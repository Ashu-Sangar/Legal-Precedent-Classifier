We cannot so interpret the section. It was intended to cover policies or contracts of insurance as commonly understood. <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>The fact that we have said that the business of surety-companies is in all essential parts that of insurance, as in Young v.

State Bank v. National Surety Co., <a href="/pa/288/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="288 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1100823" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0300-01">288 Pa. 300</a>; Mechanics Trust Co. v.

A stringent requirement of this character would have to be clearly expressed, and it is difficult to make the language of the section fit such a bond as the one before us. The unmistakable reference of the word “contract” is to insurance policies, and it may be hazarded that no one ever spoke of a fidelity bond as a policy or would be understood as referring to such a writing if he did.</p>

Words in a legislative enactment are to be taken in their ordinary and general sense: Com. v. Wark, <a href="/pa/301/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="301 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="1126469" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0150-01">301 Pa. 150</a>. The section is substantially a reenactment of the Act of May 11, 1881, P. L. 20, which is entitled “An act relating to life and fire insurance policies.” “When the statute under consideration is a general revision, the law as therein written will be deemed to be the same as it stood prior to the revision, unless we find from the statute itself, or its history, a clear intention to change it”: Miles’s Est., <a href="/pa/272/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="272 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="1068413" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0329-01">272 Pa. 329</a>, 339. Moreover, the Act of 1921 (section 412, 40 P. S., section 512) requires written applications for life insurance. The act nowhere requires a written application for a fidelity bond. We are of the opinion that section 318 of the Insurance Company Law does not apply to fidelity bonds, that, therefore, the written application was admissible in evidence, although not at<a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>taehed to the bond, and that the court erred in excluding and not considering it.</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[292,449,1157,1561]]]'>This brings us to the main question in the case: Was the plaintiff at the time the bond was applied for visited with notice of Matthews’ defalcation through his knowledge of his own dishonesty ? Matthews was, as the testimony clearly shows, the chief executive and managing officer of the bank. He was its secretary and treasurer, its highest salaried officer, giving his full time to its business and affairs. The president was not salaried, but was engaged in other business and did not give his full time to plaintiff’s affairs. The directors and president had instructed Matthews to procure the bond and had caparisoned him as the bank’s representative in doing so. He was held out as its fit instrument to answer truthfully and fairly the queries which the defendant desired information upon to guide it in deciding whether it would assume the obligation to the bank. As our late brother Mr. Justice Simpson when the case was here before (<a href="/pa/311/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="311 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1146271" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0109-01">311 Pa. 109</a>, 111) clearly stated: “On the faith of [Matthews’] statements in the application, defendant issued the indemnity bond. . . . Plaintiff, being a corporation, could not personally have any knowledge on this subject [the honesty of its officers]; consequently the language quoted [from the application] could only refer to knowledge of the executive officers, directors ©r stockholders of plaintiff, among the first of which was the secretary-treasurer, who, of course, knew that he was an embezzler, yet was seeking to have defendant guarantee his fidelity, which, presumptively at least, it would not do if the fact of that embezzlement was disclosed.”</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[292,2031,1152,371]],["BL_601.1",601,[192,337,1159,1514]]]'>Under these circumstances, there would seem to be some confusion of thought in the application of the rule that a principal is not visited with notice through an agent where the agent at the time is acting adversely to his principal and where it would be to the interest of the agent not to disclose his action or information to the principal. In procuring the bond Matthews was not act<a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>ing adversely to the bank, but in its behalf. The adverse act of embezzling the money had been consummated previously ; in that transaction — the act of embezzlement— his knowledge of his own dishonesty did not carry through him to the bank, because he was then acting adversely to its interests. In arranging for the bond, however, this was not the case. The distinction between the two situations is made clear by reference to Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/310/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="310 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1144222" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0017-01">310 Pa. 17</a>, relied upon by the court below for its conclusion that Matthews’ knowledge of his defalcations was not imputable to the trust company. That case, however, does not rule the situation which this record presents, because in that instance Matthews (the same individual as in this one) was acting fraudulently for his own benefit and adversely to the interests of the bank in the very transaction in which the loss to the Metropolitan Company occurred. The latter endeavored to establish in its favor a trust ex maleficio in the trust company of sums of money which the insurance company had paid to the trust company for certain mortgages sold by the trust company to it. In this it was unsuccessful, for it developed that the money paid by the Metropolitan Company and intended for the mortgagors had been stolen by Matthews; since in misappropriating the money Matthews was acting adversely to the interests of the trust company, it was not visited with notice of that fact, and hence not liable as a trustee ex maleficio.</p>

This is in line with the summing up of the law in the Restatement of the Law of Agency. Section 261 thus enunciates the general rule: “Agent’s position enables him to deceive. A principal who puts an agent in a position that enables the agent, while apparently acting within his authority, to commit a fraud upon third persons is subject to liability to such third persons for the fraud.” In the comment on the section this appears: “Liability is based upon the fact that the agent’s position facilitates the consummation of the fraud, in that, from the point of view of the third person, the transaction seems regular on its face and the agent appears to be acting in the ordinary course of the business confided to him.” Section 282: “Agent acting adversely to principal. (1) A principal is not affected by the knowledge of an agent in a transaction in which the agent is acting adversely to the principal and entirely for his own or another’s purposes, except as stated in subsection (2). (2) The principal is affected by the knowledge of an agent although acting adversely to the principal: (a) if the failure of the agent to act upon or to reveal the information results in a violation of a contractual or relational duty of the principal to a person harmed thereby; (b) if the agent enters into negotiations within the scope of his powers and the person with whom he deals reasonably believes him to be authorized to conduct the transaction; or (c) if, before he has changed his position, the principal knowingly retains a benefit through the act of the agent which otherwise he would not have received.” In the comments on this section, the following is stated: “Meaning of ‘acting adversely.’ The mere fact that the agent’s primary interests are not coincident with those of the principal does not prevent the latter from being affected by the knowledge of the agent if the agent is acting for the principal’s interests.” The illustration given is this: “A, P’s superintendent, knowing that B, a servant working under him, has been stealing <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>from P, and hoping to share B’s gains if P can be prevented from becoming suspicious, applies for and receives a surety bond from T, the bond running to P and guaranteeing B’s fidelity. T is not liable to P upon the bond.” In the standard textbook on agency, we find the following: “So where the act of the agent is apparently within the terms of an express authority, the principal may be bound, although the agent, unknown to the party dealing with him, is secretly engaged in abusing his authority, or has a secret motive to divert the fund either to personal or other illegitimate ends”: Mechem on Agency (2d ed.), volume 2, page 1309.

Gunster v. Scranton Illuminating Heat &amp; Power Co., <a href="/pa/181/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="181 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="891384" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0327-01">181 Pa. 327</a>, much relied upon by appellee’s counsel as sustaining his position, will be seen not to do so when the situation there presented is taken into account. On the contrary, it is directly in line with our decision in the instant case, as an examination of the facts shows. In that case the agent who perpetrated the fraud was acting in a dual capacity as agent of two principals and the controversy was over which one should suffer the consequence of his fraudulent act. In the course of the opinion and speaking generally, it is said (page 335 et seq.): “An exception to the general rule that notice to the agent is notice to the principal, arises in ease of such conduct by the agent as raises a clear presumption that he would not communicate the fact in controversy, as where the agent <em>acts for himself in his own interest </em>and adversely to that, of the principal. . . . But no agent who is acting <em>in his own antagonistic interest </em>or who is about to commit a fraud <em>by which his principal will be affected </em>does in fact inform the latter, and any conclusion drawn from a presumption that he has done so is contrary to all experience of human nature. . . . An independent fraud <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>committed by an agent <em>on his own account </em>is beyond the scope of his employment, and bears analogy to a tort wilfully committed by a servant for bis own purposes, and not as a means of performing the business entrusted to him by bis master.” The opinion goes on to state the point on which the case was decided: “Even, therefore, if the present case be made to turn on the question of knowledge it was erroneously decided. But we do not regard knowledge as the pivotal point of the case. Upon that point both parties would stand equal. Both might by mere inference be charged with knowledge, as the fraud was committed by an agent with authority to act for both, but in fact neither bad or in the nature of things could have any knowledge at all, and neither was under any obligation to presume that its agent would be guilty of fraud. The real question is, in what capacity did Jessup commit the fraud? And it is clear that it was as treasurer of the appellee. It was as treasurer be presented the notes for discount, and as treasurer be drew the checks for the proceeds. Both acts were within bis authority as treasurer and would have been lawful if they had been honest, but be drew the money on drafts which were the property of the company, and when be embezzled the money it was the money of the company. The bank bad no part in bis act, and gained nothing by it. The fraud bad its inception and its consummation in acts done in bis capacity as treasurer of the defendant company, and it should bear the loss.”</p>

Graeber acted for the bank, and his knowledge of the defect in the notes is properly imputable to his principal, the bank.” A footnote to this opinion points to a line of authorities which establishes the rule that “A corporation shall be held responsible for the knowledge which is possessed by those whom it appoints to represent it. From the nature of its constitution it can have no other knowledge than that of its officers, and, in dealing with such officers, as with the corporation itself, third parties have a right to consider it knows what they know. Indeed, when the presiding officer of a corporation is intrusted with the transaction of its business, with full power to bind the corporation in respect to such business, it seems more proper to call the knowledge which he has actual knowledge of the corporation rather than to say it is imputed.” In the above-mentioned case, Citizens Nat. Bank of Greencastle v. Speck, <a href="/pa-super/108/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="108 Pa. Super. 247" data-case-ids="706342" data-case-paths="/pa-super/108/0247-01">108 Pa.

The language there used has much pertinence to the controversy in hand (page 252) : “It is admitted that a fraud was perpetrated on the defendant and the bank by the bank’s cashier, yet the plaintiff [the bank] claims the right to avail itself of the fruits of the fraudulent transaction and disavow responsibility for the actions of the one who represented it in the very same matter. . . . The entire management of the bank was intrusted to the cashier, and in this matter he was the sole representative of the bank; in fact, <em>was </em>the bank. . . . The board of directors had turned over to the cashier the entire management of the bank; he stood in the place of the directors by reason of a course of practice of which they approved. We are not required to resort to the legal fiction of a constructive notice, but have as specific and actual a notice as if it had been placed in writing and read to the board of directors in meetings regularly assembled. The corporation became possessed of this note <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>through the act of no other person than the cashier Sheely. The bank was not represented in any stage of the transaction by any one other than its cashier. It must be taken to have known what he knew, and it cannot regain the benefits of his act without accepting the consequences of his knowledge. All the rights that the plaintiff obtained it obtained through Sheely, and it is answerable for his acts.” Mundorff v.

Perhaps a fair interpretation of that section, if it stood alone, would be that the ‘statement made [by the secretary-treasurer] . . . shall be deemed a warranty ... of the fact that the statement is true to the best of [his] knowledge and belief.’ If so, this warranty was broken as soon as it was made.”</p>
