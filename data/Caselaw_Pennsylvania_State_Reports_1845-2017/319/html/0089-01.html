    <p id="b131-3" data-blocks='[["BL_131.6",131,[201,409,1154,1575]]]'>Of the three appeals raising the single question presented by this record, we need consider only that of the depositor, Loux. When the receiver took charge of the Franklin Trust Company, October 5, 1931, F. W. Woolworth Company, a corporation, had in its checking account a credit of $51,158.52 and was owner of a certificate of deposit in the sum of $1,000. Woolworth was also a tenant, occupying the thirteenth floor in the bank building with an unexpired term at an annual rent of $20,000, payble in advance in monthly installments, none of which was in arrear. In the lease, “Franklin Trust Company of Philadelphia, Agent,” was named as lessor. Woolworth’s possession has continued. By agreement, for the purpose of taking care of the situation until the rights and obligations of the parties could be determined, Woolworth has continued to pay rent into a special fund. As this agreement was not brought up with the record, we say nothing about its general effect on the insolvency proceeding. Woolworth has also received dividends on its deposits. At the audit of the receiver’s first account, Woolworth asserted the right to set-off its obligation to pay rent against the debt due by the insolvent bank at the time it closed. The learned court below allowed the set-off. Appellant contends that this was wrong; that, as the lessor named in the lease was “Franklin Trust Company of Philadelphia, Agent,” it was the duty of the lessee to ascertain the unnamed principal and that, whether or not it did so, it cannot hold the Franklin Trust Company as principal by setting off the deposit against rent.</p>

The capital stock is owned by the trust company. All Woolwortil’s dealings were with the trust company. It received bills for rent reading “To Franklin Trust Company, Dr.” The value of the building corporation, owned by the trust company, is reflected <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>in the assets in the receiver’s hands for distribution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In those assets the depositor, Woolworth, was entitled to participate to the extent of the debt due by the trust company when it closed.</p>
