We have disposed of the claims of the German claimants in our opinion at Nos. 207-12, March Term, 1934, filed herewith, and these appeals have been taken by the Butler County line of claimants. The court below dismissed these claims.\nTheir entire case rests upon testimony of several occasions when John Link and his son, the decedent, said that appellants\u2019 ancestor, Frederick Link, a resident of Butler County, was a \u201ccousin\u201d of the elder Link. They also showed that both John H. Link and Frederick Link had impediments in their speech, and that visits were exchanged between them occasionally. We affirm the decree of the court below on the opinion of Judge Trimble relating to these claimants.\nDecree affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost.\nThe preceding case.",
