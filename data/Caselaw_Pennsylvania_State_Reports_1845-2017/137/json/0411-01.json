At the trial before Simonton, P. J., without a jury, judgment was entered in favor of the commonwealth for $19,674.67. Thereupon the defendant took a writ of error to the Supreme Court, and upon argument in said court the judgment of the court below was reversed, October 1, 1888, opinion by Mr. Justice Paxson ; reported as Penna. Co. etc. v. Commonwealth, 22 W. N. 340. On January 7, 1889, on the suggestion of the Court, an order for a re-argument was made. Afterwards a proposition of adjustment was accepted, and the cause settled on payment to the commonwealth of $11,255.37: See Attorney General\u2019s Report, 1889-90, p. 20.",
