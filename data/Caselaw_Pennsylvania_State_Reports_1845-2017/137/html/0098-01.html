If they neglect their duty, in this respect; if they allow the sidewalks to be out of repair and to remain so, and a person traveling along the sidewalk is injured in consequence of a defect, without any contributing negligence on the part of the person walking along the sidewalk, the borough is liable to pay damages for injuries which are inflicted in consequence of their negligence. It is claimed here, that on the east side of Shamokin street, on a line between the lands of Mrs. Robinson and Mr. Weir, there was an offset in the walk; that the walk in front of Mrs. Robinson’s property was considerably higher than the walk in front of Mr. <em>Wier’s; </em>that the break was, one of the witnesses puts it, as high as from twelve to fifteen inches, and the borough surveyor puts it at nine inches and a fraction or ten inches and a fraction, I forget which.

The question was fairly submitted to the jury whether the break in the sidewalk, variously estimated by the witnesses at from nine to fifteen inches, constituted a dangerous sidewalk, and whether it Avas negligence on the part of the borough authorities to permit it to remain in this condition.
