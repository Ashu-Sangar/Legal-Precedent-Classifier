It does not aver that the plaintiffs had any fund in their hands upon which Cooper, Reynolds &amp; Co. had a right to draw, or which they could assign; neither does it aver that any such funds came into the plaintiffs’ hands after November 26th. We are left to infer, what is not denied to be the fact, that the fund referred to was simply the balance due by the defendant upon the account now in suit, and that the transaction was a circuitous attempt to give the defendant a receipt in full. Drawing this inference, however, and assuming that Cooper, Reynolds &amp; Co. had some control over this balance, their own draft shows that another claim than the defendant’s was to be first paid; “ after paying hands in accordance with our agreement.” But, what this agreement was which is thus made part of the transaction; how far it was carried out; how much was paid to the hands, and how much, if any, was then left of the so-called fund, we <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>are not informed, although these matters are evidently necessary to the defence. In brief, if the fund drawn upon or assigned belonged to the plaintiffs, Cooper, Reynolds &amp; Co. could not apply it to their own debt; and, if it belonged to the latter to any extent, as we assume it did, they themselves directed it to be first applied to pay the hands, and there is no averment that it was not needed and used for that purpose. It seems-plain to us, that the affidavits fail to state the whole transaction, and fail to aver that there was any fund upon which the-draft or assignment could take effect.</p>

All the allegations in the affidavit of defence, and the inferences deducible therefrom, are to be taken as absolute verity. The iron being the property of Cooper, Reynolds &amp; Co., they had the right to direct their agents to apply the money as they desired, and the fact that they gave the order indicates-clearly that they intended the defendant company to retain the amount it owed. The order was an assignment of so much money as is specified therein, and was complete. The assignors retained no control of the fund. The order was drawn on a particular fund, and contained no power of revocation. Such an order is a valid assignment in equity: Christmas v. Russell, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wall.%2084" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Wall. 84">14 Wall. 84</a>; Trist v.

Besides this, the conceded facts show clearly that the defendant was entitled to a set-off for the amount in dispute. The fact that the iron was sold by the agents of the owners, can. make no difference on tins point, and cannot deprive the de<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>fendant of the statutory right of set-off. Cooper, Reynolds &amp; Co. were the owners of the iron, and they were indebted to the defendant in the amount of its price. Even if the order was invalid, the defendant can set off that indebtedness against the price of the iron. Confessedly, the defendant had an honest and bona fide claim against them, equal to the whole amount sued for and due at the time the action was brought, and Cooper, Reynolds &amp; Co., were insolvent. It would be a great wrong to the defendant, and a palpable violation of both the letter and the spirit of our defalcation laws, so to administer the affidavit of defence law as to allow a recovery in this action.</p>

From that we learn that there was a previous agreement between these parties, by the terms of which Heckscher &amp; Co. were to pay the hands of Cooper, Reynolds &amp; Co., out of the proceeds of sales of iron made by them. We learn also that the fund drawn upon or assigned is not the proceeds of the iron generally, but the balance of such funds remaining in the hands of Heckscher &amp; Co. after the payment of the hands in accordance with the agreement. If there was no such balance, there was no fund on which the assignment could be operative, and the plaintiffs had a right to disregard it. If there was such a fund in the hands of Heckscher &amp; Co., that fact should have been set out in the affidavit of defence. With such an averment, the affidavit would have been sufficient, but, without it, it is wanting at the vital point. It shows a title to the fund if the fund exists. If Heckscher &amp; Co. have, after the payment of the hands in accordance with the previous agreement, a balance subject to the order or assignment of Cooper, Reynolds &amp; Co., that balance passed to the defendant, and the law will apply it in payment of the plaintiffs’ demand. But the existence of such balance cannot be assumed. It must be averred in the affidavit of defence. The affidavit alleged the assignment of a particular fund, if in the hands of the plaintiffs, but did not allege that such fund existed, or that it was in the hands of the plaintiffs when this suit was brought.
