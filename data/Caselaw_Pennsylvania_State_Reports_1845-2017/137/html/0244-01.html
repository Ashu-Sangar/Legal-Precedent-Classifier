The turnout was used chiefly for open coal cars or “ gondolas; ” but sometimes, to lengthen the train so as to put the coal cars to their destination without running the engine and tender upon the track, ordinary box cars, which were wider than the coal cars, were put into the train to lengthen it. Some of the box cars had ladder-like ascents upon the ends; others, at the sides, reaching to The top of the car. The defendant had erected a telephone pole near to the track, a crooked one with the bend toward the cars when upon the track. The plaintiff’s witnesses testified that at the time of the injury complained of the pole was about twelve inches or less from the side of a box car; witnesses for the defendant testified that it was from twenty to twenty-two inches. There was evidence that the pole was in view for quite a distance from it on the track, when on January 11, 1887, the plaintiff, a brakeman in regular employment by the railroad company, while ascending a box ear by a side ladder, in the discharge of his duty, as he testified, was struck by the telephone pole as the car was passing it and knocked off with a broken arm and other injuries. There was testimony on the part of the defendant that the plaintiff was seen to fall from the top of the 'car, and therefore could not have been struck by the pole.</p>

That an employee of a railroad company, who, having had <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the risks of his situation, accepts them, cannot complain if subsequently injured. by such exposure. By contracting for the performance of hazardous duties, he assumes such risks as are incident to their discharge from causes open and obvious, and the dangerous character of which he has had an opportunity to ascertain.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AO1" data-blocks='[["BL_282.4",282,[253,685,1175,1272]]]'>Answer: We affirm this point, suggesting, with reference to the use of the words “ opportunity to ascertain,” as used in this and other points, that the word may be received in a sense in which it is not correct. That is, a person may be so situated that, by the use of means which he is not called upon to use, he might be able to discover a danger which is incident to his employment, and which is not open and obvious, and which in the ordinary course of his business he could not be expected to discover. For instance, a man might be so situated, having-time and leisure upon his hands, that by looking around and making an inspection it might be possible for him to discover something which would cause danger to him in his employment, and which he would not discover except by going entirely outside of his duties and making a special examination. This might, in one sense, be said to be an opportunity to ascertain the danger. But we understand this expression, “ which he had an opportunity to ascertain,” to mean that the danger must be so obvious and so open to observation by the use of his senses that with the exercise of ordinary care, in the use of his senses, he should have been able to discover and know the danger. If, in such a case, he fails to discover the danger, and neglects to use the senses which the Almighty has given him, and shuts his eyes to dangers which are apparent, he cannot complain afterward and allege that he had no knowledge of these dangers.1</p>

If both plaintiff and defendant were negligent; that is, if the defendant did not use ordinary care and caution in placing the telephone pole near the incline, and the plaintiff did not use ordinary care and caution in avoiding it, then the plaintiff cannot recover, even if the jury should think him less blameworthy than the defendant; for, he is precluded from so doing if he contributed in any degree whatever to the injury.</p>

And we say to you with reference to this matter of contributory negligence, that where the plaintiff seeks to recover against the defendant upon a charge of negligence, he must himself appear from the evidence to be entirely free from all negligence which contributed in any degree, even <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>the slightest degree, to produce the injury. Because we can-, not measure the comparative degrees of negligence in such cases. If the negligence of the plaintiff contributed in the least degree to produce the injury, no court or jury can say that if he had not been negligent in that slight degree, the injury would have occurred. Therefore, if you find in this case, that the accident was caused in any degree, however slight, by the want of the exercise of ordinary care and prudence on the part of the plaintiff, that precludes him from recovering in this action.</p>

In answering the first and fourth the learned judge explained to the jury, as applicable to the case, the meaning of the words “ opportunity to ascertain,” and the accuracjr of his explanation is not questioned. He might well have affirmed these points without explanation, but he cannot be convicted of error for correctly interpreting <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>an expression used in them. The first and fourth specifications are based on the answers to them, but there is no attempt to show that these are incorrect or- misleading. It may be conceded that an affirmance of the points without comment would have been appropriate and sufficient, yet it cannot be disputed that the answers were the equivalent of it. A consciousness of this pervades the argument of the appellant, which is directed exclusively to the claim he now makes, that the case should have been taken from the jury, on the ground that the injury was caused by a risk which was apparent and assumed by the appellee as incident to his employment, and that his own negligence contributed to it. But no point was presented by the appellant which requested a binding instruction in his favor. It is evident that he did not think he was entitled to such an instruction, until a verdict had been rendered against him. In the absence of a request for a direction to find for the defendant, the principal question discussed in his paper-book is not upon the record. The case was given to the jury with the instructions he solicited, and he has no standing here to complain of the result. But as we have examined and considered the case with reference to the claim now made by the appellant, it is proper to say that he was not prejudiced by the omission to request a binding instruction. The case was for the jury, and was correctly tried and decided.</p>
