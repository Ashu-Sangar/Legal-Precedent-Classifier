Some time in April, the plaintiff and Samson, one of the defendants, met and went upon the land in company with Abel Hammond to inspect it. No one else was present. As Samson testified, the plaintiff then pointed out the boundaries of the land as being at a brush fence on the north; at or near the ridge of a hill on the east; at or near the “ stub ” of a tree on the south; and at the edge of a cleared field, belonging to Thomas Lynch, on the west. The plaintiff, testifying on his own behalf, denied that he pointed out any boundaries, and stated that, on the contrary, he told Samson on that occasion, that he did not know where they were, and that he had on two previous occasions made attempts to find them with the help of Thomas Lynch, but’ had failed each time. The plaintiff testified, further, that Hammond pointed out to Samson what were said to be some of the corners and lines of the property. Hammond was dead at the time of the trial.</p>

On May 17th, they met again-at the plaintiff’s house, to complete the transaction. Samson testified that the plaintiff then produced his deed for his timber tract, saying “ This here is a description in this deed of my timber on King’s run; ” and on being asked by the witness whether that deed described the same timber he had shown to the witness on King’s run, the <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>plaintiff replied, “ It does ; I wouldn’t deceive you ; ” and that the witness then said, “Very well; that is all I want.” The plaintiff and his son testified that when the deed was handed to Samson, the plaintiff said to him, “ Here is the deed of the lot, and you know as much about the line as I do.” The deed had appended to it a plan of the land therein described.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b406-6" data-blocks='[["BL_406.4",406,[254,672,1166,656]]]'>Samson then drew up a written contract for the sale of the timber from the plaintiff to the defendants, embodying therein the description by metes and bounds contained in the deed. The subject of the sale, as stated in the contract, was all the timber suitable for sawing, or needed for removing or manufacturing said sawing timber, upon a lot of land described as in the deed, with the stipulation that the vendees should have two years from the date of the articles for removing it, and the light to erect mills, etc. The consideration stated was $475 in hand and $475 payable on January 2, 1888.

At the close of the peeling season, and when nearly two thirds of the timber included within the lines which, as the defendants alleged, were pointed out to them by the plaintiff, had been taken off, the men who were working on the tract were notified that they were about to get over the southern line of the tract and must stop. The defendant French testified that about six weeks before the maturity of the note he told the plaintiff that the defendants had been notified that the lines of the tract were not where the parties had understood them to be, and that the plaintiff replied that he thought they were. The testimonj1- of several witnesses tended to prove that, about the time when the note matured, the plaintiff admitted that he had pointed out to Samson the “ stub ” as marking the southern boundary line, and that he assured the defendants that they had not yet cut and peeled more than half of the timber on his lot. A survey was made, however, for the purpose of ascertaining definitely where the line was, and it disclosed the fact that the “ stub ” was nearly fifty rods south of <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>the southern boundary of the land owned by the plaintiff, and that about one third of the timber which the defendants thought they were buying was on the land that did not belong to the plaintiff. Samson testified that the defendants had sold the timber and bark before they found out that the line did riot run where the plaintiff had represented it to be. Before the bringing of the suit, the defendants tendered the plaintiff .$200, and this tender was renewed on the trial.</p>

The seller, because it is discovered afterwards- that the land included more within its boundaries than they supposed, cannot collect more than the price; and the purchaser, where it is found to contain less, cannot ordinarily deduct from the purchase price, when the contract has been closed by the conveyance and the giving of an obligation of this kirid.

    <p id="b411-8" data-blocks='[["BL_411.7",411,[250,1721,1168,390]]]'>The note in suit was given for one half the price of timber which the payee sold to the makers. The vendees allege that their vendor had no title to one third of the timber which he sold to them, and that they have paid or tendered the price of the timber they received or acquired any title to under their agreement with him. The vendor alleges that he was the owner of, and that they have received, all the timber embraced in the sale.</p>
    <p id="b411-9" data-blocks='[["BL_411.8",411,[248,2127,1173,303]],["BL_412.1",412,[253,382,1210,956]]]'>It is undisputed that the vendor owned a tract of land in Ceres township, containing fifty acres; that he proposed to sell to the vendees all the timber thereon suitable for sawing; that, in company with one of them and for the purpose of making a sale, he visited the tract to view the timber; that while upon the tract or returning from it, he sold the timber to them <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>for $950, and that soon thereafter they paid one half this sum in cash, and gave their note for the balance. It appears from the evidence produced by the vendees that the vendor pointed , out the timber he proposed to sell to them, and said that it was on his lot; that he did not go to any marked lines or corners, but that he designated their location, and these as represented by him enclosed the timber he had pointed out; that when the contract was reduced to writing the description of the lot was copied from his deed, and he was asked if that included the timber he h„ad shown, and he replied that it did. It further appears from their evidence that when they had cut and peeled nearly two thirds of the timber which they supposed they purchased, they were Notified that the balance of it was not on their vendor’s lot; that they informed him of this, and he assured, them that the lines were where he had represented them to be, and that they hadmot yet; cut and peeled more than half th'e timber on his lqfcr® A subsequent survey,, however, ■ demonstrated thididlie^Kitice they had received was substantially correct.</p>
    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[253,1357,1166,1128]]]'>In answer to this evidence, the vendor says that he did not point out the lines and corners of his lot, and that he did not know where they were; that the written contract must govern, and, as the vendees have received all the timber described in that, their defence fails. It does not appear that the vendees ever saw this lot or any map or description of it, before the day of the sale, but the vendor received his deed for it sixteen months before, and he says that he was upon the lot twice with Thomas Lynch to search for the lines, and that they could not find them. The learned judge instructed the jury that the case turned on the good faith of the vendor in making the sale, that his honest mistake in pointing out the lines, or a mutual mistake of the parties respecting their location, would not constitute a defence to the note. In this we think he erred/ The vendor sold the timber he pointed out, and one third of it he had no title to. The mistake was material and the sale was founded upon it. If it was an honest mistake, the vendor cannot gain nor his vendees lose by it. It was said by Chief Justice Gibson in Tyson v. Passmore, <a href="/pa/2/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="2 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="951204" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0122-01">2 Pa. 122</a>, that “ he who would avail himself of his own misrepresentation, even where it was unintentional, is as much open to an imputation of fraud as if its falsity had been known to him.” ^</p>

But if this is not possible by reason of something done under the contract before the mistake was discovered, the injured party may have compensation in damages, as an equitable defence to an action on the contract, or to be recovered in a suit for them.</p>
    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[237,847,1172,968]]]'>There is no evidence to justify an inference that the parties to this sale had equal opportunities of knowing the boundaries of the lot. The vendor owned it more than a year before he sold the timber, and his deed contained a description from which its lines could have been readily located by a surveyor. The vendees first saw this description when they met to put the contract in writing, and he then assured them that it included the timber he had pointedtiut. We think the evidence is sufficient to authorize a finding in accordance with the claim of the vendees. It is true that the only persons on the lot, on the day of the sale, who testify to what was said and done there then, are the vendor and J. A. Samson, one of the vendees. Hammond who was with them is dead. It is impossible to reconcile the testimony of these witnesses. But the declarations of the vendor, as testified to by a number of persons, contradict him and corroborate the statement of Samson. Then, there are the inherent probabilities of the transaction, viewed in the light of the undisputed facts, to assist in the interpretation of the direct testimony.</p>
    <p id="b413-5" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[239,1824,1170,350]]]'>If Hammond, acting for the vendor and in his presence, made false representations respecting the boundaries, whether honestly or with fraudulent intent, the latter is as much affected by them as if made by himself. But, in either case, the representations are not available as a ground of defence or claim, unless they relate to a material fact and were an inducement to the purchase.</p>
    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.6",413,[240,2183,1169,94]]]'>To the extent that the instructions complained of are in conflict with this opinion the specifications are sustained.</p>
