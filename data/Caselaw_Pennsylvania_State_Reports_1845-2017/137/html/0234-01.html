    <p class="summary" id="b274-6" data-blocks='[["BL_274.4",274,[257,680,1165,1353]]]'>The effect of the verdict in the first case was to determine that the dam of the defendant must be reduced in height. The submission in the present case expressly reserved to the plaintiff the benefit of this verdict, by providing that the arbitrators must first find whether the defendant has reduced his dam since the verdict, and if so whether it has been sufficiently reduced, and if not, then to fix and determine the plaintiff’s damages. On the hearing of the exceptions to the award, it was agreed that the only proof before the arbitrators of any reduction in the height of the breast of defendant’s dam after the verdict was that defendant had chipped off from one eighth to one fourth of an inch from the top of one stone in the dam-breast, which stone was about nine inches in width, and was one of the stones in the top layer of stones on the dam-breast. On the same hearing, the defendant was called and testified that this stone was about the centre of the dish in about the lowest point of the dam-breast, that the chipping done would not run the width of nine inches, that the stone was abrupt on the edges or was not square across, and that he made it level on top. One of the arbitrators testified that there was a reduction to the extent of the chipping referred to, and that their attention was called to the stone; some one said, “ there is the stone.” He says he made a calculation as a matter of curiosity, and found that it would reduce the dam about one six-thousandth part of an inch. On this testimony,, the arbitrators found that the dam-breast had been sufficiently reduced, and that the defendant was entitled to their award.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b274-7" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[259,2052,1163,349]],["BL_275.1",275,[252,373,1162,758]]]'>In this we think there was such manifest error as calls upon the court to set aside the award. It is palpable that the so-called reduction was merely a feint upon the part of the defendant, to evade the effect of the verdict and to enable him to have the case tried again upon its original merits and as though no trial had been had. This, of course, he could not have done. Such infinitesimal change is no reduction whatever within the <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>intent of the parties and the judgment of the court. No such fanciful matter' was the subject of controversy. The reduction which the law contemplates iu such case is a practical reduction, not a reduction which is senseless and unmeaning. It would seem that the defendant produced testimony before the arbitrators which he had not in court on the former trial, to satisfy them that he ought not to be required to reduce the height of the dam. The arbitrator, examined on the hearing of the rule, in answer to the question whether his judgment was that the dam ought not to have been required to be reduced in height, said “ I am not making any comment, but if I were to answer that question I might say that we heard testimony that was not before the other jury; ” and, in speaking of the dam being lowered one six-thousandth part of an inch, he added, “ but that would have been ample if only one twelve-thousandth was required.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[252,1139,1162,861]]]'>Whether the verdict was right or wrong does not now matter. It determined that the dam-breast was too high and must be reduced ; and we must take that as settled, and the right of the plaintiff to require such reduction was recognized in the order to the arbitrators. To what extent it should be reduced, the verdict of course does not determine, but that it should be more than the pretence of reduction which was made in this case is clear. The arbitrator examined said : “ After hearing the evidence, we went there a second time with our minds made up that a very slight reduction was all that was necessary,” and that they then established a lower line for the height of the dam than existed at the time of the verdict. If the dam needed this reduction, although even a slight one, the plaintiff was entitled to the award. With reference to the action of the arbitrators in fixing the height of the tumble or overflow, we need only say that the award must be taken as a whole, and stand or fall together.</p>

The court set the award aside because Sterrett bad not “substantially” reduced the height of his dam. But the question submitted to the arbitrators was not whether there had been a substantial, but whether there had been a sufficient reduction. Sterrett would never have consented to an agreement of reference implying that there must be a considerable reduction. At the time the agreement was signed, he was contesting the case on the ground that the reduction made was sufficient. And the court erred in assuming that the judgment in the first action necessarily required •a substantial reduction. Whether the reduction made was sufficient, was a question of fact for the arbitrators, and not, under any circumstances, a question for the court.</p>

Such backing ■of water was the essential matter and wrongful act complained ■of. The averment that it was by reason of Sterrett’s dam being too high, was not essential to the action: Chitty on Pleading, § 391; Keller v. Stoltz, <a href="/pa/71/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="71 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1031224" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0356-01">71 Pa. 356</a>; Wells on Res Judicata, § 228. The declaration, by its terms and of necessity, was a complaint that every particle of water flooded back beyond the plaintiff’s line, was flooded wrongfully, and issue was joined on this complaint. Upon the issue so joined, the verdict and judgment rendered are conclusive: Wells on Res Judicata, § 200; Freeman on Judgments, § 257, 272; 1 Chitty ■on Pleading, 158.

Such being the effect of the former verdict and judgment, <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>the award was manifestly erroneous in finding that the dam-breast had been sufficiently reduced, in the face of the fact that the plaintiff’s land was still overflowed to the same extent as before, and no change had been made in the dam-breast, except a slight chipping of one stone that did not reduce the level of the water more than one six-thousandth part of an inch. The opinion of the court below abundantly justified the setting aside of the award. The agreement of reference contemplated a reduction of the dam in accordance with the prior verdict, to an extent sufficient to give James the right determined in his favor thereby. No re-trial was contemplated or permissible. The plain- duty of the arbitrators was to ascertain what the former trial settled, and determine whether Sterretthad conformed to it. This duty they disregarded, and justice required that their award be set aside. As the court below said, this so-called reduction was a mere feint to evade the effect of the verdict and obtain a re-trial.</p>

The right of the defendant to maintain a dam at the point in question was not disputed, and the contest related exclusively to its height. It was not essential to the plaintiff’s recovery that he should prove that all the water backed upon his land by the defendant’s dam was unlawfully there, nor a valid defence to the action to show that the defendant had acquired, by grant or user, the right to maintain a dam which would back a considerable portion of it there. The wrong complained of was the maintenance of the dam “ higher than it ought to be,” that is, above its lawful height, and the flowing thereby of the plaintiff’s land; but this height was not defined by the pleadings, or by the verdict. Under the pleadings the plaintiff could not recover for any flooding of his land by the dam, as the defendant had the right to maintain it, but for any flowage caused by an unlawful raising of the dam, he was entitled to the verdict he secured. Any raising of the dam above its lawful height which increased the flow of water on the plaintiff’s land was sufficient to authorize the former judgment, and that, uuon its face, is conclusive only of such matters <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>as were essential to its recovery, and were necessarily included' in it: Packet Co. v.

In an action for the continuance of the nuisance, that record was sufficient and .unanswerable proof of these facts. But a reduction of the dam to its lawful height, before the second suit was brought, would prevent a recovery in it. As a slight raising of the dam above its lawful height would sustain the first action, a corresponding reduction of it would defeat the second.</p>

The tribunal thus constituted was necessarily charged with the duty of ascertaining the proper height of the dam, and it was required by the agreement which created it to designate the same by appropriate and permanent marks. In this way the parties to a profitless contention wisely resolved to end it. The arbitrators viewed the premises, and the parties appeared before them with their proofs, and were fully heard. An award was made strictly responsive to the submission, finding that the defendant had sufficiently reduced the dam, and marking its lawful height. The award upon exceptions filed to it was set aside upon the sole ground that, in the opinion of. the learned judge of the court below, there had not been a substantial reduction of the dam. Whilst he conceded that it was not determined by the verdict in the first suit to what extent the dam should be reduced, or what its lawful height was, he assumed that it was his province to reject the judgment of the arbitrators upon this question, if it did not accord with his own. There was no plain mistake of fact or law on the fa-ce of the award, or shown by extrinsic evidence. There was no suggestion that the arbitrators misbehaved themselves in the case, or that the award was procured by corruption or other <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>undue means. The matters for which the court may set aside .an award are enumerated in the statute. Its power is dependent on their existence, and if none of them is found the award must stand. The interest of the parties in it cannot be arbitrarily destroyed. We think the action of the court below in setting aside the award in this case was unauthorized by the statute, and therefore in excess of its power. The sufficiency of an undisputed reduction of the dam was not a question of law, but of fact. If it brought the dam to its lawful height, it was sufficient. A reduction, however slight, which accomplished this, was all that was required by the former verdict. The fundamental error in the case lies in the assumption by the court of a power which belonged exclusively to the arbitrators or the jury.</p>
