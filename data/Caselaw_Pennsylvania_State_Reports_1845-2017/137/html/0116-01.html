M. Dull, one of the executors and purchasers, was sold at sheriff’s sale on a judgment in favor of Nannie J. Dull; and that the widow of the testator was dead.

Dull, under an assignment thereof made by him to her the date of which did not appear; also, that it was claimed that out of D. M. Dull’s share of the fund for distribution there should be deducted before payment the one half of the note for $1,163.79, dated April 1, 1881, made to A. J. and C. P. Dull; that this Was resisted on behalf of Nannie J.

M. Dull in the real estate, on January 12,1884, certain notices had been given by the executors, by reason whereof the said interest did not bring near its actual value for her execution.</p>

Dull claim to take one half the amount thereof from the share coming to D. M. Dull, showing that he is insolvent, and claiming that otherwise it could not be collected from him. Nannie J. Dull, bis wife and assignee of his share in the fund for distribution, resists this. It is not claimed by her or her husband that the note was not properly given by <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>Mm, or that it was ever paid. Her objection to the payment of the same is grounded upon the allegation that, at the sheriff’s sale of the real estate of her husband, D. M. Dull, sold on a writ issued by her, notice was given by some one or all of the executors of Casper Dull that said real estate would be sold subject to the interest of Joseph F. Dull in the same, and that therefore the purchasers of said real estate would have to pay this note, that it cannot be taken from the share of her husband in this proceeding; and, further, that she was the bona fide assignee of her husband’s share, and that it could not be paid to her detriment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[244,947,1165,709]]]'>Evidence was taken before the auditor to sustain her position, and the auditor finds therefrom, as a fact, “ that Joseph F. Dull had one eighth interest in the lands of the estate of Casper Dull, deceased.” We have looked in vain to discover any parol or written testimony in this record to justify this finding; on the contrary, the will of Casper Dull shows that at the time of the sheriff’s sale Joseph F. Dull had no interest in the real estate. To this may be added the admission on the record, “that these lands were held by James J. Dull, D. M. Dull, A. J. Dull and C. P. Dull, as tenants in common,” and the levy of the fieri facias, on which Nannie J. Dull sold the lands, described her husband’s interest as the undivided one fourth part, which would necessarily exclude Joseph F. Dull from having any interest in it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[243,1664,1168,655]]]'>This conclusion will nullify the finding of fact No. 2, and affect more or less the findings of fact Nos. 3, 4 and 5. The testimony shows there was a notice given at the sale. Whether it was that the property was selling subject to the interest of Joseph F. Dull therein, or subject to the dower mortgage of Jane Dull, widow, in which Joseph F. Dull had an interest, is uncertain, the evidence being unsatisfactory and somewhat contradictory. But, whichever may be the truth, it wdll not justify the non-payment of the note in question. The evidence of the sheriff and others is uncontradicted that, after the notice was given, he paid no attention whatever to it, but went on and sold as usual: Barnet v. Washebaugh, 16 S. &amp; R. 410; Woods’ App., 9 Cent. R. 377.</p>

The note never was entered, so far as we can ascertain; never was a lien on the real estate sold. Giving notice by third parties that a sheriff’s sale would be subject to a loose note, that was not a lien, is, we think, novel. To be effective it should be precise and clear, qualities not to be found in the evidence. We are not clear, if the note had been a lien on the lands sold, and notice had been given so as not to discharge its lien, but that the holders could take it out of this or any other fund of the debtor until paid.</p>

Dull sold for a sum far below its value.” "We think this finding conjectural. We discover no evidence to support it.] 5 The only evidence that bears on the subject is the deeds, which show what the property brought when sold by the executors as a whole, and the return of the sheriff, which shows that D. M. Dull’s one fourth brought at the sale in question, deducting the mortgage which it is conceded by all parties that it was sold subject to, the one fourth interest brought more at the sheriff’s sale proportionately than the whole did at the executors’ sale. [We are of opinion, therefore, that the one half of this note should be deducted from the share of D. M. Dull and given to the holders of said note, and that the assignment by D. M. Dull of his share to his wife will not prevent it from being liable for its proper debt to the estate.] 8</p>

Dull had no control over it: [Ante, p. 113.] We still adhere to that opinion, and direct that the share awarded to Joseph F. Dull be paid to his trustees.

    <p class="summary" id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[258,649,1172,905]]]'>The contention about this arises as follows: This mortgage was given by the Messrs. Dull, the purchasers of the land at the executors’ sale, of whom D. M. Dull was one, conditioned to pay the interest thereof to Jane Dull, widow,' during her natural life, and at her death'the principal equally to the eight children. Jane Dull, the widow, being dead, the exceptants contend that the one eighth part, or the share of D. M. Dull, one of the mortgagors, is merged in the fee, and that when the interest in the mortgaged premises was sold by the sheriff, on the writ of his wife, the purchaser took it discharged from that share of the mortgage coming to him, especially against her and him. This is the general rule of law in such eases, unless there is some equity which requires the rule to be suspended to prevent injustice being done. We see nothing like that in this case.
