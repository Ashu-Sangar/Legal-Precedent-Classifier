Phillips also built an arch in the rear end of the party wall, through which he intended to introduce to his premises the drain-pipe, when constructed as agreed upon. The plaintiffs had knowledge of what the defendant Phillips had done, and that the plan of his building contemplated the erection of his water-closets in the rear end of his building in the southwest corner thereof. Yet, regardless of his rights under the agreement, they constructed for their own use a small drain-pipe connecting with their water-closets in the northwest corner of their building, about forty feet north of the said arched way, and running thence eastward along the north side of No. 72 North Fourth street into the said public sewer in Fourth street; and, for the accommodation of Cyrus Phillips, in fulfilment of their agreement with him, as they alleged, they ran a branch pipe southward to a point about twelve feet north of the said archéd way or opening in the wall, and informed him that he might connect with it. This he declined to do, and justly so. It was not such a drain as they had agreed to give him. It was not a twelve-inch drain or large enough for his purposes, nor was it put where or constructed so that he could use it.....</p>

This led to a demand for the value of the party wall, which was finally paid. Notice was then given by plaintiffs to Phillips to close the windows, which he declined to do. Phillips admits in his answer that the notice was given and that he did decline to comply with it.</p>

The interest on the value of the wall used was the only consideration, as such, which the plaintiffs were to receive from Cyrus Phillips for the privilege given him to have the said windows in the wall, and by thus demanding and receiving it, he ended and terminated the agreement between them in respect to the windows, and destroyed and annulled his right, <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>which was at best a mere revocable license to have and maintain the said windows in said party wall.</p>

In point of fact it appears from the evidence that the plaintiffs have built such a drain; but the defendant contends that it is not of the character or capacity of the drain they promised to put down.

There is nothing to show that the one was dependent upon the other. That seems to have been the opinion of the master, for he says in his report: “ The plaintiffs’ title or legal right to have the windows closed and the nuisance abated, is clear and free from doubt. Both parties are practically agreed as to the nature and extent of the agreement with respect to the windows. In that sense, the agreements are separate and distinct. The rights of the plaintiffs under that part of the agreement are not in any way subordinate to or dependent upon their performance of the other agreement, which has reference to a separate and distinct subject.” And in another place he speaks of the agreements as two, “ the two agreements, if we may so designate them, were made at or about the same time.” Certain it is that Mr. Cheyney was employed by the defendant to draw up an agreement upon both subjects, but the plaintiffs refused to sign it, and it never was signed. Mr. Cheyney admits that the plaintiffs objected to it when it was shown to them. He says that he drew the paper “ from his recollection of what took place.” Mr; Cheyney’s testimony is very vague, uncertain and unsatisfactory. He gives no con<a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>versation with Mr. Datz, but only his own conclusions, or the inferences which he drew from them. There had been a great deal of conversation between the parties relative to both subjects. Cheyney also had conversations with both parties. Being employed by the defendant to draw up an agreement, he did so. It did not suit the plaintiffs, and they refused to sign it, and that is the whole of it.</p>

The subjects of the agreements were totally different. The considerations were different. They were never blended, and one agreement was not a consideration for the other. The breach of the agreement which the defendant sets up in the answer cannot be set off in this ease, because the remedies upon the two agreements are totally different. The plaintiffs seek a specific performance, and that only. It is no answer to that to say that the plaintiffs have broken another agreement relating to another subject. The proper remedy of the defendant for a breach of the agreement to lay the drain-pipe, is an action at law to recover damages. The defendant has imported into the case something that has nothing to do with it, but which may be proper ground for an action at law.</p>

Indeed it is not properly a cross-bill, but an original bill under the guise of a cross-bill. A cross-bill is a mode of defence. The original bill and the cross-bill are one cause. The office of a cross-bill is to enable a defendant to have a discovery or to obtain a relief for himself in reference to the matter contained in the original bill.. A cross-bill must be confined to the subject matter of the original bill, and cannot embrace new and distinct matters not embraced in the original suit.

Before the master, the defendant, without any alteration of the cross-bill, substituted a claim for specific performance by the plaintiffs of an agreement to build a drain and a claim for damages for not building it. That specific performance cannot be decreed of such a contract, is too clear to require argument, the defendant having a full, complete and perfectly adequate remedy at law for the breach of the contract. The master, while awarding to the plaintiffs the specific performance which they prayed for, and to which they were justly entitled, awarded at the same time to the defendant specific performance by the plaintiffs of the contract to build the drain, and damages for not having built it. This is to introduce chaos into equity proceedings. But it was not the learned master’s fault. The plaintiffs having neglected to demur to the cross-bill, and having put in an answer to it, the master very naturally proceeded to take cognizance of it, and to inquire into and report upon the subject matter of it.

We submit that the master’s conclusion that the agreement with reference to the privy well and drain-pipe and the party wall and windows was made at one and the same time is clearly shown by the testimony of the plaintiffs themselves. Surely, under such circumstances, it would be most unjust to allow the plaintiffs to enforce an agreement made in one part of a conversation, and relieve them from the performance of an agreement made in another part of the same conversation and negotiation. The error of the court below arose from the assumption that the defendant’s rights could be fully compensated by damages for the breach of the contract to build the drain. The duty of the plaintiffs to construct the drain was only a part of the contract. The part that gave equity jurisdiction was entirely overlooked, and that was, the grant of an easement to maintain in perpetuity the right of drainage across the^ plaintiff’s lots from the rear of defendant’s property to the public sewer on Fourth street. No action at law can compel the grant of such an easement.</p>

If the position of the court below be sustained, the defendant will be compelled to file a bill in equity setting up substantially the same facts that are now before this court, praying for a decree defining and ascertaining said easement and that the property of the present plaintiffs is subject to the same. Why, then, should not the court so decree in the present controversy? The authorities cited by the master, we submit, fully justify him in the view he takes, that equity has jurisdiction to do justice between the parties in this proceeding. To hold otherwise, is to permit these plaintiffs, whom the master finds to have acted in bad faith to the defendant, to take advantage of their own wrong.

The two agreements being separate and distinct, the breach of one cannot be set off in equity as a defence to the breach of the other, and the cross-bill was improperly brought, and properly dismissed. It is unnecessary to cite authorities in support of the well-known rule that there can be no set-off in equitj'', and that a cross-bill must be confined to the subject, matter of the original bill, and cannot introduce new matters not embraced in the original bill.

On the backside of No. 70 there was a large privy well some thirty feet deep, and ten feet wide, to the use of which the defendant had a title which is not questioned, and to which he had access for himself and his tenants by means of an opening in the east wall of his building. Both parties were desirous to rebuild on their respective lots. Negotiations were had in regard to the privy well and the drainage for the new buildings, which resulted in an amicable arrangement by which Phillips was to surrender his right to the privy well, and permit the plaintiffs to fill it up and build over the ground. In exchange for the right thus relinquished, the plaintiffs were to provide Phillips with a suitable connection with the Fourth street sewer under the south side of their building. He was to build therefore a solid wall on his east line, with no opening in it, which the plaintiffs could use as a party wall in the erection of their block. This he did. The plan of the plaintiffs’ building contemplated the use of this party wall for their first floor, and a shortening of the stories above the first, so as to leave a recess or open area between the party wall and the upper stories some ten or twelve feet wide. Into this area it was agreed that Phillips might open windows in the party wall. So long as they were kept open he was not to ask contribution towards the cost of the wall. If the plaintiffs wished the windows closed, they were to give Phillips one year’s notice, and pay their share of the cost of the wall. This agreement was reduced to writing, at the instance of Phillips, and presented to the plaintiffs for execution. They made no objection to the contract as written, but delayed its execution until Phillips had completed his building, and then refused to sign it. They filled the well and built over it up to and against the party wall, but they refused or neglected to provide the sewer connection that was to take its place, and compelled Phillips to provide another connection with the sewer by a different route, and at a relatively large cost. <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>The master has found that the written contract correctly recited the agreement actually made; that Phillips surrendered his right to the well, and complied with the contract on his part in regard to the manner of building the party wall. He has also found the refusal of the plaintiffs to provide the promised sewer connection, and that Phillips has suffered injury in consequence, amounting to several hundreds of dollars. Upon this state of facts, the plaintiffs have come into a court of equity to ask that Phillips be compelled to close the windows opening into the area in accordance with his agreement to close them upon a' year’s notice.</p>

Such of them as were for the benefit of Phillips, and were to be performed by the plaintiffs, he left for a court of law to enforce in an action for damages ; but a stipulation which was found by the master to be part of the general arrangement, which was for the benefit of the plaintiffs, he enforced by a decree in equity. This we think was wrong. If the case presented was one for specific execution, the equities of both parties should have been protected. But we think the plaintiffs were in no position to ask equitable relief. They set out in their bill so much of the general arrangement as related to the windows in the party wall. The defendant replied, in substance, that the stipulatioñ on which the bill rested was but a part of an agreement made before the work of rebuilding was begun; that under that agreement he had surrendered his right to a privy well on the plaintiff’s ground, and erected a party wall with no opening in it on the first floor, against which the plaintiffs had built their new building; that, on the other hand, the plaintiffs had neglected and refused to keep the agreement on their part, and had neither provided him with a sewer connection, as promised, nor offered to make any substitute or compensation therefor. The report of the master showed the facts to be as alleged in the answer. The plaintiffs were thus found to be standing with both feet on their own broken promises asking a chancellor to compel Phillips to keep to the uttermost his promises towards them. But specific execution is not of right, but of grace; and he who seeks relief <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>at the hands of a chancellor must show himself ready and willing to do all that he ought, in good conscience to do : Brightly’s Eq., § 218. If he does not, his bill will be dismissed. If the contract is not fair, or the conduct of him who asks its enforcement is not just and conscionable, or if there are independent circumstances which will render the operation of a decree of specific execution harsh and inequitable, the parties will be left to their remedies at law: Brightly’s Eq., § 220. Whether the stipulations in the contract are severable or not is not the important question in this case, but whether the position and conduct of the plaintiffs are such as to give them any standing in a court of equity. They had secured the surrender by Phillips of his rights on their land, and the erection of a wall with no openings on the first floor as a party wall, for which they had failed to make the promised return, and were still refusing to make any return whatever. Under such circumstances, they cannot be heard to ask equitable relief in regard to any part of the general arrangement. Having violated it themselves, in every important particular, they cannot ask its specific execution at the hands of a chancellor. They must do equity before they ask equity.</p>
