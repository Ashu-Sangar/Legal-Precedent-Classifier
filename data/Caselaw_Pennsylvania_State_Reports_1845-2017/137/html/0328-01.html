The contract on which Josephs was surety was awarded under § 26, act of May 13, 1856, P. L. 573, which, as modified by § 6, act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 233, required the contract to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, and required <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>the contractor to give security for its performance. The first suggestion is, that a contract governed by such a law, in which the surety is guided only by that which inheres in the contract itself, is not subject to a set-off against the contractor which existed at the date of the contract, so as to prevent the surety from recouping his advances to perforin the work. The city knew of Clement’s indebtedness to it when the contract was awarded, and its duty was to give Josephs notice that such indebtedness was to be deducted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[246,835,1182,654]]]'>2. The agreement between Clement and Josephs worked an equitable assignment, and by reason of the latter’s obligation as surety to the city, neither the city nor Clement, without payment of his advances, could deprive Josephs of the sums due. The filing of the warrant of attorney was sufficient notice to the controller to deprive Clement of any further right of disposition. As surety, Josephs spent $10,000 in completing ■ the contract, and he thus in any event suffers a loss of $3,000. His liability, when he became surety, was to expend of his own funds only such sum in excess of $7,025, the contract price, as should be required for the completion of the work. If the city’s contention is sustained, the burden of his suretyship is increased to the extent of $2,874.36.</p>

The agreement between Clement and Josephs, and the power of attorney, were made on the faith of decisions of this court. The agreement was drawn from the precedent approved in Hart v. Kelley, <a href="/citations/?q=83%20Pa.%20289" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="83 Pa. 289">83 Pa. 289</a>, construing the act of April 6, 1870, P.

After notice, the city was bound to recognize the right of Josephs, and nothing outside of the contract could affect his right to be paid in cash. The city’s judgment against Clement did not enhance its rights; a judgment cannot be set off against an equitable assignee for value: Ramsey’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20228" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 W. 228">2 W. 228</a>.

When the contract between Clement and the city was executed, the rights of the parties became fixed. The city could compel Clement to finish his contract, and,- upon so doing, he could recover the contract price, less the city’s set-off. The balance due him was the utmost he could claim, and no act of his could take the city’s right of set-off away. The agreement between Clement and Josephs was a partnership agreement, drawn under the act of April 6, 1870, P. L. 56, so as to protect Josephs from the liabilities of a general partner. It was not brought to the notice of the city. The power of attorney lodged with the controller gave no notice of it, and contained nothing that required the city to do aught else than to settle with Josephs as Clement’s attorney. It requires no argument to prove that the position of the attorney in fact was no higher nor better than that of Clement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b368-6" data-blocks='[["BL_368.4",368,[250,1139,1176,802]]]'>2. The city is asked by this action to give up the $2,874.36, appropriated to paying the judgment held by it against Clement, and the request should be backed up by clear reasoning and authority. The appellant’s counsel are driven to deny the city’s right of set-off, as against-a surety’s advances to perform the work. The city had no reason to anticipate that the surety intended to make such advances, and had no notice that Clement was doing the work with money other than his own. How, then, can it be logically reasoned that the city was under obligation to inform Josephs of its intention to deduct the judgment when it came to settle with Clement? Besides, the judgment against Clement was a matter of record, and easily ascertainable by Josephs. The advances made by Josephs give him no greater claim than any other creditor would have, who could show advances expended in the performance of Clement’s work.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b368-7" data-blocks='[["BL_368.5",368,[250,1960,1171,453]],["BL_369.1",369,[248,384,1168,353]]]'>3. The authorities relied on by the appellant are not applicable. Philadelphia v. Lockhardt, <a href="/pa/73/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="73 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="1032348" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0211-01">73 Pa. 211</a>, differs radically from this case. There has been no payment to Clement; all that the city owed him has been paid to Josephs. Ramsey’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20288" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 W. 288">2 W. 288</a>, does not fit the ease in hand, for Josephs asserts no claim against the city as an equitable assignee for value. He asserts no claim as surety, and as such he has not lost a dollar. The claim asserted is as a partner. He asserts it under a power of attorney which gave him the right to collect what the city <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>owed Clement: and that he has been paid. The effect of his collecting the money sued for might be to evade the city’s right of set-off, for the partners may have made a settlement between them already. His position as partner, and the fact that the venture has been a losing one, give Josephs no right to maintain this suit, or to collect the balance retained by the city in payment of the judgment due it.</p>

A portion of the contract price was applied with his consent to the payment of his debt to the city. Josephs, who was his surety on the bond accompanying the contract, brings this action to recover the amount so applied, alleging that he has an equitable claim to it superior to the city’s right of appropriation or set-off. When he became surety and before any work was done under the contract, he received from Clement a letter of attorney, which he filed with the city controller. By it he was authorized to receive all warrants which might be coming to Clement under his contract with the city. It constituted Josephs the attorney in fact of Clement for this purpose, and this was the scope of the power conferred by it.</p>

The city was not advised of this agreement, nor of the loan made in pursuance of it. It knew that Josephs had signed the bond of Clement and that he held the power of attorney mentioned, but it had no reason to suppose that he was interested in the contract or the moneys arising therefrom. It owed him no duty to give notice that Clement was its debt- or, or to relinquish its right of set-off.</p>

L. 56, to be compensated by a share of the profits on the bridge contract, in lieu of interest on the sums advanced, and the rights of the city under its contract with Clement were not impaired by it. The city could require Clement to complete the work according to his agreement, and, in an action for the price of it, set off its judgment against him: Metzgar v. Metzgar, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20R.%20227" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 R. 227">1 R. 227</a>; Jacoby v. Guier, 6 S. &amp; R. 448; Filbert v.

The claim against the city is founded on Clement’s performance of his contract, and the fact that he borrowed money to pay for labor and materials to complete it, cannot enlarge the claim nor destroy the defences to it. It was Clement’s money, and the sum which he could recover in a suit on his contract, which Josephs was authorized to receive from the city, and this was the only right against the city which the power of attorney and the agreement to secure his advances and compensation gave him. ■</p>

The city, with full knowledge of these facts and after repeated recognition of the right of the assignees to receive the moneys arising from .the contract, paid a portion of them to the contractor, and attempted to justify the payment on the ground that the assignment was invalid. In this contention it was defeated. There was no question of set-off involved in the suit, and no demand for more than the contractor could recover, if the assignment had not been made.
