The Reading Iron Works is attempting to recover back, by way of set-off, from Hunter’s estate, all moneys which were voluntarily paid by the corporation during a course of years, in the way of dividends. The attempt is based upon the fact that the directors never by formal resolution declared a dividend. But it was the usage of the company from the beginning to divide the profits on its books, and permit the stockholders to draw upon the corporate funds on account of their respective shares of such profits. We contend that profits-distributed by such method cannot be converted into an indebtedness and recovered back. No charter provision, statute, nor by-law made that usage unlawful, or required that dividends be declared by formal resolution. The method pursued was the equivalent of making dividends: Commonwealth v. Railway Co., <a href="/pa/74/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="74 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1034741" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0083-01">74 Pa. 83</a>. The profits thus divided did not always exist in cash for immediate and actual distribution at the end of the year, but it was unnecessary that they should, if they fairly appeared on the balance sheet: Stringer’s Case, L. R. 4 Ch. D. 475; Angelí &amp; Ames on Corp., § 557, note.</p>

The deceased having drawn out, during a series of years, some thousands of dollars as profits, doubtless regulating the <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>amount of his living expenses on the theory that such sums were income, the corporation cannot be permitted, by treating them as money borrowed, to destroy so much of the corpus of his estate: Montgomery’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=92%20Pa.%20206" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="92 Pa. 206">92 Pa. 206</a>. And, by the course pursued in regard to the assessment and payment of income tax, the corporation is estopped from denying the stockholder’s title to the profits received by him. Returns of the share of each stockholder in the profits of the company were made on his behalf in his name. The tax was then paid for him and receipted for in his name; the receipt taken was handed over to him, and he was charged with the amount so paid. By dividing the income of the corporation into a number of small incomes, the rate of taxation was reduced and the stockholders benefited. Either the method adopted was a bona fide division of profits, or it was a fraud on the government. In either case, it was valid between the parties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b330-5" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[241,1191,1165,805]]]'>3. The resolutions of the directors limiting the percentage of profits which stockholders might draw out in certain years, must be construed as meaning a percentage exclusive of the six per cent interest on their investment, which was regularly credited to them on the books during these same years. That this was the meaning, is manifest from the whole course of dealing. Even if it were not so, such resolutions cannot be regarded as declarations of dividends. They were not an even division of profits, which dividends must be : Morawetz on Corp., § 324; but certain stockholders were permitted to draw out only five per cent and others ten per cent. The resolutions must be regarded simply as fixing the time of payment of each member’s share of the profits; and, when any one drew in excess of the prescribed amount, without objection from the corporation, thus anticipating the prescribed time of payment, he was under no obligation to return any part of what he thus drew.</p>

It is an established principle that the law raises no implied promise which will support an action, from the mere fact that one man’s money has got into the hands of another: 2 Addison on Cont., *40. Much less will such promise be implied when the money belongs, as in this case, to the person receiving it. We have nothing to do here with the other stockholders, or with the question whether they drew out more or less than Hunter. In neither event, can the sums paid to stockholders <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>oil account of profits, be converted into moneys lent, and tbe transaction made a basis for the extinguishment of the stock. The items in the account which the master has allowed to be set off against the plaintiffs’ claim for stock, all bear date more than s&amp; years prior to the time of the issue of the stock, and would therefore be barred by the statute of limitations, and incapable of use as a set-off. If there was an over-payment here, the principle of law which forbids the recovery back of- a voluntary payment can never be more equitably applied than in this case.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b331-5" data-blocks='[["BL_331.5",331,[250,1050,1171,910]]]'>1. We are not seeking to recover back anything from Hunter’s estate. The plaintiffs demanded that their stock in the old corporation be exchanged for stock in the new. As the old stock had become very valuable, partly because the earnings of the corporation had remained with the company and had been used in improving and extending the plant, and, as the several stockholders had never received their exact proportions of any dividends earned, but had drawn out various amounts, charged against them in accounts annually rendered to them and approved by them, the interest which each stockholder had in the assets and franchises of the corporation was not represented alone by his certificates of stock, but by his stock as modified by his private account; and, therefore, to ascertain how much of the new stock he was entitled to, the account must first be adjusted. The process of changing the corporation and issuing new stock, was in substance a dissolution of the old company and a distribution of its assets. In view of the facts, the demand of the plaintiffs is unconscionable.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b331-6" data-blocks='[["BL_331.6",331,[251,1969,1171,453]],["BL_332.1",332,[249,383,1171,650]]]'>2. There is no evidence that Hunter ever objected to the accounts so carefully kept and annually rendered to him. The book-keepers being but servants of the corporation, and Hunter being one of the directors, it is substantially correct to say that these accounts were made up by himself. It was with his full knowledge and assent that he stood upon the company’s books as its debtor at the time of his death. We are merely insisting that his relations to the company be adjusted on the lines laid down by himself. But the master committed grievous error, in <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>his treatment of the payments made to Mrs. Hunter after her husband’s death. He treated them as if made by the Reading Iron Works, overlooking the fact that it was the executor who-in reality received the money from the corporation and paid it over to Mrs. Hunter. The confirmation of the executor’s account clearly established this, and also that the payment of this money to her was a proper thing to do. The present plaintiffs are no longer at liberty to dispute those propositions. And it is idle to inquire whether McManus could have borrowed the money on the credit of the estate. He simply drew $5,665.50 of the $6,000 which was set aside as the equivalent of dividends. That sum could have been appropriated by the company to Hunter’s indebtedness, but this was not done.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[249,1045,1169,1112]]]'>3. The plaintiffs are not entitled to a decree against the defendants for money. It is admitted that the Reading Iron Works has made an assignment and is insolvent. The attempt of the plaintiffs is to secure a part of the assets of the insolvent corporation, instead of stock. If we are correct in our position that the plaintiffs are entitled only to so much stock as represents the value of Hunter’s interest after his indebtedness is paid, the company was not in default in refusing to issue the number of shares demanded by the plaintiffs, and should not be made to pay damages. But, in the circumstances of this case, it makes very little difference whether the decree is for money or for certificates of stock, provided it does not entitle them to a share of the fund in the hands of the assignee. The capital stock of a corporation is a trust fund for the benefit of its creditors: Messersmith v. Sav. Bank, <a href="/pa/96/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="96 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="494639" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0440-01">96 Pa. 440</a>. It is difficult to see why the block belonging to the plaintiffs must not be a portion of such fund. As the debts of the company were contracted on the credit of the entire capital stock, without regard to who held it, the plaintiffs ought not to be allowed, because they failed to get a certificate long ago, to appropriate a place in the rank of creditors and take a portion of the fund as an equivalent for the stock.</p>

The defendant now abandons the averment of an increase of indebtedness, and argues its case on the basis that the payments to the widow were payments of income credited after Hunter’s death. If they were part of the profits of the company accumulated during his life, the payment was wrong, because such accumulations were part of the principal of his estate: Earp’s App., <a href="/pa/28/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="28 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="981664" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0368-01">28 Pa. 368</a>. If, on the other hand, they were earnings accruing subsequent to his death, he had anticipated these dividends, as the moneys drawn by him during his life were admittedly received by him on account of his share of profits, and the company cannot have credit for a second payment of them. Nor can the widow appropriate principal to make up to her a deficiency of income arising from such anticipation: Blackstone v.

    <p id="b334-7" data-blocks='[["BL_334.6",334,[281,486,1166,1670]]]'>The first and controlling question to be considered in this case is whether Charles H. Hunter, who was a stockholder in a corporation known as SeyEert, McManus &amp; Co., was its debtor at the time of his death in 1870. The master has found that he was, and the court has approved the finding. But this finding is a deduction from undisputed facts, and the appellants claim that it is not authorized by them. These facts are distinctly and fully stated in the master’s report, and need not be repeated here. They show a course of dealing between the corporation and its stockholders, by which the latter received upon the books of the former an annual credit of six per cent on the agreed value of their shares, and were charged with the amounts drawn out “ on their capital stock.” An account current containing all the items of debit and credit was kept with and annually furnished to each stockholder, and he was thus advised of the state of his account with the corporation, and, if the debits exceeded the credits, that he appeared on the books of the latter as its debtor to the amount of the excess. The account included the balance of the previous year, together with interest upon it and the sums drawn out. This interest was applied in reduction of the interest credit to which the stockholder was entitled, as appears by the entry “ bj^ balance of interest account per account current rendered.” A stockholder who, annually for eight jmars, received a statement of his account without intimating that it was incorrect in form or fact, must be considered as consenting to its accuracy. But independent of the notice afforded by the account current, Hunter must have known that he appeared on the books of the corporation as its debtor, because he was one of its directors, actively participated in the management of its affairs, and was present when the resolutions were adopted, which limited the amount that the stockholders might draw out to five per cent on their capital stock.</p>

These profits were “ invested in the business in various properties,” thereby increasing the capacity of the plant and the value of the stock. In 1865, on motion of Hunter, it was resolved <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>“that the report of the assessor of income tax of the profits of last year be made in the individual names of the stockholders, and their respective amounts charged to their account when paid to the collector; ” and the reports and charges were thereafter made in accordance with this resolution. The appellants insist that this action was the equivalent of an actual division of the profits. But this claim is sufficiently answered by the fact that the profits remained in the business and were not credited in the account current, while the taxes were charged therein. We think the master was justified in finding that Hunter was indebted to the corporation in the sums drawn out by him in excess of the credit of six per cent on the agreed value of his stock.</p>

    <p id="b336-9" data-blocks='[["BL_336.8",336,[263,781,1168,849]]]'>Two questions are raised by this appeal. The first is, whether the sums paid by the corporation to the widow of Charles H. Hunter constitute an indebtedness of his estate; and second, whether under the circumstances of the case a decree for the payment of money is allowable. Hunter, by his will, devised the residue of his estate, after the payment of his just debts, to his executor, in trust to devote the net income thereof to the maintenance of his wife and children for a period therein named, and as each child attained the age of twenty-five years to pay to him his proportion of two thirds of the principal, and at the death of the widow his proportion of the remaining one third of it. No authority was given to the executor to pledge any portion of the assets of the estate for a loan to be expended in their maintenance. The sums paid to the widow from 1870 to 1875 were charged in the account opened with Hunter in 1862, and the effort of the appellant is to subject the stock belonging to Hunter’s estate to a lien for them.</p>
    <p id="b336-10" data-blocks='[["BL_336.9",336,[262,1648,1169,757]],["BL_337.1",337,[232,375,1177,1222]]]'>At the time of his death, in 1870, Hunter was indebted to the corporation, and his stock was pleged for the payment of this indebtedness. He was then entitled to an annual credit in his account of six per cent on the agreed value of his stock. These credits were entered in the account each year after his death until 1876. The account shows that the corporation actually appropriated a portion of each year’s interest credit to the payment of interest on the debt, as it had done in Hunter’s lifetime. The balance of this interest credit was applicable to the items of the debt in the order of their entry.- It is clear that the widow had no authority to bind the estate by a receipt for any portion of its assets, or in any manner to increase its indebtedness. But it is claimed that the payments were made to her by direction of the executor, who was also president of the corporation, and that they were therefore in effect payments <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>to him as the legal representative of the estate. If it be conceded that these payments were made to the executor, it remains to inquire whether he could increase the debt for which the stock was pledged, by drawing out sums in excess of or equal to the interest credits in the account which were applicable to that debt. The annual balances in the account show that the first year after Hunter’s death the debt of his estate was reduced from $7,987.56 to $7,524.21, and that in the second and third years it was increased from $7,524.21 to $10,493.20, by charging to the estate the sums paid to the widow. If the sums so paid by the direction of the executor became a debt of the estate and a lien upon the stock, it would follow that he might devote the principal of the estate to the maintenance of the widow and children, while the will limited his expenditures in that behalf to the net income thereof, after the payment of its just debts. The interest credits were not dividends, but payments on an account in which the sums paid to the widow were improperly charged, thus apparently but not actually increasing the debt of the estate. The powers of the executor under the will were known to the corporation of which he was the chief officer. We think the learned master was right in holding that the interest credits were applicable to the debt for which the stock was pledged, and that the amounts received by the widow were not a lien on the stock, or a debt of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b337-3" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[239,1608,1170,610]]]'>On the 28th of March, 1889, the corporation made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, and at the time of the final decree its stock was worthless. The assignee was admitted to defend, and it is now claimed that a decree for money is improper, because it may affect injuriously the general creditors. It is conceded that, but for the assignment and insolvency of the corporation, the decree in this respect is unobjectionable, because it was the plain duty of the corporation, under its own resolutions, to issue the stock. But we are unable to see how these can affect the rights and liabilities of the original parties to this litigation. The assignee succeeded to the defences of the assignor and is limited to them.</p>
    <p id="b337-4" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[503,2224,909,94]]]'>Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>
