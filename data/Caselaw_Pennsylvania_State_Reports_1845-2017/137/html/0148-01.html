The apparatus had not been long in use by the defendant, and consisted of a heavy pole fifty or sixty feet in length, set upright in a wooden cup on the ground and held in its place by guys. At the top of the pole was fastened an endless chain with scoops or pockets, by which the coal was drawn to the top of the pole and thence dropped down, the process being continued until the pile of coal was as high as it could be made, when the guys were taken down and attached to another pole in another place. To remove the coal for loading it upon cars or vessels, it was taken away from the bottom of the pile, and, as the removal reached the pole on the slope of the pile, the pole was to be drawn tight against the coal on the other side, by ropes attached to it above the coal. The poles and other appliances were furnished by one Berger, under a contract with the defendant company made in May, 1887, by which Berger agreed to “erect and operate” the plant or plants at his own expense.</p>

Train or and others, engaged in handling the coal, were selected by Toner from men approved of by the company’s superintendent. On the afternoon of Monday, December 5th, a part of the coal having been removed, ropes were attached to the pole above the remaining coal, the other ends passing, one of them to a fence, and the other to a stake driven into the ground, and drawn as taut as it was practicable to draw them at that time. On the next morning there was about twenty or thirty feet of coal yet about the pole. Toner left the yards early in the day and, with the knowledge of the defendant company, put one McFadden, another employee, in charge of the men. McFadden occasionally acted as foreman, in the absence of Toner.</p>

The plaintiff had been employed about the pile for but four or five days, and he testified that when working at the -coal he supposed that the pole was sunk in the ground.</p>

      <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>■ At the close of the testimony, the defendant presented the following points for instruction:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b187-5" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[246,466,1162,300]]]'>1. The evidence in this case shows that the pole which fell upon the plaintiff was owned by one A. J. Berger, an independent contractor, and that it was erected by him, and that all the care of the same was his only. There was therefore no duty upon the defendant towards the plaintiff with regard to the said pole, and the verdict should be for the defendant.8</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b187-6" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[245,773,1163,709]]]'>8. An employer does not impliedly guarantee the absolute safety of his employees. A master discharges his full duty toward his servant, when he provides for him in such a manner as may fairly and reasonably be deemed prudent' and safe. The evidence in this case shows that the pole was intended to be taken down. If, therefore, the person intrusted with this business acted in good faith in removing the guys some time before the accident, leaving the pole imbedded in the coal, believing, according to the best of his judgment, that there was no danger in so doing, and that shortly before the accident he had two or more blocks-and-falls attached to the pole to pull it over on the coal, and that it was so pulled the day before the accident as far as it would then go, there was no negligence on the defendant’s part, and the plaintiff cannot recover.3</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b187-7" data-blocks='[["BL_187.6",187,[247,1491,1161,144]]]'>4. The evidence in this case does not show any negligence on the part of the defendant, producing the accident in question, and the plaintiff cannot recover.4</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b187-8" data-blocks='[["BL_187.7",187,[246,1644,1162,555]]]'>5. In accepting an employment, an employee is presumed to have notice of all patent risks incidental thereto, and he is further assumed to undertake such risks. The evidence in this case shows that the pole in question was intended to be taken down; that it had been standing without other support than the body of coal in which it was imbedded, for more than a month before the accident, and that blocks-and-falls were attached to the pole to draw it over, the day before the accident. All this was visible to the plaintiff, who continued to work around the pole. He must be considered as having taken the risk of the pole falling, and he cannot recover.5</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b187-9" data-blocks='[["BL_187.8",187,[247,2207,1163,196]],["BL_188.1",188,[265,362,1162,140]]]'>6. The evidence shows that there was no defect in the pole itself or in its manner of erection or maintenance, but, on the contrary, that it was intended to take the pole down, and that the accident was proximately caused wholly by the manner in <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>which, the plaintiff and his co-employees acted in removing the coal around the pole.

    <p class="summary" id="b188-6" data-blocks='[["BL_188.4",188,[264,514,1163,345]]]'>7. The evidence shows that the pole was equipped with blocks-and-falls to pull it down as the coal was removed, and that the pole fell in consequence of the omission of William McFadden, who was a fellow-servant of the plaintiff, to have the blocks-and-falls manned and pulled upon as the coal was removed from the base of the pole. The verdict must, therefore, be for the defendant.17</p>

If there was negligence here, on the part of the company, it was because of its failure to perform some duty which it owed him. The first inquiry, then, is this: What duty did the railroad company owe to these workmen at this place ?</p>

Among these are the duties to provide a reasonably safe place in which to work, and reasonably safe instruments with which to do his work. If this duty is delegated to another, the agent charged with its performance stands in the same position as the principal. But one who enters the service of another always takes upon himself the ordinary risks of the employment. The negligent act of a fellow-workman is one of these risks. An employer is then not responsible to a workman for an injury caused by the negligence of a fellow-workman.</p>

It was so firmly imbedded in the coal the night before that it was impossible to move it; it was drawn on until there was danger of breaking. It seems to me that the only danger that could have been apprehended, the only danger that could have been reasonably considered at that time, was not that the place in itself was an unsafe place; it was not that there was any defect in the. machinery, but that there should be neglect in not keeping the ropes tight and not drawing the pole over soon enough, or that it should be done in an unskilful manner.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b189-8" data-blocks='[["BL_189.7",189,[255,1805,1166,546]]]'>The first of these happened. Mr. McFadden, who had been left in charge of the matter by Mr. Toner, two hours before this time, and who had been cautioned by Mr. Berger to look out for the pole, neglected to do so. There was an oversight or an error of judgment upon his part, as to the proper time to remove the pole. He says he thought that at the time of the accident the pole was secure. At the time it fell, there was, according to his testimony, twenty feet of coal in front of it, and the coal sloped up to a much greater height back of it. He thinks it fell because of the pressure of a slide of coal behind it.</p>

If it did this, it did its whole duty in the matter. If there was in the situation, as it stood on Tuesday morning at the time of the accident, no danger to be reasonably apprehended, then there was no duty resting on the company, and there can be no recovery in this case. If there was such a danger, that is, a danger to be reasonably apprehended and guarded against, then there rested upon the company the duty to guard against it. If a competent man, charged with the duty to see that the pole was taken down, was placed in charge of it, with the help and appliances sufficient and necessary for that purpose, and if he was a fellow-workman of the other men engaged there, and neglected his duty or erred in judgment, the company did all that it was bound to do, and is not responsible.

The learned judge had correctly stated who were fellow-servants, and if the company desired specific instructions on the point of the relation of McFadden to the appellee, <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>under their employment, it should have requested them.

    <p id="b194-6" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[252,538,1181,1163]]]'>The question whethei McFadden was competent to superintend the work of taking down the pole was fairly raised by his own and Toner’s evidence, as witnesses for the company. He was without experience or instruction in that work, and he was never directed to take charge of it. His duties were defined by his orders, and these were to look after the wheeling' and handling of the coal; and, in his own language, “ that was all he was concerned with.” The conduct of Toner, the morning of the accident, was confirmatory of this view of the scope of McFadden’s employment. He informed the company of his intended temporary absence from the work, and no objection was made to it, and he requested and was promised that a man should be sent to take his place. These facts he communicated to McFadden, who had not the slightest intimation that he was expected to assume any duty of Toner in the taking down and care of the pole. The company knew how the pole was supported, and that its employees' were engaged in removing the coal from it, and must, therefore, have known that their safety required the presence of a competent person to supervise the work of taking it down. It knew McFadden’s habits, capacity, and duties, and the duties of Toner. Its promise to send a man to take the place of the latter was evidence of its own understanding of its duty in the premises.</p>

These would have been amended on motion in the court below, even after verdict, to make the record conform to what was tried there, and we consider an amendment as made which is of course : Jones v. Freyer, 3 <em>W. </em>N. 365; Bolton v.

It is not claimed that the learned judge erred in his statement to the jury of the duties of the company to its employees, but it is contended that he should have charged that these had all been performed in this case. But, as already indicated, we think the question whether a competent man was placed in charge of the pole was for the jury. It is a sufficient answer to the other criticisms of that part of the charge <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>contained in the first specification that the mere omission of an instruction not asked for is not cause for reversing a judgment.</p>

In the case before us, the pole was not held in place by guys, and it was not set in the ground. Its only support was the coal pile around it. As the support was weakened by the removal of the coal, it was liable at any moment to fall upon and crush the men working at its base. The company knew this, but did not advise its coal-handlers of the danger to which they were exposed. It was a danger which was not patent to one in ignorance of the facts and whose experience and observation had taught him that such poles were either held in place by guys, or securely set in the ground. The same appliances which kept the pole in position while the coal-pile was being formed about it, would have held it securely there while the coal was being removed from it. These consisted of guys, which were taken away when the pile was formed and the work of removing it began. It seems from the testimony of Berger that the guys were taken away when the pile was complete, upon the theory that they were no longer of use there, and might be in the way of other guys supporting other poles in close proximity.. As a substitute for the security afforded by these, a plan was adopted for taking down the pole while the work of removing the coal was in progress. Two poles were taken down safely in pursuance of this plan; but the third pole, to which the apparatus was attached for the purpose of taking it down, fell among the workmen, killing two of them instantly, and seriously injuring others. It is obvious, from the description of the plan, that its successful execution required the vigilant superintendence of a competent person, and even thus, speaking for myself, it was dangerous. A slight inconvenience or expense may have been saved by it, but these can have no weight in a matter affecting the safety of the workmen.</p>
