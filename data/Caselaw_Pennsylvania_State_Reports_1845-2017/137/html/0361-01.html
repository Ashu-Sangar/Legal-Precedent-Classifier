The walk upon which she fell was built of plank, and was about four feet in width. The plaintiff had passed over it twice, a few days prior to her accident, and at that time noticed nothing wrong with it. She testified that the evening on which she was injured was not very dark, and she thought it was a bright starlight night; that it had snowed a little in the afternoon, and had been a little muddy, but in the evening it got colder; that she went up the street on an errand and passed over this sidewalk without noticing any tip in it; that as she was returning down the street, her foot slipped while upon the walk and she fell, breaking a bone in her ankle ; that, while lying on the walk awaiting the coming of assistance, she observed the condition of the walk and noticed that it tipped toward the roadway of the street, the inside edge of it being over a foot higher than the edge on the side next the roadway ; and that she had never noticed this, and had paid no attention to it, before her fall. The plaintiff testified, also, that she was unable to say whether there was any snow or ice upon the walk.</p>

W. J. Alexander, a witness for the plaintiff, testified that he was one of the persons who helped to carry the plaintiff to her home after her injury, and described her situation and apparent condition just after her fall. On cross-examination, he testified, further, that there was nothing about the sidewall?; that attracted his attention to it as being dangerous in any way. Other testimony for the plaintiff tended to show that Pearl street was very much traveled.</p>

Crandall, the other person who assisted in carrying the plaintiff home after her injury, and several other witnesses who were in the habit of using Pearl street. The testimony of these witnesses tended to prove that, at the time of the plaintiff’s injury, the sidewalk did not tip toward the roadway in the manner described by her, but that it was nearly level from side to side, the outer edge of it having been raised by the frost a little higher than the edge next the fence, and the difference in level between the two not being more than three or four inches ; that it was in good and substantial repair, and there was nothing about it to attract attention as unsafe; and that there were level spaces, sodded over, on each side of the planks, upon which there was room for a person to walk.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b400-7" data-blocks='[["BL_400.7",400,[256,1145,1163,804]]]'>1. There was no evidence at all of actual notice to the defendant that the walk was out of repair, and no evidence that the walk was in such condition that constructive notice could be presumed. From the testimony of the plaintiff herself it is evident that the walk, when she first passed over it on the evening of her accident, could not have been in the condition described by Mrs. Fitzpatrick; for no reasonable being could pass over a sidewalk four feet wide, and tipped so that one side was a foot higher than the other, without noticing it. A walk in that condition would incline at an angle of from thirty to forty degrees. The fair inference from the plaintiff’s testimony is that its condition changed between the time she went up the street and the time she came back. This is certainly a much fairer inference than the one submitted to the jury. The action of frost is quick, and the condition of the walk might have changed in that short time.</p>

To visit the city with notice of the alleged defect, something more’ is necessary than the naked testimony of two persons, who say they fell at a certain point, at times three weeks apart. To make the city responsible, the defect must be so notorious as to be obvious to all who had occasion to pass over the walk: Rapho v. Moore, <a href="/pa/68/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="68 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1024549" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0404-01">68 Pa. 404</a>; Mauch Chunk Bor. v.

There is no evidence of such a defect. The testimony <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>shows that a large number of people were in the habit of using this walk regularly, and not one of them is called to show that it was in a defective condition. The plaintiff passed over it on a bright, clear evening, one half hour before she was injured, and it was not at that time in such a condition that she noticed its dangerous character. How, then, can the city be charged with constructive notice ? If it was in such a condition that the city was bound to notice it, then the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, as the testimony shows that she could have avoided the walk: Crescent Tp. v. Anderson, <a href="/pa/114/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="114 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="549995" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0643-01">114 Pa. 643</a>; Erie City v.

      <em>Mr. Eugene Mullin </em>(with him <em>Mr. J. M. </em>McClure), for the appellee:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.5",401,[253,1136,1173,1068]]]'>The accident occurred about the first of March. Bradford’s latitude and elevation warrant the presumption that the condition of the sidewalk described by Mrs. Fitzpatrick was attributable to the action of the frost, and continued until after the time of the plaintiff’s accident. If, then, this sidewalk was in the condition, described by Mrs. Fitzpatrick, for two or three weeks before the accident occurred, the defendant was visited with constructive notice thereof. It is not the law that the defect must be known to the public generally, in order to visit the city with constructive notice. It is sufficient if the defect be such that those who used the sidewalk might readily have observed it. A sidewalk four feet wide, with one side of it from four inches to a foot higher than the other, is defective to the extent referred to. The fact that a half dozen persons, of the hundreds who daily passed over it, did not observe the defect, ought to have no weight in determining the facts constituting constructive notice. The city was chargeable with notice of it, but the plaintiff was not; she was bound only to exercise reasonable care and prudence, and was not bound to have her mind directed at every moment to the condition of the sidewalks: Dillon on Mun. Corp., 1007.</p>

The controlling questions in the case are whether her negligence contributed to the injury, and whether the city had notice of the alleged defect in the walk.</p>
    <p id="b402-6" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[248,721,1171,1369]]]'>The walk was four feet wide, and there was no structural defect in it. Its material was substantial and <em>sound; </em>the stringers were of the proper size and well laid, and the planks were securely nailed to them. It is charged in her declaration “ that a portion of said sidewalk was covered with snow and ice, and one side thereof was several inches higher than the' other.” As there was no evidence of any accumulation of snow and ice upon it, that part of the charge is eliminated from the case. The appellee testified that at the point where she fell, the walk on the side next to the fence was a foot higher than on the side next to the road, so that it descended towards the road in the degree of one foot to four. If her description of the walk was correct, it is evident that the stringers on the side next to the fence had been raised a foot by the action of the frost, while the stringers on the opposite side remained in place. But, in her description of the condition of the walk at the time of the accident, she was not sustained by a single witness in the cause. The persons who came to her aid when she fell and who were called to testify in her behalf, did not observe any defect in the walk, or hear any complaint from her, or others present, respecting it. A Mrs. Fitzpatrick, however, testified that between two and three weeks previous to the accident, she had fallen on a walk on Pearl street, which was then in exactly the same condition as the walk described by the appellee; that she had not seen the walk since, but from information she had received from the latter she knew that they fell on .the same walk and at the same place.</p>

The appellee had been over this walk half an hour before she fell upon it, and twice within a day or two previous to that time, and she testified that she never noticed any defect in it until after her fall. The only person who described the condition of the walk as dangerous, at any time previous to that, was Mrs. Fitzpatrick. It is admitted that the city had no actual notice of any defect in it, but it is claimed that this evidence is sufficient to charge it with constructive notice that the walk was out of repair and unsafe. A municipal corporation is not an insurer against all defects in its highways, but it is answerable for negligence in the performance of its duties in the construction and care of them. For a defect arising in them, without its fault or neglect, it is not liable, unless it has express notice, or the defect be so notorious as to be evident to all passers. If a defect is such that it is discovered by only one of a thousand or more persons who pass it in the ordinary pursuit of business or pleasure, can it be said to be notorious, or such a defect as the municipality is botind to take notice of ? We think not.</p>
    <p id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[236,1428,1170,904]]]'>It is a fact well known to the inhabitants of all our municipalities that the sidewalks, whether of plank or stone, are liable in the winter to be thrown out of level by the action of the frost, and in the spring, when the frost is out of the ground, to settle to their' former positions. It is not necessary or practicable that for every slight deviation of the walks from their original level the}' should be taken up or relaid while the ground is frozen, nor would the comfort and safety of pedestrians be promoted by such action. Aside from the evidence of Mrs. Fitzpatrick, there is nothing in the ease to show that the walk was unsafe or out of repair, prior to the appellee’s fall upon it. If the condition described by Mrs. Fitzpatrick once existed, there is no room, in the presence of the testimony of the appellee and all the other witnesses in the cause, for a presumption that it continued. We think the evidence is insufficient to charge the city with notice of any defect in the sidewalk in question, and we sustain the fourth specification of error.</p>
