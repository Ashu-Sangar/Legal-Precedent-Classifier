Three reasons seemed to incline the court below to the opinion that the defendant’s operations were not to be distinguished from life insurance, viz.: (a) that it employs paid agents; (b) that a relation, in the nature of a contract, exists between it and its members, and (e) that it uses certain printed blanks in its business, somewhat similar to those used by insurance companies.</p>

L. 67, beneficial associations, of which defendant is one, are excepted from the provisions of the act, and that, therefore, they have the right to transact the business which they have been carrying on. We do not think that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. If the act of May 1, 1876, does not apply to defendant, the result is simply that it is not brought within the jurisdiction of the insurance commissioner. But this does not aid, in any degree, in determining its power under its charter; and what these powers are, or, at least, whether they include the right to transact the business in which they are engaged, is the real question in this case. Those rights cannot be increased by § 54 of the insurance act. That section does not enlarge the jurisdiction to grant charters, conferred on the courts by the act of 1874. That act limits the jurisdiction to corporations not for profit, and the only, clause, under which defendant could claim to bo chartered, is that which authorizes the granting of charters for the purpose of “the maintenance of a society for beneficial or protective purposes to its members from funds collected therein.” It would be doing violence to the language of this clause to extend it so as under it to confer the right to transact what is, in all its essential features, the business of life insurance, differing only from the business transacted by the various life insurance companies in the amounts for which policies are issued. Thus, the operations of this defendant would be correctly described by using the language of § 28, of the act of 1874, authorizing corporations for profit to be chartered by the governor, which is as follows: “ Companies incorporated under the provisions of this act for the insurance of human beings against sick<a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>ness, cleatb or personal injury.....shall have the power and right to make, execute and perfect such and so many contracts, agreements, policies, and other instruments as may be required therefor.” This language describes exactly that which defendant has been and is engaged in doing, and it is impossible for us to say that the business thus described is not the business of life insurance.</p>
      <p id="b452-9" data-blocks='[["BL_452.3",452,[269,1464,1170,335]]]'>We may further say that it is very doubtful whether the business, which has been done by this defendant, has, in any proper sense, been beneficial to its members. An analysis of the receipts and expenditures of the association, above stated, Ivill show that they have paid out, on an average, annually, $4,000 for expenses, and only $3,400 for benefits ; showing that more than fifty per cent of the amount collected from the members is absorbed in expenses, and consequently, less than one half the amount paid in by the members is ever returned in the form of benefits.</p>

The form of the judgment will therefore be settled on proper application to the court.</p>

Their contention is that their organization falls within the first class of corporations, authorized by the second section of the act of 1874, which, in the ninth clause, provides for the granting of charters for the maintenance of societies “ for beneficial or protective purposes to its members from funds collected therein; ” and that the Equitable Beneficial Association of Pennsylvania is in no sense an insurance company, and has not been, and-is not now, so conducted.</p>
    <p id="b455-3" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[282,1474,1168,849]]]'>As the law plainly recognizes the existence of beneficial societies, as distinguished from insurance companies, and provides for their incorporation as such, it is proper that we should determine what is meant by “ a society for beneficial or protective purposes,” and in what respects it may be said to differ from an insurance company. The general object or purpose of an insurance company is to afford indemnity ox security against loss: its engagement is not founded in any philanthropic, benevolent, or charitable principle; it is a purely business adventure, in which one, for a stipulated consideration or premium per cent, engages to make up, wholly or in part, or in a certain agreed amount, any specific loss which another may sustain; and it may apply to loss of property, to personal injury, or to loss of life. To grant indemnity or security against loss, for a consideration, is not only the design and purpose of an insurance company, but is also the dominant and characteristic feature of the contract of insurance.</p>

The great under<a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>lying purpose of the organization is not to indemnify or to secure against loss : its design is to accumulate a fund from the contributions of its members, “ for beneficial or protective purposes,” to be used in their own aid or relief, jn the misfortunes of sickness, injury, or death. The benefits, although secured by contract, and for that reason to a limited extent assimilated to the proceeds of insurance, are not so considered. Such societies are rather of a philanthropic or benevolent character: their beneficial features may be of a narrow or restricted character ; the motives of the members may be to some extent selfish, but the principle upon which they rest is founded in the considerations mentioned. These benefits, by the rule of their organization, are payable to their own unfortunate, out of funds which the members have themselves contributed for the purpose, not as an indemnity, or security against loss, but as a protective relief in case of sickness or injury, or to provide the means of a decent burial in the event of death. Such societies have no capital stock. They yield no profit, and their contracts, although beneficial and protective, altogether exclude the idea of insurance, or of indemnity, or of security against loss. There were many of these societies in existence at the time of the passage of the act of 1874 in this state : the character of their business was a matter of common knowledge, and it was doubtless to societies of this character the ninth clause of the second section of the act of 1874 was intended to apply.</p>

The cause was tried under the act of April 22, 1874, without a jury, and the facts necessary to the determination of the case are not found. It is the duty of the court, in such case, to “state separately and distinctly the facts found, the answers to any points submitted in writing by counsel, and the conclusions of law: ” Act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109; Marr v. Marr, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20Pa.%20468" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="103 Pa. 468">103 Pa. 468</a>; Sweigard v.

Hay, <a href="/citations/?q=111%20Pa.%20564" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="111 Pa. 564">111 Pa. 564</a>. In the opinion of the court, after reciting the purpose or design of. the association, as defined by the charter, the learned court says : “ The facts in the case are substantially the same as in the. case, of the Commonwealth v. Beneficial Association of Philadelphia, No. 36 January Term 1889, Dauphin county <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>Common Pleas, in which an opinion has this day been filed; and for the reasons in the said opinion given, we find, as matter of law, that the commonwealth is entitled to a judgment of ouster against this defendant.” What these facts were the record does not show, and it is impossible for us to examine into the correctness of the conclusion of law without the facts from which that conclusion is drawn. In a case of this kind we are confined to the record. What is not found, must be presumed not to exist. We are wholly without information as to the business in which the defendants are engaged: there is no finding that they are making any contracts of insurance, or issuing policies in pursuance thereof; or, indeed, that they are engaged in any business at all.</p>
