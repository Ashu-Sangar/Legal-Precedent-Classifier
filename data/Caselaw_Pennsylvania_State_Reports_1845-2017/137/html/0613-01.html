That on the 1st day of May, 1884, the said claimant and said Margaret Metzgar 'entered into a written agreement, by the terms of which said claimant was to build for said Margaret Metzgar a house complete, furnishing all labor and materials, according to certain specifications then understood and agreed upon by the parties, for which the said Margaret Metzgar was to pay the sum of $2,875, on the days and times in said agreement specified. That, after the work was begun, it was agreed verbally that said claimant should from time to time make such changes and modifications in the plans as they were bid on, as the said Margaret Metzgar might desire and direct; she upon her part, agreeing to pay, in addition to said contract price, the fair value of such extra work. That, after the work had progressed under said contract and the supplement or amendment thereto, and after the claimant had laid out and expended the sums of money, and worked the number of days hereinafter set forth, the said Margaret Metzgar, in violation of the true intent and meaning of said contract as amended, refused to comply with the provisions thereof, and compelled claimant to abandon his contract and quit said work; at the same time refusing, and ever since continuing to refuse to pay to said claimant the sums of money aforesaid.”</p>

The foundation stone of the action in each case is the written contract between the parties severally. That the contract afterwards was modified and changed as the work and plan of the houses changed there is no question, but the written contract never was abrogated. This contract was material to the plaintiff’s case and was put in evidence by him. In strict order, perhaps it should have been the first proof in the cases.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b651-9" data-blocks='[["BL_651.7",651,[240,1327,1166,656]]]'>In each contract there is this provision: “Should any question arise in regard to the quality or the quantity of the work, the same shall be referred to the said superintendent, John M. Johnston, whose decision shall be final and binding.” The plaintiff admits that, upon failure to have his claims adjusted, he refused to submit the dispute which arose to the superintendent, and came to Greensburg, filed his liená, and issued the writs of scire facias now being tried. By reason of these undisputed facts, the question was then raised by the defendants’ counsel, in their third point, that the plaintiff is now estopped from recovering on the mechanics’ liens. When we charged the jury we reserved the question, for it is one of pure law. There is no question of fact in it for the jury.</p>

Plaintiff’s counsel, however, argue that under the pleas advantage cannot be taken of this defence. We cannot see why. The point is in the nature of a plea to the jurisdiction, and want of jurisdiction can be taken advantage of at any time. In Hartupee v. Pittsburgh, the pleas were the general issue, non-assumpsit, and payment with leave, etc., the action being assumpsit.</p>
