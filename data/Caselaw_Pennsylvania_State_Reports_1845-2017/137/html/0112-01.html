    <p class="summary" id="b150-6" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[250,886,1170,1009]]]'>1. It is contended that the tenth item in Casper Dull’s will disposed of two thirds only of his estate, leaving him to die intestate as to the remaining one third. We do not think so. The expression in item ten is, “ the proceeds of <em>all </em>my real and personal estate not specifically disposed of, whether accepted or sold as aforesaid, after the payment of my just debts, funeral expenses and legacies, I direct to be divided into eight equal shares, after one third part thereof shall have first been reserved and secured for the purpose of paying the interest of my wife; ” showing no intention of dying intestate as to any part of his estate; but, having ordered in the first clause of his will that his widow was to have the interest on the one third of his estate, the exception in the tenth item means no more than that this third should not be paid over to the legatees while the widow lived, but should be first deducted and secured for her as previously directed by his will. It is not an exception from the fund bequeathed so as not to pass under the general bequest, but a direction that this one third should be set apart for the widow while she lived, and upon her death it would be payable as the clause directs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b150-7" data-blocks='[["BL_150.6",150,[250,1904,1161,196]]]'>2. It is contended that J oseph F. had an inheritable estate in the bequest to Casper Dull’s executors for his use, first, because he gave the income, and second, because at his death it was to go to his heirs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b150-8" data-blocks='[["BL_150.7",150,[249,2109,1165,336]]]'>It must be observed that nothing is given to Joseph F. The language is, “ one share to be reserved, kept and invested by my executors, the proceeds whereof shall be applied by my executors to the proper maintenance of my son Joseph F. during his life,” and then allows the corpus to be invaded if necessary, but Joseph F. is to have no control of it, nor shall it be liable to his debts.</p>

The case is very like Rife v. Geyer, <a href="/pa/59/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="59 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="426935" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0393-01">59 Pa. 393</a>. We are of the opinion that the interest of Joseph F. Dull under his father’s will was such that nothing remained in the shape of property or money which survived his death, and that he has no estate which his administrator is entitled to receive.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b151-6" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[249,891,1201,403]]]'>The citation must be refused. This conclusion works to the injury of none. The petitioner had no status as administrator of Joseph F. Dull, to compel the executors or trustees to file ah account. The heirs could do so, and doubtless will if the trustees fail to distribute the fund. The only difference in the distribution would be that, if distributed by the administrator of Joseph F., it would be subject to commissions on the part * of the administrator, petitioner; otherwise it would not.</p>
