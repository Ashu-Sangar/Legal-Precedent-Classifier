In the case at bar, the widow has made an unequivocal election, after ample time for deliberation and with the advice of counsel.

But, it is contended by the widow that she is not bound by her election, because she was not named in the will. Under the act of April 20,1869, it is not necessary that she should be a beneficiary under the will, to make an election to take against it binding upon her. But she is a beneficiary in this case. The will makes the testator’s “ legal heirs and representatives in law ” his residuary legatees, and under that provision the distributees are the same persons who would be entitled to take under the intestate law, including the widow: Suplee’s App., 16 W.

Assuming that the widow was excluded from benefit under the will, and that the will converted the real estate into personalty, as of the time of the testator’s death, the widow is entitled to receive the one half of the fund absolutely.

The equitable doctrine of election presupposes a plurality of gifts or rights, between which a choice must be made: 2 Story’s Eq., § 1075; and the statutes cited by the appellants apply only when a devise or bequest is made to the widow. Here, there was no provision in the will for her to decline. She simply found that the estate consisted of certain personal property, and modestly asked her share of it. The very question presented was decided by the Orphans’ Court in McCrystle’s Est., 4 W. N. 216, and if the principles of that case are indorsed, this decree must be affirmed.</p>

The alleged election in the present case was filed after the adjudication of the widow’s rights in this court, and in accordance with a requirement of the court below. We submit that no legal election ever could have been made, and that no. actual election ever was made; but that the widow’s rights are the same as in a plain and simple case of intestacy, and she shares in the property of her husband just as she found it immediately after his death, when, according to all the authorities, the conversion took effect. If any other view be correct, it. certainly cannot be the one advocated by the appellants. If there was no conversion as respects the widow’s rights, the executor’s sale has not divested her interest, but it still remains in the land, and her dower is a charge against it in the hands of the purchaser. In no event can she be entitled to the income of one half of this fund. The just and, equitable solution of this problem vmuld be the affirmance of the court below.</p>

There is no third or mixed course. Her legal rights, which are paramount to the husband’s control, attach eo instanti that he dies, and there is no interval during which the will can slip in and work a conversion, and then stand aside to let in her intestate rights upon the converted estate. Conversion takes place by virtue of the will, but as to the widow so electing there is no will. She must make her choice, and it is will or no will. She has time to consider which she shall take, but the quality of the estate as to her rights is fixed at the moment of death, and she must take one or the other as they were then.

Followed to its logical conclusion, it would result that a will which gave the widow one cent would require and support a valid election, while one which gave her nothing would not permit an election at all. The law does not sanction such an illusory distinction, and the argument which would support it is founded on wrong premises. The election which the widow is required to make is between rights, not between benefits. She has the right to abide by her husband’s disposition of his property, or the right to override it and claim under the intestate law. These rights are inconsistent, and cannot co-exist. She has always the choice which she will assert, but the choice is of one or the other, not both, and does not legally depend in any degree on the mention or omission of her in the will, or on the quantum of benefits she receives or renounces under it.</p>

L. 537, affects this question. The common-law rule was that a devise or bequest to a wife wits not in satisfaction or lieu of dower unless so expressed in the will: Co. Litt. 36 <em>b. </em>The courts of equity relaxed this rule by holding that where the provisions of the will would otherwise be materially disarranged, an intention to make the devise in lieu of dower would be implied. This gave rise to frequent <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>litigation as to the inconsistency of clower with the provisions of wills, (see Webb v. Evans, <a href="/binn/1/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="1 Binn. 565" data-case-ids="1787896" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0565-01">1 Binn. 565</a>,) and the act of 1833, § 11, was meant to diminish this by establishing a fixed general rule. The act of 1848, supra, simply secures the widow her choice between the provision for her in the will, and her share under the intestate law of both personalty and realty.</p>
    <p id="b665-6" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[220,670,1171,609]]]'>As the widow’s rights are paramount to her husband’s power of disposition, she of course at her election could claim her statutory estate in the land itself, and in law it is this only to which she is entitled. But in equity, as she has acquiesced in the sale and made claim to the proceeds, she must now be held to have relinquished her dower, and the land to have passed to the purchaser discharged of her estate in it. It is an estoppel by election. But the fund is to be treated as still realty, for the purpose of determining the quantum of her interest or estate in it, and that is for life only. One half of the fund, therefore, must be properly secured under the direction of the court, and the interest paid to her during her life.</p>
