Upon this judgment, an <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>attachment-execution, returnable to the first Monday of January, 1887, was issued, which was duly served by the sheriff upon Mrs. Ogle, and also upon the National Bank of Fayette county as garnishee. Mrs. Ogle did not appear in the attachment proceeding, and judgment was therein regularly obtained against the bank, as her garnishee, for $377, the amount of a deposit which she had in the bank. The judgment against the bank was collected by the sheriff upon execution process, and the amount so collected was applied to the costs and to the original judgment in favor of Baker. At the time when the original judgment was entered, and during the subsequent proceedings, Mrs. Ogle was living on the farm of Baker, who was her son-in-law, occupying a small house, close to the one in which he and his family resided. She took her meals with them, and spent the most of her time during the day with the family, but stayed at night in the smaller house. She was about 81 years old, and was unable to read or write.</p>

Baker, the defendant, persuaded her not to go, telling her that the business was nothing that needed her attention, but was something that concerned himself and he would attend to it; that by reason of Baker’s representation and promise, she gave the matter no further attention. On the other hand, the testimony for the defendant tended to prove that some time prior to the date of the judgment note, Mrs. Ogle told Baker she intended to give him all she had; that a day or two before said date, while in Uniontowm attending to some business for her, he procured the judgment note from an attorney, and after returning home acquainted her with its contents; that she afterwards signed <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>it with her mark in the presence of McDowell, and gave it to Baker as a recompense for her maintenance during the nine years she had resided on his property.</p>

It cannot be denied that a judgment may be impeached collaterally for fraud, and that is just what is done here. Doubtless another course might have been pursued. Application might have been made to open the judgment, and its validity determined in a feigned issue, awarded on that application or in the original case after being opened, but that alone would not secure the return of the money collected. Possibly, an order of restitution might be awarded after the invalidity of the judgment was ascertained, but that is uncertain. Or, a bill in equity might have been filed for the purpose of having the judgment stricken off, the note canceled and the money collected refunded. But, whatever course should be adopted, it would require, as the first step, the establishment of the alleged fraud and consequent invalidity of the judgment, and that could in no way be more satisfactorily determined than it has been done in this case by the verdict of the jury.</p>

True, the original judgment still remains unsatisfied, but what is there now to prevent the court upon application made, from striking off that judgment by virtue of the facts determined here ? And thus, as briefly, directly and satisfactorily as possible the whole ground is covered and the entire controversy ended. Ordinarily, it would, perhaps, be better to apply first to have the judgment opened, but under the circumstances of the case nothing would have been gained thereby, and the defendant has in no way been prejudiced.</p>

A judgment or decree procured through the fraud and collusion of the parties to it, for the purpose of defrauding a third person, may be attacked by such person in a collateral proceeding, because he has no standing to appeal from it, or to require that it be vacated or reversed.
