(2) That § 1, act of May 23, 1889, providing that each city of the third class subsequently incorporated should constitute a single school district, and § 9, in so far as it provides that existing cities of that class may become single districts by acceptance of the act, were constitutional and valid, and that by <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>accepting said act, the city of Wilkes-Barre became a single school district, so that the electors at large, and not by wards, were entitled, under the act of May 8, 1854, P. L. 617, to elect a board of six school directors at the municipal election in Feb' ruary, 1890. And (3) that such an election having been held, and the persons receiving the certificates of election having duly organized, and it not appearing clearly that there was lack of general knowledge that such a board was to be elected, the six persons so chosen were entitled to act and perform the duties of directors, at least until duly ousted.</p>

The act violates § 1, article XI., of the constitution, vesting the legislative power of the commonwealth in the general assembly, inasmuch as the breath of life comes to the act from the school boards, and not from the legislature. The legislature cannot delegate its power. There are a number of recognized instances in which the legislature may submit to the people of a locality a question as to the executive administration of a law, complete in itself and operative throughout the state, but the act before us, as amended by the court below, is clearly distinguishable from those cases. There is no person, thing or corporation in the state upon which it can operate, except by the affirmative act of school directors in certain cities ; it provides no rule of action as to circumstances actually existing or contingently possible, except by the intervention of a board of school directors who are to say when it shall go into effect; and it is not a law, but merely an invitation to school directors to make a law.

In that case we said: “ When the requirements of the fifty-seventh section are complied with, in any given case of a preexisting city, such city enters into the third class of cities, whose future incorporation has been provided for, and becomes a constituent part thereof. No city is prevented from doing this, and all have the opportunity of doing it. Those that do not embrace the opportunity simply remain as they were before, and all that do embrace it become members of a class whose existence and all the elements of whose government are regulated by general law. There is no possibility of any exercise of the powers or privileges conferred by the fifty-seventh section which can work affirmatively a local or special result. Whatever is done by virtue of this section simply converts that which was, or might be, local or special, into that which is general.” As each city of the third class accepts its provisions, the diversity of city charters is diminished to that extent, and uniformity follows in the proportion that these acceptances are increased, until, as contemplated by the legislature, the municipal government of all such cities shall be the same. The hope that this consummation may be reached is founded in the facts that special legislation, in aid of cities existing by special char<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>ter, is prohibited, and that, in the changing conditions incident to their growth in population and wealth, they will ultimately find their interests best protected in the wise and beneficent provisions of the general system.</p>

    <p id="b439-6" data-blocks='[["BL_439.5",439,[214,945,1174,1483]],["BL_440.1",440,[281,384,1175,352]]]'>The fifth section of the act contained the following proviso: “ Provided that no city of the third class, nor any city of less population than ten thousand inhabitants, heretofore incorporated, shall become subject to the foregoing provisions of <em>this </em>act, until the same are accepted by an ordinance, duly passed by a majority of the members elected to each branch thereof voting in favor of the same, and approved by the mayor.” The effect of this proviso, if the act was constitutional, was, that the act should not apply, unless formally accepted, to any city of the third class, etc., incorporated prior to March 18, 1875, even though that city had already accepted the provisions of the act of May 23,1874, or had in fact been incorporated under that act. In Reading v. Savage (supra) we said: “ As to all those which had been previously incorporated, a double acceptance was made necessary; first, of the provisions of the act of 1874, under the fifty-seventh section of that act, and second, of the provisions of the act of 1875, under the proviso of the fifth section. The proceedings upon acceptance under the two acts are quite dissimilar, and, without a strict conformity to both, no city previously incorporated could have the benefit of the act of 1875. Those cities, which in reality did accept under both acts, would thus in fact become a class by themselves, and that class could only be made up by individual accessions from time to time. But it might very easily happen that only a single city, or at most a few, would adopt the double acceptance made necessary by the act of 1875, and in that event the new class thus created would be limited to that one or those few.” The test, as we said in Frost v. Cherry, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20Pa.%20427" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="122 Pa. 427">122 Pa. 427</a>, “ is not results, but possibilities; ” and, if the act of 1875 had been sustained, <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>It was possible for us to have cities of the third class: (1) by-special charter as before; (2) cities of the third class under the ¡act of 1874; and (8) cities of the third class under the acts of 1874 and 1875. The elective clause in the act of 1874 was sustained, because its exercise necessarily tended to uniformity, whilst a similar clause in the act of 1875 was condemned, because its exercise tended to diversity.</p>
    <p id="b440-6" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[284,746,1171,806]]]'>With this plain and obvious distinction in view, we come to consider the act of May 28, 1889, P. L. 274. It is entitled, “ An act constituting each city of the third class a single school district, providing for the election of its school controllers, the levy and collection of taxes and management of its affairs.” It contains provisions wholly different from those of the act of 1874; it not only changes the provisions contained in the general act, but adds other and entirely new provisions relating to the affairs of the schools, and of the school districts. It applies only to the cities of the third class thereafter incorporated, but in the ninth section it is provided as follows: “ Any city of the third class, now incorporated, may accept and become subject to the provisions of this act by resolutions of the school boards of such city, duly passed by a majority of the members elected in each of such separate districts thereof, voting in favor of the same,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b440-7" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[285,1562,1171,862]],["BL_441.1",441,[218,379,1167,607]]]'>It is plain that this provision is precisely similar, in effect, to the act of 1875, which was passed upon in Scranton School D.’s Appeal (supra) : its tendency is not to uniformity, but to diversity; its results are not general, but special and local. It will be observed that, “ any city of the third class,” incorporated before its passage, whether b}1" special charter or under the general law of 1874, may accept its provisions, and any of such cities may refuse to accept them. Wilkes-Barre is a city of the third class by special charter. The local authorities of the city have not yet accepted the provisions of the act of 1874, but desire to avail themselves of the act of 1889, which is not an amendment to the act of 1874, but an original act. If the act of 1889 is sustained, we are liable to have cities of the third class: (1) by special charter as before; (2) by special charter and under the act of 1889; (8) under the general act of 1874; and (4) under the acts of 1874 and 1889. Another such statute would double these possibilities, and each succeeding simi<a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>lar enactment would double tbe possibilities then existing. This diversity, thus increasing in a geometrical ratio; would result in a confusion and disorder with which the evils of undisguised special legislation cannot be compared. In order to procure special legislation upon any subject relating to the government of cities, it would only be necessary to procure the passage of a law, in general form, with the specific and special features desired, with a provision that it should apply only to such cities as might accept it; and it would be possible, in this form of legislation, for each city of the third class in the state to have, to some extent, its own peculiar’ system, with like effect as if enacted by special law.</p>
    <p id="b441-4" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[219,994,1166,598]]]'>The legislature, in the act of 1874, provided a general system, upon which are found all the cities thereafter incorporated, and upon which are to be put, ultimately, all other cities of the third class, as beads are put upon a string. The system may be strengthened or extended, but it cannot be parted or divided. The loose beads, as they are taken up, must be put upon the string, and not upon one of the strands'of which the string consists. The system, under the constitution, is necessarily an entirety; and the special charter city, in passing upon the acceptance of its provisions, under an elective clause such as is contained in the act of 1874, must decide to take all or none of them.</p>
    <p id="b441-5" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[219,1610,1166,246]]]'>We are of opinion, therefore, that the act of May 23,1889, is in contravention of article III., § 7, of the, constitution of the state, and that upon this ground the entire act is void. In this view of the case, it is unnecessary to consider the act with reference to the other provisions of the constitution referred to.</p>
    <p id="b441-6" data-blocks='[["BL_441.6",441,[217,1865,1169,353]]]'>The effect of this is to take the act of May 23, 1889, out of the case, which disposes of the pretensions of board No. 1, and narrows the controversy to the boards Nos. 2 and 3 ; the former elected upon general ticket, under the school law of 1854, and the latter under the 28th section of the original charter, and claiming to hold over until a new board is lawfully elected and organized.</p>

The repeal, however, it is argued, was “ not to go into effect until from and after the first Monday of June, 1890,” but it <em>was </em>to go into effect then, and it is difficult <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>to see how it could go into effect under the act of 1854, without a proper board of school directors under that act. The effect of the act of May 31,1889, was, undoubtedly, to constitute the city a single school district, under the general law of 1854; but the act was “ not to go into effect” so as to remove the existing boards, or to change or embarrass the operation of the schools, until the end of the current school year. The act contemplated an election of school directors, or controllers, at the spring election of 1890; under a different act, perhaps, but the legislative purpose undoubtedly was that a legally elected and properly constituted board of school directors or controllers would be chosen, to give the act its proper effect at the end of the current year. The act of May 23,1889, having failed in its effect, and the 28th section of the charter having been repealed, the city, in the absence of any other provision, became a single district under the first section of the act of May 8, 1854, and the election, held under the fifth section of that act, provided a competent board with full authority to take charge of the affairs of the school district at the opening of the new year; that board was duly organized, and its members are the respondents in this case.</p>
