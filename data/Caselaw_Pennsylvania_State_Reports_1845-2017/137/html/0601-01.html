We are unable, however, to see that these authorities support the views of the learned counsel, under the facts in the case at bar. Taken together, they rule that the act of 1836 is superseded or supplied by the act of 1870 ; that neither judgment nor execution gives a lien on the franchises and personal property of a corporation, and where such are sold the proceeds of sale must be distributed among all the creditors alike ; that all buildings, lands, works, etc., of a public corporation, such as railroad, canal, turnpike road companies, etc., dedicated to corporate purposes and necessary to the exercise of the franchise, are part of and pass with a sale of the franchise and that a judgment is no lien thereon. Such are some of the leading principles ruled by these authorities.</p>
