This objection will not apply to the Nebraska or the Wisconsin cases, and it will be found on examination of the other cases that the reason of the decision is put on the ground that without specifications to bid on there can be no competitive bidding such as is required to award a contract to the lowest bidder.

Such is not the law in Pennsylvania. The authorities against this ruling are: Kenton v.

It is but lately that a tax-payer’s right to file such a bill as this was settled, but, in the doctrine of the court below allowing an unsuccessful bidder to use a tax-payer’s name for this purpose, we have a new equitable principle. Upon this question the answers can be considered together: Mills v. Gore, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20Pick.%2034" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="20 Pick. 34">20 Pick. 34</a>; Field v.

    <p class="summary" id="b594-6" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[273,1387,1165,754]]]'>3. Neither the charter of the city of Pittsburgh, nor any other law applicable thereto, requires, as a condition precedent to the making of a contract, that specifications of a particular kind of pavement should be prepared prior to advertisement for bids. On the contrary, the act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 230, commits to the city the discretionary power of determining the best mode of receiving bids, and, in the absence of fraud, the courts cannot interfere.' This has been repeatedly decided by this court. The decision of the court below,- that under the act of 1874, this contract was void for want of specifications prepared before the bidding, is the more remarkable, in view of the admitted fact that the mode adopted by the city was the best possible one to secure the widest and fairest competition, and that by following it the city secured a better and cheaper pavement than it could otherwise have done.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b594-7" data-blocks='[["BL_594.5",594,[273,2149,1162,247]],["BL_595.1",595,[232,363,1169,555]]]'>4. The court also held that specifications prior to the bidding, were required by the ordinance of December 17,1887, and that therefore that ordinance rendered this contract void. Two answers suggest themselves: (a) If an ordinance enacted by the city had contained such a requirement, the city could <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>waive it, if an honest benefit was conferred upon the city by such waiver;.but, <em>(i) </em>the ordinance of 1887 manifestly contemplates that the Department of Awards shall have nothing to do with specifications until they meet to let the contract, and that the specifications shall be approved by the department before the contract is let, but not prior to the taking of the bids. An examination of the cases, cited by the court below as ruling that specifications before bidding are conditions precedent to the granting of a contract, will show that all of them, except the Nebraska case, turned on the express requirements of a statute; and in that case the chief justice dissented.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b595-4" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[231,927,1169,962]]]'>5. It is useless, however, to examine the cases cited by the court below, because the present case involves a construction of the act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 230, which has been repeatedly before this court, and it is well settled that the question of the letting of a contract, under that act, is a matter for the discretion of the city, and not of the courts, and that the only question for the latter is that of fraud: Commonwealth v. Mitchell, <a href="/pa/82/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="82 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1047925" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0343-01">82 Pa. 343</a>; Findley v.

To hold that a tax-payer may at any time file a bill, and for a mere irregularity have any contract or ordinance of the city annulled, would be a most mischievous rule, and would open wide the flood-gates of litigation. This has never been the rule in Pennsylvania: Cooley on Taxation, 540, 541, n. 1; Wheeler v.

A subsequent ordinance declares that all contracts shall be awarded after due public notice, as now provided by law, upon such specifications as shall be approved by the Department of Awards. It cannot be doubted that the true intent of the act of 187£, and the ordinances passed in pursuance thereof, regulating the awarding of public contracts, is to secure to the city the benefit and advantage of fair and just competition between bidders, and at <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>the same time close, as far as possible, every avenue to favoritism and fraud in its varied forms.

The advertisement is also silent as to those matters; but it does announce that “plans and specifications can be seen, and blanks for bidding can be had, at this office,” meaning the office of the chief of the Department of Public Works. The bill charges that at no time before bids were received were there any plans or specifications for the work of paving Craig street at the said office, or prepared by any department of the city, or on file, or open to inspection by parties proposing to bid, etc.; and that the said chief of the Department of Public Works refused to exhibit any plans and specifications, and directed such persons to prepare their own specifications to be inclosed with their bids. The answer asserts that there were plans, etc.; that “this plan showed the surface of the street; the street as it had been prepared by grading; the number of square feet of paving to be done; the number of lineal feet of curbing to be done; and the specifications embraced paving with cobble-stone, paving with irregular block-stone, and paving with block-stone. There were no specifications as to what is called asphalt pavement.” It is not alleged that the specifications for stone pavements, above referred to, were special to Craig street. On the contrary, it may be fairly assumed that they were general specifications applicable to all streets. This contention relates to bids for asphalt pavements, and, as to that kind of pavement, the charges in the seventh paragraph of the bill are virtually admitted. We have then, as correctly found by the court below, these facts, viz.: There were no specifications whatever special to Craig street, except the plan showing the surface of the street as it had been prepared by grading, the number of square feet of paving to be done, and the number of linear feet of curbing to be set. As admitted by the answer, “there were no specifications as to what is called an asphalt pavement.” As to that kind of pavement, bidders were directed, as charged in <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>the bill, to prepare their own specifications, and that was accordingly done by each of the bidders. For the kinds of stone pavement for which the answer avers there were plans and specifications in the office, no bids whatever were received.. The contract was awarded to the defendants Booth &amp; Flinn, on their own specifications, for what is called a “ vulcanite asphalt pavement,” a kind of pavement neither called for in the ordinance, nor even hinted at in the advertisement inviting bids. On the contrary, taking the notice in the advertisement, that plans and specifications for paving could be seen, and blanks for bidding could be had at the office, in connection with the averment in the answer that there “ were specifications for three kinds of stone pavement on file in the office,” and no specifications for an asphalt pavement, it follows that proposals for the latter were virtually excluded.</p>
    <p id="b599-4" data-blocks='[["BL_599.4",599,[239,1129,1174,966]]]'>In the face of the facts above referred to, all of which appear in the pleadings, it is idle to contend that the contract in question was regularly awarded in accordance with the charter and ordinances of the city. The charter requires contracts “ to be given to the lowest responsible bidder.” How can there be .a <em>lowest </em>bidder, when parties proposing to bid are instructed to prepare their own specifications and submit them with their respective bids ? The expression, “ lowest bidder,” necessarily implies a common standard by which to measure the respective bids, and that common standard must necessarily be previously prepared specifications of the work to be done, and materials to' be furnished, etc., specifications freely accessible to all who may desire to compete for the contract, and upon which alone their respective bids must be based. The court was therefore clearly right, in pronouncing the contract in question “ illegal, null, and void.” Not a respectable authority can be anywhere found to sustain it as a valid contract, under any system of competitive bidding such as the charter and ordinances of the city of Pittsburgh require.</p>

In the first paragraph of the bill he avers “ that he is a citizen and resident of the city of Pittsburgh, and is a tax-payer of said city, paying annually to said city in taxes, by it lawfully assessed, a large sum of money, to wit, the sum of seven hundred dollars; that he is, <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>and has been for and during all the time of the happening of the things hereinafter complained of, the owner of certain lands lying and being in the fourteenth ward of said city, abutting ■upon the easterly side of Craig street, and extending along and upon said street for a distance of four hundred feet, more or less, between Center Avenue and Bayard street.” These facts, which are admitted by the defendants in their answers to be true, give the plaintiff a standing in court which cannot be successfully challenged by any averments in the answer, such as that “ the bill is not filed in good faith by the plaintiff, but on the contrary thereof he is merely a cover; ” that he represents another paving company, at whose instance the bill was filed* etc. If it appeared that plaintiff was a mere volunteer, without direct personal interest in the controversy, or that he had bought his way into it since the acts complained of occurred, his position would be different, and the authorities relied on by defendants might be invoked with some show of reason; but he avers, and they admit, that he has and is a property owner on the street, and as such liable to be assessed for paving, etc., or liable, in common with the general public, to be taxed to pay for the work; in short, that he has a direct and substantial pecuniary interest in the controversy, and has had from the beginning of the proceedings which resulted in awarding the illegal contract. The right of the plaintiff to maintain the suit cannot be seriously doubted.</p>
    <p id="b600-6" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[258,1641,1169,350]]]'>■ We also agree with the court below that the question of plaintiff’s standing in court should have been raised by plea in the nature of a plea in abatement; but, in whatever form that defence may be interposed, there is nothing in the facts of this case to sustain it. The questions involved are so fully and satisfactorily considered in the opinion of the court below that further elaboration is unnecessary.</p>
