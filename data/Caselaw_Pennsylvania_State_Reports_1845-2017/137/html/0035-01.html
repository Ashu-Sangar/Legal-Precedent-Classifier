Well, you went to live with Smith there, and he said he gave you your choice of rooms ? A. Not then, he didn’t. Q. But when you came to move ? A. Well, he spoke to me once about my choice of rooms, but I proposed to take the room myself. Q. Who fitted it up ? A. Well, I suppose her and him. Q. Well, whose furniture was in the room? A. Why, mine; and she had a couple pieces of carpet; my carpet wouldn’t fit. Q. What else ? A. And a big chair, I think; well, after while I can’t tell what — I don’t know what — my carpet, or the chairs— perhaps the carpet wasn’t gone, but the chairs were taken up stairs. Q. They had taken what chairs up stairs ? A. Why, their own. Q. How long was that after you had moved there ? A. Why it wasn’t very long. Q. What kind of chairs did you <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>have in the room ? A. Why, a couple for me. Q. Who took them out? A. I can’t tell you. Q. Well, did you ever have any conversation with theiii about it, or either of them. A. No, sir; I don’t know that we had any particular conversation. Q. Well, do you know when they took those chairs out? A. And put them up stairs; and I said to Jennie, what did you take the chairs out for ? Well, Q. What did she say ? A. I don’t know what she said, whether she said anything; she was no wajrs talkative, nor I wasn’t; when I had nothing to talk about; and so — well, she set there — it was after breakfast, I think, she set there — now here’s the important point, she set there with her elbow on the side of the chair or table, I can’t tell you which, but this way, and I want you to understand, and she said to me, “ I want you to understand that I am boss here,” she said. Q. She said that she wanted you to understand that she was boss there ? A. Well, I didn’t say no; after a bit I repeated it to Laura Smith. Q. You told Laura about it? A. Yes, sir. Q. Whát did he say? A. Well, he spoke an ugly word. Q. Well, what was that? A. Well, I can’t tell you. Q. What kind of a word ? A. Well, kind of a swear; and here — what was I going to say? I was going to say, I am getting forgetful. Well she repeated and said this, — Laura didn’t say, I don’t think he did— Q. Well, what was it? A. Well, she said that there was some wonderful thing going to happen here. Well, I said nothing. I didn’t know what it was even, and just before this she had-cut my shoe, and thinks I, the next thing will be my throat. I just thought of that and that’s what started me to move. As God is my father and judge this is the truth. Q. Well, how was Jennie towards you, was she kind and considerate, did she treat you right? A. Well, she supposed so. She is an ignorant woman, and I suppose she done the best she could; I can’t compare her to anything else. There is some people in this latter day professes to be intelligent, and yet they don’t know their duty to an old person. Q. Well, how did Laura treat you while you were staying there with them ? A. Well; only sometimes he would take a spurt in ugliness; have his bad words you know. He was just middling. He done the best, I suppose, he knew how..... Q. Well now, just state briefly why you left Laura and his wife ? A. Why it was this here cutting of the shoe and the <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>expression that she made. You know I said just a bit ago that she said that “ there is going to be dreadful things here.” Well, thinks I, what in the world — she never explained things very fully, and when she said that, the shoe was cut, and I thought my throat would go next.

She selected her rooms in the house. They were comfortably fitted up for her, partly with her own furniture which she had before, and partly with furniture procured by defendant. She remained there as a member of the family until the following September, and then left without assigning any satisfactory cause for so doing.</p>

Mrs. Sarah Smith, the old lady who conveyed the property to plaintiff, was his main witness; and, assuming her testimony to be true, there is nothing in it to justify her in rescinding the contract she made with the defendant, and on the faith of which he expended money in the improvement of the property. The witness was ninety years old, and testified in a rambling and incoherent manner, such as might he expected of one of her advanced years. In answer to the question, “ How did the defendant treat you while you were staying with them?-” her answer was: “Well; only sometimes he would take a spurt in ugliness; have a bad word, you know. He was just middling. I suppose he done the best he knew how.” Again; in answer to the question whether defendant’s wife abused her, she said: “ Oh, no, not particularly, any more than she wasn’t very much of a talker of a woman, nor she didn’t quarrel, nor nothing of the kind.” Again, in answer to the question whether the defendant offered to strike her, her reply was: “ Oh, no.

In view of the insufficiency of plaintiff’s rebutting testimony, the court, in defendant’s first point for charge, was requested to instruct the jury “ that the plaintiff has shown no facts which would justify Sarah Smith in rescinding the contract contained in her will, and therefore he cannot recover.” We think this point should have heen affirmed. The plaintiff was certainly in no better position than Mrs. Smith would have been, if she had brought the action herself without having conveyed the property. The case may be regarded as a close one, but, on a careful review of the evidence, we are of opinion that it should not have been submitted to the jury.</p>
