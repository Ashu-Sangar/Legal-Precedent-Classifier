[If there was such a contract, and, as we have instructed you, such a relation entered into between these parties that the-company by suit could have compelled Mr. Long to pay that premium, and he, in pursuance of the arrangement, made with the agents of the company, was to have until the tenth of December, 1887, to pay that premium, and within that time sent his check to either member of the firm, it makes no difference whether it was drawn in the name of the firm or not, if it was received by either member of the firm; and if on or before the tenth of December, 1887, he tendered them the money, the-company would be bound to pay for this loss.] 11.....</p>

Mead &amp; Co., agents of the defendant company, had charged the premium on the policy in question to A. A. Long, and had also credited the premium on their account with the defendant company, in view of the explanation made by Mead &amp; Co. of the mode of conducting their business, and charging and crediting policies not accepted by the assured, is not of itself. sufficient to make out a contract of insurance-between the plaintiff and the defendant company.</p>

Mead &amp; Co., in relation to this matter, which shows any contract relation or insurance to have existed between the plaintiff and the defendant company, if the jury believe the-explanation of the mode of keeping the accounts, as made by J. -H.

It is now well-settled law in Pennsylvania <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>that if an insurance company keep an account with their agents, bj7' which they charge their agents with policies put into their hands, and make them debtor to the company for the premium, and the agents in turn issue those policies to other persons, and give credit to those persons, or time in which to pay the premium, and a loss occurs, the company is liable for that loss, although the premium may not have been actually paid until after the loss. The company could not then refuse to accept the premium and refuse to carry out the contract. You are to consider these books, with the explanation given by the agents who kept them, as to their manner and purpose in keeping them as they did, as bearing upon the question of a contract in this case. . The books do not of themselves make out a contract of insurance, but are simply evidence for the consideration of the jury.6</p>

That under the terms of the policy claimed on in this case, it was necessary for the plaintiff to have paid the premium thereon, in order to complete a binding contract, in the absence of proof that such payment was waived by the agents and a contract was made and concluded by which he was to have a stipulated time wherein to pay the premium, and the policy considered delivered.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b381-6" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[254,1502,1169,698]]]'>Answer: If I understand the point, I affirm it. But fearing that my understanding may not be as it is drawn, I say this : That the agent who wrote the policy had the power to waive the prepayment of the premium, and if the jury find that there was such an actual waiver of the prepayment of the premium, then the contract, if there was one, would be valid and binding without an actual prepayment of the premium. So far as considering the “policy delivered,” as mentioned in this point, I instruct you that it is not necessary that the policy itself should have actually been delivered over to Mr. Long. If he chose, he may have left it with the agents of the company. If such a contract as I have mentioned was made, its validity and force did not depend upon the actual delivery of the policy to him.6</p>

Roll Bloom, who delivered the envelope containing the letter of Long to Rorabaugh, obtained by him from the postmaster at Olanta, as stated by W. J. Owens, postmaster, with the post-mark on it, and the effort to create the appearance that the letter containing this check had passed through the regular course of the mail, as if dated and mailed on the 26th of November, before the fire; these facts, if believed, are evidences of bad faith on the part of the plaintiff, and should be taken as evidence against him.</p>

There is not a scintilla of evidence in the case, tending to show that any contract was made, outside the testimony of the plaintiff himself, and that testimony clearly shows that when the agents offered him credit, he refused to take the policy. According to his own statement, the strongest expression he <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>used, was, “ I suppose I can have thirty days to remit for the policy.” This was not an agreement to take it, and would not have been sufficient, in the face of the fact that he declined to accept the policy on credit, to enable the company to maintain an action against him for the premium. His language about carrying his own insurance shows the truth of our contention that he declined to accept the policy because he was objecting to the rate.</p>

Moreover, his conduct in the matter of antedating the check and fraudulently arranging to make it appear that it was mailed prior to the fire, is sufficient to convince any unbiased mind that there was no contract between him and the company. He asserted that Rorabaugh encouraged him to antedate the check. This Rorabaugh denied. But suppose the agent did collude with him to defraud the company; this could create no liability on the part of the company, and could confer no advantage on the plaintiff: Smith v.

We submit that such a contract was not established.

A conspiracy between them was sufficiently established, and the acts and declarations of Bloom in perpetrating the fraud were just as binding on Long as if the latter had been present. That the conduct of Long in the matter of the check was evidence of bad faith, and evidence against him on the question whether a contract existed, is too clear for argument. Our third point, therefore, should have been affirmed without qualification.

If the assured made himself liable for the premium, the company was liable on the policy. Hence, the inquiry whether the agents would have used the check for the premium, if no fire had occurred, was pertinent, as throwing light upon whether <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>they did not consider him bound for the payment of the premium. The ruling excluding declarations of Bloom, made in the absence of Long, was right, because there was no proof or offer of proof that Long authorized the declarations, or that they were within the scope of any agency: Irvine v. Buckaloe, 12 S. &amp; R. 35 ; and because the offer was not sufficiently specific to make the competency and materiality of the excluded declarations apparent.

This policy expired on the first of November, 1887, and, prior to that time, the company, through its agents at Curwensville, informed him by letter that the insurance would be renewed if he did not give notice to the contrary. As he did not give any notice of a desire to terminate the insurance, the policy in suit was issued by the company and forwarded to its agents, who charged the premium to him, and in their account with the company charged themselves with it. Whether these charges were made before their interview with him on the eighth of November, the testimony does not inform us; but we learn from it that their <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>custom was to carry policies thirty clays or more, if requested by the assured, in which case he became their debtor for the amount of the premium, and the company accepted them as its debtor for it. In their former transactions with Long, he was allowed thirty days in which to pay the premium, and his policjr remained with them ; but it was mutually understood that it was in force for the term described therein, as effectually as if he had paid the premium upon it and taken it away. It was on this understanding that the credit was sought and granted, and that the premium was subsequently paid and received. In view of their custom, and previous dealings with the appellee, their possession of the policy in suit and the nonpayment of the premium thereon were consistent with a contract of insurance and his claim that he was their debtor for the premium and they were keeping the policy for him.</p>

They admit that but for the fire they would have accepted the premium from him at any time on or before that day. The fire occurred on the 26th of November, and on the 28th they received his check for the premium and held it until the twelfth of December, without intimating to him that it was not satisfactory. Upon their books this premium was charged to him under date of November first, and credited under date of December 9th, and in their account with the company a corresponding charge and credit appear. These credits were entered after the fire and by the direction of special agent Piper, who was charged with the duty of investigating the claim in dispute.</p>

The question was designed to test the accuracy of his previous statement, and his intelligence and integrity touching the matters under investigation, and we are not prepared to say that it exceeded the limits of a proper cross-examination.</p>
    <p id="b387-6" data-blocks='[["BL_387.5",387,[238,1089,1169,403]]]'>There is no error in the ruling on the offer of evidence contained in the third specification. It did not appear, and the offer did not propose to show, that Bloom was acting for Long or by his authority in obtaining the stamped envelopes. But if he had been so acting, and the appellant desired to prove his declarations, the offer should have embraced at least the substance of them, that the court might judge of their relevancy and materiality: Williams v. Williams, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20Pa.%20312" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="84 Pa. 312">84 Pa. 312</a>.</p>
    <p id="b387-7" data-blocks='[["BL_387.6",387,[237,1502,1170,392]]]'>The remaining specifications do not require separate consideration. The answers to the appellant’s points in relation to the delivery of the policy, the antedating of the check, and the explanation of the book entries, were fair, full, and correct, and, as it is admitted that there was a tender of the premium on the tenth of December, it is profitless to inquire whether the receipt and retention of the check were the equivalent of it.</p>
    <p id="b387-8" data-blocks='[["BL_387.7",387,[882,1913,479,42]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
