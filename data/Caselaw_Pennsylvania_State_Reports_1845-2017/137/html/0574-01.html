Penn. R. Co. v. Johnston, supra. The judgment against the railroad company was for damages by the defendant for entering and occupying plaintiff’s land. It was not a lien in the ordinary sense, to be divested on the sale on the mortgage. Indeed, the defendant company had no estate in the land to be bound by a judgment in the usual way. The title was still in the plaintiff; the judgment was damages for occupation. This position results from the reasoning of Justice Agnew in the Johnston case cited. While it is true, that case was a scire facias on a judgment for damages against the original Northwestern Railroad Company, assessed under •the statutory proceeding, to revive the judgment against the West. Penn, company, successor to the Northwestern company, ■yet it was damages for occupation, practically the same as a judgment in trespass; except in the former damages were for past and prospective occupation, while in the latter they are for the past, or for damages already incurred alone. The plaintiff never having parted with her rights, shall not be deprived of the use of her property without compensation. “ If the original occupant has so managed his card as to escape payment until it has divested its_elf of its interest by any form of alienation, its alienee, mediate or immediate, if it would enjoy the uncompensated right, must pay the price of it.” So spoke the Supreme Court in the Johnston case mentioned.</p>

What could be clearer ? The undoubted intention was to make these damage claims part of the purchase money. The terms of the contract of purchase made the purchaser liable for such claims as the plaintiff makes, not because of any statutory or common-law right of lien, but as part of the contract of purchase.

To support this position, the case of Lawrence’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=78%20Pa.%20369" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="78 Pa. 369">78 Pa. 369</a>, is cited. This case is not so regarded by the court. By reference to its facts, recited on page 367, the owner of the land released the railroad company from all claims, damages, etc., by reason of their entering upon and taking the land, etc. The Supreme Court says: “ The release operated not by way ■of an original conveyance but by way of a discharge from damages incurred.” The paper of May 13,1887, does not purport to be a release of all antecedent damage, but a grant of “the free and uninterrupted use of the right of way and passage to the railroad company over and across plaintiff’s lands, for one hundred feet long and forty feet wide, as the railroad is now located.” The consideration paid is $200. It must be borne in mind, at this date the plaintiff had judgment against the defendant company for previous trespasses, for $1,100 and costs. No reference appears, in the agreement, to that judgment, nor anything in it to indicate the plaintiff was extinguishing it for $200, about one sixth of its amount. The reasonable construction, in view of all the surroundings, about this agreement, is, <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>that the plaintiff was giving a present grant of right of way for the future, without reference to past occurrences.</p>

Ejectment or trespass will lie by the landowner in such case. But he may waive his constitutional right to oust the trespasser, and proceed for compensation under the statute. This, being made, diveste his title and vests an easement in the company, leaving such company trespasser liable only for the prior trespass. The owner’s right, as stated, for the trespass, is a vested right of which he cannot be deprived. But as to that use which is yet to come, the legal remedy for appropriation and compensation may be pursued by either 'party: McClinton v. Railway Co., <a href="/citations/?q=66%20Pa.%20407" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="66 Pa. 407">66 Pa. 407</a>. If, instead of presenting a petition for assessment of damages, under the statute, the parties agreed amicably, this would be a substitute for such petition.

    <p class="author" id="Ah_" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[480,738,487,33]]]'>Mr. Justice Mitchell:</p>
    <p id="b621-6" data-blocks='[["BL_621.6",621,[235,788,1176,764]]]'>The plaintiff’s statement is defective in not exhibiting the full record of the suit in the Circuit Court of the United States, on which the right to recover against the present defendant depends. The procedure act of 1887, in express terms, requires the statement to be accompanied by copies of all notes, contracts, etc., and the excepted cases where “particular reference” to records is sufficient, are confined to records in the county where suit is brought. The importance of such copies is well exemplified in the present case. The decree of the Circuit Court requires the purchaser at the sale to take subject to “ all unpaid purchase money for any of the lands or rights of way herein referred to.” What are so referred to, we can only conjecture. Por all that appears in the statement, they may be specially described lands and rights of way of which plaintiff’s is not one.</p>
    <p id="b621-7" data-blocks='[["BL_621.7",621,[233,1560,1176,601]]]'>But, irrespective of the incompleteness of the statement, it discloses no cause of action. The claim is made against one corporation, on a judgment against another. What is the basis of liability? Not a lien on land, for as to the particular land in question it was and is the plaintiff’s own, and the Pittsburgh <em>&amp; </em>Western Railroad Company had no title on which a lien could fasten : and, as to any other land of the Pittsburgh &amp; Western Railroad Company which the judgment might have grasped, the lien was discharged by the sale. It is plain, therefore, that the present defendant is only liable, if at all, by the decree of the Circuit Court, and the terms of the sale under which its title accrued.</p>
    <p id="b621-8" data-blocks='[["BL_621.8",621,[235,2179,1174,248]],["BL_622.1",622,[244,373,1181,1885]]]'>It is not necessary to discuss the authority of the Circuit Court to impose the terms it did as to the sale. The purchaser, and those in privity with him, are in no position to question the terms which they agreed to when they bought. But the decree was out of the usual course of judicial sale, and in deroga<a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>tion of the general principle that purchasers at such sales take the land, discharged, or subject only to such known and ascertainable liens as are expressly preserved. We must therefore examine the decree to see that its effect is not pushed beyond its intended limits. The language is, “ any purchaser..... shall take.....subject to all unpaid purchase money for any of the lands or rights of way herein referred to, as well as also all unpaid claims of landowners for damages for property taken, injured, or destroyed in the construction of the railroad,” etc. All that is included in this language is what is commonly known as land damages, to wit, compensation to the owners of the land over or along which the railroad is constructed, for the injury to their land by such construction, and the right of action is given in the words of the constitution to all owners of land, for “ property taken, injured, or destroyed by the construction.” Such damages form a well-known class, having certain features peculiar to themselves, such as express protection by name in the constitution, exemption from ordinary statutes of limitation, etc. This is the class of claims which the decree imposes upon the purchaser. It is not said that he shall take subject to the debts or judgments of the old company generally, as for goods furnished or services rendered, or for negligence or trespasses, but only for the particular class of obligations clearly indicated. The claim of the plaintiff is for a debt of the old company on a general judgment for damages by trespass. It is on the same legal footing as to the purchaser, the present defendant, as a judgment for damages for burning plaintiff’s bam, or running over his cattle. It is not in any legal sense for land taken, or right of way acquired. The plaintiff’s claim for compensation, in that regard, was the same after this judgment as before. It is this feature which distinguishes the present case from West. Penn. R. Co. v. Johnston, <a href="/pa/59/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="59 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="426955" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0290-01">59 Pa. 290</a>, and Buffalo etc. R. Co. v.

Those were cases of damages for land taken in the construction of the railroad, and in the former the charter of the defendant expressly made such damages a perpetual lien until paid.</p>

Even if this conclusion were doubtful upon the terms of the decree, which we do not regard it, it would be made clear by the fact set forth in the affidavit of defence, that the plaintiff granted the right of way to the Pittsburgh &amp; Western Railroad Company, after the judgment for the trespass and before the sale. It is true the agreement did not, so far as appears here, release the damages for the previous trespass of the defendant in the judgment. That claim still remained good against the trespasser. But it severed the past trespass from the future lawful occupation, and gave the old company an unquestionable title to a right of way, to which the purchaser succeeded. At the time of the sale, therefore, the plaintiff had no claim for any “unpaid purchase money, or right of way,” and no right of action to which the purchaser became subject.</p>
