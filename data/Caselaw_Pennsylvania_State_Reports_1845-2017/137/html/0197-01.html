A sample is “ a portion of the goods to be sold, fairly taken from the hulk, ” and that term is inaccurately used in the affidavit, as the substance of the allegation is that certain goods were ordered by description, that is, the defendant showed to the plaintiff certain goods, and ordered certain other goods to be of the same description. The affidavit describes neither the goods shown to the plaintiffs, nor the goods received by the defendant under his order. Nor does it aver an agreement or warranty that the goods ordered should correspond with those shown. Whatever is not stated in an affidavit of defence is taken not to exist: Lordv.

But if the defendant had properly alleged a warranty, the affidavit would still remain wholly frivolous and evasive, as, when it comes to state the breach of warranty, it does not deal in facts, hut merely in adjectives and opinions.

Moreover, the affidavit fails to state properly the damages alleged to have been suffered. They are averred simpty as a general statement of results, from unstated facts and unnamed conclusions of law. As the defendant nowhere denies getting and keeping the goods, he is bound, in any case, to pay what they were worth, notwithstanding their defects. His affidavit is an attempt to usurp the court’s function of determining the law on facts stated, and is insufficient: Stitt v.

      <em>Mr. Josiah R. </em>Adams, for the appellee:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b236-7" data-blocks='[["BL_236.5",236,[264,1241,1166,554]]]'>1. While the strict legal definition of sale by sample is in accordance with the plaintiffs’ contention, among the ordinary significations of the word sample are: “ specimen, example, illustration.” An affidavit is not defective because of omitting to use words in a technical sense. It is enough if they are used with their ordinary conventional significance. There is nothing in the act of April 13,1887, P. L. 21, which provides that there shall be an implied warranty in all sales by sample, unless otherwise agreed, to limit the use of the word sample; and, according to the plain meaning of the act, the warranty arises, whether the sample was shown by the vendor or by the vendee.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b236-8" data-blocks='[["BL_236.6",236,[264,1802,1163,544]]]'>2. It is impossible to tell from a casual inspection of yarn, when delivered, whether it comes up to the sample on which it has been ordered. That can be told only by the use of the yarn after it is put in course of manufacture. As to what makes yarn poor and unfit for use, there is no standard in words that can be applied. Inferior yarn makes poor goods, and the affidavit distinctly says that the defendant’s loss was incurred by reason of the poor yarn in the cloth manufactured therefrom. No other test can be suggested; nor could this test be averred or applied in more emphatic words than have been used in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b236-9" data-blocks='[["BL_236.7",236,[308,2365,1119,32]],["BL_237.1",237,[251,378,1168,760]]]'>3. That the amount of the defendant’s loss is not stated in <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>figures is unimportant, inasmuch as it is averred to be in excess of the plaintiffs’ claim. In the ordinary case, when the damages claimed are less than the bill sued for, there is necessity for an exact statement. And it is no argument to say that the defendant kept the yarn and did not offer to return it. It would be impossible for him to do so. The quality of the yarn could not be ascertained until it was manufactured into goods, and the goods placed on the market. The goods manufactured and sold by the defendant, and not paid for because of the poor quality of the yarn, represent not only the value of the yarn, but that of other materials, labor, rent, etc. The yarn was not only worth nothing to the defendant, but was destructive of his entire product. On an appeal of this kind there can be a reversal only for a clear case of error in law: Griffith v. Sitgreaves, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20378" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="81* Pa. 378">81* Pa. 378</a>.</p>

It is to be noted that neither the quantity, market price, or quality of the yarn purchased or of the yarn delivered, is stated in the affidavit. It contains, in general terms, a suggestion of a loss of custom and a cancellation of contracts, as a result of a breach of warranty, but it is clearly deficient in the statement of specific facts on which to rest the legal conclusions invoked. It does not allege that the plaintiffs were manufacturers of yarn, that the defendant was a manufacturer of cloth, or that the former knew for what purpose the yarn was purchased by the latter. Its inferences and conclusions are not authorized by its facts. There is nothing in it on which to ground a claim for damages, embracing loss of custom or a cancellation of contracts.</p>

In an action for the price of the goods, the purchaser may interpose this difference as a defence pro tanto. If an affidavit of defence is required, it should contain a clear and concise statement of the facts which constitute a basis for an assessment of the damages under the legal rule by which they are measured. All the elements of a defence should appear with reasonable certainty in the affidavit, and, if any fact essential to complete the defence is omitted, the affidavit is insufficient. In the present action, the defendant alleges that he has sustained great loss by reason of claims made on him by his customers, and their cancellation of contracts with him, because of the low grade and inferior quality of the yarn; but he has not stated a single fact which would make these matters proper items of damage on a breach of the warranty. An affidavit so vague and evasive, and so radically wrong in its conclusions, upon the few facts it contains, cannot be approved. In the absence of an averment to the contrary, it is fair to presume that the yarn was inspected by the purchaser when he received it, and that he then, knew its grade and quality, and made no complaint as to either.</p>
