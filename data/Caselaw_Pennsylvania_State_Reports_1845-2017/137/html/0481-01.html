Solvent means, literally, paying; and we hold, notwithstanding the fact that defendant was in the hands of receivers, that it was, within the meaning and intent of the act, solvent as to so much of its indebtedness as it actually paid, and this objection cannot, therefore, be sustained. It is further claimed that defendant is not liable for any part of the amount charged in the settlement, for the reason that no interest on any part of its indebtedness was paid directly by it; that the only interest paid during 1886 was paid by its receivers, and that the defendant cannot be charged with tax in respect to such payment.

We think this claim is valid. The act requires the tax to be retained by the treasurer of each private corporation, upon the payment of any interest; and, no interest having been paid by the treasurer of defendant or its receivers, we are unable to see how defendant, or any one on its behalf, could have retained the tax, and, as to this portion of its indebtedness, we think defendant was in 1886 insolvent.

The tax is upon the creditor in respect of the indebtedness, and the source to which the state looks for the tax is the interest due and paid.

Hence, the stockholders are not liable for the non-collection of this tax, as they were in no way responsible therefor. It is argued, however, that the company is liable, because, having received its property back from the receivers, it has gotten the benefit of the payment by them of the interest. Such a conclusion does not legally or logically follow. The law will not impose a retroactive penalty for failure to do that which was impossible. The tax becomes a liability of the company only if the company could lawfully have collected It from the bondholders.</p>

This loan tax is an ad valorem tax, and as such requires a lawful assessment: Cooley on Taxation, 238. The act of June 30,1885, P. L. 194, did not create a new tax on corporate loans, but simply provided more efficient machinery for their taxation: Commonwealth v. Canal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=123%20Pa.%20617" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="123 Pa. 617">123 Pa. 617</a>; Commonwealth v.

Canal Co., supra, distinguish it from a specific tax, in that it requires an assessment by a duly authorized officer. It is beyond controversy that the bonds described in § 4 of the act of 1885 are subjected to an ad valorem tax by § 1, and are merely sub-classified for the application of a different method of assessment and collection. In this case, there was no assessment, and the only person authorized to make one had no opportunity to do so. Moreover, under the provisions of the act, the tax on the bonds of an insolvent corporation must be held to have been collected through the county officials.</p>

The company is not liable for the tax on bonds the coupons of which were purchased by the receivers of the railroad company. The amount expended in their purchase is an acknowledged indebtedness of the defendant, represented by a book-account. The money paid from time to time by the defendant to the railroad company has never canceled any portion of the sum expended in their purchase. The question whether a particular transaction was a payment or a purchase of the coupons, is one of fact rather than of law: Jones on Corporate Bonds and Mort<a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>gages, § 253; Ketchum v.

The defendant did not pay any part of the interest represented by these coupons to the railroad company nor to any one else, and as, under the act of 1885, it could not have collected any tax from interest which it did not pay, nothing can be recovered from it in this case as tax upon these bonds.</p>

The interest coupons paid by the receivers of the railroad company, in pursuance of that company’s guaranty, have been credited to the railroad company by the defendant, and have become a matter of book-account between the two companies. For the purposes of the taxing statute this amounts to a payment of the interest by the defendant to the railroad company. In view of the ownership and management of the coal and iron company by the railroad company, the fact that the balance of the account has been largely in favor of the latter, is immaterial. As the railroad company was credited with the amount of the coupons, without deduction for the tax, it should be inferred that the defendant has assumed the payment of the tax to the commonwealth.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-8" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[269,1576,1167,749]]]'>2. The defendant is liable for the tax on the bonds upon which its own receivers paid interest.

It is conceded that the tax is not a personal tax upon the corporation, but the corporation is the collector of a tax upon the bondholders, acting through its proper officer or agent. The term treasurer, in § 4, act of June 30, 1885, P. L. 194, applies to the person by whose hand the money is paid for the debtor corporation. That the corporation may designate that person by some other name than treasurer, or that the law, on taking possession of the corporation, may substitute some other person to discharge his functions, does not defeat the statute. The interest was paid in this instance with the money of the defendant, and the fact that such money was in the nominal control of the receivers, is immaterial.</p>

Acting in the dual capacity of treasurer for both the company and its receivers, his duty was plain and clear, and, failing in the discharge of that duty, the company is liable for his default. The receivers were not the proper persons to assess the taxes, and, of course, they were not responsible personally for any failure in this respect; it was the treasurer’s duty to assess the tax, and the responsibility rested upon the company, whose treasurer he was.

This, however, he failed to do, and for this failure the company is responsible. In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, on payment of the tax the coal and iron company would have been entitled to a credit pro tanto in the account, but would in any event be liable to the state, whether any agreement existed as alleged Qr not.
