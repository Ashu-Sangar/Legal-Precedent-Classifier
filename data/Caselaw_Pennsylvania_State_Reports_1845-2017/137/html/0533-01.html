L. 211, with authority to construct a street railway upon certain specified streets in the city of Pittsburgh ; that the Larimer Street Railway Company, one of the defendants, pretended to be a company incorporated under the same act on November 20,1889, to build a street railway upon certain streets in part the same that were covered by the plaintiff’s charter; that in violation of the provisions of § 52, act of May 16, 1889, P.

      <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>The plaintiff companies have the older charters. They applied to the city for its consent to their entering and constructing their railways, but were refused. The defendant companies, against their protest, obtained consent by special ordinances. Although the plaintiff companies cannot enter the city without its consent, and that consent has been refused, yet I think, by virtue of their prior franchise, they have a standing in court to contest any illegal acts of the city, or other companies, which would utterly destroy their franchise rights. The question then, I think, is this : Has the city been guilty of illegal acts in refusing consent to the plaintiffs and granting it to defendants ? In other words, has the city no discretion in the matter, — must it admit the first company chartered, or refuse all?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b572-6" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[254,1019,1167,907]]]'>These companies derive all their powers from the state. But under the constitution and the acts of assembly creating them, they cannot enter the city or move a step inside the city limits, in the exercise of their franchise rights, without the consent of the local authorities; that is, the city councils. That consent is a condition precedent to the exercise of any franchise right, and was written on the face of their charters when they obtained them. The right to consent or refuse is given to the city by the constitution. It is an absolute, unlimited, unqualified right, which may be exercised arbitrarily, with or without reason, and which the legislature cannot take away, and no court has power to coerce. We cannot, therefore, compel the city, either directly or indirectly, to give consent to the plaintiff companies, and without that consent they canuot lay a rail in the city. The question, then, is narrowed down to this: Are the plaintiffs entitled to injunctions to restrain the defendants from proceeding t*&gt; lay their tracks,* with the consent and under the ordinances of the city ?</p>

The proposition on which plaintiffs rely may be thus stated: That the consent of the city can only be given by general ordinance, and then the company having the prior charter has the prior right. As a corollary to this, the defendants, having consent only by a special ordinance, have no consent, and are, therefore, proceeding illegally.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b573-7" data-blocks='[["BL_573.6",573,[233,1386,1168,909]]]'>That section, no doubt, applies to street railways, as well as all other corporations using or occupying the streets for any purpose, either permanently or temporarily; also, to individuals and firms occupying portions of streets for business or building purposes. The leading and controlling idea is, that all of a class shall stand upon an equality ; there shall be no partiality, no favors bestowed, and no limitations, conditions or burdens imposed upon one, not upon all. It has no reference to granting consent to one, or authorizing one to do something which can only be granted to one. That cannot be done by general ordinance, but must be particular or special. That is fairly implied in the second sentence of the section, which refers to “ authorizing or permitting ” any person or corporation to use any street, etc. A general ordinance prescribes the “ regulations ” for all street railways in tbe city. But when new lines are formed and new streets are to be occupied, the consent of the city must be obtained, and that can be obtained only by a special ordinance referring to the company and the streets.</p>

True, it may, but this is not to be presumed. There may be as great evils from denying this choice. If the company that gets the first charter for a short street can prevent any other company from getting the city’s consent, it may stop a through or competing line of more rapid transit and far more advantageous to the public, or demand an exorbitant price for its charter. There might be a dozen such companies, each preempting a certain street, important links in a long through route, and each demanding its price to get out of the way. Is the city, and the public, powerless in such a case ? When two or more companies desire to occupy certain streets, but differing in routes, termini, motive power, etc., the city ought to have a discretion to accept the one which would be of the greatest public advantage.</p>

L. 211, the plaintiff company was authorized to construct and operate a railway upon the streets in controversy, and therefore the subsequent charter of the defendant, the Larimer Street Railway Company, granted under the same act, cannot authorize it to construct a railway on the streets named in the plaintiff’s charter, as the act does not permit the incorporation of a company for any purpose except to build and operate a railway on streets “upon which no track is laid or authorized to <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>be laid or extended under any existing charter.” The defendants contend that because the plaintiff had not obtained the consent of the local authorities to the construction- of its railway, the laying of the same upon these streets was not authorized on November 20,1889. This position assumes that the authority to construct springs from the consent of the municipality; whereas, it is well settled that the authority for such an occupation of a highway is a franchise which can come only from the state, and which the municipality cannot confer: Covington St. Ry.

We are not unwilling, however, to discuss the right of the Larimer Street Railway Company, and in support of it we produce a complete title, viz., letters patent from the state granting the franchise, and the formal consent of the city to the construction of the railway, expressed by general ordinance prescribing regulations, and by the so-called special ordinances. The plaintiff replies: (a) that the city had no power to pass the special ordinances; and (5) that an exclusive right to these streets is vested in it, whether the city ever consents to their occupation by it or not, and <em>(c) </em>that they cannot be used by another company without its consent. If these startling propositions are unsound, the plaintiff’s case necessarily falls. The provisions in the constitution and in the street railway act of 1889, requiring the consent of the local authorities, are a distinct limitation upon the power of the company, distinctly pointing to an application for such consent by each particular company, and saying in so many words that unless this is procured the railway shall not be constructed. Until it is procured, the charter is worthless, and no track'is “authorized to <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>be laid.” If § 52 of the street act of May 16, 1889, P.

The capital stock is $18,000, and it is set forth in the affidavit, attached to the articles, that ten per cent of this amount has been paid in, and that it is the intention of the corporators, in good faith, to construct, and to maintain and operate the road.

On the 13th December, 1889, and again on the 28th February, 1890, the local authorities of the city of Pittsburgh, by ordinance having special and particular reference to the Larimer Street Railway Company, gave their consent and granted to that company by name, its successors, lessees, and assigns, the right to enter upon, use, and occupy the streets and avenues mentioned; and the company thereupon undertook and were about to enter on the construction of their road, when this bill was filed, praying for an injunction restraining the Larimer Street Railway Company, and the Duquesne Traction Company, their lessees, from constructing or operating a railway on the streets named, and enjoining the city of Pittsburgh from any and all interference with the complainants, in the construction and operation and maintenance of their road. The prayer for a preliminary injunction in the court below was denied, and it is from that decree the present appeal was entered.

The appellants’ contention is, that the ordinance is in conflict with this section of the constitution ; that the state cannot grant legislative powers which it does not itself possess. The restrictions upon the legislative power of the state, they say, rest equally upon all the agencies of the government created by the state ; that, as the legislature cannot transcend the powers conferred by the constitution, so a corporation, which exists by express grant of the legislature, is hound by that supreme law which limits the power creating it; and, hence, that all ordinances impairing the obligation of contracts, all ex post facto laws or ordinances, and all bylaws of a corporation, inconsistent with the constitution of the state, or of the United States, are void. Upon the same ground, it is contended that all special enactments of the municipal corporation, granting to any corporation, association or individual, any special or exclusive privilege or immunity or to any corporation, association or individual, the right to lay down a railroad track, is necessarily void, as a special law, and is in conflict with the constitution of the state.</p>

The power of the city to make such special grant was claimed to exist under the provisions of the act of April 16, 1838, P. L.

This court held, however, in affirming the judgments entered in the court below, that whilst the power of councils, by general ordinance, was undoubted, these special grants were unlawful, and therefore void; in neither case was it suggested, or supposed, that the special grant might be construed to have general effect. In no case has a local or special law been held to have general effect, simply because <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>the legislative body enacting it had power over the subject only by general law, or because the grant or right should have enured to the benefit of a person different from the person named in the grant.

The charter gave the company a legal existence, clothed it with corporate power, placing it in a position to undertake the purposes for which it was organized, and to solicit the privilege of entering upon the streets in question to construct their road; but their right so to do was expressly conditioned upon the action of the councils to that effect. Until they obtain that right, they cannot be said to suffer any special damage or irreparable injury, which would call for the intervention of equity; for, as we have said, although the appellees may, perhaps, have no right, it is clear that the complainants have none. What has been said, therefore, as to the invalidity of the ordinances of 13th of December, 1889, and 28th February, 1890, and as to the application and effect of § 52 of the act of <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>1889, is wholly irrelevant and without effect in this case; these ■questions can only arise when they are presented by a proper party.
