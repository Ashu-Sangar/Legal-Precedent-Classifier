If the plaintiff was guilty of any negligence herself, which contributed to the injury, she cannot recover. [Where a person in going along a public highway knows of a defect and knowing it undertakes to cross, or pass along, and receives an injury, he cannot recover. In other words, a person, knowing a place to be dangerous, must exercise a greater amount of care in passing along than if he did not know of any such dangerous place. <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>Now, whether Mrs. Readdy knew of the condition of the pavement or sidewalk, at the place where she received the injury, or not, I leave to you to determine. The only evidence that I recollect of on that subject is the testimony of Mrs. Readdy herself, who stated, you will recollect, that she did not know of this offset or defect in the pavement. She also said that she did not see it at the time she was injured. She stated that her usual course in going from her house to her daughter’s house was down Rock street to Spruce, thence out Spruce to Shamokin, across Shamokin to Liebig’s lot, thence through that lot to her daughter’s house; that she went the same course back, and did not go along the eastern side of Shamokin street, and did not pass over the place where she received the injury. She stated that was usually so, but, still, she did state that on some occasions prior to the injury she had gone along Shamokin street, as I understood it, along by this place where she received her injury. Yet, she could not and did not fix any time when she so passed along that street, before the accident, or how long before; or, whether it was before the offset was made in the pavement, by raising one higher than the other, she was not able to state. But she says she did not know of this offset or difference in the height of the pavements, at the time of the injury. This, so far as I recollect it, is about all the evidence on this subject; no one ever saw Mrs. Readdy passing along at that place, so far as the evidence discloses, prior to the time she received the injury.] 4</p>

And I charge you that if there is any evidence in the case that Mrs. Readdy failed to exercise such care as a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the circumstances, she cannot, recover. By that I mean, if there was negligence on her part, negligence in taking the risk of crossing or passing that place, or negligence in walking without seeing where she was going, she cannot recover. No matter what the negligence of the borough was, the plaintiff cannot recover if her negligence contributed to her injury.</p>

If a sidewalk or any part of tbe public streets become dangerous, or in bad condition, the borough or city is not liable until the proper officers of such borough or city have notice, and then it becomes negligence on their part if they do not immediately put such street or sidewalk in reasonable repair and in a reasonably safe condition, and that is one of the questions you are to pass upon in this case.

If a street or sidewalk is out of repair such a length of time as to become generally observable, then the borough or city becomes affected with what is called constructive notice; it is presumed they would have notice. As stated by the Supreme Court, implied notice is the notice which the borough or city is presumed to have, when an obstruction in the public highway has existed so long that the city or borough should reasonably take notice of and repair it. Whether the borough had actual or constructive notice by reason of this alleged defect in the pavement existing for such a length of time as to become generally observable, is a question I leave to the jury to determine. The evidence would seem to be plain on that subject, but still I leave it to you to determine.....</p>

In this case, it being an action by a married woman, there is no claim on her part for any expenses incurred by reason of the injury. If there were any such, doubtless they were paid by the husband and he may have his remedy.] 5 There is no claim on the part of the plaintiff in this case for any direct expenses. Nor is there any claim for any pecuniary loss that she has sustained, or is likely to sustain during the remainder of her life, from the disabled condition of her arm or side. Nor is there any-claim for any difference it has occasioned in her ability to earn wages or to be of service to herself or husband. [The plaintiff claims in this case to recover damages only for the pain and suffering, bodily and mental, already experienced and likely to be experienced by reason of the injury she sustained, and these we say to you are proper subjects to be taken into consideration by the jury in estimating the damages sustained by the plaintiff. In no event can the verdict exceed $2,500, as the plaintiff has not declared in her declaration for any larger amount.] 6 . . . .</p>

While it referred to the testimony applicable to the point, it ended with the emphatic statement : “ No matter what the negligence of the borough was, the plaintiff cannot recover if her negligence contributed to the injury.” In the third assignment, complaint is made that the court did not direct a verdict for the defendant.
