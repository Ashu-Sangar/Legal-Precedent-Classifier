That supervisors are not required by law to rail the sides of a road, merely because there is a bank over which a vicious, blind or uncontrollable horse might plunge or back a vehicle, unless the roadway is so narrow as to afford insufficient space to manage a horse. It would be impossible to guard a road against every possible danger; therefore, if the jury believe that the road in question, being twenty-eight or-thirty feet wide, was safe, and an accident could only happen by careless driving, or using a blind horse, the township of Milford was not at fault, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b160-11" data-blocks='[["BL_160.9",160,[255,1446,1165,440]]]'>Answer: The law makes no distinction between a blind horse and one that can see, in respect to the duty of supervisors in making and keeping the public roads in safe and passable condition. The measure of their duty is the exercise of sufficient care, according to the circumstances. They are not required to guard a road against every possible danger; but only to guard it so that the traveler exercising ordinary care may pass along it in safety. With this qualification this point is affirmed.3</p>

This is not contained in the record, because the reporter bad left for home after the jury was charged. I do not remember the questions asked by the jury on these two occasions; but, I think the instructions given were to define and illustrate negligence and contributory negligence ; and I think, as one example, they were told that if the borough authorities of Mifflintown dug a ditch across one of the streets and left it open and unguarded, that would be negligence; and if a traveler, in the night-time, without knowledge of its existence, drove into the ditch and was injured, he might recover damages. But if a resident of the borough, with knowledge of the ditch, carelessly or intentionally drove into it, he would be guilty of contributory negligence and could not recover damages. I think on the second occasion the jury were told, that if a public road were so dangerous that it needed a guard-rail or other barrier to protect against going over a steep embankment, it was negligence to leave it without such protection. But if a traveler, knowing the danger, should be passing along asleep in his carriage, or engaged in reading a newspaper, or otherwise having his attention so averted that his horse was not under control, and the horse went over the embankment because unguided, that such traveler would be guilty' of contributory negligence and could not recover damages. I think the plaintiff’s counsel complained of this last example, because they said it was the theory set up by the defence. No exception however was noted, because the answers to the jury’s questions were not committed to writing, and the reporter was absent. It is impossible to recollect accurately what was said on the occasion,- and the foregoing statement may only be substantially correct. But the object of the instructions thus given was to make plain as possible to the jury the .idea of negligence, and of contributory negligence, so that they might determine for themselves from the evidence, whether the township was guilty of negligence, and if so, whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>
