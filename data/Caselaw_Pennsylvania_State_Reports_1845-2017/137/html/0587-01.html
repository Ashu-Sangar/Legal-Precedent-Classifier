F. Proper, of Tionesta, Pa., for $700, “he being the best bidder and that the best price bidden for the same,” praying that said sale be confirmed.</p>

Proper, who told him that he would be the only other bidder at the sale and de<a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>sired t.o know how much Brown would take to stay away, but Brown repudiated the proposition; that Brown went to the court house at ten o’clock, by his watch which he believed to be correct, and found that the sale had been held and the property purchased by J. F. Proper for $700 ; that Brown after-wards met Proper and the latter said that the property was sold to him at two minutes after ten; that, about fifteen or twenty minutes after ten, Brown made an offer in writing of $900 to the attorney of the administratrix, which was refused.

Hazlett to the extent of at least $600. He does not state the character of the claim, to enable us to determine whether it is or is not a prima facie valid claim. He does not allege collusion between the administratrix and Proper to wrong him as a creditor. The administratrix is asking the sale to be confirmed, and, if she has wrongfully refused a higher bid for the property, by reason of which the exceptant’s claim against the estate, if a valid one, is impaired, he has his remedy against her in the settlement of her accounts, or possibly by an action. If the exceptant was not an actual creditor of the estate, but interested only in buying the property as a speculation, he has not been legally prejudiced so as to give him a standing to oppose the confirmation of the sale.</p>
