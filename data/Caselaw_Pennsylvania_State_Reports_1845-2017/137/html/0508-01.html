The only legislation the effect of which need be considered, is contained in the acts of June 14,1887, P.

The essential change produced upon the charter of 1870 by the act of 1887, is that the membership of the select council from each ward is reduced to one. The legislative intent, in passing the act of 1887, was not to legislate out of office any select councilman elected for the city prior to its becoming a city of the second class, but the intent is plain that such select councilmen should serve out their terms of office, and that no persons should be elected to select council, except as successors of the select councilmen of the old city. The new members to be elected are to succeed, not to supersede, the old members. The judgment of the court below is therefore manifestly erroneous, unless the act of 1889 makes some change in the act of 1887, and shows plainly an intent to strike down the terms created under the acts of 1870 and 1881.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b552-6" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[272,1154,1166,859]]]'>4. The act of 1889 did not intend to do this; on the contrary, it provides for the cutting short of the terms of those officers, only, whose offices are superseded by the change in classification. The office of select councilman is not superseded, but is preserved as heretofore. The contention of the relator that an election should be held in February, 1891, under the charter of 1870, is sufficiently met in the opinion of the court below. The dates named in the act of 1887 are directory merely, and Were intended to enable cities of the second class, then existing, which were to come under its provisions, to do so with as little inconvenience as possible. So, the fact that thirteen councilmen cannot be evenly divided by two, is unimportant. The act of 1887 does not require an equal division. If it be true that the dates in the act show a plain intent to apply it to the existing state of facts in the then only city of the second class, the city of Pittsburgh, this would not make the act, otherwise constitutional, local or special legislation.</p>

The decree should be reversed because it compels an election to be held under the provisions of the act of May 8, 1889, P. L. 133, which, in so far as it provides for the election of municipal officers, is unconstitutional. The title of the act indicates but one subject, classification and the change thereof, and contains nothing indicating an intention to deal with the subject of municipal elections, or to strike down the terms of municipal officers. As has been abundantly shown, the mere <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>fact of change from one class to another does not involve a change in government, and or in the number, powers and duties of officers, or in their terms of office.

    <p class="summary" id="b553-7" data-blocks='[["BL_553.5",553,[250,976,1163,951]]]'>1. The act of May 8,1889, P. L. 133, divides cities into three classes materially differing in character from the classes created by the act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 230, and Allegheny, by becoming a member of the division styled the second class, in the act of 1889, does not become subject to the legislation enacted for the former class of the same name. Its special laws remain unrepealed and unaffected by its change in class, until altered by legislation for the new second class. These conclusions appear to be authorized by a fair reading of the act of 1889. It nowhere shows an intention to subject cities coming into the second class, thereby created, to the laws provided for the old second class. We claim, however, that the act of 1889 is unconstitutional, in that it contains more than one subject of legislation. In addition to what is declared by its title, it attempts to enact a transition bill, abolishing offices, unseating officers duly elected, and providing for the election of new officers. The case comes clearly within the ruling in Hatfield v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/120/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="120 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="559960" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0395-01">120 Pa. 395</a>, and Commonwealth v.

L. 395, is in force in Allegheny, it does not repeal the provisions of the special charter of 1870, respecting the select council. It is impossible for us to comply with its provisions. The directions as to the holding of elections in 1889 and 1890, are mandatory, hut they are impossible of performance in Allegheny. Nor is it possible to divide the thirteen select councilmen, to which, under the act of 1887, the city would be entitled, into two equal classes alternating in terms. The intent of the legislature as to biennial <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>expiration of terms is so linked to the provision as to number, that it cannot be dissevered therefrom without violence to the law, and, if councils can fix the number of each of the classes to suit themselves, the purpose of the law would be perverted. The plain intention of the legislature was that the two classes should be equal in number. If the city has the power to make seven long, and six short terms, it would have the power to make twelve long terms and one short term. No provision is made for a city having an uneven number of wards. When it is impossible to comply with certain provisions of an act, these provisions are inoperative and void.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b554-5" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[246,917,1165,1005]]]'>3. Again; the mischief sought to be remedied by the act of 1887 was a disproportion between the two branches of councils, the select council being by far the larger body in the only existing city of the second class, and the purpose of the act being to cut it down one half. The application of the law to Allegheny would have a result directly opposite, and bring about a disproportion in the other direction. We would have but thirteen select councilmen and fifty-eight common councilmen. Nor can this difficulty be cured by a division of wards under the act of May 23, 1874, as that act requires the submission of such a question to a popular vote. To carry out the legislative intention to secure a proper proportion between the two bodies of councils, would it not be fair to assume that there was no purpose to repeal the local law, as to select council, of any city coming into the second class with a small and odd number of wards ? Such a saving of local laws would not invalidate the general act: Evans v. Phillipi, <a href="/pa/117/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="117 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="555822" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0226-01">117 Pa. 226</a>; Malloy v.

But we claim, further, that the act of 1887 cannot repeal the charter of 1870, because the entire act is unconstitutional.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b554-6" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[245,1940,1163,448]],["BL_555.1",555,[238,383,1163,506]]]'>4. The act of 1887 is in violation of the constitutional prohibition of local legislation for cities. It is true that legislation for a class composed of but one city, has been justified on the ground that other cities, by increase of population, may come into that class and become subject to such legislation. But this assumption cannofi save the act in question, for two reasons : (a) On its face, it is inapplicable to any city coming into the second class after its enactment, as it specifies the dates at which certain things shall be done; and (6) at the <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>time of its enactment there was no possibility of any other city becoming a member of the second class, there being no provision in the act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 230, for a change of class, and that act having arbitrarily and finally fixed the rank of each city, with the expectation that the ratio of increase in all the classes would be substantially uniform, and that the various cities would always bear the same relation to each other that existed in 1874. The legislature had no right to assume that one or more third class cities would be ushered into the second class by some subsequent legislature.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b555-5" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[237,896,1166,1060]]]'>5. Legislation for a class composed of but one city can be justified only on the theory that some existing city will probably come into that class by increase of population. The idea of the word class is apparent from its derivation: classis, a fleet, a troop, a collection, a cluster. One city can no more constitute a class, than one ship can make a fleet, one soldier a troop, one object a collection, or one grape a cluster.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_2" id="ref_footnote_0_2">*</a> As this act is limited by its plain terms to the only city of the second class existing when it was passed, and as there was then no possibility of any other city coming into that class except by a future act of the legislature, it is a local law obnoxious to the constitution. If by the act of 1889 Allegheny is forced into the second class, and thereby becomes subject to all the legislation enacted for cities of that class, as constituted by the act of 1874, untold disorder and uncertainty will pervade every departure of the government. A judgment that the new second class is not the old, and that Allegheny is not bound by the laws enacted for the former second class, will remove all difficulty. If this is impossible, a decision that the local law of 1870, as to select council, is unrepealed by the act of 1887, will relieve from considerable embarrassment.</p>

L. 717, entitled “An Act to reduce the charter of the city of Allegheny, and the several acts amendatory thereof, into one act.” By that act, the powers of the municipal government were vested in the mayor and select and common councils. The select council was composed of two members from each ward, to serve for a term of two years, which term was increased by the act of 1881 to four years. There being thirteen wards in the city, the number of select councilmen has hitherto been twenty-six.</p>

It repeals no ordinances; it vacates no offices except those which it abolishes, and makes no vacancies to be filled except by the creation of new offices. The offices of mayor, and of select and common councils are common to each class of cities. The mere fact of the transition does not necessarily unseat the persons legally filling such offices at the time it occurs, but they serve out their official terms for which they were elected, and their successors are elected under the laws regulating the class into which the city has moved. In the meantime, the officers, whose terms have not expired, become possessed of all the powers and are subject to all the duties pertaining to the offices held by them in cities of the class to which it has advanced. In other words, the machinery of the old government is to be used in adjusting the city to its position under the new. Were it otherwise, — were all offices to be suddenly vacated, we would have chaos.

This leaves thirteen members, the precise number to which the city is entitled under the new order of things, whose terms will not expire until April, 1893. There is, therefore, no necessity for an election this year of such members. All the present members are entitled to retain their seats until the expiration of their respective terms.
