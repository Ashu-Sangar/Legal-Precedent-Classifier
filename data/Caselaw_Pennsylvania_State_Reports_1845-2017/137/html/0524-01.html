Rebecca Pew states that Mrs. Cousins was present at the time the contract was concluded and the writing drawn, as I understand it, and that she at that time said that she was willing for her father to act for her, or something to that effect, and that subsequently her father paid to Elizabeth Cousins part of the money. Mr. Loy says that it is his recollection, and he has no doubt, that Mrs. Cousins was present at the time this contract was made; that there were women present, and he thinks a son or two of Mr. Pew, and his recollection is that Mrs. Cous<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>ins was present, and in another part of his testimony he states he does not doubt that she was present. He also says that he had no knowledge at all of her being possessed of any title to any part of this land, and that all who were present seemed satisfied with what was done. He is positive in his statement that he knew nothing at all about Mrs. Cousins being the owner of a part of this land.

Now, is that true? Miss Pew says that she was present and that Mrs. Cousins was present when this agreement was consummated. Is that true ? Mr. Loy states that Mrs. Cousins was present at that time. That is the first fact for you to find. Mrs. Cousins denies that she was present there. Is it true that she was present ? If she was, then what took place when she was present ?

The evidence shows that on that day Samuel Pew, by articles of agreement, transferred a part of said tract to his sons Joseph Y. and A. Preston Pew; that, by sundry mesne conveyances, a portion of said last-mentioned tract, including the land in controversy, became vested in Elizabeth Cousins October 8,1870; and that she was in possession thereof from that time until May 12, 1884, when she conveyed the same in fee to Anna R. Cousins, now Anna R. Richards, the beneficial plaintiff below. That evidence made a clear prima facie case in her favor, and entitled plaintiffs below to a verdict.</p>

The character of that evidence is sufficiently indicated by the points for charge submitted by defendant below. Its purpose was to show that Elizabeth Cousins, from whom the beneficial plaintiff directly derived title, was estopped by her action at and about the time the right of way was executed by Samuel Pew, and that the beneficial plaintiff took title with knowledge of the facts constituting the alleged estoppel.</p>
    <p id="b565-7" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[232,1656,1168,503]]]'>It clearly appears that the New Castle &amp; Franklin Railroad Company, predecessor of defendant company, entered upon the land in controversy, and constructed its road, under and in pursuance of the grant aforesaid.

In other words, unless defendant company had a right of possession under the alleged grant, in connection with facts sufficient to constitute an estoppel, plaintiffs below were entitled to recover.</p>

As has already been remarked, there is no evidence that the land in question was appropriated for railroad purposes otherwise than under and in pursuance of the grant above referred to. That, in connection with the alleged estoppel, was the only ground of defence the company had. Failing in that, it follows that the company was wrongfully in possession, and the principle of McClinton v.

If you find that the agent of the company knew at the time he took the grant from Samuel Pew that Elizabeth Cousins was the owner of a part of the land embraced in the grant, and that the part in controversy here, there would be no estoppel.

The qualification complained of was not erroneous. If the railroad company, through its agent, Mr. Loy, knew Mrs. Cousins owned the land in controversy, it should have procured a right of way executed by her in'person, or by her duly constituted attorney in fact. Instead of doing so, it was guilty of the folly of accepting a grant from one who was neither owner of the land, nor the duly constituted attorney in fact of the owner. If the company actually knew the fact that Mrs. Cousins owned the land, how could it be deceived or misled by her alleged acts and declarations indicating the contrary ? And on what principle can she or her vendee be estopped from asserting and proving the truth of that fact ? If vitality can be thus infused into an unauthorized grant, it would be a very convenient way of circumventing the statute of frauds and perjuries. We think the learned judge was right in saying: “ If the railroad company knew the truth, at the time they took the grant, the plaintiffs would not be es-topped from showing the truth now.”</p>

In appellant’s history of the case,. it is substantially conceded that, as the owner of the land she had purchased four years before, Mrs. Cousins was then in possession thereof. That of itself was at least constructive notice of her title. One of the witnesses also testified, in substance, that while Mrs. Cousins was participating in the negotiations at the time of the grant, Mr. Loy knew or understood that she owned the land, and in the presence of the witness asked her if she was willing to have Samuel Pew settle the matter for her. The testimony, it is true, was conflicting, but it was all proper for the consideration of the jury.</p>

This can be done by ordering a stay of execution for sufficient length of time to enable the company to appropriate the land according to law.</p>
