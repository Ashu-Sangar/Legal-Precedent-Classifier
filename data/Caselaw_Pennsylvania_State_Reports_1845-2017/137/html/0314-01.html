    <p class="summary" id="b351-5" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[245,735,1187,557]]]'>A motion by the plaintiff for a preliminary injunction was heard on August 6,1890. The plaintiff’s affidavits were to the ■effect that the defendant’s excavation and foundation were within the railroad appropriation, which however, was not defined by marked boundaries, but the point had been used for a considerable length of time as a place for teams to drive in and out to load and unload freight. The affidavits of the de- • fendant alleged in general terms that the land in controversy was not within the plaintiff’s right of way, but belonged to the defendant and had been occupied by it and its predecessors in title for a long period, as a place for piling lumber, ties, etc.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b351-7" data-blocks='[["BL_351.6",351,[246,1455,1174,707]]]'>The allegation that the land belongs- to the defendant must be taken and considered in connection with the deed under which she claims title, and from the deed it appears that the right of way, as granted and conveyed by Samuel Benedict, is recognized and expressly reserved. Where, then, is the plaintiff’s right of way ? In the absence of monuments on the ground, drafts of surveys exhibiting the original location would be evidence, and, according to the company’s map recorded in its book of drafts of rights of way, the point in controversy is not only within the .sixty feet to which the company was entitled by law, and the grant from Samuel Benedict, to appropriate, but within the lines of the land actually appropriated. It was not necessary to mark off the land by permanent monuments, nor to cover it with railroad tracks.</p>

It is also alleged that, as early as 1860 and continuing until 1880, two switches were located across the ground where the foundation of the struc<a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>ture, proposed to be erected by defendant, now stands. The plaintiff does not deny that the defendant and her predecessors have from time to time piled lumber and other materials on the land, but alleges that she has from time to time removed such obstructions from the right of way, after being notified to do so. If the land is within the lines of the company’s appropriation, the use of the laud from time to time, in the manner described by the defendant and her predecessors, would not give title.</p>

Therefore, we do not think the defendant, or those from whom she derived title, can claim to be purchasers without notice. They had notice of the grant from Samuel Benedict, although not recorded, and recognized its validity. Inquiry would have given them information as to the extent of the plaintiff’s appropriation under that grant, if they did not know it otherwise. In the absence of monuments on the ground marking the lines, we do not think they had a right to presume, without inquiry, that the plaintiff’s appropriation under the grant included less than the law would allow them to take.</p>

If the plaintiff will not bring his suit at law within a reasonable time, or fails to maintain it, the special injunction can be dissolved. But if, without unreasonable delay, he succeeds in . establishing his right, the defendant can be heard on his answer and proofs, and the injunction be dissolved or made perpetual, as may appear equitable and just.”</p>
