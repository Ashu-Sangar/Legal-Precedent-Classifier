    <p class="summary" id="b655-6" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[255,780,1168,966]]]'>To be brief, in this regard, we call your attention to the testimony of the plaintiff himself, and that of ’Squire Metzger, that after the horse died the company was notified through the mails, and that a blank proof of loss in proper form to make out the proof was requested of the company in the same manner; that some proof of loss of some kind was made out and mailed to the company, and subsequently, as we recall the testimony, a blank proof of loss was made out and also, if we remember correctly, sent by mail to the company. The correspondence between the plaintiff and the secretary of the company and the attorney of the company is also before you and this you will examine for yourselves. The evidence does not show a strict compliance with the provisions of the policy; but, as we have said, we think there is sufficient proof to submit the question of fact as to whether the plaintiff reasonably complied with the contract on his part; whether he so complied, under all the circumstances and facts which have been developed in evidence, as would in the eye of the law be a sufficient compliance with this part of his contract.</p>

The law is, as to the burning of a building, the entire destruction by fire of a building, that if notice be promptly given of the loss, further proof of loss is not necessary. This does not apply as a rule to personal property, if at all; it surely does not apply to personal property which may be composed of a number of items, when articles are removed and like articles take their place, as in the case of grain in a barn or goods in a store. [I am unable now to say whether this question as to whether it applies at all to personal property has ever been adjudicated; but, taking the law as given to us in regard to the burning of buildings, where it is an entire loss, where there is nothing left from the devouring flames, the whole building swept away, <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>reasoning by analogy from cases of that kind which have been adjudicated, we believe that where there is one article of personal property, specific and identical, insured for a certain round sum, the same rule of law would apply there and remove very largely, if not entirely, the necessity of any further proof of loss being made, except to give notice to the company that there was an entire loss; that the horse was dead.] 5</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b656-6" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[239,767,1168,352]]]'>1. The uncontradicted evidence, in the case, is that the preliminary notice required was given by the plaintiff to the defendant company through the mails, a few days after the death of the horse which was insured by the defendant company, which was in fulfilment of the requirements of the policy, the loss being a total and entire loss, which notice under the law took the place of the proofs of loss.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b656-7" data-blocks='[["BL_656.6",656,[234,1127,1169,602]]]'>Answer: If the evidence satisfies you of the fact that notice was given the defendant company of the death of the horse, within the time, the same would be notice of an entire loss. Where such preliminary notice is given, in cases of the destruction of buildings by fire, further proof of loss would be unnecessary, unless requested by the company. This rule, however, does not apply to personal property, especially if the personal property consists of different items. But, as to the case now on trial, the insurance was upon a particular, specific and identical thing; and we think the same rule will apply as in cases of a building, and we do so instruct you as requested in the conclusion of the point.6</p>
