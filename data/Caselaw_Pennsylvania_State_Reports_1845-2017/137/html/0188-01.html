It is very clear that the Jifkinses could not execute a mortgage that would bind any other than their own estate in the land: § 8, act of 1705, 1 Sm. L. 59. The only estate they ever had, in this case, was a term of five years, and the property was transferred to them for that term, only, by way of pledge for the loan they agreed to furnish. They were authorized to execute a mortgage upon it undoubtedly, but only for the said term; for it was the express condition of the granting of this term, that they were continually to apply the rents and profits to the discharge of the loan, and if at its expiration any balance remained undischarged, Sweetzer was to pay off such balance at once, and be at once reinvested with the possession. No such balance remained undischarged, and the term expired by its own limitation, the property reverting to Sweetzer. This is settled and has become res judicata by the decision in <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>Sweetzer’s App., <a href="/pa/71/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="71 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1031241" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0264-01">71 Pa. 264</a>, and the account settled thereunder.</p>

The case is interesting, because it is an instance of a genuine vivum vadium, as distinguished from a mortuum vadium. We are in the habit of calling all pledges of. land mortgages, such pledges usually being of that character; but there is nothing in the law to prevent the giving and accepting of. a living pledge, and that is what the parties did in this case: 2 Bl. Com., 157; Co. Litt., *332, note; Glanville, lib. 10, c. 6; 1 Reeve’s Hist. Eng. Law, 161; Yates v. Hambly, 2 Atk. 360, 362; Fenwick v. Reed, 1 Mer. 114, 123. Cases of this kind are rare; but, clearly, this was a case of a vivum vadium; and long before Mrs. Atterbury issued her scire facias, the pledgors had ceased to have any title whatever to the land in question. She claims to be a bona fide purchaser. Of what ? All that she ever purchased was the Jifkins title, and that was nothing. She took special pains to confine her purchase to that title, even to the extent of collusion and conspiracy against Sweetzer, as we offered to prove, and as must therefore be assumed upon this hearing. The question now is one of plain legal title. The equities between Sweetzer and the Jifkinses were settled in Sweetzer’s App., supra, and that decision is conclusive upon her as the claimant of the Jifkins title: 1 Greenl. Ev., § 523; Carver v. Jackson, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Pet.%2085" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 Pet. 85">4 Pet. 85</a>.</p>

If notice of Sweetzer’s rights be deemed material, we submit that Mrs. Atterbury cannot claim to have purchased without such notice. After she took the bond and mortgage from her father’s executor, she continued Scranton as her agent, in the same matter, and she is chargeable with his knowledge. Knowledge is notice, and notice to an agent in the same transaction is notice to the principal: Le Neve v. Le Neve, 2 Lead. Cas. Eq. *23, and notes. Formal notification is unnecessary: Biddle v. Moore, <a href="/pa/3/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="400632" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0161-01">3 Pa. 161</a>. Moreover, the very method of the transfer, which lay in the line of her title, amounted to notice. But the doctrine of lis pendens is of controlling effect on this point. By the filing of Sweetzer’s bill in equity, in 1868, she had notice of his claim: Fessler’s App., <a href="/pa/75/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="75 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1036697" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0483-01">75 Pa. 483</a>; Dovey’s App., <a href="/pa/97/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="97 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="444826" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0153-01">97 Pa. 153</a>. Granting every consideration possible in her favor, the utmost she could legally and righteously <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>claim would be the right to hold the property until her loan was fully paid.</p>

To hold, as the court below apparently did, that her acquisition of the Jifkins right, invested her also with the title of Sweetzer, without any process against him, and without an opportunity for a hearing on his part, even after collusion by her to prevent such a hearing, is to violate rights guaranteed to him by both the . national and the state constitutions. Much was said in the trial below by her counsel about her having a debt confessedly due and unpaid. It was confessed by the party with whom she was in collusion, but Sweetzer denied her claim instead of confessing it. We submit, further, that the court erred in rejecting the testimony of the plaintiff, on the ground that the death of Scranton and Dodge rendered him incompetent. The thing in action is Sweetzer’s title, and the ejectment is between parties in full life. The rule on which the court acted applies to suits upon choses in action: Warren v. Steer, <a href="/pa/112/0634-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="112 Pa. 634" data-case-ids="546522" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0634-01">112 Pa. 634</a>.</p>

Her title relates to the date of the mortgage. <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>Moreover, the allegations of the bill gave notice of a claim very different from that now set up. The plaintiff was incompetent to testify to matters occurring in the lifetime of Scranton and Dodge : Swank v.

The proposed testimony, however, was immaterial. We have nothing to do with the rents of the property before we purchased it at the last sheriff’s sale, and it savors of extreme coolness to ask us to account for the subsequent rents.</p>

As to the mortgagee, Sweetzer was a terre-tenant of the land, and as such he was not entitled to notice of the scire facias. He had no defence to it and he can make none here: Nace v.

The authorities cited by the appellee do not support the position she advances, but declare precisely the contrary. The court refused Sweetzer permission to take defence to. the scire facias on the mortgage and, upon reflection, we think rightly; for, as he had not been made a party to the writ, the judgment could in no way affect his rights. It cannot be said that the refusal to give him a chance to be heard was giving him a day in court. In the, former ejectment, Sweetzer v. Atterbury, <a href="/pa/100/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="100 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="498475" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0018-01">100 Pa. 18</a>, the judge in the court below declared that Sweetzer was bound to take an appeal from the discharge of his rule, under the act of April 4,1877, P. L. 53, or be forever barred. That the judge was mistaken, is clear, not only from the words of the act, but from its judicial construction: Lamb’s App., <a href="/pa/89/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="89 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1063271" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0407-01">89 Pa. 407</a>; First N.

We did not have then the evidence of collusion, which we offered in the present case.</p>

Moreover, the learned justice who delivered the opinion in the former case, labored under a misapprehension. He assumed that Mrs. Atterbury took the mortgage without notice, whereas we offered to prove that she had notice. And he evidently overlooked the rule that the assignee of a purchaser of a mortgage stands in no better position than he: Mullís on’s Est., <a href="/pa/68/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="68 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="1024562" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0212-01">68 Pa. 212</a>. He was misled, also, by the assertion of counsel, repeated in the present case, that Dodge “ sold and assigned the mortgage ” to Mrs. Atterbury. Dodge, as an executor, merely transferred to her this mortgage as one of the securities in which the money of her father’s estate was invested. This was not a sale. A sale is the passing of rights of property for money: Williamson v.

The primary purpose of the parties to the transaction disclosed in Sweetzer’s App., <a href="/pa/71/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="71 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1031241" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0264-01">71 Pa. 264</a>, was to effect a loan on Sweetzer’s property for his benefit. It was plainly their intention that tbe property should be “a clear and unencumbered security” for the loan, and that Dodge should have a first mortgage upon it for the money advanced by him. This sufficiently appears from the claim of the ap.pellant in the case cited. It was said by this court, in that case, that the transaction put the Jifkinses “in Sweetzer’s stead, so far as the mortgaging of the property was concerned. It was Sweetzer’s debt that was secured by the Dodge mortgage, and it was his land that was pledged by his authority for its payment. Whatever title to this land remained in him after the sheriff’s sale was subject to the lien of this mortgage. It ffiound the fee.- It was not for him, after appropriating, in the manner agreed upon, the moneys secured by the mortgage, to allege that the mortgagee acquired nothing by it. In Sweetzer’s Appeal, supra, we enforced a parol agreement when its at- . tempted repudiation was a fraud upon the appellant, and we cannot allow him to perpetrate a like fraud by denying an obligation founded upon it. In this view of the case it is of no consequence whether the assignee of the mortgage had knowledge of his agreement with the Jifkinses concerning the occu<a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>pancy of the property and the appropriation of its rents. The reception by the latter of the profits arising from the possession and use of the property was not a payment on the mortgage. It was their duty to account for these according to the terms of their agreement with him. The right of action for a breach of that duty was not in the mortgagee or his assigns, but in the appellant, to whom they were bound to account. It is not pretended that the mortgage was paid before foreclosure, or that the judgment obtained in the suit upon it was greater than the sum due to the plaintiff therein. The appellant knew of this judgment, and moved the court to open it, on the grounds stated in his offers of evidence in this case. The motion was denied, and, rather than pay his own just debt, he allowed his property to be sold for it. The process throughout conformed to the instrument by which the property was pledged.</p>
