Stoecklein d/b/a Penn Lincoln Memorial Park. At the conclusion of the testimony, the lower Court directed verdicts for the defendants. Plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied, Judgment was never entered on the verdicts. Plaintiff appealed to this Court \u201cfrom the lower Court\u2019s Opinion and Decree dismissing the motion for a new trial.\u201d\nIn Denmon v. Rhodes, 416 Pa. 568, 207 A. 2d 860, we said: \u201cAs stated in the footnote in Menyo v. Sphar, 409 Pa. 223, 224, 186 A. 2d 9: \u201cloo many members of the Bar mistakenly believe that the appeal is from an Order which dismissed their motion for a new trial, instead of from a judgment which was entered on the verdict: Simpson v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 384 Pa. 335, 121 A. 2d 84. Compare also Hazle Township Supervisors\u2019 Appeal, 406 Pa. 641, 180 A. 2d 232.\u2019 \u201d\nThis appeal must be quashed because it was not taken from a judgment. The record is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County without prejudice to the right to enter a judgment on the verdicts.\nAppeal quashed and record remanded.",
