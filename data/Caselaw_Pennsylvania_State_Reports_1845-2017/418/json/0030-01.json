        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Robeets,\nThis appeal invokes the interpretation of an insurance contract.\nOn July 20, 1958, appellee\u2019s decedent, Anthony J. Wzontek, was killed in an airplane accident while a passenger in an airplane piloted by Robert J. Williams. Williams was also killed in the same accident. The relevant facts are undisputed. Williams held a private pilot\u2019s license and he rented the airplane involved from Edwin S. Braden, trading as Braden\u2019s Flying Service. Braden was insured by appellant, Zurich Insurance Company. The airplane was one of those listed in the \u201cAircraft Schedule\u201d attached to the insurance policy issued to Braden, which policy was in full force and effect at the time of the accident.\nAppellee, administrator of Wzontek\u2019s estate, instituted a trespass action against Williams\u2019 estate and obtained a judgment in the amount of |15,000. The present proceeding was instituted by appellee who claimed that appellant was liable to Williams\u2019 estate under the insurance policy, and issued an attachment execution against appellant in order to collect the judgment.\nAppellant chose to defend solely on the ground that Williams was not an \u201cinsured\u201d and was excluded from coverage under provisions of the policy issued to Braden. The trial judge, however, directed a verdict for appellee, and a subsequent motion for judgment n.o.v. by appellant was denied. Appellant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that Williams is a \u201crenter pilot\u201d within the meaning of subsection III of the printed portion of the policy and is therefore excluded from coverage. That subsection reads:\n\u201cIll Definition op \u2018Insured\u2019 (Coverages A.B.C. D and E).\n\u201cWith respect to the insurance for bodily injury liability and for property damage liability the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured and also includes any person while using the aircraft and any person or. organization legally responsible for the use thereof, provided the actual use of the aircraft is by the named insured or with his permission. The insurance with respect to any person or organisation other than the named insured does not apply: ... (c) to a student or renter pilot or anyone operating the aircraft with the actual or implied knowledge or consent of a renter pilot.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nOther sections of the policy, both printed and typewritten, contain language broad enough to extend coverage to Williams. Under the heading of \u201cExclusions\u201d, the policy provides: \u201cThis Policy Does Not Apply: ... (d) while the aircraft is being operated in flight by any pilot other than the pilot (s) named or described in Item 8 of the declarations unless specifically approved by endorsement attached to this policy.\u201d\nNumerous \u201cDeclarations\u201d appear on the printed policy form which has blank spaces for the insertion of required information.. These declarations are attached to the policy and made a part thereof: \u2014 \u201cInsured is Individual \u2014 \u201cBusiness of Insured Sales, Instruction, Rental & Charter \u2014 Item 7. \u201cUses: Commercial Item 8 of the \u201cDeclarations\u201d (\u201cPilots\u201d) is completed by reference to the endorsements. In respect to Item 8, the endorsements provide: \u201cThe Insured Aircraft will only be flown by the following Pilot(s) : . . . (b) . . . [As respects the aircraft involved in this case] \u2014 Any Private or Commercial Certificated Pilot, also any Student Pilot under the supervision of a Commercial Certificated Instructor Pilot.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nFurthermore, the printed policy provisions contain the following \u201cDefinitions\u201d: \u201c(1) Commercial includes all uses enumerated in the definitions of Instruction and Rental. ...\u201d \u201c(j) Instruction and Rental is defined as used principally in the business of the insured, including student instruction, rental to others and Pleasure and Business purposes but excluding passenger carrying for hire.\u201d\nWe find it unnecessary to determine whether Williams must be considered a \u201crenter pilot\u201d within the meaning of the exclusionary provision. That provision appears only in the printed portion of the policy while typewritten \u201cdeclarations\u201d clearly express the intention to extend insurance coverage to \u201cAny Private or Commercial Certificated Pilot\u201d who is flying an airplane listed in the policy. We believe, as did the court below, that the facts of Newman v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co., 361 Pa. 587, 65 A. 2d 417 (1949), are sufficiently similar to those in the present case to make that decision controlling.\nIn Newman, the exclusionary clause was a printed provision which stated that the policy did not apply to injury to buildings or contents thereof caused by the \u201coverflow of water . . . from plumbing, heating, refrigerating, air conditioning, or automatic sprinkler systems. . . .\u201d The policy contained \u201cdeclarations\u201d under which there appeared an item entitled \u201cCoverage Analysis\u201d which provided blanks for insertions for any or all of six classes of hazards. Under the first class, \u201cPremises and Operations\u201d, these typewritten words were inserted: \u201cNo. 2473 \u2014 Photographers\u2014Commercial \u2014 all operations \u2014 -including studios (Aerial Photography or the Production of Motion Pictures to be separately rated.\u201d In rejecting the contention that the printed exclusion precluded liability on the part of the insurance company for certain water damages, the Court held in Newman-. \u201cThe Coverage Analysis recited the business of the assured (commercial photographers) and provided that the coverage was on \u2018all operations \u2014 including studios.\u2019 The court must give effect to every word that can be given effect. By the familiar rule applicable in such circumstances, that typewritten provision, which is the parties last expression of their intention, must be given effect to the exclusion of the printed portions in Exclusion(h) [Citing cases.].\u201d 361 Pa. at 591-92, 65 A. 2d at 419.\nThe printed provision respecting \u201crenter pilots\u201d, whatever that term might mean, must yield to the typewritten \u201cdeclarations\u201d covering any private or commercial certificated pilot who flies an airplane listed in the policy. We therefore conclude that Williams, as a licensed, private pilot, was covered as an insured under such policy.\nJudgment affirmed.\nThe policy provided that any person or the legal representative thereof who has secured a judgment against an insured shall thereafter be entitled to recover under the policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by the policy.\nThe term \u201crenter pilot\u201d is nowhere specifically defined in the policy.\nEmphasis supplied.",
