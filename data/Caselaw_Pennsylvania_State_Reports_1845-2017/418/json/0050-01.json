        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThis is an appeal from a default judgment entered in a trespass action by the Court of Common Pleas No. 6 of Philadelphia County as a sanction under Pa. R. C. P. 4019.\nOn January 9, 1964, Irvin Rapoport (Rapoport), by the issuances of a summons, instituted a trespass action for criminal conversation against George Sirott (Sirott). Service of this summons was made upon the desk clerk in charge of the Parkway House, Philadelphia, which; Rapoport contends, was the residence of Sirott at that time. According to an affidavit of record \u2014 unnoted on the docket entries \u2014 Sirott, on Feb-' ruary 1,1964, was served in the same manner and place with a notice that his deposition, in aid of discovery under Pa; R. C. P. 4007, would be taken on February 4, 1964. Sirott did not appear at that deposition.\nOn February 19, 1964, a complaint was served upon Sirott personally in Camden, New Jersey. Five days thereafter, Sirott filed preliminary objections which challenged the validity of the service both of the summons and complaint, and, at the same' time, moved for a protective order until such time as the court determined the questions raised on the preliminary objections and, if such determination was adverse to Sirott, until the pleadings were closed. One day thereafter, Sirott\u2019s counsel was notified \u2019 that Sirott\u2019s deposition would be taken on February 25, 1964; on February 24, 1964, Sirott\u2019s counsel again moved for a protective order and, pending disposition thereof, Sirott did not appear for that deposition.\nWhile disposition of Sirott\u2019s preliminary objections was pending, Rapoport\u2019s counsel notified the manager of the Parkway House that he intended to take his deposition on March 23, 1964; again Sirott\u2019s counsel moved for a protective order alleging that at the time fixed he was engaged in the trial of a case in the federal court. Allegedly as an accommodation to Sirott\u2019s counsel, a new date for taking this deposition was fixed, Sirott\u2019s counsel did appear and the deposition of the Parkway House manager was taken. Thereafter, on the basis of this deposition, the court overruled Sirott\u2019s preliminary objections (April 9, 1964) and the motion for a protective order (April 14, 1964) and Sirott then filed an answer containing new matter to which Rapoport filed a reply.\nAllegedly after unsuccessful efforts of Rapoport\u2019s counsel to persuade Sirott\u2019s counsel to have Sirott appear for depositions, on June 3, 1964, Rapoport moved for the imposition of a sanction by way of a default judgment against Sirott. This motion for a sanction was based upon the failure of Sirott to appear for deposition after notices given on February 1 and 25, .1964, and the court was requested to direct Sirott to appear for depositions within 20 days or suffer a default judgment. Two days later Rapoport filed a new notice to take the deposition of Sirott on June 11, 1964, and, on June 10, 1964, Sirott\u2019s counsel moved for another protective order requesting that Sirott\u2019s deposition be taken upon written interrogatories or, in the alternative, upon oral examination in Nevada which, allegedly, was then the place of Sirott\u2019s residence. In this motion for a protective order, it was averred: (a) Sirott had been a bona fide resident of Reno, Nevada, since March 1964 and had not resided in Pennsylvania since January 15, 1964; (b) since Sirott was under indictment in Pennsylvania upon the same charges embodied in this trespass action, Rapoport, by his efforts to have Sirott\u2019s depositions taken in Pennsylvania, was attempting in bad faith to nse the rules of discovery to effect Sirott\u2019s arrest in Pennsylvania and to circumvent presently pending extradition proceedings against Sirott and, if Sirott was required upon deposition to answer questions concerning facts in this case, he would be required to incriminate himself in violation of his constitutional rights. On June 11, 3964, Sirott did not appear for deposition.\nOn June 16, 1964, Judge McClanaghan of the Court of Common Pleas No. 7 of Philadelphia County granted Rapoport\u2019s motion for sanction, continued Sirott\u2019s motion for a protective order and directed that Sirott appear for the taking of his deposition within twenty days or suffer the entry of a default judgment. Rapoport\u2019s counsel, acting in accordance with this court direction, then scheduled the taking of Sirott\u2019s deposition for July 6, 1964, such deposition to be limited, according to Rapoport\u2019s counsel, to Sirott\u2019s \u201cfinancial records and income, since [Rapoport] sought exemplary damages.\u201d\nOn July 1, 1964, Rapoport\u2019s counsel moved that Sirott\u2019s motion for a protective order be overruled as moot and, on July 2, 1964, Sirott filed an answer to Rapoport\u2019s motion for sanction, moved for a new protective order and then filed an appeal to our Court from the order of June 16, 1964. This new motion for a protective order was based substantially upon the same grounds as alleged in the motion for a protective order filed on June 10, 1964. On July 3, 1964, the court below denied the motion for a protective order on the ground that it was moot. Thereafter, Sirott did not appear for the deposition on July 6, 1964. We were requested but refused to grant supersedeas and we quashed the appeal upon the ground that the order of June 16, 1964, was interlocutory.\nThereafter, on August 14, 1964, Sirott\u2019s motion of June 10, 1964, for a protective order was overruled and leave was granted to Bapoport to enter a default judgment in favor of Bapoport and against Sirott. From the entry of such default judgment Sirott has appealed.\nThis appeal raises four issues: (1) this default judgment, by way of sanction, should not have been entered because Sirott \u201cnever wilfully failed to appear at any properly noticed deposition\u201d; (2) until the disposition by the court of Sirott\u2019s motion for a protective order, Sirott was not under a duty to appear and the default judgment should not have been entered; (3) Sirott\u2019s motion for a protective order should have been granted because the notice to appear for deposition was made in bad faith; (4) if the information sought by way of deposition on July 6, 1964, was expressly limited to the financial status of Sirott, then the order directing the entry of a default judgment for failure to appear for deposition violated the 14th Amendment of the U. S. Constitution.\nThe entry of a default judgment by way of sanction for failure of a party to appear for the taking of his deposition is a drastic remedy and should be entered only in the clearest of cases. Unless the failure of a party to appear for the taking of a deposition is wilful, i.e., deliberate and intentional, and his duty to appear is clear and the record clearly and unequivocally reveals such to be the case, a default judgment should not be entered.\nWhile it may well be that Sirott\u2019s refusal to appear, at least, in compliance with the direction of the court order of June 16, 1964, was wilful yet the record reveals certain circumstances which may well exculpate Sirott from a finding of wilfulness. He was charged with a criminal offense based upon the same facts as alleged in this action, his presence in Pennsylvania might have subjected him to arrest while extradition proceedings were pending against him, depending upon the scope of examination on the deposition, he might have been subjected to self-incrimination in violation of his constitutional rights and he did, through his pleading, agree, in an attempt to avoid such complications, to an examination by way of written interrogatories or, in the alternative, by deposition in his state of alleged residence. At least, the instant circumstances, including the plethora of motions and other procedural steps, are such that there is grave question of the existence of any wilfulness on Sirott\u2019s part in his failure to appear for deposition in this Commonwealth. In our view, Sirott should be given an opportunity to purge himself of the charge of wilfulness and another opportunity to comply with the order of the court below.\nTo that end we vacate the default judgment and remand the matter to the court below with instructions to that court to immediately direct that Sirott appear for the taking of his oral deposition at a suitable place in his state of alleged residence, i.e., Nevada, on a certain date and at a certain time and that Sirott pay to counsel for Rapoport reasonable counsel fees, costs and expenses involved in the taking of such deposition in Nevada. Upon the failure of Sirott to appear at such deposition in Nevada and/or pay the court-directed counsel fees, costs and expenses, then the court below should direct the entry of a default judgment by way of sanction.\nJudgment vacated and the matter remanded to the court'below for proceedings consistent with the view expressed in this opinion.\nAs to this notice, Sirott\u2019s brief states, inter alia; \u201c. . . [Rapo-' port] did not file a notice to take [Sirott\u2019s] deposition . . ., but rather invalidly attempted to subpoena [Sirott] by leaving notice of the subpoena with the desk clerk at an apartment where [Sirott] no longer resided. [Rapoport] at no time served a copy of the subpoena or any notice to appear on [Sirott\u2019s] counsel. In addition, the subpoena directed [Sirott] to appear at 66th Street and Woodland Avenue in the City and County of Philadelphia, whereas the transcript . . . showed that [Rapoport\u2019s] counsel was waiting to take [Sirott\u2019s] deposition in Norristown, Montgomery County .. . .\u201d\nThis complaint sought compensatory, exemplary and punitive damages in the amount of $2,000,000.\nOpinion of the court below.\nCf. Kine v. Forman, 412 Pa. 163, 194 A. 2d 175.\nThe authority to direct a sanction under Pa. R. C. P. 4019-(a) (2) against a party arises only where such \u201cparty . . ., after notice under Rule 4007, wilfully fails to appear before the person who is to take his deposition . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied). The court must determine whether the failure of a party to appear is \u201cwilful\u201d before a sanction can be imposed. See generally: 4 Goodrich-Amram, \u00a74019(a) (2).\nIn this connection, Sirott relies upon Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U.S. 409, 17 S. Ct. 841, Hammond Packing Company v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, 29 S. Ct. 370 and Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles Et Commerciales, S. A., v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 209, 210, 78 S. Ct. 1087. In view of the conclusion reached in this opinion, the resolution of this issue should await the taking of the deposition at which time the exact scope of the deposition will then become evident and its constitutional validity then tested.\nWhether or not any questions addressed to Sirott on such deposition involve self-incrimination can be determined upon such deposition. Sirott\u2019s counsel can fully protect him in that respect.\nSuch fees, costs and expenses should be determined by the court below and, upon the fixing thereof, must be paid in advance by Sirott.",
