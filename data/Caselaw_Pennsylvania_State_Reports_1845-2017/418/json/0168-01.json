        "text": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nOn March 19, 1962, appellant, represented by court appointed counsel, entered pleas of guilty to murder generally on two bills of indictment. A court en banc heard three days of testimony and arguments and adjudged appellant guilty of first degree murder on each bill and sentenced him to life imprisonment on each bill. No appeal was taken from the judgment of sentence.\nOn January 14, 1964, appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus which, after hearing, was dismissed by the court below; this appeal followed.\nWe have carefully examined appellant\u2019s allegations and have fully reviewed the record in the habeas corpus proceeding as well as the record in the criminal case which underlies it. Our examination and review leads us, inescapably, to an agreement with the court below that appellant \u201cwas accorded the benefit of every constitutional guarantee\u201d. His allegations, individually or collectively, form no basis for the grant of the writ prayed for.\nOrder affirmed.",
