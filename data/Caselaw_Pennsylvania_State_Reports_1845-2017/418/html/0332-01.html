Scott gave his residuary estate to his trustees, in trust to pay the net income to his wife for her life, with succeeding contingent life interests to certain members of his family and upon the death of the last survivor of the life tenants to pay the principal to the Children’s Hospital, absolutely and in fee simple.</p>

The only evidence presented to the auditing Judge was the corporate fiduciary’s standard schedule of compensation which was admitted without objection. Under this schedule the corporate trustee would be entitled to total commissions of over $90,000; the total commissions actually paid on principal and income amounted to $66,500, of which the corporate trustee had received ony $39,000. It is clear that this so-called fiduciaries standard schedule of compensation was never in effect and was never applied to this trust.
