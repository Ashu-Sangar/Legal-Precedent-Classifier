It also involves two appeals from an order of the lower court, entered while said three appeals were pending, purporting to vacate a prior order. This last mentioned order ivas also entered while the three appeals were pending and it purported to rescind a prior decree. All of the orders and decrees which are either appealed from or are collaterally involved were entered in two actions in equity which were tried together before the lower court. <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>The focal point of both actions was the ownership of certain realty which is hereinafter referred to as lot #203.</p>

Prior to November 29, 1858, South Hills Homes Company (South Hills) was record owner of lots In Allegheny County set forth in Parkridge Plan No. 2, which included lot #203. On that date South Hills executed a deed, which was recorded, covering certain of the lots in the plan, to Arthur and Dorothy Corace, husband and wife. The recited consideration for said deed was one dollar. At the time, Arthur Corace was a substantial shareholder in South Hills and apparently in control of its corporate activities. On 3 une 8, 1959, the Coraces executed a deed to these same lots, including lot #203, to South Hills. Said deed was not recorded. About two and one-half years later Arthur Corace entered into a contract with Ryan Construction Corporation (Ryan) wherein he agreed, inter alia, to convey lot #203 to Ryan. Ryan did not know about the unrecorded deed to South Hills. Several months later John and Eva Balint, husband and wife, entered into two agreements with Ryan. In the first, for valuable consideration, Ryan agreed that “it . . . shall and will . . . by deed of general warranty, will and sufficiently grant, convey and assure unto the . . . [Balints], his heirs and assigns in fee simple, clear of all encumbrances” (with certain exceptions not here relevant) lot #203. In the second, for valuable consideration, Ryan agreed to construct a home for the Balints on lot #203. After Ryan built the home for the Balints on lot #203 there was a “settlement” wherein the Balints, with the assistance of a mortgagee, completely paid their obligations to Ryan. But Eyan did not deliver the promised deed to lot #203 at the settlement; Ryan represented that said deed was in the process of being recorded. Thereafter, the Balints received a deed to lot #203, <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>purportedly signed by Arthur and Dorothy Corace, the record owners. Actually, Arthur Corace had signed his wife’s name. Like Ryan, the Balints were unaware of the unrecorded deed to South Hills.</p>

In the first count, the Balints alleged, inter alia, their agreement with Ryan for the delivery of Ryan’s warranty deed free of encumbrances, the breach of said agreement, and improvements to the property; they prayed that Ryan specifically perform its agreement to convey lot #203 and that it pay reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and other damages arising out of the action against them by Dorothy Corace, No. 646, and their action, No. 1636. In the second count, the Balints alleged, inter alia, that all of the above named defendants had engaged in “a deliberate plot,” involving forgery, misrepresentations, and passive misconduct, to deprive them of their money and property, and they prayed that the court order the defendants to execute all instruments necessary to convey to them marketable title to lot #203, free and clear of all encumbrances (except its mort<a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>gage to United Savings), and to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and other damages arising out of actions Nos. 646 and 1636.</p>

An understanding of the case requires a somewhat detailed account of pertinent parts of the record below. After a hearing, the chancellor found, inter alia, that the Coraces were record owners of lot #203, that they had executed and unconditionally delivered a deed to this lot to South Hills on June 8, 1959, that said deed was not recorded, that Ryan had promised its own warranty deed to the Balints, that instead the Balints “accepted” a deed purporting to be from the record owners, Dorothy and Arthur Corace, that Arthur Corace had signed Dorothy’s name to the deed, and that neither Ryan nor the Balints knew of the unrecorded deed to South Hills.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As matters of law the chancellor concluded, inter alia, that Dorothy Corace had no right, title, or interest in lot #203, that the deed to Balints of lot #203 was of no legal effect, and that Ryan failed to perform its agreement with the Balints to deliver to them its warranty deed to lot #203. It further concluded that Ryan’s breach gave the Balints the right to rescind their agreement with Ryan and recover damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees. Based upon these findings of fact and conclusions of law, the chancellor entered decrees nisi on February 5, 1964, dismissing the complaint in No. 646 against the Balints and granting Balints the right to rescind their contract with Ryan and recover the consideration paid by them to Ryan, plus costs of improvements and reasonable counsel fees incurred in Nos. 646 and 1636.</p>

    <p id="b308-4" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[190,688,1162,1406]]]'>Argument before the court en banc was had on exceptions, and the next pertinent matter that appears of record is an adjudication, filed August 3, 1964, purportedly that of the court en banc. In its discussion, the court stated that subsequent to the chancellor’s adjudication of February 5, the Ooraces, South Hills and Byan had all signed a deed conveying any interest they might have in lot #203 to the Balints, that the Balints had accepted said deed, and that, therefore, all of the exceptions of the parties were moot, except certain ones of Dorothy Corace, which were dismissed. However, in its additional findings of fact and conclusions of law, it said that South Hills held lot #203 as constructive trustee for the Balints, thus indicating that what it had said in its discussion about South Hills signing and Balints accepting a deed to lot #203 was not, at that time, correct. It further found that Ryan owed the Balints |2,500 in attorneys’ fees incurred in actions Nos. 646 and 1636 and that Arthur Corace owed Ryan |2,500, representing the amount Ryan had to pay to the Balints. In what purported to be a final decree the court further indicated that what it said in its discussion was not correct by ordering the Coraces, South Hills, and Ryan to execute and deliver a deed to lot #203 to the Balints. It also made orders as to counsel fees consistent with its findings.</p>

Based upon these findings, which contradicted certain findings in the August 3rd adjudication, and the further finding that Arthur Corace <em>forged </em>his wife’s name to the deed to the Balints, the court decreed that Arthur Corace was indebted to Dorothy Corace in the amount of $36,800, representing one-half of the consideration supposedly received by him in connection with the sale of lot #203 and other lots with a similar history.</p>

Thereafter, Arthur Corace discontinued appeals 4 and 6 from the August 5tli decree. Then, on December 22, 1964, the lower court vacated the order of September 28, 1964.

Seaboard was surety on Permaerete’s performance bond with the Shenandoah Valley Housing Corporation. In becoming Permacrete’s surety, Seaboard had relied on certain financial misrepresentations made by Permaerete. Permaerete defaulted on its performance and Seaboard was required to defend and settle an action on the bond. In a subsequent damage action by Seaboard against Permaerete, based upon the latter’s misrepresentations, Seaboard was permitted to recover counsel fees incurred in the prior action and settlement with Shenandoah.</p>

While the lower court found that Ryan breached its contract, it did not make any findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding a tort by Ryan that was the legal cause of the action in No. 646. Indeed, it seems clear that Dorothy Corace’s action in No. 646 was engendered by Arthur Corace’s conduct and not Ryan’s. Moreover, the thrust of the Balints’ action against Ryan in No. 1636 was not in trespass for damages for fraudulent misrepresentations by Ryan but in equity for specific performance of a contract to convey realty. Under such circumstances the Balints should not have been permitted to recover against Ryan the counsel fees incurred in defending No. 646. In so holding we make no ruling as to what, if any, recovery may be had in a separate action by the Balints against Ryan based upon misrepresentations or deceit or what if any recovery may be had in a separate action by Balints against Arthur Corace based upon his alleged forgery. The state of the present record would not permit such rulings to be made herein.</p>

In the August 3rd adjudication the lower court confirmed the chancellor’s finding of fact that on June 8, 1959, the Coraces “executed and unconditionally delivered to South Hills Homes Company a deed” to lot #203, among others, and his conclusion of law that Dorothy Corace has “no right, title, or interest in or to lot No. 203 ... or in any of the lots conveyed by her and Arthur L. Corace to South Hills. . . .” There was an additional conclusion of law in the August 3rd adjudication that “South Hills Homes Company holds the property in question as a constructive trustee” with the Balints as beneficiaries. Then, on August 5th, in the adjudication under discussion, the lower court, in an about face, found that the deed from Arthur L. Corace and Dorothy A. Corace to South Hills, dated June 8, 1959, was never delivered to South Hills and concluded that the Ooraces “are the owners in fee simple of Lot No. 203” and that “Arthur Coraee is indebted to Dorothy A.
