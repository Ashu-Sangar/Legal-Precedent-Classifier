Appellant-union is obliged by the contract to supply the contractor with unionized electrical workers.

Either party desiring to change or terminate this Agreement must notify the other in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to September 1st of any year. Whenever notice is given for changes, the nature of the changes desired must be specified in the notice, and until a satisfactory conclusion is reached, in the matter of such changes, the original provision shall remain in full force and effect.” Furthermore, the contract states that “in the event that any part or parts of this Agreement are found by proper authority to be in conflict with any mandatory State or Federal law or regulation, then such part or parts of the Agreement shall be modified to the extent of compliance with the applicable State or Federal law or regulation.” The contract also sets up ma<a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>chinery hy which a “Labor-Management Committee” is to decide “all disagreements, or claims, of violation of this Agreement . . . which cannot be adjusted between the duly authorized representatives of the Union and the Employer ....

As a result of appellant’s conduct, appellee has been unable to bid for or obtain work requiring unionized help and has suffered irreparable harm and great damage.

Because the case is before us merely on appeal after preliminary objections, we, of course, express no opinion as to whether appellee could make out a case warranting either injunctive relief or damages.

The Senate bill contained no such provision, but instead made the breach of a collective agreement an unfair labor practice which could be enjoined by the National Labor Eelations Board. These changes never became law since the conferees agreed “that suits for breach of such agreements should remain wholly private and ‘be left to the usual processes of the law’ and that, in view of the fact that these suits would be at the instance of private parties rather than at the instance of the Labor Board, no change in the existing anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act should be made.” (Footnote omitted.) <a href="/us/370/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="370 U.S. 195" data-case-ids="6166651" data-case-paths="/us/370/0195-01">370 U.S. at 207</a>, 82 S.

Evening News Association, </em><a href="/us/371/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="371 U.S. 195" data-case-ids="451047" data-case-paths="/us/371/0195-01">371 U.S. 195</a> (1962). If the complaint has not so alleged then it must be dismissed. Naturally, there is no need for the lower court to have a hearing on whether there was or continues to be a violation, in fact, of a collective bargaining agreement where no such violations have been alleged. And just as naturally, in determining whether the complaint so alleges, we must confine our attention to what the <em>plaintiff </em>states in that complaint. Having done so, I must frankly note that I find nothing but sheer hypothesis in the majority’s all important jurisdictional statements: “Various allegations of the complaint indicate <em>that the contract continues to exist and that plaintiff suffered, and continues to suffer, damages as a result of appellant’s continuing breach.” </em>and “The complaint further alleges that subsequent to the <em>unlawful termination </em>. . . .” (Emphasis supplied).

But nowhere does the complaint suggest in any way how this conduct is a violation of a collective bargaining agreement. True, it alleges that at one time the union had agreed to supply unionized labor. But it also recognizes and alleges in more than one place — and this is crucial — that the contract was terminated by the union. Nowhere does the complaint indicate that the union had agreed not to terminate the contract or had agreed that it would terminate only for specified reasons and that its reasons in this case violated the contract. In short the complaint neither alleges a past violation of a collective bargaining agreement, a valid subsisting agreement, or a continued violation of a valid subsisting agreement.</p>

But it is not alleged that it is a collective bargaining agreement that makes such conduct unlawful. On the other hand, such conduct is arguably an unfair labor practice. Section 8(b)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act provides: “(b) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents ... (2) to cause or attempt to cause an employer ... to discriminate against an employee with respect to whom membership in such organization has been denied or terminated on some ground other than his failure to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership; . . .” 29 U.S.C A §158 (b)(2).</p>

    <p id="b60-4" data-blocks='[["BL_60.5",60,[209,469,1156,429]]]'>The lower court’s view of the complaint is precisely the same as mine. The final paragraph of its opinion states: “Accepting the averments of the complaint before us, we could not conclude otherwise than that plaintiff was being subjected to picketing in order to compel it to violate the federal law respecting restoration of a discharged veteran to his former employment and thereby to subject itself to possible sanctions.”</p>

The majority’s jurisdictional hypothesis relies entirely upon one thing. Attached to the complaint is a copy of what is alleged to be the agreement between the union and the employer before the union terminated it. In that alleged former agreement are clauses setting forth procedures to be followed in the event that either party decides to terminate the contract. Although the majority does not expressly say so it must be implying that these termination procedures were not followed by the union and that it therefore breached its contract and that the lower court therefore has jurisdic<a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>tion. <em>But the complaint does not allege the union violated these provisions. </em>These provisions are not in the slightest way alluded to in the complaint as the basis for the cause of action. Even if the union did violate these procedures, the plaintiff’s failure to rely on these provisions and allege a breach of them by the union is only natural since such a breach would not give the plaintiff a right to the relief requested. <em>There is nothing in these procedures which would have prohibited the union from terminating the contract and from refusing to supply unionized employees and from picketing the employer.</em>

Why? We should be as diligent in preserving the exclusive or primary jurisdiction of federal administrative agencies as we are in preserving the exclusive or primary jurisdiction of our own administrative agencies. And this is of especially great importance where the consequence of a failure to do so is a lack of the uniformity vital to sound labor relations.</p>
