In order that my position may be made clear I repeat some of the salient facts in the case. In November, 1963, the Board of Commissioners of Lower Merion Township in Montgomery County enacted an ordinance providing for the condemnation, under eminent domain proceedings, of a tract of land owned by Francis A. Mahan and Alice Rolfe Read Mahan, his wife, for the purpose of creating a historic public park and recreation area. On December 18, 1963, the Mahans filed an action in equity in the court of common pleas for a writ of mandamus against the township, averring, inter alia, that the township was without authority, under the provisions of the First Class Township Code, to maintain historical properties, that the attempted taking constituted an abuse of the township’s power of eminent domain since the land was not necessary for public use, and that the appropriation would result in “immediate and irreparable damage to the plaintiffs.”</p>

In doing so, the court relied principally on three recent decisions of this Court, namely, <em>Balazick v. Dunkard-Bobtown Municipal </em>Authority, <a href="/pa/414/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="414 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="1890432" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0182-01">414 Pa. 182</a>; <em>Cunfer v.

Adopting the reasoning advanced by the township, the court held that whatever the law may have been prior to the indicated decisions, it was now clear that in <em>all </em>condemnation proceedings, the statutory proceedings with respect thereto, provide complete protection for property owners and that, therefore, equitable relief in that area is not available.</p>
    <p id="b603-4" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[163,1079,1149,528]]]'>An analysis of the three cited cases reveals that in each of them the usual statutory remedy was indeed adequate to safeguard the property owners’ rights.

In that case the plaintiff was endeavoring to enlist “equity’s powers to aid him in obtaining the highest possible amount of condemnation damages. Needless to say, equity is an improper forum for the relief sought by appellant.” But, as we have seen, the plaintiffs here are not complaining about inadequacy of compensation. They are asserting that the contemplated condemnation proceedings rise as a catastrophic threat of irremediable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law.</p>

That the Court did not in that case state that equity would not have jurisdiction under any circumstance is indicated by the fact that I joined in the majority opinion after having previously clearly expressed my views about the nonousting of equity by my joinder in the concurring opinion in the <em>Cunfer </em>case.</p>

Bogert, 209 Pa., supra, the court said (p. 601) : ‘The most comprehensive statement of the rule and the one which has been 'followed by this court ever since its announcement in 1850 by Judge King in Bank of Virginia v. Adams, 1 Parsons, 534, is as follows: “To induce equity to refuse its aid to a suitor, it is not sufficient that he 'may have some remedy at law. An existing remedy at law to induce equity to decline the exercise of its jurisdiction in favor of a suitor must be an adequate and complete one. And when from the nature and complications of a given case, its justice can best be reached, by means of the flexible machinery of a court of equity, in short, where a full, perfect and complete remedy cannot be afforded at law, equity extends its jurisdiction in furtherance of justice.” ’ ”</p>

The statute is directed to the condemnation process itself and its various stages. There is nothing in it which suggests that it excludes or controls procedures which are separate therefrom, ancillary and preliminary thereto, or which form no part whatsoever of the condemnation process.</p>

Or to suggest quite an awesome, if overpowering illustration, if an authority, also operating under eminent domain, condemned Valley Forge or Independence Square, it would be unthinkable that the equitable sword of a chancellor could not be appealed to, to strike down the vandalistic threat to an ineffable and irreplaceable shrine of Liberty.</p>
