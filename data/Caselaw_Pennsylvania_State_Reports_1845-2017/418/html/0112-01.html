Yet there is sufficient ambiguity in the majority’s mind to warrant a mechanical and surgical dissection and recomposition of the settlor’s words based upon argumentative and speculative assertions deduced from other phrases of the instrument. I do not understand the law to distinguish between a latent ambiguity which allows the admission of relevant extrinsic evidence and one which allows only the rewriting process engaged in by the majority. Once the latent ambiguity is established, it has been thought that the settlor’s intent will be more readily fulfilled if all the surrounding facts and circumstances are developed. Undoubtedly, it is proper to search the instrument itself for the meaning of ambiguous words, but, in my view, the majority lapses back into the days before Lord Coke when “[i]t was part of the stiff formalism of earlier interpretation . . . that <em>all </em>aids to the meaning must be found <em>in the document </em>itself(Emphasis partially supplied). 9 Wigmore on Evidence §2470 (3d ed. 1940).
