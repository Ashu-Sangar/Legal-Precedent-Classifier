Plaintiffs establish neither a clear right to the funds sought nor a corresponding mandatory, ministerial duty on the part of defendants to pay those sums. Plaintiffs’ demands for payment were refused by defendants because of the right asserted by the City to set off against such funds claims by the City arising out of plaintiffs’ misconduct in office. It is true that a counterclaim may not be asserted in an action in mandamus. Pa. R. C. P. 1096. Mandamus would not be precluded, however, by the mere assertion by the City of a claim against plaintiffs if, notwithstanding such claim, plaintiffs show a clear right to the funds and a corresponding mandatory duty in defendants to pay them. However, if the City is entitled to offset any money owed or due to <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>plaintiffs with a claim of its own, then permitting plaintiffs to recover in a mandamus action would clearly be improper. This is because the claim of plaintiffs would not be clear and the duty of defendants would not be mandatory and ministerial.</p>
    <p id="b462-4" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[208,682,1154,209]]]'>On this appeal, therefore, the issue narrows to the question of whether plaintiffs’ right to the claimed payments is subject to a counterclaim or setoff by the City of Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.6",462,[206,901,1156,917]]]'>At the outset, plaintiffs assert that the City’s rights are not relevant in this action since the City is not named as a party. We do not agree. Although under our Rules of Civil Procedure the City need not be named as a party,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> such fact may not be utilized to conceal the true nature of the proceeding. The rule clearly states that it is the performance of a “public act or duty by a political subdivision of the Commonwealth” which mandamus seeks to compel. Rule 1094(a) permits the action to be brought against the public official who is designated to perform the act for the municipality. This does not mean that the act is any less that of the municipality or that the position of the municipality should not be considered in determining whether plaintiff does indeed show a clear right in himself and a corresponding duty to honor that right on the part of the municipality.</p>

If, therefore, the City has a right to assert a setoff or counterclaim against funds sought by plaintiffs, then defendants would be duty-bound to refrain from complying with plaintiffs’ demands for payment. Their obligation to the City dictates that they <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>render loyal and faithful service, protecting at all times the City’s interests. It would only be appropriate to compel defendant-city officials to pay plaintiffs if their duty to dispense the claimed funds is mandatory regardless of any countervailing interest or claim by the City. We conclude that neither the refund of plaintiffs’ pension fund payments nor the receipt of terminal vacation pay are rights enjoyed by plaintiffs which are immune from offset by a legitimate City claim.</p>
    <p id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[172,900,1148,426]]]'>The Superior Court determined that the right to the return of pension contributions was an absolute right to which no defense could properly be asserted and against which no counterclaim or offset could properly be made by the City.

But we find nothing in those sections which requires us to take the further step that because there is a right to a return of the contributions, there can not be, at the same time, a right on the part of the City to setoff a claim of its own against funds which would otherwise be payable. To the contrary, such a right is specifically reserved to the City in section 218.1 of the Retirement System Ordinance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Such a reading results in the conclusion that although misconduct may not constitute grounds for forfeiture of pension contributions, that conduct may nevertheless provide a basis upon which the City may assert' a counterclaim or a setoff against demands for the return of pension contributions.

We do not interpret the ordinance provision in such a restrictive manner. The pertinent section reads: “That the City shall have the authority to assert or offset any claim of the City against such person and the rights or benefits arising <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>from his membership under this ordinance.” Plaintiffs’ contention must rest upon an interpretation of the phrase “arising from his membership under this ordinance” as modifying and limiting “any claim of the City.” However, in the interpretation of statutes, “words and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Applying that precept in this situation, it is quite obvious that “arising from his membership under this ordinance” does not limit the type of claim which the City may assert against rights or benefits belonging to plaintiffs but, rather, merely clarifies the type of right or benefit against which the City may assert <em>any </em>claim.

The 1956 ordinance corrected that situation by providing for a practical and readily available method by which the City could recoup from one of its employees at least some portion of losses it sustains as a result of that person’s employment by the City. If the City lacked such authority, its right of recovery against the wrongdoer in this and many other instances would be, at best, a theoretical and empty one without any real possibility of satisfaction. Surely, reason, common experience, sound governmental administration and public policy dictate the justice and necessity of the authorized right contained in the ordinance to offset against funds in its control.
