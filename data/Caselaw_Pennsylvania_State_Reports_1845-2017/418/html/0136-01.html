In <em>Kurtz, Dodson, </em>and <em>Hinton, </em>each respective plaintiff found himself stalled upon the streetcar tracks through no fault of his own. In <em>Wilkerson, </em>the plaintiff’s vehicle skidded on slippery pavement (without negligence) into the path of the oncoming streetcar. In each of these cases, the compelling result is that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence because he did not wilfully block the path of the streetcar, or at least that the manner of his arrival upon a situation of danger was such as to require a jury determination of negligence vel non. In <em>Rice, </em>the plaintiff drove onto the tracks in order to blend into the flow of traffic (at a time when the streetcar was stationary, 150 feet distant, and discharging passengers), but that very flow of traffic prevented his removal from the area of danger. While voluntarily blocking the tracks at inception, the irresistible conclusion is that nonnegligence was predicated upon the involuntary manner in which he was forced to remain there. The only jury question re<a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>maining was whether he was negligent in attempting to go on his way in the first instance.</p>
    <p id="b180-4" data-blocks='[["BL_180.5",180,[182,468,1156,698]]]'>In the present case, it is perfectly clear that plaintiff voluntarily assumed a position which in fact blocked, the free passage of the streetcar, and that he remained there voluntarily until the moment of impact. . This is not a situation where the plaintiff was thrust into peril by circumstances beyond his control. Having placed himself in a position of danger in violation of The Vehicle Code, when a position of safety was equally available, plaintiffs recovery for negligent operation of the streetcar is barred by contributory negligence as a matter of law. Cf. <em>Weiner v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., </em><a href="/pa/310/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="310 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="1144239" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0415-01">310 Pa. 415</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%20252" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="165 A. 252">165 A. 252</a> (1933).</p>
    <p id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.6",180,[176,1178,1159,1077]]]'>Appellant urges upon us the contention that the violation of the present section of The Vehicle Code requires scienter, and that this element is lacking, in that he did not know that he was blocking free passage of the streetcar. In the first place, this contention ignores the very language of the regulatory section involved. That section does not penalize the “knowing obstruction”, but merely the obstruction. Nor is such a result inconsistent with the policy of the section, which is designed to regulate the flow of traffic on public thoroughfares. That the flow is interrupted unknowingly does not in any way alleviate the resulting congestion. Therefore, it is an easy step to conclude that scienter is not an element of the offense as set forth. Furthermore, as applied to negligence vel non, scienter would make the violation even more condemning. We conclude, therefore, that if the violation is a proximate cause of the damage, then it becomes contributory negligence as a matter of law by which recovery is denied.</p>

Without the negligence of either there would have been no injury. Plaintiff’s violation of the statute therefore was an ‘effective’ and ‘efficient’ cause and ‘a substantial factor in bringing about the harm’ barring his right of recovery.” So too, in the present case, had not plaintiff’s automobile been blocking the path of the streetcar, the collision would not have occurred. This is not the case where the statutory violation provided only a passive background upon which the causal negligence unfolded, as in <em>Steele v. Peoples Natural Gas Co., </em>supra, and Nettie road and stop when the streetcar was about 200 <em>Luca v. Manchester Laundry &amp; Dry Cleaning Co., </em>supra. Here, the very act of negligence on plaintiff’s part became an integral factor of the collision. The failure to observe the duty laid down by the statute was every bit as much a proximate cause of the accident as was the failure of the motorman to proceed more cautiously.</p>

Only a portion thereof jutted out into the street to obstruct safe clearance for the oncoming trolley. The proof does not disclose how much of the automobile was in the pathway of the trolley, or to what point the obstruction extended. It may well have been that only a small portion thereof was in the path of the “overhang” of the trolley. The evidence, therefore, would not warrant or permit the conclusion that the motorman knew or should have known for a sufficient period of time beforehand that a collision was inevitable, or at what point this conclusion should have <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>been reached.

The majority says that it doesn’t matter whether or not the plaintiff knew he was stopped close to the streetcar track. If, of course, the plaintiff had been reckless and indifferent as to the manner in which he stopped his car to pick up a friend, such conduct would undoubtedly have been a bar to a recovery for damages sustained. However, where the evidence is clear that the plaintiff used caution and where the evidence shows that the circumstances were such as to deceive a reasonably-minded person as to the extent of clearance from the track, his mechanical, unknowing transgression should not deprive him of his right not to have his automobile smashed by a transfer-making passenger-conversing, turned-about, woolgathering motorman.</p>
