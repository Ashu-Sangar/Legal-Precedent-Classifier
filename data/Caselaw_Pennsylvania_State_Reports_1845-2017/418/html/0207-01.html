The case at bar involves the rezoning of a parcel of land in the City of McKeesport from “ ‘E’ Residential” to “General Business”. The land in question was, for a long period, owned by the School District of the City of McKeesport, which maintained a school building thereon. The property consists of one city block, bounded by Soles, Oak, Bridge and Evans Streets, in <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>the seventh ward of the City, and measures 210 ft. x 215 ft., being 45,150 sq. ft, or 1.04 acres.</p>

Subsequent to the enactment of the 1953 Ordinance, the school use of the property was discontinued and the School District conveyed the property to Baehr Brothers. Thereafter, the city council enacted an ordinance amending the 1953 ordinance by changing the zoning classification of the property to “General Business”. In due course, Baehr Brothers applied for, and was granted, a building permit for the erection of a grocery supermarket on the rezoned premises.</p>

An appeal followed to the County Court of Allegheny County, which remanded the matter to the board for further hearing.

In <em>Cleaver, </em>supra, we approved the rezoning of some 11 acres of land, and in <em>Upper Darby Township Appeal, </em>supra, we approved the rezoning of a parcel less than 1 acre in size. In <em>Glorioso, </em>supra, we reversed the “special” zoning of a <em>4y2 </em>acre tract. Clearly, the size of the property involved is only one of the determining factors. What is most determinative is whether the parcel in question is being singled out for treatment unjustifiably differing from that of similar surrounding land, thereby creating an “island” having no relevant differences from its neighbors.</p>

The area in which the subject premises is located is <em>zoned </em>residential. It is true that, within the confines of this large residential zone, certain commercial uses exist. All such commercial establishments exist, however, as nonconforming uses and, should such uses cease, the properties could be utilized only for residential purposes. <em>French v.

The amendatory ordinance creates a commercially zoned island in a residentially zoned sea and, unless a proper basis appears for such special treatment, cannot be sustained.</p>
