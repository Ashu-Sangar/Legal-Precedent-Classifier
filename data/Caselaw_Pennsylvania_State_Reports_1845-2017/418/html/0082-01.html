Company (Bus Company), and the Union representing the bus operators (operators), employed by the Bus Company entered into a collective bargaining agreement the term of which expired on March 21, 1960. This agreement expired without renewal on March 21, 1960, and the operators went on strike. The strike was never settled, the operators performed no services after March 21, 1960 and later on the Bus Company went out of business.</p>

Eighty-three operators, who had selected vacation dates subsequent to March 21, 1960, and claimed,'compensation in lieu of “vacation pay”, instituted assumpsit actions in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County. The operators ’ and the Bus Company then agreed and stipulated that the matter be submitted to the court as a “Case Stated”. Three questions were thus presented for determination:</p>

The Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County answered questions (a) and (b) affirmatively, i.e., in favor of the operators, and entered judgments accordingly in favor of the operators and answered question (c) negatively, i.e., in favor of the Bus Company.

      <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>The vacation pay clause regulating the year that the employee quits or is dismissed creates a separate and distinct right to prorated consideration in recognition of the fact that the employee has worked part of a year but won’t be able to take his vacation. The employer’s contention that paid vacations were in consideration for continued employment does not accord with the employer’s own practice of allowing vacations at the beginning of the year of employment alleged to be the consideration for the vacation. Nor does it accord with what I think would be the legitimate expectation of an employee who was told that if he worked a year he would get two weeks’ paid vacation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The majority’s interpretation of the contract would require the employee to work a full year in order to be eligible to work another full year to earn the vacation with pay.
