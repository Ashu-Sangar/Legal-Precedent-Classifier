The Commonwealth attempts to bring its case within this exception solely on the grounds that the statutory procedure is “cumbersome” and “time consuming.” Granting, for the sake of argument only, that this is so the Commonwealth has not related such fact to the necessity for short circuiting the statutory procedure in this case. The fact would be relevant only in the event that the difference between the time required by equity processes to resolve the dispute and, if appropriate, alleviate the problem and the time required by the statutory framework makes <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>pursuit of the latter irreparably damaging in the particular case. Moreover, such irreparable damage would have to appear clearly, because to short circuit the statute is to obviate the expertise and procedures which the Legislature considered necessary for the proper resolution of the difficult problems of air pollution. We cannot lightly assume that a case by case, adversary procedure is more suited to the task of conserving and balancing the interests in air use, as envisaged by the Act, than the legislatively prescribed framework.</p>

I do not so read <em>Collegeville. </em>In <em>Collegeville, </em>we stated, 377 Pa. at 657: “Moreover, there is a very great difference between the intervention of a court of equity under the circumstances presented in the Shumaker case to prevent <em>harm to the public </em>caused by the pollution of a stream of water, and an intervention which would obstruct or prevent the conservation, control and equitable distribution of the waters of the Commonwealth for the <em>benefit of the public </em>— a function properly vested in a legislative agency with State-wide jurisdiction. In the former instance, the court is acting in consonance with the statutorily declared policy and purpose of the Legislature; in the latter instance, contrary to it.” In the case at bar, the Commonwealth is attempting to abate a situation which is causing <em>irreparable harm to the public.</em>
