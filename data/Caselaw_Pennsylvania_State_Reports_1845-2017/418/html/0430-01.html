The court held the service was not open to the indefinite public but, being confined to privileged individuals, was private in nature. Significantly, the commission itself, in <em>Camp Wohelo, Inc. v. Novitiate of St. Isaac Jogues, </em>36 Pa. P.U.C. 377 (1958), adhered to the doctrine expressed in <em>Overlook, </em>stating that “ ‘a public <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>use ... is not confined to privileged individuals, but is open to the indefinite public’ ” and that “ ‘it is this indefinite or unrestricted quality that gives it its public character.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[217,643,1158,1402]]]'>Although the present case involves the owner of an apartment complex which proposes to render service to its tenants and to no one else, the commission held that the contemplated service would not be merely incidental to the operation of Drexelbrook, but would be a separate and distinct enterprise for profit, subject to the Public Utility Law. In part, the commission based its conclusion on the fact that appellant does not propose to reserve the right to select its customers, but would obligate itself under separate and uniform contracts to furnish service to all tenants, present and future, in its development. The fallacy of this reasoning is shown in the dissenting opinion of the commission chairman which stated that the test “is not whether all tenants are being furnished service, but whether anybody among the public outside of the Drexelbrook group is privileged to demand service.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> In the present case the only persons who would be entitled to and who would receive service are those who have entered into or will enter into a landlord-tenant relationship with appellant. Here, as in <em>Aroniminh, </em>those to be serviced consist only of a special class of persons— those to be selected as <em>tenants </em>— and not a class open to the indefinite public. Such persons clearly constitute a defined, privileged and limited group and the proposed service to them would be private in nature.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

      <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>The commission concedes that a landlord would not be a public utility if its charge for utility service is included, un-itcmized, in a flat rental. The commission contends, however, that appellant’s intention to re-meter the service, charge separately for it, and malee a profit presents a “different situation” and results in the proposed service being public in nature.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> However, it is apparent that whether or not the utility charge is included in a flat rental or determined through sub-metering, it still constitutes compensation to the landlord. We fail to see how the method of computing the charge for the utility service is in any sense determinative of or relevant to the issue of whether the service is “to or for the public”. “The charge to the tenant based upon the amount which the particular tenant actually uses (as proposed in this application) is far more equitable to the tenant than imposing a hidden and unidentified item in the rental charge without any showing by the landlord of the basis on which the utility charge is calculated.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

Such reasoning disregards the express formulation of public policy by the Legislature embodied in the statutory definition of the term “public utility”. That provision confers jurisdiction on the commission <em>only </em>where the service involved is rendered “to or for the public”. The <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>controlling consideration is not whether regulation is desirable, but whether appellant is subject to regulation under the Public Utility Law. <em>Klawansky v.

If the Legislature did not deem it necessary to confer jurisdiction on the commission with respect to the service proposed by appellant (as the commission conceded for purposes of its alternative holding), then the absence of such jurisdiction as a result of the consummation of the proposed transfers would not and could not contravene public policy. Furthermore, the possible evils which the commission envisaged as a result of the absence of its supervision could come to fruition irrespective of whether a landlord originally installs facilities or later purchases them from a public utility, or whether the charge for service is on a metered basis or included in a flat rental without itemization. It seems obvious that the same projected evils which the commission majority envisaged as possibilities in the present case may be equally posited in other instances and cases previously approved by the commission and the Superior Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">21</a>

    <p id="b483-5" data-blocks='[["BL_483.7",483,[181,632,1152,857]]]'>Today the majority decides that Drexelbrook, a supplier of utility service for compensation, cannot be a public utility, within the meaning of the Public Utility Law, because those to be “serviced consist only of a special class of persons — those to be selected as tenants [of Drexelbrook] — and not a class open to the indefinite public”. “Such persons”, says the majority, “clearly constitute a defined, privileged and limited group and the proposed service to them would be private in nature.” In short, the majority’s position is that where a consumer’s receipt of utility service from a particular supplier is conditioned upon his being a tenant of that supplier, then, ipso facto, that consumer is not entitled to the assurance of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission that he will receive adequate service at a reasonable rate.</p>
    <p id="b483-6" data-blocks='[["BL_483.8",483,[184,1503,1150,903]]]'>The facts of this particular case, involving as it does thousands of consumers, residential and commercial, comprising a small community, strongly suggests the fallacy of the majority’s position. It is not difficult to envision a community of 20,000 consumers who are all tenants of a handful of landlords. The landlords would purchase utility services wholesale from the public utilities and would distribute them to their tenants at a profit. If the majority rule is correct, the handful of giant landlords comprises or is part of the consuming public whom the Public Utility Law protects from unreasonable rates and inadequate service, while the 20,000 tenants comprise a handful of “special class [es] of persons” “and not . . . the indefinite public” and, therefore, are left to the tender mercies of their landlords regarding adequate utility service at reasonable rates.</p>

      <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>Actually, if the majority is correct, then, in the preceding example, the public consumer, whom the Legislature intended to protect, has disappeared into thin air. The landlord is little more than a middleman, distributing the services for a profit. He “consumes” little if any of the service himself. He has taken the place of a distribution subsidiary of the public utility. On the other hand, the individuals who are actually consuming the service are, according to the majority, members of a “privileged class” and not the public. Thus, the public and the public interest has vanished, relieving the public utility of its duty to service the public at large, except for a handful of distributors who require little if any protection, and who, in fact and in common sense, should be regulated as a public utility while distributing utility services to those who really comprise the consuming public.</p>

In this respect, we said that those limited persons receiving water through the developer’s pipes did not constitute the “public” <em>for purposes of dedication. </em>It will be noted that in <em>Overlook </em>the consumers who did not comprise a “public” for purposes of dedication were, nevertheless, part of the “public” who were entitled to and in fact were <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>receiving service directly from a public utility and the protection of the Public Service Law.</p>

The context of both <em>Ambridge </em>and <em>Aronimink </em>is the problem of whether there is <em>competition </em>between utility suppliers in dealing with the public which may be damaging to the public interest. In that context it was decided that the supply of service to a limited group of persons was not service to the “public”.
