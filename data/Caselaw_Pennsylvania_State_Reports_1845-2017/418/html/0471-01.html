The use of the word “involuntary” in the declaration of public policy section is enlightening because the Legislature equates that word with the phrase “through no fault of their own.” Can it reasonably be said that claimants in the instant case found themselves unemployed “through no fault of their own”? Obviously not.

It is to provide protection against the “hazards of unemployment.” Clearly this refers not to unemployment arranged, agreed upon, and sanctioned by the employer and employee but, rather, to unemployment which is attendant upon the vicissitudes-of the economic climate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The purpose of the Act is to prevent the worker from becoming the innocent pawn of forces and movements beyond his control. Suffice it to say that this is a large enough undertaking without increasing the burden upon the unemployment compensation system by adding to its protective cover situations of “unemployment” devised by the employer and his employee which, by contract, are made virtually certain to occur and reoccur at regular intervals. Surely, at this stage of experience with the system, it must be obvious that a great and basic difference exists, economically and legally, between the nature of involuntary unemployment as contemplated by the Act and that “unemployment” continuously and deliberately planned and created by the contract arrangement involved at Talon.</p>

      <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>It has been pointed ont that one of the purposes of the Unemployment Compensation Law was to encourage the reduction of unemployment through the incentive of reduced employer contributions to the unemployment compensation fund for those who achieve a stabilization of employment in their businesses.

Although we recognize that this secondary aim must not take precedence over the paramount objective of providing relief to employees who leave work through no fault of their own, we are equally convinced that the employer and employee must not be permitted to create “unemployment” in order to secure payments from the unemployment compensation fund by means of a contractually agreed upon system which does not discourage unemployment but actually creates and fosters it on a periodic and continuing basis.</p>

      <em>Gianfelice </em>involved a man who, having attained the age of 68, became subject to the terms of an employer-union contract under which an employee, after reaching the age of 68, could continue work only with the consent of the employer. Not obtaining that consent, claimant filed for unemployment compensation benefits shortly after his 68th birthday. In holding that this retirement provision of claimant’s employment con<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>tract did not make the retirement voluntary, the Court’s decision carefully and wisely limited the language in the case to its facts.</p>

The agreement made him secure in his job until he reached a certain age, at which time he could be retired. In the instant case, on the other hand, we find not an effort to prolong the happening of an inevitable event which gives rise to unemployment but the creation of a new kind of event, a new condition which will, by mutual consent, automatically result in laying off workers.

This food or money was not easily forthcoming because they still had no jobs. Society lacked stability.</p>

Judge Reno responded for the Court: “The Scipani decision was rendered in 1942, and during the ensuing decade the General Assembly has twice amended §306(b). . . . Neither amendment touched the clause [interpreted in Scipani]. . . . The Scipani case is the settled law of the Commonwealth. It has acquired the virtual force of a legislative enactment. When the 1945 and 1949 legislatures amended §306(b) without touching the foundation of the Scipani case they, in effect, reenacted the quoted clause and the interpretation placed upon it by this Court. Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, §§52(4), 73, 46 P.S. §§552[4], 573. . . . ‘The question whether another formula would achieve a fairer or more just result than the one prescribed under §306 (b) of the 1939 amendment is a matter for the legislature to determine and is not within the province of this Court.’ ” This time-honored principle of the effect of judicial statutory interpretation followed by the failure of the Legislature to change the interpretation while making substantive changes <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>in other parts of the interpreted provisions — a principle which is codified in the Statutory Construction Act — could have no greater validity than in this case. One need only look at the list of counsel who appeared before this Court in <em>GianfeUce </em>in order to realize that it was one of the most important cases in the law of unemployment compensation, that the rule enunciated therein received tremendous publicity, and that no Legislature which thereafter addressed itself to the eligibility and ineligibility clauses of the Act could fail to have in mind the <em>GianfeUce </em>rule. When one adds to this the tremendous pressure that always obtains when important changes are made in workmen’s and unemployment compensation acts one cannot doubt that the statutory rule of statutory construction set forth above has its surest applicability in this case.</p>

One need only read <em>Gianfelice </em>casually to recognize that the decision therein is not limited to its facts. The sweep of the rule and the reasons for it quoted at the outset are evident. Moreover, this Court applied the rule to <em>Smith Unemployment Compensation Case, </em><a href="/pa/396/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="396 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1284922" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0557-01">396 Pa. 557</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.2d%20492" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="154 A.2d 492">154 A. 2d 492</a> (1959), where <em>the facts were very different </em>but, nevertheless, on the basis of <em>Gianfelice, </em>the collective bargaining agreement was deemed irrelevant in deciding whether termination of employment was “voluntary”. In my opinion, the majority is, sub silentio, reversing the rule of <em>Gianfelice, </em>at least for this case, and is doing so in contravention to the legislative intention as derived from obviously applicable statutory rules of statutory construction. All the major steps taken in the majority opinion are wrong under <em>GianfeUce: </em>(1) The majority ignores the factual matrix found by the Board to exist at the time of termination of employ<a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>ment for the purpose of determining whether that termination was voluntary, (2) looks to the collective bargaining agreement to determine whether termination of employment was voluntary, and (3) deems the union-employee agency relationship, with respect to bargaining, material in deciding voluntariness.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[154,693,1150,1230]]]'>I hesitate to respond directly to the majority’s reasons for ignoring <em>Gianfelice </em>and the Legislature’s intention because I believe history demonstrates that courts are weakest when they interject their own economic theories into the law. This is true because the judges’ personal theories are irrelevant and because judges are not often good economists. Nevertheless, I find it necessary to respond because the majority opinion does not even pretend to derive validity from our prior case law as approved by the Legislature but rests solely upon its own economic theory. In short, the majority’s theory is that the union and the employer have <em>created unemployment by contract where unemployment would not otherwise exist </em>and have thereby committed a fraud upon the unemployment compensation fund. The majority states absolutely no facts upon which this theory is based. All that is cited is the contract, but the contract does not disclose what the unemployment rate would be if the contract did not exist. The fact that <em>does </em>clearly appear of record as being found by the Board is <em>ignored </em>by the majority, namely, that the unemployed persons involved in this case were “available for suitable work” but unable to obtain it.</p>

      <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>Regrettably, the only way to respond to an economic theory which is unsupported by record facts is to suggest another theory which is a more plausible explanation of the terms of the contract — a contract, which, under <em>Gianfelice, </em>the majority should never have considered in the first place. The employer could only use a certain number of employees in his business. The number of persons <em>available and unemployed </em>who could perform the job was greater than the number the employer could use. In order to give more persons an opportunity to work during the year no person was allowed to work after his earnings reached $5,000. In other words, the employer and union agreed to “spread the work”. In the anthracite coal industry the work is spread on a time, rather than dollar, basis, the employees working alternate months. In other industries the retirement age is set with an eye to making room for new employees as well as an eye toward the age at which an employee loses his effectiveness. (None of these provisions for “spreading the work” involve “featherbedding” which is having more men employed at any one time than are needed to do the job.) “Spreading the work” in no way <em>creates </em>unemployment. Viewed in terms of unemployed man hours it neither increases nor decreases unemployment. All it does is to allow more persons to work over a period of time. Rather than having 50 men continuously employed and 50 men continuously unemployed all 100 men work part of the time and are unemployed part of the time.</p>

Surely the majority does not believe it is the employee’s “fault” that all the available man hours cannot be absorbed by the economy. What the majority fails to recognize is that the “spread the work” doctrine is an <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>attempt to cope with the sad fact of unemployed man hours — a fact not attributable to any “fault” on the part of the employees.</p>

But, as it now stands, the law merely requires that the employee who was “layed off” desired, <em>at the time of the layoff, </em>to continue working and that he be available for suitable work but unable to obtain it. The Board found these factual requirements to exist in this case. “[T]he findings of the Board of Review as to facts, if supported by the evidence, are conclusive. . . . Here the Board made findings of fact, stated above, which the Superior Court has disregarded despite the fact that the findings are well supported by the evidence contained in the record. The appellate courts do not exist to retry factual matters better left to determination by the administrative agencies charged with hearing the cases, and we should not begin to alter this approach now.
