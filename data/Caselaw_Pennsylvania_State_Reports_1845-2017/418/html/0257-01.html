In 1958, Robbins, Inc. agreed to do some building for Airportels, Inc. The agreement provided:</p>
    <p id="b298-10" data-blocks='[["BL_298.17",298,[203,1655,1156,687]]]'>“Art. 40. Arbitration — All disputes, claims or questions subject to arbitration under this contract shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions, then obtaining, of the Standard Form of Arbitration Procedure of The American Institute of Architects, and this agreement shall be specifically enforceable under the prevailing arbitration law, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in the court of the forum, state or federal, having jurisdiction.

      <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>Disputes arose which were submitted to a board of arbitrators. At the outset of the hearing before the arbitrators counsel for Airportels stated that his client was participating in the hearing under the Arbitration Act of 1927, Act of April 25, 1927, P. L. 381, §1, 5 P.S. §161 et seq., and intended to preserve any rights it had under the Act. Counsel for Robbins, Inc. refused to stipulate that the Act of 1927 applied to the proceedings. The arbitrators made an award in favor of Robbins. Robbins demanded payment from Airportels but was refused. Thereafter, Robbins, plaintiff-appellant, brought suit on the award and demanded a judgment against Airportels, defendant-appellee. The latter preliminarily objected upon the grounds that the Arbitration Act of 1927 provided the exclusive method for the enforcement of the award and that Robbins’ suit to enforce the award was premature because, under the Act, Airportels had three months to appeal from the award, which period had not expired. The lower court sustained the objections and dismissed the complaint.</p>

The question is important, because, as the cases indicate, the scope of judicial review of a common law award differs from the review accorded to an award under the Act of 1927: <em>Freeman v.

    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[211,731,1156,862]]]'>It is well settled that the Arbitration Act of 1927 did not abolish the applicability of common law rules to the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate and awards rendered under such agreements; the purpose of the Act was to provide what the Legislature deemed a more efficient method of enforcing arbitration agreements and awards than was provided by the common law. <em>Freeman v. Ajax Foundry Products, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Rosenbaum v.

Therefore, the parties <em>may </em>provide, <em>in their agreement to arbitrate, </em>either that the common law or the Act of 1927 shall be applicable to the enforceability of that agreement or awards rendered under it.</p>
    <p id="b300-5" data-blocks='[["BL_300.6",300,[209,1603,1160,641]]]'>The exception to this rule is provided in §16 of the Arbitration Act of 1927, supra, 5 P.S. §176. Here the Legislature has made it mandatory that the Act of. 1927 shall apply to arbitration agreements to which “the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or any agency or subdivision thereof, or any municipal corporation or political division of the Commonwealth shall be a party.” <em>Philadelphia Housing Authority v.

M. Davis Company v. Shaler Township, </em>supra, contained the sweeping language that “[w]hen the parties entered into the arbitration agreement . . . they ipso facto embodied in that agreement all of the provisions of the Arbitration Act.” The language was not applied by this Court in the following year in <em>Sukonik v. Shapiro, </em>supra, or thereafter. In <em>Lowengrub v. Meislin, </em><a href="/pa/376/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="376 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="1246206" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0463-01">376 Pa. 463</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.2d%20405" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="103 A.2d 405">103 A. 2d 405</a> (1954), we pointed out that the <em>J. M. Davis Company </em>case had been “limited” by later cases. And, in <em>Philadelphia Housing Authority v. Turner Construction Company, </em>supra, <em>J. M. Davis Company </em>was cited as a case involving a “public” contract, where, as described above, §16, <em>does </em>“write” the Arbitration Act into the parties’ agreement. Thus, the sweeping language of <em>J. M. Davis Company </em>can no longer be considered good authority outside the area of “public” contracts. Rather, the import of the cases is that when the agreement to arbitrate is not by itself determinative of the issue then common law rules regulate the enforcement of the agreement and the award, unless, subsequent to the agreement, the parties, expressly or by implication, further agree that the Act of 1927 shall govern. See <em>Harwitz v. Selas Corporation of America, </em><a href="/pa/406/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="406 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1304854" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0539-01">406 Pa. 539</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.2d%20617" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="178 A.2d 617">178 A. 2d 617</a> (1962); <em>Freeman v.

In so holding it was noted, <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>in all of these eases, that <em>neither </em>of the parties had attempted to follow the Act in any particular.
