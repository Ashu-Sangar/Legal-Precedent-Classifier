In part, similar considerations moved us in <em>Haines v.

Rather if the general authority to ‘sue and be sued’ is to be delimited by implied exceptions, it must be clearly shown that certain types of suits are not consistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme, that an implied restriction of the general authority is necessary to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function, or that for other reasons it was plainly the purpose of Congress to use the ‘sue and be sued’ clause in a narrow sense. In the absence of such showing, it must be presumed that when Congress launched a governmental agency into the commercial world and endowed it with authority to ‘sue and be sued,’ that agency is not less amenable to judicial process than a private enterprise under like circumstances would be.” p. 245</p>

The general contractor was comprised of a domestic corporation and two foreign ones. The group dealt with Central as a joint venture, as evidenced by such designation in its contract with Central. Thus, it was proper for Central to bring its suit on the contract against the joint venture as the party-defendant. And, presumably, its attachment was directed against assets belonging to the joint venture but in the hands of the Housing Authority. While the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure do not set forth how a plaintiff should serve a joint venture or when its assets are subject to foreign attachment, we are of the opinion that the corresponding Rules regulating partnerships are applicable, until the Rules expressly provide otherwise.</p>

(2) the defendant is a partnership . . . without a regular place of business in the Commonwealth and the action is against the defendant in its firm . . . name, even though one or more members of the partnership . . . are present in or are residents of the Commonwealth.....” Applying this Rule to a joint venture it appears that its assets are not subject to foreign attachment when it has a regular place of business in <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>the Commonwealth. What constitutes a regular place of business must be decided first by the trial judge in view of all the surrounding circumstances. Of course, the decision must be made in the context of the activities of a joint venture, the scope of which, by definition, is more limited than that of a partnership. Depending upon the circumstances, a regular place of business for the joint venture might be at the regular place of business of one of the participants in the joint venture or at a location apart from that of any of the participants or both. If the lower court finds that the joint venture has a regular place of business in the Commonwealth it must dissolve the attachment.</p>

If Crump’s principal place of business is not a regular place of business of the joint venture and there is no regular place of business in the Commonwealth, then the foreign attachment of the joint venture’s assets was proper and jurisdiction over Central’s dispute with the joint venture has been obtained.

However, we do not agree with these cases to the extent that they hold that an agreement between the parties, purporting to determine the forum where future disputes between them should be litigated, is per se invalid and without legal effect. The modern and correct rule is that, while private parties may not by contract prevent a court from asserting its jurisdiction or change the rules of venue, nevertheless, a court in which venue is proper and which has jurisdiction should decline to proceed with the cause when the parties have freely agreed that litigation shall be conducted in another forum and where such agreement is not unreasonable at the time of litigation.

For present purposes, the pertinent parts of the arbitration provisions provide: “33(b). If the Subcontractor [Central] is contending that the work in question is not included in this subcontract . . . the matter shall be determined by negotiation between the parties involved and, if the said parties cannot agree, the matter shall be determined by arbitration pursuant to Paragraphs 54, 55 and 56 below. . . .</p>

Central asserted in subsequent pleading that defendant could not invoke the arbitration clauses because it had failed to “negotiate” the dispute in accordance with Paragraph 33(b).

See also 93 A.L.E. 1073. Because the lower court has not reached and may find it unnecessary to reach this question and because it has not been fully argued or briefed we do not find it appropriate to discuss it here. However, we note in passing that we find no merit in Central’s contention that defendant may not even invoke the arbitration clauses because of its failure to “negotiate” the dispute. In our opinion, Paragraph 33(b) does not make negotiation a precondition to arbitration. A contrary conclusion would ascribe to the parties an irrational intention to prevent arbitration when they most need it, i.e., when they are at such odds that they cannot even negotiate about their differences. The language does not command such a result and, in view of its irrationality, we will not so interpret it. Moreover, we have no way of determining what the parties intended by the word “negotiation” and, therefore, could not enforce it.</p>
