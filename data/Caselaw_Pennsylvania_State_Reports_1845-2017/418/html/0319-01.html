The Court said (page 498) : “The same principles of public policy enunciated in Mineo, supra, and Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, supra, apply with equal force to the present case. The defendant was presented with more than ample opportunity to overcome the charges lodged against him while he was swathed in a cloak of presumed innocence. His case was twice presented to a federal jury which found him <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>guilty of extortion beyond a reasonable doubt, upon tbe same facts which are now urged as the basis for his civil liability. To now hold that the effect of those jury determinations is nil not only would be to fly in the face of reason, but also <em>would be a general indictment of the whole American jury system.”</em>

The correct rule in these “Slayer” cases is that the record of her conviction includes the indictment, the verdict of the jury, the judgment and sentence of the Court, and any decision, order and judgment of this Court and of the Supreme Court of the United States.

The rule set forth in <em>Stirone </em>is diametrically opposed to <em>Zubrod v.

The rule of conclusiveness in <em>Stirone </em>is unjust because it unduly emphasizes the policy of diminishing litigation. It does not sufficiently take into account the fallibility of juries, advocates and judges involved in any proceeding. Further, only the criminal is bound by the “truth” established in the criminal proceeding; I do not understand the majority here or in <em>Stirone </em>to suggest that an acquittal in the criminal proceeding conclusively establishes the facts upon which it is based when introduced in a civil proceeding not involving the same parties. In other words, with respect to its effect on future separate causes of actions <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>between different parties, tbe criminal proceeding is a one-way street against the interests of tbe defendant; any error in finding tbe “truth” is conclusive in tbe future only if tbe “truth” is adverse to tbe defendant.</p>

In this case we are not dealing with Pennsylvania’s <em>common law </em>rules of evidence but, instead, with a <em>statutory provision </em>which regulates use of certain specified items of evidence in a proceeding to determine tbe right of inheritance— a subject entirely regulated by statute. Tbe Slayer’s Act of 1941 provides that “[n]o slayer shall in any way acquire any property or receive any benefit as tbe result of tbe death of tbe decedent. . . ,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> It defines a “slayer” as one “who participates, either as a principal or as an accessory before the fact, in tbe wilful and unlawful killing of any- other person”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Section 14 of tbe Act provides: “Tbe <em>record </em>of bis conviction of having participated in tbe wilful and unlawful killing of tbe decedent shall be <em>admissible in evidence </em>against a claimant of property in any civil action arising under this act.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

Up to the time of the enactment of the Slayer’s Act of 1941, the Intestate Act of 1917 had provided that a person “who shall be finally adjudged guilty of murder” of the decedent could not inherit from him; and in <em>Tarlo’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/315/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="315 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1156734" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0321-01">315 Pa. 321</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.%20139" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="172 A. 139">172 Atl. 139</a> (1934), we held that this provision meant that if the claimant had not been criminally convicted of the crime he could not be barred from inheriting. Obviously, therefore, under the 1917 statute the <em>only </em>way to prove that the claimant was barred as a slayer was to introduce his conviction into Orphans’ Court. The common law, at the time when the 1941 Act was passed, provided that a criminal conviction was inadmissible in civil proceedings for purposes of proving facts established in the criminal proceeding. <em>Zubrod v. Kuhn, </em>supra. The Slayer’s Act of 1941 was designed to change the rule of <em>Tarlo’s Estate, </em>permitting the fact of the claimant’s involvement in decedent’s death to be established in Orphans’ Court for purposes of determining his right to inherit, rather than requiring a criminal conviction. The question remained regarding the weight to be given to a prior criminal conviction where one existed. Confronted with two clear alternatives of making it <em>conclusive, </em>as under the 1917 Act, or <em>inadmissible </em>as under the common law, the Legislature chose a third alternative in §14, to make it merely <em>“admissible in </em>evidenceThus, it codified the rule that the conviction is admissible but not conclusive on the question of whether one is a slayer for purposes of inheriting; and the ultimate fact is to be determined in orphans’ court.</p>

Moreover, in relying on common law cases rather than solely on the statute, the majority assumes unto the courts the regulation of the right to inherit — a matter that had always been thought to be strictly within the province of the Legislature. <em>Carpenter’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/170/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="170 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="872239" data-case-paths="/pa/170/0203-01">170 Pa. 203</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.%20637" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="32 A. 637">32 Atl. 637</a> (1895); <em>Tarlo’s Estate, </em>supra.
