Cesare, deceased, brought this action under the wrongful death and survival acts to recover damages suffered by reason of the death of said Thomas W. Cesare. Cesare suffered fatal injuries while riding as a passenger in an automobile operated by the defendant, Potts, when it collided with another automobile operated by the defendant, Cole, on Route 512 at its intersection with Township Route 634 in the Township of Bushkill.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At all relevant times, Cole was employed by the Township of Bushkill as a laborer. The sole issue involved on this appeal is whether or not the plaintiff produced enough evidence on the question of whether Cole was within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident so as to require the submission of the liability of the township to the jury. We agree with the court below that the plaintiff <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>has not met her burden and the motion to remove the nonsuit was properly refused.</p>

Illustration 4 thereunder states: “The master agrees with A, his servant, to pay for A’s transportation upon public vehicles such as railway trains and street cars. As an alternative, A is permitted to use his own automobile for transportation, charging to the master the regular train fare. A is paid by the week, with indefinite hours of labor. In going to a place at <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>which he is to perform work for the master, A drives his own car, carrying thereon necessary tools and materials belonging to the master. In the absence of evidence that A owes P any duty of obedience in the details of operating the automobile, such driving is not within the scope of employment.”</p>
    <p id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.5",216,[204,695,1157,643]]]'>In the present case, other transportation was paid for (i.e., free transportation by township truck was provided), and we can assume at least an implied permission to Cole to use his own automobile. Militating even more strongly against the plaintiff’s position here than the aforecited illustration, however, is the fact that there was no agreed reimbursement for the travel, nor was there any evidence that on the day in question Cole was carrying any “necessary tools”. It is clear that Cole owed no duty of obedience in driving his automobile, and such, therefore, was not within the scope of employment.</p>
    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.6",216,[202,1349,1156,584]]]'>Liability attaches to a master by reason of a servant’s negligent injury of a third person only when the servant is acting within the scope of his employment: Restatement (2d), Agency, §219, and <em>Klovacs v.

It is unquestioned that Cole was a servant of the township on the day in question and that, at the moment of the accident, he was being paid his hourly wage. The question still remains, however, whether in driving to the area of work in his own automobile he was acting within the scope of his employment.</p>

In the former, we said (p. 120) : ‘To hold a master legally re<a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>sponsible for the act of a servant who is engaged in furthering his master’s business and who while doing so negligently uses some instrumentality that carries him from place to place, it must either be proved that the master exercises <em>actual or potential control </em>over that instrumentality, or the use of the instrumentality at the time and place of the act complained of must be of <em>such vital importance </em>in furthering the business of the master that the latter’s actual or potential control of it at that time and place may reasonably be inferred.’ (Italics supplied.) In the course of the latter opinion, we said (p. 244) : ‘If, in the course of his work, an employee travels as a passenger in a train, trolley car or taxicab, he does not expose his employer to the risk of financial responsibility for accidents to other persons, and if the employee, merely for his own convenience, chooses to transport himself in his own automobile, his employer, who has not hired him to drive a car, should not be subjected to such potential liability. Therefore, unless the employee is <em>directed </em>by the employer to <em>use his car </em>for the purpose of traveling from place to place, or unless the circamstances are such that it is reasonably <em>necessary </em>for him to so travel instead of by train or other common carrier, the use of the car is not within the scope of the employment and the employer is not liable for injuries occasioned thereby to third persons.’ This ruling fits the present case as though made in it.” (Emphasis as in original.)</p>

And when we consider the nature of Cole’s employment, the vital importance or even the reasonable necessity of the use of his own automobile to the township disappears. Cole was a laborer, purely and simply, and his duty, on July 30, 1963, was to perform his labors upon Township Route 634. He was not a real estate salesman, required to <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>contact prospective customers and transport them to the site of possible purchase, as in <em>Gozdonovic v.

And in each of those cases, the employer’s liability was negated on the grounds that there was no potential control and none could be inferred from the vital importance or reasonable necessity to the employer’s business.

Cole was not requested or required by the township to use his own automobile, and its use was not only not reasonably necessary, it was totally unnecessary. The township supplied its employees with transportation, but this was ignored by Cole. Furthermore, Cole was not engaged in any activity on behalf of the township other than getting himself to the job site. While there is some testimony that Cole carried his own tools at times for use on township projects (for what reason it does not appear of record), there is no indication that he was doing so this day, or that he was required to do so. Although being paid for the time consumed while driving, Cole was not being paid for the driving itself, and he would have been equally paid had he been riding on the township truck. In so driving his automobile to the area of work, Cole was not acting within the scope of his employment, and therefore, no liability could attach to the township for negligently so doing.</p>
