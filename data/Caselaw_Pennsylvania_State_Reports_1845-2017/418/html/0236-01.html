The second witness testified to the execution of the codicil but stated that the testator was unconscious at the time. Against the contention that the will was not proved by the two subscribing witnesses and that the third subscribing witness should have been called, the trial court held that the execution of the codicil was proved by two witnesses and that the question of testamentary capacity was then for the jury to determine. This Court affirmed, saying: “But proof of the facts necessary to constitute authentication is not to be confounded with proof of mental soundness, or freedom of the will.” <a href="/pa/38/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="38 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="994119" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0138-01">38 Pa. at 143</a>.

Because, says the plaintiff in error, the same witness testified that Mr. Towar was unconscious when he made the signature. But was the court to disregard the proof of the fact of signature, because the witness denied the existence of mental capacity?

The Register of Wills Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> makes it patently clear that the “proving” of a will is simply the process by which the authenticity of testator’s signature is established. The Act provides that if the subscribing witnesses are not readily available, then, with a will signed by testator, proof of testator’s signature is to be preferred to proof of the signature of the subscribing witnesses. However, if proof of a will required, as appellant must contend, an express or implied affirmation of testator’s mental capacity by the subscribing witnesses, then surely proof of the signature of the testator alone could never be sufficient to prove a will.</p>

Necessarily, such proof does not contemplate an attestation as to testator’s mental capacity but only proof of the fact that the signature affixed to the testamentary instrument is that of the testator.
