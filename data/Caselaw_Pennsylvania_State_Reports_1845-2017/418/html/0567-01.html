The track area along the station platform was well lighted, and in addition, the headlight on the train illuminated the tracks for a distance of 200 feet ahead. He specifically stated that he did not realize that there was a human being lying in the tracks until “the last moment” and that it was then too late to stop the train in time to avoid the accident. If his testimony were limited to this explanation, the plaintiff would have not made out a case. See, <em>Zawacki v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/374/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="374 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1241472" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0089-01">374 Pa. 89</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.2d%2063" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="97 A.2d 63">97 A. 2d 63</a> (1953). However, in another portion of his testimony Forsythe admitted seeing “an object” lying between the rails when the train was still 88 feet distant therefrom, and in still another instance, he stated that he first saw “the object” when the train rounded the curve leading to the station platform, or from a distance of 168 feet away. In either <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>event, 168 feet or 88 feet, both were points at which the train could have been stopped safely before striking the decedent. The train was traveling at about 10 miles an hour and the evidence established that it could have been stopped within a distance of 24 to 38 feet. It did not so stop and continued on until 65 to 70 feet of the train had passed over the decedent’s body. Under such facts, it was for the jury to say whether or not wanton misconduct was present.</p>
    <p id="b613-3" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[163,866,1151,1062]]]'>Appellant contends that in order for wanton misconduct to exist it was necessary to establish that the train’s operator had actual knowledge of the decedent’s presence on the tracks for a sufficient period of time before the accident to give him a reasonable opportunity to take means to avoid the accident, and that the evidence is fatally lacking in this respect. As pointed out before, the evidence is clear that the operator saw an unusual object lying in the tracks in the path of the train at a time when it was sufficiently far away to stop and avoid the accident. On the basis thereof, the jury would be warranted in finding that a reasonable man, operating this train, would have been more diligent in trying to ascertain the particular nature of the object which he knew to be within the range of his unchangeable path, and the failure to do so, especially in view of the contiguity of the passenger platform, was a reckless disregard for the safety of anyone who might be there. This, in our opinion, would constitute wilful misconduct.</p>
    <p id="b613-4" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[166,1949,1149,427]],["BL_614.1",614,[192,423,1156,695]]]'>It is true that in several instances this Court has described wilful misconduct as a reckless disregard for the trespasser’s safety after actual knowledge of his peril.

However, these decisions have all erroneously equated wilful misconduct with wanton misconduct, used the terms interchangeably and ignored the patent difference. Correctly <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>speaking, wilful misconduct means that the actor desired to bring about the result that followed, or at least that he was aware that it was substantially certain to ensue. This, of course, would necessarily entail actual prior knowledge of the trespasser’s peril. Wanton misconduct, on the other hand, “means that the actor has intentionally done an act of an unreasonable character, in disregard of a risk known to him or so obvious that he must be taken to have been aware of it, and so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow. It usually is accompanied by a conscious indifference to the consequences . . . .” Prosser, Torts §33 at 151' (2d ed. 1955).</p>

The inference was that, if it had been proved that the light was functioning, then to ignore it would have been wanton misconduct, showing a reckless disregard for the safety of those on the track ahead. The Court implied that this would have been the result though there was no <em>actual knowledge </em>of the peril (i.e., even though the stopped train itself had not been seen until it was too late to avoid the collision). The crucial point, then, in determining wantonness would seem to be whether or not the actor had sufficient warning of the possibility of peril. And actual knowledge thereof would thus constitute only one manner of apprisal, along with other various means.</p>

The closest he seems to have come is the neutral statement, <em>“We have heard discussion </em>that where a man is a trespasser, that the only duty of the defendant is to avoid wilful and wanton negligence.” (Emphasis added.) While thereafter defining “wanton negligence”, he nowhere states that it is the criterion upon which defendant’s liability is to be tested. Furthermore, the issue is additionally confused by repeated references to the defendant’s negligence in later portions of the charge. Manifestly, negligence is not at issue in this case, involving the duty owed to a “trespasser”.

This Court said that the decedent’s carelessness amounted to contributory negligence as a matter of law: “For decedent to have walked alongside the streetcar track and in close proximity to it, with his back to approaching cars, and without making the necessary observations to protect himself, was so clearly negligence on his part which contributed to the happening of the accident that the court was justified in declaring it to be such as a matter of law.”</p>

And recorded experience through the centuries reveals that unless there is some obvious reason to establish the contrary, the person who fails to offer an explanation, when he is charged with misconduct, runs the risk of having the world believe that he has no satisfactory explanation to produce. Of course, we know that many a blameless person is accused of misbehavior of one character or another, but it still remains true that unless there exists a palpable reason for sealing one’s lips, the world expects speech when the finger is lifted to accuse. We are not here considering the constitutional provision that no person is required to reply to any question which might subject him to criminal prosecution.”</p>

Forsythe stated, under examination by plaintiff’s counsel, that he saw a man on the track when he was 88 feet away. Yet he did not stop the train before reaching him, indeed, until he had passed over him with slaughtering effects. The company’s lawyer could have asked Forsythe if there was a failure of brakes, whether the brakes had been inspected, whether the lighting was such that he could <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>not distinguish the form of a human being. He could have asked him if he did everything humanly possible to avoid striking the prostrate figure on the tracks. There were innumerable questions defendant’s counsel could have put to Forsythe in attempted mitigation of the testimony he had given when questioned by plaintiff’s counsel.</p>
    <p id="b635-3" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[158,748,1151,1287]]]'>The jury had the right to infer from the defendant’s failure to call Forsythe as a witness that what he said in his examination by plaintiff’s counsel was true, and that he had no modification to offer against that testimony. The majority admits that the plaintiff did not ask the witness at what point he applied the brakes to stop the train. Why didn’t the defendant’s counsel ask that very pertinent, crucial question? The failure of the defendant to put only that one decisive question was enough to justify the application of the rule under consideration. The only possible inference that can be drawn from the defendant’s counsel failure to ask that extremely pivotal crucial question is that he assumed or knew that the answer would undoubtedly have been damaging to the railway company. Defendant’s counsel was astute in not asking that question or any other question. Forsythe had already revealed, when questioned by plaintiff’s counsel, his ineptness, negligence and lack of care at the time of the accident. Defendant’s counsel did not intend to drive further nails into the coffin lid of the defendant’s case by asking further questions. Any first year law student would see this fundamental strategy on the part of defendant’s counsel. The majority seems to miss it.</p>

And one of those rules is that a party which fails to put an important witness on the stand takes the chance of an unfavorable inference being drawn against it because of that failure. All this is ABC in <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>trial by jury, but it seems to escape the majority. For tbe majority to base an order for a long, expensive new trial on so flimsy and feeble a foundation as the one announced in this reason is to play at sixes and sevens with trial by jury.</p>

This means that in ordering a new trial two weeks more will be consumed in litigating a controversy already litigated, it will mean adding a mammoth log to the gigantic backlog of untried cases, it will méan the retrial of a case without precise direction as to how the case should be retried, which could mean another appeal, another re-reversal of a verdict, and, therefore another retrial, and' another prolonged, protracted drawing out of a legal controversy which has already been decided. If Hamlet lamented over the “law’s delays,” in 1602, I should like to hear him on the snail’s gallop of the law in 1965, with particular asides on the case of <em>Evans v. Philadelphia Transportation Company! </em>And it would indeed be engrossing also to hear him comment, in iambic pentameter, on self-assumed monarchical usurpation of unwarranted judicial power, all so evident in. this case.</p>

If so, would a reasonable man have acted as the PTC’s driver acted? It seems to me a reasonable jury could answer the first question affirmatively and the second negatively and, therefore, I would affirm the imposition of liability upon the PTC. As is pointed out by the Pennsylvania Annotation to §336 and Eldredge, Tort Liability To Trespassers, 12 Temple L. Q. 32 (1937), Modern Tort Problems .163 (1941), “wilfulness or wantonness” is merely a characterization of the conduct of a possessor who is negligent toward a trespasser of whose presence he is or should be aware.</p>

It seems unrealistic to require no greater duty toward passengers or potential passengers invited into the area of the subway platform than is required toward individuals who come onto or into the area of railway tracks uninvited and undesired. The PTC should have a duty to watch out for persons in positions of danger in the platform area. In fact, in most instances it probably acts like it has such a duty.</p>
