Plaintiffs contend, therefore, that this is tantamount to a renunciation by the Legislature of <em>its </em>duty to put standards in the Act. This argument, however, merely manifests an artful play on the word “standard”. What is clearly contemplated with standards required for a legislative delegation of duties is that the Legislature establish the norms and basic policy lines which the administrators must follow. This the Legislature did in the 1963 Act. On the other hand, when the Legislature authorizes the State Board to prepare the “standards” upon which organization plans will be approved, what is called for is simply the implementation of the legislative policy by means of an elaboration in more specific detail of the criteria set forth in the Act. We find nothing objectionable in such a delegation in this case in light of the standards and factors provided by the Legislature.</p>

This phrase takes on added meaning and substance when considered, as it must be, in its statutory context. Reference to the policy determinations which permeate the Act clearly limit and define the area of Council discretion in determining what is “wise in the best interest of the Commonwealth.”</p>

As this Court noted,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> the term “blighted” was to be interpreted by the administrative unit in light of the Legislature’s declaration that: “ ‘there exist in urban communities in this Commonwealth areas which have become blighted because of the unsafe, unsanitary, inadequate or overcrowded condition of the dwellings therein, or because of inadequate planning of the area, or excessive land coverage by the buildings thereon, or the lack of proper light and air and open space, or because of the defective design and arrangement of the buildings thereon, or faulty street or lot layout, or economically or socially undesirable land uses.’ ” See <a href="/pa/357/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="357 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="472112" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0329-01">357 Pa. at 333</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20A.2d%20277" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="54 A.2d 277">54 A. 2d at 279</a>.

Surely, different legislative and administrative treatment may be accorded different districts by virtue of factors other than those contained in §34.

The people have directed that the cause of public education cannot be fettered, but must evolute or retrograde with succeeding generations as the times prescribe. Therefore all matters, whether they be contracts bearing upon education, or legislative determinations of school policy or the scope of educational activity, everything directly related to the maintenance of a ‘thorough and efficient system of public schools,’ must at all times be subject to future legislative control.

It has such rights, and such only, as are conferred upon it by its creator. True it is for some purposes a legal entity but becomes such solely by the operation of law, and so cannot assume, as such entity, the rights, privileges and immunities which be<a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>long to the individuals composing the legal entity as natural persons.
