In this action, appellee’s four children, then all minors, were joined and a guardian ad litem appointed for them.

      <em>have been </em>under a legal disability at the time and that, even though it was not clear from the complaint that fraud, duress, coercion or undue influence had been exerted upon appellee, the complaint was not so defective as to justify its <em>summary </em>dismissal. Critical in our determination of that appeal were the averments in the complaint that on February 4, 1953 and on June 24, 1960, a Florida court had found that appellee had been incompetent since March 30, 1950— thirteen months prior to the execution of the trust agreements and assignment — and our doubt, arising from the pleadings, of the impact on the question' of laches of the decree of the Pennsylvania court which found appellee competent on March 18, 1955 — over five years prior to the institution of the equity action.</p>

Moreover, in view of the paucity of the facts before us, we could not determine the impact on laches of the finding of appellee’s competence by the Pennsylvania court on March 18, 1955.

Under the testimony of Judge Phillips, personally knowledgeable of both the 1953 and 1960 proceedings as well as of the applicable law of Florida, neither the order of February 4, 1953, nor the order of June 24, 1960, established appellee’s incompetency on any date prior to February 4, 1953. On March 18, 1955, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, appellee’s county of residence and domicil, found that appellee was at that time “able to handle her own personal affairs” and it is undisputed that since at least March 18, 1955, appellee has acted as a normal person.

When the Florida court, on February 4, 1953, found that the appellee was incompetent such incompetency was expressly restricted to her conduct caused by excessive drinking. A study of the report of the commission appointed by the Florida court reveals clearly such limitation of its opinion as to her incompetency.

During the second period, appellee continued her drinking but was not adjudged by the Florida court incompetent by reason of inebriacy until ten months after the challenged instruments were executed; she was hospitalized in three different institutions; adjudged in Pennsylvania an “inebriate”; finally, at the end of the period, appellee was found capable of handling her own affairs, a finding which implicitly recognized good behavior for some time prior to March <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>18, 1955.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> During the third period — a period of almost five and one-half years — appellee’s behavior was that of a normal person.</p>
