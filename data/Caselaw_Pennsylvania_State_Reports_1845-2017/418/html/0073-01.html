Under the Act of March 21, 1806, P. L. 558, 4 Sm. L. 326, 46 P.

L. 23, §1, 12 P.S. §672. The majority supports this proposition with <em>White v. Young, </em><a href="/pa/402/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="402 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="1296634" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0061-01">402 Pa. 61</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.2d%20663" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="166 A.2d 663">166 A. 2d 663</a> (1960), which was based upon <em>Korona v. Bensalem Township, </em><a href="/pa/385/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="385 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="1267056" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0283-01">385 Pa. 283</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%20688" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="122 A.2d 688">122 A. 2d 688</a> (1956). But these cases involved dismissal of objections based upon “adequate remedy at law” which (until 1937) were provided for by the Act of June 7, 1907, P. L. 440, 12 P.S. §1227, and were expressly excluded from the operation of the Act of 1925, supra, by §4 thereof. Objections based upon “exclusive statutory procedures,” on the other hand, are not excluded from the operation of the Act of 1925 and since the objection raises a “true question of jurisdiction” its disposition is appealable under the Act of 1925.</p>

There is a complete statutory scheme for the regula<a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>tion of the subject matter. The statute, under which the taxing ordinance was passed, specifically provides, inter alia, for a method of appealing from the enactment of the ordinance to the courts of quarter sessions within thirty days of the adoption of the ordinance. Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145, §3, as amended, 53 P.S. §6853. Moreover, the ordinance itself, in §9 thereof, charges the treasurer with the administration and enforcement of the ordinance and provides that any person aggrieved by any decision of the treasurer shall have the right of appeal to the court of common pleas as in other cases provided.</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[215,1017,1156,521]]]'>In my opinion, the disposition of the questions— whether constitutional or otherwise — arising under the amusement tax ordinance should be heard in the context of the procedures set forth in the statute and/or the ordinance and that equity has no power over the subject matter. Moreover, in this case, no exception is applicable, as in <em>Philadelphia Life, </em>because the procedures provided are adequate to the task and plaintiff would suffer no irreparable harm by pursuing them.</p>
    <p id="b122-5" data-blocks='[["BL_122.6",122,[216,1558,1152,96]]]'>Therefore, I would sustain the preliminary objections to equity’s jurisdiction in this case.</p>
