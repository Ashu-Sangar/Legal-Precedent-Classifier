But by prescribing the time and place for holding the election, and by appointing a master to supervise it, and to see that it was lawfully held, the trial court itself provided an opportunity for all stockholders to exercise their lawful rights. Only votes which were offered, and to which objection was made, could become the subject of consideration. It could not be known beforehand whether any objection to any of the votes offered, Would be made. The power of a court of chancery to control and supervise the election of directors was invoked in this case, in advance of the election, to prevent fraud or force, and to make sure that the right of each stockholder to vote if questioned, should be passed upon by an impartial and disinterested person, Whose decision was subject to immediate review and correction by the court. The master was in this case merely the executive or administrative arm of the court. The abuse which was corrected in abolishing the office of master in chancery, in so far as its general use is concerned, was well known and recognized.

There the court said at page 487: “It is true, counsel for the railroad company appeared and consented to the appointment of the master; but our rules of practice are not to be disregarded even by consent, and, even if they could, in the present case the attorney for the company had no authority to speak for the stockholders, who were the only parties directly affected by the court’s order. ...”</p>

Both had served notice against the voting of the stock by the other, which consequently prevented either one from voting. The remaining 20 shares of stock were owned by Morton J. Sablosky, who was not in agreement with Samuel Shapiro. The Samuel Shapiro interests seized control of the corporation in November, 1962. He voted the 40 shares of stock even though Edna Shapiro, his wife, objected to his doing so. Morton J. Sablosky was unable to vote his 20 shares because of a consent decree entered in one of the other legal actions, by which he agreed not to vote his shares during the pe<a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>riod the decree was in effect.

Ott, Esquire, be appointed by the court to act and function as master in this case.” Of course, master in chancery had been abolished in 1894, and any functions of a judicial nature as performed by a master in chancery were abolished. The name master, however, has persisted with sometimes well-defined duties, and at other times with no particular definition. In this case, however, the parties, by stipulation, outlined the duties of Mr. Ott, who was named master. His function by that agreement was to perform certain duties under the jurisdiction of the chancellor, and not as a substitute for the chancellor. It is necessary in some equitable actions for the court to avail itself of persons who can see to the performance of certain duties, either defined and outlined by the court, or by agreement of the parties and approved by the court, just so long as those duties are not judicial. The record indicates that Mr. Ott supervised the collection and distribution of receipts of the theatre, and otherwise supervised the personnel operating the theatre. He held numerous meetings and conferences and decided upon the time to hold the meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing the Board of Directors, and acted as chairman and judge of that election when new directors were <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>elected. In the performance of his duties, it was necessary for him to acquaint himself with the numerous corporate and legal maneuvering^ of the parties, which required him to examine the minutes of meetings and all of the incidental legal papers emanating from the activities of the parties engaged in this litigation. The record indicates the chancellor had before him all of the evidence and documents involved in this litigation that were material to the determination of the controversy. There was, practically speaking, no testimony from which disputed facts were to be decided, the questions being legal ones. The record also indicates that while the master filed his report, the chancellor made his own determination, which agreed with the report of Mr. Ott.</p>
    <p id="AE" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[208,1183,1158,901]]]'>Appellants complain that the master was without any authority to make any factual or legal determinations. However, the determinations, factual and legal, were made in a judicial proceeding by the chancellor, and not by the master. In this instance, the person called the master was actually performing a function as an arm of the Court, under the direction and supervision of the Court. It is true, as argued by appellants, that the authority of a master could not be supplied by consent or otherwise. We said in Tetter, page 487: “Our rules of practice are not to be disregarded even by consent.” If the agreement for the master and his functions and duties violated Rule 1514, the stipulation would have been of no effect. However, the agreement entered into did not violate the rule, nor did the master go beyond the function agreed to in the stipulation.</p>

He also held invalid meetings of the board of directors and officers elected at that meeting of November, 1962. He also held invalid certain changes in the bylaws attempted to be enacted by the board of directors elected at the meeting of November 26, 1962. The chancellor declared the meeting of November 5, 1963, to be a proper meeting of the shareholders, at which meeting Morton J. Sablosky legally voted his 20 shares of stock. This meeting was conducted by the master in conformity with the agreement.</p>

This loses sight of the fact that appellants-plaintiffs, filed a complaint in equity to prevent the defendantsappellees’ conducting any meeting in which Mr. Sablosky would use his shares of stock to vote, as he was not in agreement with Samuel Shapiro. Of course, Samuel Shapiro could not vote the stock owned jointly with Edna Shapiro, as she was in disagreement with her husband and in agreement with Mr. Sablosky. The defendants answered the complaint and raised, by new matter, questions which were decided by the chancellor. The fact of filing the agreement as contended for by the appellants, did not limit the scope of the equity proceedings. It is well recognized that when equity takes jurisdiction, it will resolve the entire litigation. <em>Wortex Mills v.
