The resolution stated that the ordinance was to be effective on January 1, 1965. The ordinance itself, however, provided that it should be effective immediately upon adoption. On the same day that the resolution was passed by the County Commissioners the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction, part of which is set forth above. Plaintiffs alleged that the ordinance was invalid because (1) it was an attempt by the County to legislate on the subject of anthracite strip mining, contrary to the preemption of this subject by the Commonwealth in the Anthracite Strip Mining and Conservation Act of August 13, 1963, P. L. 781, 52 P.S. §681.2, (2) that the zoning provisions of The County Code, Act of August 9, 1955, P. L. 323, §§2020-2039, as amended, 16 P.S. §§2020-2039, do not empower Luzerne County to enact zoning ordinances which purport to regulate the business of anthracite strip mining and (3) that, prior to its adoption, the ordinance <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>had not been submitted to the State Planning Board for approval, as required by Section 2023(c) of The County Code, supra. They further alleged irreparable harm and the absence of an adequate remedy at law. At the hearing to continue the injunction, held ou December 21, 1964, defendant County introduced a petition to dissolve the injunction on the grounds, inter alia, that (1) the ordinance would not be effective until January 1, 1965, (2) that no attempt had been made to enforce the ordinance against the plaintiffs and (3) that plaintiffs had an adequate legal remedy and a statutory remedy which must be pursued. The petition was denied and the preliminary injunction eon- . tinned until final hearing.</p>

In Knup v. Philadelphia, supra, we recognized that ‘. . . a court will take jurisdiction . . . only in a case in which a challenged statute, ordinance, or rule of court has been actually applied to a litigant; it does not undertake to decide academically the unconstitutionality or other alleged invalidity of legislation until it is brought into operation so as to impinge upon the rights of some person or persons.’ ” <em>Home Life Insurance Company of America v.

The Company filed a bill in equity to restrain the enforcement of the ordinance. When confronted with its failure to pursue its statutory remedy the Company argued that the letter of the City Solicitor was not such a “ ‘decision of the administrative officer’ ” as would warrant an appeal to the Board of Adjustment under the applicable statute. Our answer to that argument was as follows: “It may be added here that if we were to accept plain<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>tiff’s contention that it could not avail itself of the statutory remedy because it had ‘nothing from which to appeal’, thus reducing the practical effect of the City Solicitor’s letter to a nullity, we would have to hold similarly that since the company has not been harmed by an application of the Zoning Ordinance to it, it would have no standing to bring a suit in equity.” p. 8.</p>

Considering the ample provisions in the statute and ordinance for the staying of official action to enforce the ordinance, pending resolution of the questions involved, the possibility of irreparable harm is too remote to warrant a preliminary injunction.
