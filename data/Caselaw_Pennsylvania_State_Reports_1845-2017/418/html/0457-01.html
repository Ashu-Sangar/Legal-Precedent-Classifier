While a warrant may not be necessary for the stoppage and search of a moving automobile, such rule does not relax the requirement that the officers <em>must </em>have “reasonable or probable cause” to believe that the automobile contains contraband. Without a warrant the officers take a calculated risk; the search and seizure must be shown to have been upon reasonable and probable cause, i.e., that the officers had reasonable grounds to believe an offense has been or is being committed.

I had dissented from the previous decision of this Court on the subject, which decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States and there reversed. I would like to add but one comment to the excellent majority opinion. The Commonwealth urged in behalf of “reasonable and probable cause” for stopping the automobile in Philadelphia, the facts that the automobile was first seen in New Jersey, that it was traveling into Pennsylvania at 6:30 a.m., that the search occurred immediately prior to the Christmas holidays, the geographical contiguity of Philadelphia and New Jersey, and that the officers “knew a similar car was engaged in the transportation of liquor.” Each one of these factors, or all of them put together, could be repeated thousands of times just before Christmas, <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>which would mean that, if legal search were to he allowed, thousands of motorists would he subjected to the annoyance, inconvenience and delay-consuming stops just because a police officer “knew a similar car was engaged in the transportation of liquor.” There must be something a little more distinctive than the common features here enumerated to justify the stopping of numberless motorists honestly pursuing their legitimate errands so that an officer may have the opportunity to look for the moving needle in the thousands of traveling vehicular haystacks.</p>

The uncontradicted record fact is that the petition for forfeiture contained the required notice to claimant in the precise, statutory language and that no answer or claim was filed as required by the code. Under such circumstances, all that the Liquor Code commands, or indeed permits, is the entry of the formal decree of forfeiture. That is all that the court below was legally authorized to do.

Our reports are replete with innumerable decisions of our appellate courts sustaining, as well as directing, the entry of default adjudications against parties who deliberately failed to observe basic procedural requirements. Why it should not be so here, particularly in the face of the clear mandate of the code and the undisputed record of default, I am unable to understand. It seems beyond <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>doubt that a time limitation on answering the petition for forfeiture is a procedural requirement which is reasonably designed to serve a legitimate end in promoting efficiency in our state judicial practice.
