(Either classification permits the proposed use as a shopping center.) However, on July 8, 1963, at a regular public meeting of the Board of Commissioners of Mt. Lebanon Township (Board), a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance was introduced, changing the classification from NS to Residential (R-l), and a public hearing was scheduled for September 9, 1963 (which hearing was in fact held). On November 26, 1963, the Township Planning Commission (Commission) met, discussed the proposed amendment, and recommended that it not be adopted. Thereafter, the Board, on December 9, 1963, voted to table the proposed amendment, where it lay until June 8, 1964, at which time it was removed from the table and enacted as an ordinance.</p>

He was told at that meeting that he was required to obtain “preliminary site plan approval” from the Commission, and to secure a grading permit under a separate grading ordinance before he could apply for a building permit. Shortly thereafter, Jennings filed copies of his plot plan with the Commission and appeared before them on April 23, 1963, to discuss obtaining their approval. At that meeting five objections were raised to the plot plan, which Jennings set about to remedy. The next meeting with township officials took place on the site proposed for development, at the suggestion of (lie township and in the presence of several abutting owners, on May 4, 1963. Further conversations and meetings ensued, during each of <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>which new objections were raised to the plot plan, until on June 25, 1963, the Commission voted not to approve the plot plan. As a result of this action and at the request of Jennings, a letter listing 16 objections to be overcome in order to secure approval was issued. Jennings then met with the township director of public works, Peternel, and one Williams, a township engineer, to discuss the objections and the manner of overcoming them. As a result, late in July (note that the proposal for rezoning had then intervened) a revised plot plan was given to Peternel, which plan was in fact approved by the township engineer as being in “technical compliance” with the local requirements.</p>
    <p id="b348-4" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[200,1070,1155,1178]]]'>A formal application for a grading permit, filed on August 7, 1963, was denied because it was not in triplicate, it was not prepared by a registered professional engineer, and it had no “specifications” attached. In the meantime, Jennings requested to be placed on the Board’s agenda to obtain their approval of the site plan; but at their meeting the Board ignored his request and, in a move aimed directly at the plaintiffs, amended the grading ordinance (under which the plaintiffs had been proceeding) so as to make the securing of a building permit a prerequisite to obtaining a grading permit. Then, on August 30, 1963, the Board refused to issue a grading permit: because the Commission had not given approval, because no building permit had been obtained, and because they were “unsure” of the effect on the project of the proposed rezoning. Again, on September 20, 1963, Jennings was notified that, although they were in “technical compliance”, no grading permit could issue until a building permit was secured, a performance bond filed, and approval obtained from the Department of Forests and Waters.</p>

Abutting and neighboring property owners, whose rights could have been affected by the decision in this case, were allowed to intervene. On January 8, 1964, a second amended complaint was filed, adding a separate count, requesting the court to direct the issuance of a building permit for the shopping center. At the close of the pleadings, a hearing was held and the court directed that both the grading permit and the building permit issue. It is the correctness of this order which is here challenged.</p>

[T]he conduct of the Township officials in their relations with the plaintiffs and the action of the Township Commissioners in introducing the Rezoning Ordinance were not in good faith, but were contrived for the sole purpose of preventing the legal use by plaintiffs of their property, and therefore constituted ‘arbitrary and unreasonable intermeddling with the private ownership of property,’ which the Supreme Court has condemned in Medinger Appeal, [<a href="/pa/377/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="377 Pa. 217" data-case-ids="1249579" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0217-01">377 Pa. 217</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.2d%20118" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="104 A.2d 118">104 A. 2d 118</a> (1954)].

But, while their motives may have been of the highest sort, their course of action was ill conceived. When plaintiffs set out to construct a shopping center on their property, they had every right to do so. But at each step of the way they were met with obstructionism and hastily erected barriers. As plaintiffs overcame each objection or complied with each request, township officials were busily erecting new barriers. Plans revised to meet objections were met with additional objections, and requests for approval were summarily cast aside. While plaintiffs were attempting to secure a grading permit as a prerequisite to obtaining a building permit, the township changed its requirements to make the securing of a building permit a prerequisite to obtaining a grading permit. And so the circular pursuit went.</p>

It makes no difference whether it is a % acre lot or a 50 acre industrial complex area which is the subject of the rezoning. If it is aimed at preventing a theretofore legal use of an integrated unit owned by one common interest, the action cannot be supported as valid rezoning. In so saying, we do not mean to stagnate zoning classifications. However, under the peculiar facts of this case, it cannot be said that the purpose was for the health, safety and general or moral welfare of the community.

The question of the building permit in this context has been discussed above, as well as the “legal question” (or questions, as the case seems to be). In regard to the bond, the ordinance requires the posting of a bond in the amount of 25% of the estimated cost of the grading project. It seems as though there was some dispute as to what the cost would be, but this question was not resolved until after the institution of this suit. The question is now moot, however, the township having waived this objection by accepting a subsequently tendered bond, apparently sufficient to comply with the requirement.

Neither does the restrictive agreement of 1948. Furthermore, we concur in the construction by the court below of the “parking space” provision of the zoning ordinance and in the factual determination that plaintiffs’ plan complies therewith, a determination well supported by the record. Appellants also i*aise the requirement of prior site plan approval, but we have disposed of that contention above. Finally, appellants contend that certain proposed uses of various portions of the shopping center would be in violation of the zoning ordinance. In this regard, we again approve of the comments of the court below which point out that the requirement of use and occupancy permits thereunder provides “ample machinery” for the protection of the township. While not approving of the proposed uses, the township could still issue the building permit and allow the shopping center to be built, still reserving the right to restrict the use to which it is to be put. It is plaintiffs’ duty to find suitable tenants who meet the requirements of the “use” provisions. That plaintiffs have improperly proposed unacceptable tenants is not a ground for the <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>denial of the building permit. The future tenancy is a problem for future regulation.</p>
