Because decedent was a trespasser on defendant’s tracks and was guilty of contributory negligence, a finding of wilful or wanton misconduct was necessary in order to impose liability on defendant.

The engineman, called by plaintiff, testified that he first saw decedent approximately 1,500 feet ahead of him and across the roadbed. The train was traveling at' 50 miles per hour. He had just begun to brake the train in his usual manner in preparation for stopping at the next station.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Decedent started to cross the tracks and the engineman blew the whistle of the train to warn of its approach.

Appellant does contend, however, that the engineman should have realized it an earlier point that decedent was in a position of peril and should have invoked measures at that time to avoid the accident. The crucial point, therefore, is whether the court below erred in holding, as a matter of law, that decedent had not reached a position of <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>peril until he stepped from the center tracks heading for the track on which defendant’s train was traveling.</p>

We conclude not. The engineman had every right to believe that a man, walking diagonally across the tracks toward an oncoming train with its headlight full beam and emitting warning whistle blasts, would stop at the center track, letting the train pass, rather than walk directly into its line of travel. Although the engineman testified that decedent made no apparent reaction to his warning whistles, that fact is not sufficient to have given the engineman reason to believe that the warnings would have no effect on decedent’s conduct and that decedent would place himself in a position of peril. It was not until decedent stepped off the center track that the engineman could reasonably have suspected that <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>decedent was in a perilous position. It was at that point that the emergency brake was applied. The mere fact that this action was too late to avoid the accident can in no way detract from the fact that the engine-man took reasonable care to avoid the accident the minute he realized that decedent was in a position of peril.</p>

We cannot agree. The engineman’s testimony on direct examination was obviously directed toward his application of the emergency brake and in no way precluded the fact that he had already begun to brake for the next station. His testimony on cross-examination regarding this matter in no way conflicted with his testimony on direct examination.</p>
