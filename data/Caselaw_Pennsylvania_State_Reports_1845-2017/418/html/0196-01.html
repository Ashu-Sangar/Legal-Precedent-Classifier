Harper, Iñc. (tbe corporation). Until 1959 decedent bad conducted this business as an individual but in 1959 tbe business was incorporated with tbe decedent as tbe sole owner of all tbe capital stock. Although tbe business then' bad a book value of $200,000, it was incorporated for $10,000 and tbe balance was set up as a debt owed by tbe corporation to tbe decedent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> At tbe time of decedent’s death this balance was carried on tbe corporate books as an account payable in tbe amount of $185,825.18.</p>

This offer was made by Charles B. Harper, Jr. (Harper, Jr.), one of decedent’s sons.

Over tbe objections of decedent’s widow and one daughter (appellants), the court directed the sale be held on December 6, 1963. Notice of this sale was given by public advertisement and by written notice to all parties in interest, including the tax authorities. Although four or five persons appeared at the sale, only Harper, Jr. submitted a bid, said bid being in the cash amount of $40,000. The personal representative then petitioned the court to confirm this sale, the appellants filed objections to such confirmation and on December 9, 1963, the court held a hearing. The objections to the confirmation of the sale — both as set forth in the written objections and at the hearing- — appear to have been two-fold: (1) that the personal representative had failed and refused “to have a complete audit account of the accounts receivable and other assets of the corporation and proper and sufficient information was not furnished to bidders concerning such values”; (2) that the appellants wanted distribution of the cor<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>porate stock in kind.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> After hearing, the court below confirmed and approved the sale.

    <p id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[205,552,1155,205]]]'>The sole issue before us is the propriety, under the circumstances, of the decree of the court below which confirmed the public sale of the decedent’s interest in this corporation.</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.6",240,[203,770,1158,1007]]]'>Appellants’ position is that, because of the absence of an independent audit of the corporation, particularly its accounts receivable and inventoried items, they could not formulate an opinion as to the fairness and reasonableness of the price of |40,000 bid for the business, that it was the duty of the personal representative to furnish and the duty of the court to require the personal representative to furnish such an audit at the expense of the estate and that the personal representative failed to sustain his burden of proving that the conditions of the sale were free and fair and that the final bid was fair and reasonable. The principal thrust of appellants’ attack is that the financial statement, attached to the petition which furnished information to possible and potential bidders, Avas prepared “Avithout audit” by an accounting firm of which the husband of one of decedent’s daughters was not only a member but the active member in preparing this financial statement.</p>

Mr. Draper testified at the hearing<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> that the type of financial statement prepared— the same as always prepared for decedent during his lifetime — was called, under the procedure set forth by the American Institute of Accountants, “without audit” which means that the accounting firm has done a normal audit except that in certain areas, such, as in this case, the accounts receivable and the inventory, the audit did not encompass an investigation of each account receivable and each inventory item to confirm its existence and determine its worth. However, he did testify that, from his prior knowledge of decedent’s business, he could put a value on the accounts receivable and that, had he “confirmed” the accounts receivable, he would come up with comparatively the same value.</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[188,1282,1150,533]]]'>During the hearing the court offered a reasonable time to appellants’ counsel to secure an accountant to make an audit of the corporate books and assets and liabilities on behalf of appellants and, while at first reluctant to avail himself of that offer, appellants’ counsel finally decided to think it over and notify the court whether such offer would be accepted. While the record is silent as to whether appellants’ counsel did notify the court of his ultimate decision, the court did wait eight days before confirming the sale.</p>

Moreover, the record does not indicate that appellants state that the price bid was unfair and unreasonable but, on the contrary, aver simply a lack of knowledge as to the fairness and reasonableness of the price bid. If the appellants really wanted to be satisfied of the fairness and reasonableness of the price bid they had full opportunity to have an audit made by an accounting firm of their own choice, an opportunity which they chose to ignore.</p>
