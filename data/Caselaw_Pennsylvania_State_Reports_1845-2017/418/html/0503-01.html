List (natural father), and Joanne List (natural mother). On March 11, 1955, the natural parents of the child were divorced and the child thereafter lived for the most part with his mother until the summer of 1961. The natural mother was having difficulty, through lack of steady employment, to support herself and the child<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and was <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>desirous of entering the Women’s Army Corps of the United States Army but she was informed that her application for enlistment could not be considered so long as she had a dependent child. The natural mother then contacted the paternal grandparents of the child — Harry W. and Martha A. List — and requested that they adopt the child, a request to which they readily agreed. The natural mother then contacted Attorney Fullerton of New Castle, the paternal grandparents’ counsel, who prepared a petition for adoption for presentation to the Orphans’ Court of Lawrence County.</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[198,1065,1159,846]]]'>Prior to the presentation of that petition, Attorney Fullerton prepared a written form of consent to be signed by each of the natural parents. In pertinent part, the written consent of the natural mother recited: “That she is the mother of William Dale List, a minor, born March 2, 1953 in the City of New Castle, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, as the natural son of Joanne List, nee Joanne Miller; and that she consents to the adoption of the said William Dale List by Harry W. List and Martha A. List, his wife, of 3939 Ellwood Eoad, New Castle, Pennsylvania; that she waives and releases any and all rights over the care, custody and control of said child whatsoever; and she does not desire to be present at the hearing held in regard to the adoption of the said William Dale List and wishes to be excused therefrom.”</p>

Attorney Fullerton testified as to this matter: “I told her and advised her that she had absolutely no rights, if she once signed [the] consent and the adoption was approved — and I [informed her] that she was making a mistake or she should go slow — but she insisted that she was going to enter the armed services <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>and that was her interest; not her child — that was my opinion of it at the time .... I stated that I advised her [the natural mother] that when she signed this consent and the adoption was approved — all her rights were terminated.” Apparently at that time the natural mother told the attorney she wanted the child to be adopted temporarily and that, upon her discharge from the armed services, she wanted the child to be returned to her. After being advised by Attorney Fullerton of the finality of the grant of an adoption and of the impossibility of a temporary adoption the natural mother left his office without signing any consent. Shortly thereafter, the natural mother returned to Attorney Fullerton’s office and at that time executed the consent.</p>

After a hearing, the court, on November 7, 1961, decreed the adoption of the child by his paternal grandparents. The decree of the court read as follows: “Now, this 7th day of November, 1961, upon consideration of the allegations contained in the petition in the above entitled matter, the exhibits and testimony before this Court, therefore, on motion of Errol Fullerton, Attorney for the Petitioners, it is hereby ordered, adjudged and decreed that the prayer of the petitioners, Harry W.

J.” No appeal from that decree was taken.</p>

      <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>On June 29, 1964 — over two and a half years after the decree of adoption — the natural mother, who was then remarried, presented a petition to the Orphans’ Court of Lawrence County to vacate the decree of adoption. In that petition she averred the decree of adoption was invalid because: (a) she had not been required to be present at the adoption hearing, was not examined by the court nor was any reason given by the court for dispensing with her testimony; (b) the court did not make any findings of fact, did not state that it was satisfied of the truth of the statements in the adoption petition, did not find that the welfare of the child would be promoted by the adoption and did not find that the requirements of the law regarding procedure in cases of adoption had been complied with; (c) her consent was not the intelligent, voluntary and deliberate consent required by law inasmuch as it was represented to her that the adoption was a mere formality to comply with United States Army requirements and that the child would be returned to her upon her discharge from the armed services. After answer filed, the court held a hearing and vacated the decree of adoption. In so ruling, the court found that the decree of adoption did not conform with the provisions of the adoption statute and that the natural mother’s absence from the adoption hearing rendered the proceedings invalid. The validity of the decree vacating the adoption decree is now before us for determination.</p>

Their conclusion was that the adoption court could properly exercise its statutory discretion in dispensing with the presence of a natural parent at an adoption hearing on the basis that a duly executed consent of such person had been filed with the adoption petition. As President Judge Holland stated in <em>Coyle, </em>supra, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20Montg.%20238" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="48 Montg. 238">48 Montg. 238</a>: “Their presence [i.e., that of the natural parents] ‘may’ be dispensed with by the Court or Judge.

The petitioner argues that this being the proviso only upon which a reason can be assigned for dispensing with his presence, that the fulfilling of the proviso cannot be assigned as a reason itself. We cannot see the force of this argument when the Act clearly says that it can be done for 'any reason the Court or Judge deem’ a proper one. As a matter of fact, what better reason could a Court find for dispensing with the presence of the surviving parent at the hearing than because his admittedly genuine, unequivocal and clear written consent has been filed with the petition. He having done all that was necessary as far as his connection with the proceeding is concerned, and the best proof possible of his act being in evidence before the Court, what purpose could be served by having him present at the hearing? At most he could be called to duplicate in the form of testimony what was already of record in the proceeding.” We hold that the Court has the discretion to dispense with the presence at the hearing of the person or persons whose consent is necessary.</p>

As this Court said in <em>Harvey Adoption Case, </em><a href="/pa/375/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="375 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1244425" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0001-01">375 Pa. 1</a>, 3, <a href="/citations/?q=99%20A.2d%20276" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="99 A.2d 276">99 A. 2d 276</a>: “. . . a decree of adoption terminates forever all relations between the child and its natural parents, severs it entirely from its own family tree and engrafts it upon that of its new parentage: [citing a case].” Through the adoption process the natural parent-child relationship is extinguished and an entirely new parent-child status is created. Relying on the creation of this new status, thousands of persons annually enter the courts of adoption seeking to bring into their homes minor <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>children to whom they will bear the relationship of legal parentage and to whom they can give love and affection as though they were their own natural born children. What they seek principally is a <em>finality </em>in the creation of this new status, such <em>finality </em>as will abolish the fear that in the years ahead something will occur to extinguish the parent-child status and force them to relinquish the children they have adopted and upon whom they have lavished care and affection. If we accept as a reason to vacate an adoption decree a unilaterally alleged secret understanding we place in jeopardy and imperil adoption decrees generally.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>
