An action of trespass was instituted by appellant and culminated in a jury verdict for appellee. Appellant’s motion for new trial was denied and judgment was entered on the verdict of the jury; this appeal followed.</p>

At a point on said Turnpike, approximately six (6) miles west of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, the front portion of the plaintiff’s tractor came into contact with the rear portion of the trailer owned by the defendant and operated by one, James Crise, an employee of the said defendant.</p>
    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.6",256,[193,1482,1158,692]]]'>“The plaintiff charged the defendant Avith the negligent operation of its tractor trailer in that it was caused to sAverve off of the highway in front of the plaintiff, to proceed on the berm for a short distance, and then, without warning, to pull back onto the paved portion of the Turnpike directly into the path of the plaintiff, thus causing the accident and damages complained of. Plaintiff contended there were no lights on the rear of defendant’s trailer immediately prior to the accident. Plaintiff further alleged that the defendant’s driver was under the influence of alcohol which resulted in the negligent manner in which his tractor trailer was operated.</p>
    <p id="b256-6" data-blocks='[["BL_256.7",256,[192,2186,1156,261]]]'>“The defendant contended that its truck was proceeding on the Turnpike at a laAvful rate of speed in a lawful manner, proceeding in the right-hand, or sIoav lane, when it was struck on the left rear corner by the right-front portion of plaintiff’s tractor.</p>

    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[186,681,1149,588]]]'>“The defendant objected to the witnesses being questioned concerning the alleged intoxication of defendant’s operator in the presence of the jury, unless it was first established that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury finding said driver to have been, in fact, intoxicated. The court then received testimony in chambers concerning the alleged intoxication. Following this, the court then ruled that there was not sufficient evidence of intoxication to submit this item to the jury and no further mention was to be made of intoxication in the presence of the jury.</p>

The court was in error when it refused to permit the plaintiff to show the jury that defendant’s driver had consumed two bottles of beer, and that he had the odor of alcohol on his breath at the time of the accident. 2. The court was in error when it refused to permit plaintiff to cross-examine defendant’s driver concerning intoxication and/or drinking. 3. The court was in error in its charge to the jury concerning the duty of the plaintiff to stop ‘within the assured clear distance ahead.’ ”</p>

    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[187,514,1157,750]]]'>The trial court wisely heard the testimony relative to Crise’s alleged intoxication out of the jury’s hearing. In circumstances where the jury could not reasonably reach a finding of intoxication, it is highly prejudicial to permit it to hear evidence bearing on the subject. In <em>Wentworth v. Doliner, </em><a href="/pa/399/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="399 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1290602" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0356-01">399 Pa. 356</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.2d%20562" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="160 A.2d 562">160 A. 2d 562</a> (1960), we quoted, with approval, the following language of <em>Fisher v.

    <p id="b258-5" data-blocks='[["BL_258.6",258,[187,1276,1156,801]]]'>Here, the evidence elicited in chambers falls far short of reasonably establishing the requisite degree of intoxication. The sum and substance of that testimony was that Crise had admitted to having two beers in Greensburg prior to the start of the trip and that his behaviour at the scene of the accident was not that which might normally be expected of a truck driver in the circumstances. While not a matter for judicial notice, we cannot help observing that several hours must certainly have elapsed between the consumption of the beer in Greensburg and the collision near Car-lisle. Further, without more, this admission and the opinions of appellant and Zewe that Crise was acting “funny”, were insufficient to permit the issue to be presented to the jury.</p>

The two drivers and their respective witnesses told diametrically opposite versions of how the accident occurred. In that context, the court properly charged the jury, and <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>it obviously accepted the factual contentions of the defense.</p>
