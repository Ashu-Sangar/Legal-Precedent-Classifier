However, appellees contend that §516B is merely a <em>method </em>by which the corporation <em>may </em>secure and recover from a financially insecure plaintiff its own litigation expenses and those assessed against it under §516C. On the other hand, they contend that §5160, especially the last quoted sentence thereof, provides that a <em>corporation </em>may recover all such expenses from a losing <em>plaintiff, </em>irrespective of the size of latter’s interest in the corporation.

Under §516C, this objective is attained by shifting the expenses of successful individual defendants <em>to the corporation not to the losing plaintiff. </em>With respect to the like provision of the New York General Corporation Law, the Court of Appeals of that State held: “The effect of that statute was to impose upon the <em>eorpora</em>

See also, Hornstein, Directors’ Expenses In Stockholders’ Suits, supra; Reader, Suits Against Corporations, 12 P.S. §§1221 to 1820, page 8 (1953). That part of §516C which directs that the expenses “so assessed [against the corporation] shall be awarded as costs . . . and be recoverable in the same manner as statutory taxable costs . . . .” merely provides the method by which the successful defendants recover from the corporation the amounts assessed against it. Hornstein, Directors’ Expenses In Stockholders’ Suits, supra, at pp. 304-305; Cf. Reader, Suits Against Corporations, supra. Accordingly, §516C in no way established a right in the corporation to recover from an unsuccessful plaintiff the “reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees,” directly incurred by the corporation or assessed against it under §516C in the type of shareholder’s derivative action regulated by §516.</p>

Section 516B was derived from, and as material to this case is identical to, the now repealed §2 of the Act of April 18, 1945, P.

It was thought that such “strike suits” were usually brought by shareholders with only a small financial-stake in the corporation and who, therefore, had little to lose by starting an action. However, it also was recognized, as Mr. Justice Jackson observed in <em>Cohen </em>
