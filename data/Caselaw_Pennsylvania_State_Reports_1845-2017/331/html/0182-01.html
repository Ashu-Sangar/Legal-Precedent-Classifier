L. 5, and the Amendment thereof of December 22, 1933, Special Session, P. L. 94). Section 3 of the Act provides: “A State floor tax is hereby imposed upon spirituous and vinous liquors lodged or stored in this Commonwealth at any time between the date this act becomes effective and the date the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution of the <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>United States is ratified by conventions in at least three-fourths of the several states, inclusive. Such tax shall be at the rate of two dollars, on each proof gallon. ...” The act requires payment ninety days after the taxes are due, and provides that the tax, with interest, shall be a lien upon such liquors from the date the tax is imposed until paid. Section 5 provides in part: “The tax . . . shall be paid into the State Treasury by the owner . . . and he shall be liable to the Commonwealth as a taxpayer for the payment of such tax.” The Fiscal Code (72 PS sec. 1401) makes a state tax against any corporation a first lien upon the franchises and real and personal property of such corporation. The same Code (72 PS 1406-b) authorizes the Department of Revenue to bring suits for taxes, pursuant to which these were brought against the taxpayers, under Section 5. Heavy penalties were also provided for violation of the provisions of the act. An amendment authorized the Revenue Department to grant an extension of time for payment of the tax to not later than December 31, 1934.</p>

The market value, as of the date of the passage of the act, ranged from $9 per gallon for the 1930 whiskey, to $2 per gallon for the distillation of the fall of 1933. The total market value of this whiskey was $9,365,494.76. The floor tax was $4,481,529.82, ranging from <em>22% </em>to 100% of its value. Of the total gallonage more than 800,000 gallons was of whiskey distilled in the fall of 1933, stipulated as worth $2 per gallon, making a total market value of $1,619,549.58, upon which the floor tax was 100% of the value. Overholt also had in its warehouse 5,816.20 <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>gallons owned by others valued at $16 per gallon, on which the tax amounted to only 12% % of its value. It also had 30,171.63 gallons as bailee valued at from $15 to $16, of which the tax was 12%% to 13%% of its value. The Large Company owned 79,089.22 gallons, all at the stipulated market value of $2, against which the floor tax of $158,178.44 equals the total market value. It also had 2,082.65 gallons of pre-prohibition whiskey as bailee and 185,353.50 gallons in cases distilled in 1921 and prior thereto on which the tax amounted from 12%% to 13%% of the market value. At the effective date of the act the Finch Company had 4,077,920.12 gallons (of which 75,116 gallons were held by it as bailee) which ranged in value from 40 cents to $16 per gallon, including spirits, gin and rum, and whiskey of various distillations from 1917, and prior thereto, to the fall of 1933. The total tax thereon was $8,155,853.24 and the ratio of the tax to the value was from 12%% on the whiskey of 1917 and prior thereto1, to 500% on spirits which was valued at 40 cents per gallon. The Finch Company had more than 1,500,000 gallons of the youngest whiskey at the market value of $2 per gallon.”</p>

[This repealing amendment became effective December 5, 1933.] At the time [November 29, 1933] the act was passed establishing the Liquor Control Board, and after, no liquor <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>could be legally sold in Pennsylvania except through that board. The legislature appropriated $2,000,000 which was required for the physical equipment and establishment of stores and the Board had no appropriation with which to stock the stores.” The Commonwealth then, through the Liquor Board and with the approval of the governor, entered into practically identical agreements with these three companies by which the State agreed to purchase through its Alcohol Control Board 2,268,428 gallons from Overholt, 80,205 gallons from Large, and 4,220,441 gallons from Finch, deliveries to be made before the end of the year 1934, at the prices agreed upon. All these contracts provided that the companies were to pay to the Commonwealth at the time the liquor was purchased a tax upon the amount of gallons purchased, provided the Commonwealth performed its obligation under the agreement. The companies also reciprocally agreed (a) not to contest the constitutionality of the act; (b) to continue to pay the floor tax even though the act was declared unconstitutional as a result of a contest instituted by others; (c) not to seek refund of the tax paid pursuant to this arrangement. They also agreed to discontinue the actions pending in the Federal Court and to have that court vacate the restraining orders therein enjoining the enforcement of the tax. This contract the Commonwealth did not keep; it was unable to purchase the quantity therein provided for. Prior to February 28, 1935, which was the postponed date upon which it should have completed all purchases and payments, it had purchased less than 20 % of the stipulated gallonage. On April 16, 1936, the Commonwealth definitely declared the agreement illegal and void and demanded the payment of the balance of the tax for which these suits were subsequently brought. Credits had been extended by these companies to the Liquor Control Board from time to time and the board was heavily indebted to these companies at the time the Commonwealth declared the contracts void.</p>

By necessary implication, the first clause of that section recognizes the authority of the legislature to justly and fairly, but never arbitrarily, classify those subjects of taxation with the view of effecting relative equality of burdens. . . . These limitations on the power of the legislature mean something. They are plainly intended to secure, as far as possible, uniformity and relative equality of taxation, by prohibiting generally the exemption of a certain part of any recognized class of property, and subjecting the residue to a tax that should be borne uniformly by the entire class, and by guarding against any other device that necessarily or intentionally infringes on the established <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>rules of uniformity and relative equality which, as we have seen, underlie every just system of taxation.”</p>

An ad valorem tax is a tax of a fixed proportion of the value of the property with respect to which the tax is assessed, and requires the intervention of assessors or appraisers to estimate the value of such property before the amount due from each taxpayer can be determined. ...”</p>

It conceived a specific tax to be one that imposed upon property by its “height, number, weight or other measurements,” without reference to valuation. However, in his argument before our court, the Attorney General conceded that the challenged tax was a property tax. This concession, which the facts of the case clearly warranted, greatly simplifies the problem, for whether or not a certain <em>property </em>tax is so drafted or administered as to violate the constitutional requirement of uniformity is susceptible of almost mathematical demonstration.</p>

While every tax is a burden, it is more cheerfully borne when the citizen feels that he is only required to bear his proportionate share of that burden measured by the value of his property to that of his neighbor. This is not an idle thought in the mind of the taxpayer, nor is it a mere speculative theory advocated by learned writers on the subject, but it is a fundamental principle written into the constitutions and statutes of almost every state in this country. In Pennsylvania the framers of the new constitution embodied this principle in our organic law in terms so plain that no one should misunderstand its meaning or doubt its application, and the people by the adoption of that instrument placed the seal of their approval upon a system of taxation which has for its comer stone uniformity in the valuation, levy and collection of all taxes. . . . There must be substantial uniformity which means as nearly uniform as practicable in view of the instrumentalities with which and subjects upon which tax laws operate.”</p>

Taxation is the equivalent for the protection which the government affords to the persons and property of its citizens; and as all are alike protected, so all alike should bear the burden, in proportion to the interests secured. Taxes by the poll are justly regarded as odious and are seldom resorted to for the collection of revenue; and when taxes are levied upon property there must be an apportionment with reference to a uniform standard, or they degenerate into mere arbitrary exactions.” See also Cooley on Taxation, 4th ed., Yol. 1, sec. 267 at page 569, as to constitutional provisions for equality <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>and uniformity applying “to all kinds of property taxes.”</p>

If the owner of land worth $400 is taxed exactly the same as the owner of land worth $16,000, the former’s constitutional right to uniformity of taxation is breached. Whether the thing taxed is a quantity of <em>liquor </em>or a quantity of <em>land </em>makes no difference; each is property. The burden of a property tax rests upon the property on which it is imposed and if the same tax is laid on two properties of unequal supporting economic power, the burdens are unequal. A two dollar tax on a unit of liquid property of the value of two dollars while the same tax is laid on the same unit of liquid property of the value of four dollars is just as much an offense against the constitutional prescription of uniformity as in the more extreme examples presented by this record. Uniformity of taxation means equality of tax burden. A tax to be uniform must operate alike on the classes of things or property subject to it.
