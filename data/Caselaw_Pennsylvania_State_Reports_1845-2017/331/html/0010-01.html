The term of the lease was 100 years. The consideration was $150, plus an annual rental of $1. The lease bears the notation that the $150 was paid and also $5 rental in advance for the first five years of the term. In 1838 the lease of 1828 was modified by subsequent agreements between London and Meredith. By one of these, Meredith’s right was expressly limited to the use of the tract as a coal field, with the right to mine and sell coal therefrom. By an agreement dated December 10, 1838, it was agreed that as full consideration for the conveyance, Meredith should take up and cancel an outstanding indebtedness of London’s, the annual rental payments then to cease altogether.</p>

Burr Kenyon a deed of conveyance of the entire area now in dispute. This area was admittedly part of Edward London’s original warrant which his four children inherited on his death. The deed to Kenyon conveyed Isaac London’s entire interest in the property, together with the reversions and remainders thereof, and all his “estate, right, title, interest, use, trust, property, possession, claim and demand whatsoever ... in law or equity or otherwise howsoever of, in, to or out of the same,” specifically excepting and reserving, however, the prior grant of coal rights to Meredith in part of the “tract of land surveyed to Edward London, deceased, the title to which became the property of [Isaac London] by the heirship of Edward London.” A covenant of warranty accompanied the habendum clause. This constituted a comprehensive conveyance of Isaac London’s entire rights in the property, including any rights that might revert to him or his heirs upon the conclusion of the 1828 lease.</p>

The writings in this case constituted a sale of the coal to be mined within the term stated therein.” In the latter case we said: “The ‘severance’ which took place when the Meredith lease was executed October 1, 1828, was not a complete severance for all future time. ...

In the same year he applied for a Warrant of Survey of this land. Appellees further contend that in the same year Edward London and Isaac London made an amicable partition and division of this tract and marked and defined the boundaries. Isaac London was then of age and married, and appellees state that he entered into and upon the south half of the tract (Edward retaining the northern half) and maintained improvements thereon until the property was sold by him in 1840 to J. Burr Kenyon, excepting the 1828 grant of coal rights to Meredith.

The vital differences between the facts of that case and this are indicated by the following excerpt from the opinion of this court in that case: “He [the alleged disseisor] never created a new title in himself or any other person under which possession was held. . . . He does not seem even to have claimed it as <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>his own, though even that alone, though accompanied with the receipt of the rents and profits, would not, according to many authorities, be an ouster. On the contrary, he took out a patent in 1813, expressly in trust for himself and the other heirs of his father, and the lands were taxed in the name of the heirs until 1820.

Gregg), </em>the evidence leaves no room for doubt that Isaac London “intended” by his actions in 1828 and later to show that he regarded himself when he made “the Meredith lease” as the sole owner of the property. The conduct of Isaac London and his sister Susan in respect to the property was consistent with the hypothesis of the defendants that in 1815 Edward London gave this property to Isaac.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The coal in a large area was being “sold” in 1828 for one hundred years. The document was carefully couched in legal phraseology. Evidently at least one party was represented by a lawyer. The fact that the grant contained no indication that any other person than Isaac London had any interest in the property is of great significance. No one seemed to think it necessary or desirable that Susan Dolph join in that grant. Susan did not bestir herself to protect <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>any rights she may have had in the coal or in the consideration or in the reservation of fuel coal to the grantor.

    <p id="b68-4" data-blocks='[["BL_68.4",68,[288,615,1154,1622]]]'>Appellants in their paper book frankly made the following admission: “In most of the cases on which we rely, one cotenant leased the property, presumably for a short term, and it was held that the making of such a lease did not thereby oust his cotenants from their rights in the property after the termination of the lease. The only difference between the cases cited and the case at bar is the length of the lease in the present case.” We think what appellants refer to as “the only difference,” to wit: “the length of the lease” in the instant case, is a <em>vital </em>difference in the determination of the probative value of the grantor’s act in making that lease (which was “a sale of the coal,” as appellants stress in another part of their paper book). It may be customary for a cotenant to lease, without the joinder of the other co-tenants, a property for <em>a short term, </em>but it would be most unusual for a cotenant, without the other cotenants’ joinder, to lease a property for 100 years or to sell it outright. Appellants well say: “The present case is unique in its facts because of the unusually long term created by the lease from Isaac to Meredith.” It is so unusual for one cotenant to make such a long lease without the other cotenants joining in it, that the court below was fully warranted in inferring from the circumstances here present that Isaac London in 1828 recognized no other person as being his cotenant in the tract in controversy. The inference is equally legitimate that no cotenant would supinely stand by and permit his land to be aliened for 100 years without either her joinder or her protest.</p>

But under the lease Sarah and her heirs got nothing. Apparently they demanded nothing. The inference is that legally they were entitled to nothing.</p>

Ten years later Isaac London and Thomas Meredith met again and entered into a new agreement in respect to the coal tract in question. In this agreement the rights of Isaac in respect to the use and sale of the coal from the tract are substantially enlarged and, what is of even more legal significance, the provisions for annual rental of one dollar and for the payment of “$50 in case the coal on the leased premises shall prove extensive and abundant and of an average thickness of ten feet” was declared “null and void,” the consideration for this being that Thomas Meredith “agrees to take up and cancel a certain bond given by the said Isaac to Samuel Dickenson and others, for the purchase money of his farm; the said Thomas also further agrees that the said Isaac may open a mine on the said leased premises at his own expense and cost, and shall be allowed to sell 300 tons of coal to pay the expense thereof but no more.” The foregoing was equivalent to a statement that the entire consideration for the modification of the lease of 1828 was for Isaac’s sole benefit. Isaac was to have his farm “cleared” of the indebtedness evidenced by a “purchase-money bond” and was allowed to open a mine on the tract leased to Meredith and “to sell 300 tons of coal to pay the expense thereof.” Again we find no reference whatever to any cotenant and there is no proof anywhere that any co-tenant profited in any way from the 1828 lease or its 1938 modification or made any protest. There is no legal warrant whatever for the presumption or inference that Isaac gave his cotenants anything. The logi<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>cal and legal inference is that neither he nor Thomas Meredith recognized the existence of any cotenants, and that no one at the time claimed to be a cotenant.</p>
    <p id="b70-4" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[313,502,1150,965]]]'>There is still further evidence to be considered. In 1840, Isaac London executed three deeds conveying parts of the property formerly of the Edward London estate, one to Samuel Callendar, one to Allen Secor and one to J. Burr Kenyon. Each of these deeds described the land conveyed as being a part of the Edward London tract, “the title of which became the property of the first party [Isaac London] by the heirship of Edward London.” The deeds to Kenyon and Secor purported to convey portions of the surface overlying the coal leased to Meredith and each deed expressly excepted this coal. These deeds conveyed as appurtenances to the land described all mines, minerals, reversions, remainders, etc., “pertaining to Isaac London and Sally, his wife.” To Callendar was conveyed no land underlaid with the coal leased to Meredith. The deed to Kenyon covered the 122 acres of surface overlying the coal whose ownership is now in controversy.</p>

This argument apparently overlooks the fact that this case turned on the evidentiary value of acts and circumstances. In the absence of proof of any mutual declarations made by Isaac and his sister Susan in respect to the ownership of property they inherited from their father, who had died intestate in 1815, we are bound to consider how they acted in respect to that property. Defendants pleaded that Isaac acquired all the coal in controversy, together with the overlying surface, in <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>1815, through an “amicable partition” made by his father. This pleading is unsupported by proof but this does not estop defendants from showing that Isaac <em>acted </em>not only in 1828 but afterwards as though he owned the property and that Susan by her nonaction apparently recognized the validity of her brother’s claim. Whatever title Isaac had to the surface which he sold to Kenyon in 1840 was, it must be taken for granted, the same title he had to the coal beneath that surface, which coal he leased to Meredith in 1828. The facts that he as <em>sole </em>owner conveyed in 1840 the surface of a tract of land which formerly belonged to his father, that his grantees accepted deeds from him as sole owner, and that there is no evidence that Susan made any claim to be a cotenant or to any part of the substantial consideration ($1,250 in the Kenyon deed) “to them [i. e., Isaac London and Sally his wife] in hand paid,” are all facts from which the court below had a right to infer that Isaac claimed to be the sole owner of the surface granted in 1840 and from that conclusion the inference is also warranted that in 1828 when he “leased” the coal to Meredith he claimed to be <em>the sole owner of both the surface and the coal.</em>

It is not disputed that she was in the prime of life, being forty-three years of age, when the Meredith lease was executed and fifty-five years of age when the Kenyon deed was executed, and that until her death in 1868 at the age of 83 years she resided within a radius of ten or twelve miles of the land in controversy. Likewise, her husband, whom she married in 1803, spent his entire life until he died in 1860, in the same locality. Long before her death the fact that the property her brother “leased” or sold in 1828 to Meredith contained rich coal deposits became manifest. Yet neither she nor anyone acting in her behalf attempted to assert any rights to that coal <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>based on the fact that she who is now alleged to have been an owner of an undivided quarter interest in that coal, did not join in the Meredith lease of 1828. Since apparently no document ever existed showing that she authorized her brother to execute the Meredith lease in her behalf as well as his own and since there is no record of her having participated in the proceeds of that lease, the evidence, as already indicated in our discussion of the 1838 modification, being to the contrary, the court below was amply warranted in its finding (51) : “Any presumption that Isaac London’s act in leasing the coal to Meredith was in conformity with the rights of his cotenants, not antagonistic thereto; or that he acted for and in their behalf and with their acquiescence and consent and that he accounted to them for the rents and royalties collected, is rebutted by the facts appearing in this record. He did not act for and on behalf of his co-tenants.”</p>

The various deeds upon the record from Isaac London, and the lease to Thomas Meredith, with its modifications, were claims of title by Isaac London to the whole of the tract, and as such were notice of adverse and hostile claims to Susan London Dolph, and her heirs, and all persons claiming under her and them, and to the plaintiffs in this case. 6. If Susan London Dolph Avas ever a cotenant Avith Isaac London of the tract of land in question, she lost any right she ever had by her inactivity. ... 7. The plaintiffs have no interest, title, claim or right of possession in the tract of land described in the Writ and they are, therefore, not entitled to recover.”</p>

At the termination of the twenty-one-year limitation period after 1828, title to Susan Dolph’s interest in this reversion vested in those who took under the 1840 deed of Isaac London to J. Burr Kenyon, his heirs and assigns. Whatever interest Susan Dolph may have had in the property in question was divested by the uninterrupted possession of Kenyon and his successors in title. The claim of the appellants had been barred for more than fourscore years when the instant summons in ejectment was issued.</p>

These depositions by Isaac London and others claiming knowledge of the facts showed that the original Edward London tract of 400 acres was “amicably partitioned” in 1815 and Isaac received the southern half “for having labored for his father for several years after becoming of age.” These depositions were received <em>in this </em>case, hut the court later held them to be incompetent to prove the facts therein contained, having been given in a proceeding to which neither the present plaintiffs nor their ancestors were parties.</p>
