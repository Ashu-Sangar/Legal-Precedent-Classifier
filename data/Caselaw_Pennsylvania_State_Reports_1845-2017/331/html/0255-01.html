Bashore, Secretary of Labor and Industry, and the members of the Industrial Board of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, from a decree of the lower court restraining them from enforcing any of the provisions of the 44-Hour Week Law with respect to the plaintiffs. The other case considered here is that of C. W.

The formal adjudication in each case contains findings of fact and conclusions of law in keeping with the decree entered. The legal conclusions upon which the adjudication was based were that the 44-IIour <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>Week Law was an improper exercise of the police power, and that Section 2(b) thereof delegated legislative power and incorporated Federal regulations by reference in violation of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. The findings of fact are to the general effect that the operation of the 44-Hour Week Law would cause difficulties of management and production for the respective plaintiffs, would greatly increase their labor and overhead costs, would increase the selling price of their products and greatly reduce their profits, and would seriously prejudice their ability to compete in the sale of their goods in states which have no similar laws. It was also found as a fact that the work performed by the employees of the respective plaintiffs under the existing schedule of hours is not in any way injurious or detrimental to their health, morals, safety or welfare; and that in some instances the terms of the 44-Hour Week Law will result in a reduction of the weekly wages of the employees since they are paid on an hourly or piecework basis.</p>

The title states its purpose to be “. . .to protect the public health and welfare by regulating employment in this Commonwealth with respect to hours and conditions of employment.” Section 2, the heart of the act, provides that “. . .no employer shall employ any person for more than forty-four hours in any one week, or eight hours in any one day, or on more than five and one-half days in any period of seven consecutive days.” Section 2(c) exempts those engaged in agricultural occupations, or in domestic service in private homes, or persons doing executive work and earning more than twenty-five dollars a week, and the learned professions. Section 2(b), however, provides that “Where the strict application of the schedule of hours provided for by this section, imposes an unnecessary hardship and violates the intent and purpose of <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>this act, the Department of Labor and Industry, with the approval of the Industrial Board, may make, alter, amend and repeal general rules and regulations prescribing variations from said schedule of hours; Provided, That with respect to any industry whose schedule of hours is established by Federal regulation, the schedule to be fixed by the Department of Labor and Industry, with the approval of the Industrial Board, shall conform to the schedule established by any such Federal regulatory body.” The delegation of these broad powers to the Department and the Board, as well as to Federal authority, was regarded by the legislature as so vital to the operation of the act that it provided in Section 11 “. . . that the provisions of subsection (b) of section two are hereby declared not to be severable from the other provisions of this act, and in the event the provisions of such subsection are held to be unconstitutional, it is hereby declared that the legislative intent is that the entire provisions of this act shall not be in force or effect.” Consequently, we are impliedly invited at the outset to determine the validity of Section 2(b). The court below held it invalid.</p>

Regardless of exigencies which at times arise or of how trying our economic or social conditions become, the powers and duties imposed by the Constitution upon the legislative branch of our government remain steadfast and neither the urgency of the necessity at hand nor the gravity of the situation allow the legislature to abdicate, transfer or delegate its authority or duty to another branch of the government. Our system of checks and balances in the government was wisely instituted by the framers of the Constitution for the protection of all the people of the Commonwealth and has proved an effective method to prevent unwise, hasty and imprudent legislation. So effective has been this system of government no attempt has been made to amend that part of the Constitution and it remains the fundamental law of this Commonwealth.</p>

In all such occasions, nevertheless, the legislative body must surround such authority with definite standards, policies and limitations to which such administrative officers, boards or commissions, must strictly adhere and by which they are strictly governed. As said by Mr. Justice Agnew, in <em>Locke’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/72/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="72 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="434662" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0491-01">72 Pa. 491</a>, 498, “Then, the true distinction, I conceive, is this: The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend.” Thus the legislature may, as was held in <em>Locke’s Appeal, </em>pass <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>laws to become effective only upon local option. The ascertained sentiment of the locality is the fact upon which the law is to become operative; the local sentiment does not make the law, and it is just as proper to have it determined after as before the legislature acts. So also the legislature may confer upon an executive department or other agency the power to find whether the facts exist upon which a law is to operate. Generally these facts are of a scientific nature, not involving a personal decision as to whether the facts should be considered within the general policy of the law in question.

First, it delegates to the Department of Labor and Industry in conjunction with' the Industrial Board the power to make law for the regulation of the hours of labor. Second, it attempts to hand over to Federal authority—whether Congress, executive commission, or other agency not yet appearing—plenary power to regulate working hours in Pennsylvania. As to the delegation to the Department of Labor and Industry, the only condition precedent to the exercise of this extraordinary power to change the provisions of the statute and make its own law is expressed in the following words: “Where the strict application of the schedule of hours provided for by this section, imposes an unnecessary hardship and violates the intent and purpose of this act. . . .” If this condition is found to exist, the statute provides no limit to the exercise of the discretion of the Department with the approval of the Industrial Board to prescribe variations from the schedule of hours laid down in the act. This may be done by means , of general rules and regulations which may he made, altered, amended and repealed at discretion. The Department is then free to <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>fix the hours of labor in any industry, group of industries, or in individual cases, without any guide or restraint of any kind; the hours may be shortened to six a day or extended to ten or twelve a day. There is no policy set up, there are no standards, there are no boundaries within which the Department and the Board must exercise their discretion. There are no requirements for hearings, findings of fact with reasons for conclusions, or appeals. There is merely a naked authority given to the Department and the Board to make law by general rules and regulations prescribing variations from the said schedule of hours, and to alter, amend or repeal such rules and regulations. The power to amend or repeal a statute is as much legislative in nature as the power to enact the statute. It is impossible to find any restrictive policy in such a grant.</p>

The action of the legislature prescribing a maximum work-week of forty-four hours and a maximum work-day of eight hours might be completely nullified or partially or entirely rewritten by the regulation of the department.

United </em>States, supra, the National Industrial Recovery Act was held to be unconstitutional on the ground that the code-making authority therein conferred was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Chief Justice Hughes there stated (p. 541) : “Section 3 of the Recovery Act is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe rules of conduct to be applied to particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, Section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section one. In view of the scope of that broad declaration, and of the nature of the few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered.” The same criticism applies to Section 2(b) of the 44-Hour Act. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity, and does not undertake to prescribe rules of conduct to be applied to particular states of fact to be determined by any administrative procedure. The statement of the general aim of the act “. . .to protect the public health and welfare” is as broad in scope as the general aim of re<a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>habilitation, correction, and expansion described in the National Industrial Recovery Act.</p>

In that case the President was given the authority to prohibit the transportation in interstate and foreign commerce of petroleum and petroleum products produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted to be produced or withdrawn from storage by any state law or valid regulation or order prescribed under any state law. Mr. Chief Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court, which, in part, is as follows (p. 415), “Section 9(c) is brief and unambiguous. It does not attempt to control the production of petroleum and petroleum products within a State. It does not seek to lay down rules for the guidance of state legislatures or state officers. It leaves to the States and to their constituted authorities the determination of what production shall be permitted. It does not qualify the President’s authority by reference to the basis, or extent, of the State’s limitation of production. Section 9(c) does not state whether, or in what circumstances or under what conditions, the President is to prohibit the transportation of the amount of petroleum or petroleum products produced in excess of the State’s permission. It establishes no criterion to govern the President’s course. It does not require any finding by the President as a condition of his action. The Congress in Section 9(c) thus declares no policy as to the transportation of the excess production. So far as this action is concerned, it gives to the President an unlimited authority to determine the policy and to lay down the prohibition, or not to lay it down, as he may see fit. And disobedience to his order is made a crime punishable by fine and imprisonment.”</p>

      <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>The Court of Appeals of New York, in <em>People v. C. Klinck Packing </em>Company, <a href="/ny-crim/33/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="214 N.Y. 121" data-case-ids="1211612,72091" data-case-paths="/ny-crim/33/0001-01,/ny/214/0121-01">214 N. Y. 121</a>, held unconstitutional a provision in a law requiring one day of rest in every seven consecutive days for workers in factories and mercantile establishments, which authorized the Commissioner of Labor to exempt from its provisions employees engaged in continuous processes if he “. . . in his discretion approves.” The court said (pp. 138-139) : “The question whether the statute shall take effect in any, all, or no cases is left wholly to his [the Commissioner’s] volition. Under its terms he has the power, without check or guidance, so far as we can perceive, to veto the entire clause and decide that its benefits shall never be extended to any case although it comes within the precise terms of the statute, or to permit the exemption in one case and deny it in another precisely similar one. Of course, it is not to be assumed that the commissioner of labor would intentionally be arbitrary and unreasonable in the exercise of this power, but nevertheless the legislature has attempted to confer upon him the opportunity which would permit of these shortcomings and we are to judge of a statute by what is possible under it. In the absence of any guide it might very well happen that an administrative officer with the best of purposes would nevertheless be very fallible in the execution of them.”</p>

Insurance Company, </em>supra, this Court declared an act of the legislature an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The statute in question in that case directed the Insurance Commissioner to prescribe a standard policy of insurance and forbid the use of any other. We declared the act to be unconstitutional and said (p. 79) : “The elementary books divide a. statute into three parts, the declaratory, the directory and the vindicatory. In this statute the legislature furnished the first and third. It delegated the preparation of the second. It declared in effect the need of a standard form of policy. It provided punishment for the failure to use <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>such form when provided; but it turned the preparation of the form over to its appointee and gave him six months in which to do his work and file a copy of it in his own office. Whoever might be interested in knowing the directory part of the statute and understanding what it was he was required to do, had to go beyond the act of assembly and inquire of the appointee of the legislature what it was he had filed in his own office, of which the people of the Commonwealth were bound to take notice at their peril. . . .</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[276,882,1154,581]]]'>“We do not see how a case could be stated that would show a more complete and unconstitutional surrender of the legislative function to an appointee than that presented by the Act of 1891. By its provisions the legislature says in effect to its appointee, ‘Prepare just such a policy or contract as you please. We do not care to know what it is. The governor shall have no opportunity to veto it. File it in your own office and we will compel its adoption, whether it is right or wrong, by the punishment of every company officer or agent who hesitates to use it.’ ”</p>

The result would be, if the proviso is effective, that whenever a Federal regulatory body established a schedule of hours for any industry, our Department of Labor and Industry is bound to adopt such schedule of hours for that industry. This would, of course, introduce an inequality in the requirement for hours of labor in Pennsylvania. There is no <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>pretense that tlie Federal schedule will be limited by any standard. In this attempted transfer of legislative power there is not even a semblance of limitation or control. A more sweeping abdication of power and duty it would be difficult to imagine.</p>
    <p id="b319-3" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[108,617,1154,1083]]]'>This case has no resemblance to <em>Commonwealth v. Alderman, </em><a href="/pa/275/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="275 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1075628" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0483-01">275 Pa. 483</a>, relied upon by the Commonwealth. There, the Pennsylvania liquor prohibition act referred to the Federal act for the definition of intoxicating liquor. Under national prohibition the state acts were merely augmentative. The national act, passed pursuant to the Eighteenth Amendment, applied to everyone whether the states had their own acts or not. Consequently, all involved in the <em>Alderman </em>case was a deference to the superior authority of the Federal law. We held there was not a delegation of power but a simple acknowledgment by the legislature of the power of Congress under a constitutional amendment. But as to hours of labor the Federal government cannot regulate beyond the field of interstate commerce. Beyond that lies the exclusive province of the states. Therefore, when the present act requires the hours schedules of the Department to conform to those of some Federal authority it is to that extent delegating its exclusive power to the Federal government.</p>

It is, therefore, unnecessary to pass upon other questions raised in these cases.</p>
