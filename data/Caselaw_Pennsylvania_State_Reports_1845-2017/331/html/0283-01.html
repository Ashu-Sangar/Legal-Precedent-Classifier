It had received savings funds as well as general commercial accounts. The plaintiff sued for $11,533.73 with interest from June 24,1931, averring that in prior years she had made deposits aggregating the sum of $12,000 and had received from the bank only $466.27. The 5th paragraph of the statement of claim is: “Plaintiff avers that all moneys [except $466.27] paid out of the said savings account and charged against the savings account of Martha Tribuías were improperly paid out, improperly charged against the savings account of said Martha Tribuías and that the money so withdrawn was not paid to Martha Tribuías or to anyone authorized to act for her or in her behalf.” In the affidavit of defense it was averred that plaintiff withdrew, on dates and in amounts specified, $11,966.27; that she knew her account had been closed; defendant denied that the orders or checks alleged to have been executed by the plaintiff were “improper, unauthorized and forgeries” as alleged by her. The affidavit also set forth that the amounts charged against the account had been properly paid and “that after the plaintiff withdrew the balance in her account <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>on June 24th, 1931, she made no demand upon défeñdant for the payment of any sum or sums prior to the institution of this suit upon the 16th day of April, 1936. Defendant avers that at all times prior to June 24th, 1931, the plaintiff knew the withdrawals made in said account and on June 24th, 1931, accepted the sum of $466.27 as payment in full of the balance in said account.”</p>

Defendant then made three motions, 1, asking leave to amend its affidavit of defense by setting up the statute of <em>limitations; </em>2, a motion for a new trial, and, 3, a motion for judgment n. o. v. The learned court below granted the last motion and said that “in view of this ruling it is unnecessary to consider the motions for new trial and for leave to file an amended affidavit of defense.” These motions were accordingly overruled, pro forma, we assume.</p>

She ran a hotel in Atlantic City for three summers; her husband testified that he was also interested in that business with her.

Then the balance carried forward in plaintiff’s favor as of December 30, 1930, was $452.68. The only withdrawal during that period was the sum of $1,000, May 17, 1927. This withdrawal will be referred to later as the Fitzpatrick check. On June 24, 1931, the account was closed by the plaintiff’s receipt of $466.27, which, we assume, is the balance of $452.68 appearing on December 30, 1930, with interest to the date of closing the account. There was evidence that savings accounts received higher rate of interest than checking accounts. A witness for defendant testified that “withdrawal had to be made at the office. We had our own special checks that were only good within the office. They were a yellow check marked ‘Special’ on the end. By the Court: Q. What do you mean that withdrawals must be made in the office? A. I mean that we would not permit negotiable checks to be issued against savings accounts. Q. You mean you could not put a check in through another bank? A. That is right. Q. How about the passbook? A. The passbook had to be there with the withdrawal. By Mr. Ewing: Q. I imagine sometimes the bank waived the ten days’ notice for convenience sake if it was necessary? A. Sometimes, if it was necessary and if the depositor was well-known and had a good account. Q. What significance do the notations have on the last page of this book? (Indicating exhibit ‘PI.’) A. Those were notices of withdrawals. Q. Were notices of withdrawals given to cover withdrawals in this account? A. That is true. Q. And they were noted in the back of the book? A.

The defendant of course concedes that by accepting the deposit it became plaintiff’s debtor; it is also agreed that plaintiff had the right to withdraw the deposit or any part of it after ten days’ notice; as it was a “Special” account, she would be required to use a check marked “Special.”</p>

The account, balanced February 15, 1922, showed that, against interest allowed and deposits to her credit amounting to $19,203.67, the bank had charged withdrawals of $17,698.64, leaving a balance of $1,505.03 carried over as the debt remaining due to her. Now, it is not without interest to note that out of the total of $17,698.64 withdrawals charged against her, she makes no question of $8,698.64; that total is charged as having been paid to her in 1919 and in 1920; she concedes having received that. Her contention is that the remaining $9,000 then charged against her was paid without her authority and is part of the sum in suit. That $9,000 was represented by two checks on the form specified for such accounts, one in the sum of $5,000 dated June 2,1921, drawn to the order of her husband and indorsed by him, and the other, in the sum of $4,000, dated February 14, 1922, to her own order with her name written on the back of it alongside her mark and followed by the signature of Baltram Tribuías as witness. On cross-examination she was shown the $5,000 check and said: “That is Mr. Tribuías’ signature”; but she said, “I never put that cross.mark. He never told me nothing about that money, that he is going to take it, he gypped me, you know.” Her testimony with regard to the other three “Special” checks <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>referred to above as charged against her account, was substantially to the same effect.</p>

This doctrine is of universal application. Whether a bank is or is not estopped from denying its liability for a balance stated by reason of fraud or error depends upon the facts, which are for the jury. In such a case the burden is on the bank attempting to evade responsibility, because the presumption is that the balance stated by its own officers is correct and truly represents the account between the parties.” In <em>United </em>Security, <em>etc., Co. v.

This withdrawal appeared charged against her account as of May 17, 1927, when the account was closed in June, 1931. She testified that she did not receive the money and that she did not make her mark to the check. It is an order prepared on one of defendant’s “Special” forms to “transfer to Baltram Tribuías $1,000.” It bears the name of Martha Tribuías and a mark; alongside the mark is written “Witness J. Fitzpatrick, Assistant Treasurer” in his writing. On the back of it appears “Credit account of Baltram Tribuías,” together with the name Martha Tribuías with her mark also witnessed by the assistant treasurer. Mr. Fitzpatrick died before the trial, so that the parties do not have his testimony describing the transaction. Baltram Tribuías testified on behalf of the defendant. He was shown the check and testified that there was “No signature on this check of mine.” We understand him to mean that though his name appears on the check twice, he did not write either. “Q. Was that $1,000 transferred to your account? A. I cannot remember. Maybe yes. Maybe she came in herself, because she used to work with ine.

An “account stated” is “an agreed balance of accounts. An account .which has been examined and accepted by the parties: 2 Atk. 251,” Bouvier’s Law Dictionary. There is nothing in this case showing that there ever was an “account stated” between the parties. No “account stated” was mentioned in the pleadings; no “account stated” was mentioned by Judge Lamberton in his charge to the jury; and no “account stated” was referred to by Judge Alessandroni in his opinion supporting the entry of judgment for defendant n. o. v. I will go further and state that if the issue in this case had been the existence of an “account stated,” <em>which decidedly it was not, </em>that issue, if prima facie supported by proof, <em>would have had to go to the jury. </em>Furthermore, if an account stated had been properly raised by the pleadings, the bank would have failed on this record to make out a prima facie case showing an “account stated.” What an “account stated” as between a bank and its depositor is, has been frequently clearly defined by this court and the Superior Court of this State. In <em>Thompson v. Republic Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/84/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="84 Pa.

The first reference to a disputed check is on page 22a of the record where the bank’s attorney in cross-examining Mrs. Tribuías, said: “I show you a check dated February 14, 1922, for $4,000. This check was drawn to the order of Martha Tribuías.” Her reply was: “I never marked it. I don’t know nothing about it.” She was then asked: “And it has your name on the back.

If he fails to do that, the balanced passbook becomes an account stated.” This record is barren of any evidence that the depositor’s passbook <em>was delivered to </em>her, after entries of deposits and credits or at any other time. Besides, the <em>return of the cancelled checks </em>to the depositor is an <em>indispensable element </em>in the account stated, and this was not done here.

The deposits were admitted, and the depositor claimed that the withdrawals were madé on forged crosses (Xs). The bank pleaded that the checks had been “properly executed by the plaintiff” or, in other words, that the crosses had been made by her. This was as definite an issue of fact as it would have been had she been able to write her name and had claimed that her signature had <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>been forged. The possession of the passbook had nothing to do with the withdrawals, as no rule of the bank required the production of the book when withdrawals were made. She claimed that her husband had locked the passbook in his safe since 1924. Whether or not she had the passbook in her possession when the withdrawals were made is wholly immaterial. If the bank paid out her money on a forged cross (X) as her “signature,” it is liable. Cassidy, the former bank clerk, was asked if he had “any knowledge as to the withdrawals in this account, other than the information which you have gotten from the records of the bank” and he replied : “That is all, except the last one.” As to the last one he said that he “made that closing check to close the account.” He testified to her making her mark on that undisputed closing check. No one except Mrs. Tribuías’ husband testified to her making her mark on the other checks and he is not only a hostile witness, he and his wife being estranged, but he is an interested witness, for it is undisputed that the proceeds of every disputed and allegedly forged check <em>were paid into his account in the same bank. </em>J. J. O’Donnell, who had been paying teller in the defendant bank at the time of the transactions in question, testified that “there was no actual cash paid on these [disputed] checks. They were issued at the savings fund window and immediately deposited with the receiving teller.” All the checks put in evidence by defendant bank, show that the husband, Baltram Tribuías, had the proceeds of the checks credited to his account. All this tends to confirm Mrs. Tribuías’ view of this case, to wit, that her husband forged her cross on the checks and appropriated the proceeds.</p>

The passbook shows that the date of the last deposit was February 21, 1921, in the amount of $1,220; the ledger sheet of the bank shows that the last deposit of $1,220 was made on February 21, 1926. This shows a discrepancy between the bank’s ledger sheet and the entries made in plaintiff’s passbook, and indicates that there was at least some carelessness on the part of the bank.</p>

The bank did not in practice so construe the “signature card,” for on May 17,1927, it paid out one thousand dollars on an order purporting to bear Mrs. Tribuías’ “mark” (X) and witnessed <em>not by Tier husband </em>but by “W. J. Fitzpatrick, Asst. Treasurer.” The bank cannot now by its counsel convincingly plead for a judicial construction of the “signature card” which would logically force the conclusion that the bank in at least one instance breached its contract with the depositor and, according to her testimony, caused her a loss of one thousand dollars.</p>

It could have provided in the passbook (as apparently it <em>has since 1928) </em>that it should be presented when withdrawals were to be made and that such presentation, unless the bank had been given timely notice of its loss or theft, should be prima facie proof that the order for withdrawal was authoritative. It could have tested the withdrawer’s identity by asking questions based on data available on the “signature card.” There is no evidence that the bank did this. It could have taken many other customary precautions against the possibility of being imposed on. The bank did not call any witness who remembered plaintiff being present when these withdrawals were made. The bank’s inability to do this is understandable but it is not so easy to understand why the bank did not require some of its numerous officers or clerks who, it is testified, “well knew” this illiterate depositor, to make a notation in the bank’s records that she was identified and by whom, when the withdrawals were made. With such a record to “refresh recollection,” convincing proof of the making of payments on plaintiff’s order could have been offered, if such <em>was the fact.</em>

This witness also admitted that “if Mr. Tribuías would <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>come with a check for Mrs. Tribuías, the bank would cash it.” He added: “He was on record as being all right to cash for her.” The fact is that this record is barren of any evidence of any authority ever being given by Mrs. Tribuías to her husband to cash checks for her.

This is one of the most important facts in this case. </em>Most banks do have a rule printed in the passbook providing that presentation of the passbook shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the presenter to withdraw funds. For example, in <em>Bulakowski v. Phila. Saving Fund </em>Society, supra, and quoted in the majority opinion, there was a rule in the passbook providing in effect that a person by presenting the passbook might give himself the status of the depositor. This court in that case said: “Possession of the bank book is, <em>under the deposit contract </em>[italics supplied], prima facie evidence of the right to draw on the fund it represents” and that “these rules are printed in the deposit or passbook; by accepting the book the depositor assents to the regulations and they become a part of the contract of deposit binding on both [bank and depositor] alike,” citing <em>Burrill v. Dollar Savings Bank, </em><a href="/pa/92/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="92 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="491073" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0134-01">92 Pa. 134</a>. <em>If in the instant case there had been such a rule in the passbook </em>and plaintiff’s husband or some one else had procured possession of the book and presented it at the bank and thereby had enabled himself to withdraw funds from the depositor’s account, the bank would be relieved from liability, <em>but under the facts of the present </em>case, <em>with no such rule in the passbook, the debtor bank </em>paid out this <em>creditors </em>money at its peril. It was under the duty of seeing to it that it paid the money to exactly the right person, to wit, the depositor. If A promises to pay B $1,000 and gives a note to B as evi<a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>denee of the indebtedness, and someone steals or finds the note, A cannot discharge his obligation to B by paying that “someone,” unless by their contract it is stipulated that possession of the note will be prima facie proof of the right to collect it. In the instant case, A is the defendant bank, B is Mrs. Tribuías, the depositor, and the “someone” to whom the money was unquestionably paid was her husband. This payment to the husband did not discharge the obligation unless Mrs. Tribuías was present and authorized the payment by actually making the mark that the bank alleges is hers. <em>That is the fact </em>in issue, and the question was <em>for the jury.</em>

She claimed she “cried and fought” when she made the discovery that most of her money was gone, until she was told to “get out.” Witness Cassidy was asked: “Did she raise [in 1931] any question about any additional money being due her from her account?” and he answered, “Not to my knowledge. Q. Did she leave the bank perfectly satisfied?” In reply to this he stated his conclusion: “Yes, sir.” That was all for the jury.</p>
