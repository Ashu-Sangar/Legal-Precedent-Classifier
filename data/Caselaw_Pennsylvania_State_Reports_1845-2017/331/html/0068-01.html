Breyer shall pay out of the profits of said equal fourth part or share of said business to my son Bernard August Breyer the sum of fifteen dollars per week during the term of his life, PROVIDED, however, that said weekly payment to my said son, Bernard August Breyer shall be charged against said equal fourth part or share and shall in no event be construed to be a personal charge against or obligation of my said son, Henry W.

Breyer, would have operated to end the $15 payments at the death of the said Henry W.

The first agreement made the sum payable during Bernard’s life. The second agreement, upon which plaintiff bases this action, specifies that said sum is for Bernard’s support and maintenance, thus impliedly limiting it to his lifetime. The language employed clearly demonstrates that the basis and foundation of the contract was to provide maintenance and support for Bernard. The payments could not, obviously, serve this purpose after his death. The fact that by the terms of the agreement Henry’s obligation was to cease upon his own death does not mean that it was to cease only upon that event. What the parties plainly meant was that Henry’s liability should end upon his own or his brother’s death, whichever should first occur. In the first agreement, payments to Bernard are expressly confined to “the term of his life.” The only change in the sxibsequent agreement, subject <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>of the present action, is that the duty to pay is made Henry’s personal liability. The duration of the obligation remains the same.</p>
    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.4",121,[107,501,1151,207]]]'>The court below was clearly right in holding “that the obligation to pay cannot be divorced from the purpose for which it is paid, and that the obligation to support ceased upon the death of the person to be supported.”</p>
