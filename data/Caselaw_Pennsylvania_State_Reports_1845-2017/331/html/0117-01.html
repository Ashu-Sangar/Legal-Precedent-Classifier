While errors committed with regard to one fund may be irremediable as to it, they do not impose upon the court the necessity of persisting in the same errors in the disposition of a subsequent fund: <em>Kellerman’s Estate, <a href="/pa-super/52/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="52 Pa.

It was said by the Supreme Court in that case (pp. 12, 13) : “But the rule of estoppel does not extend to the law which was applied in the earlier distribution to the facts there ascertained when it comes to the second distribution. Though the decree in the first may have rested on a mistaken application of a rule of law—a circumstance which can only be inquired into on appeal—so long as the decree stands it is conclusive with respects to all rights in the fund distributed; but it cannot be made the basis of an estoppel when another distinct fund is to be distributed though it be part of the same estate. The law applied in the first distribution if inapplicable, is not the law of the case; the duty of the auditing judge in distributing on a second amount is to distribute according to law, just as this is the duty of a judge in the first distribution; and in discharging this duty he must be free to disregard a decision of his own, or that of another, upon the same bench, which as he is better informed he would reject. . . . The plain logic of this is that the distributions are wholly distinct and separate, each having its own subject-matter, and are to be treated as though they were two separate actions at law between the same parties, and such questions of fact as had been passed upon in the earlier are not open to dispute in the later. Estoppel does not extend beyond this.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

It does not have the finality of the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>“The prior ruling may have been followed as the law of the case but there is a difference between such adherence and <em>res judicata; </em>one directs discretion, the other supersedes it and compels judgment. In other words, in one it is a question of power, in the other of submission”: <em>Southern Railway Co. v.

The rule of “the law of the case” is one largely of convenience and public policy, both of which are served by stability in judicial decisions, and it must be accommodated to the needs of justice by the discriminating exercise of judicial power. Thus there is an abundance of authority<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> to the effect that where a prior decision is palpably erroneous, it is competent for the court, not as a matter of right but of grace, to cor<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>rect it upon a second review where no wrong or injustice will result thereby, where no rights of property have become vested, where no change has been made in the status of the parties in reliance upon the former ruling, and where, following the decision on a former appeal, the court in another case has laid down a different rule either expressly or by necessary implication overruling the previous decision: <em>Smith v.
