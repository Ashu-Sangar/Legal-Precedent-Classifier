The words of the latter are, ‘unless the agreement, or some memorandum thereof shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith.’ Our act declares that all leases, estates, interests of freehold, &amp;c., shall have the force and effect of leases or estates at will only, unless put in writing and signed <em>hy the parties so making or creating the same, </em>that is, the parties making the leases or creating the estate. It is then only the lessor or grantor who is required to sign the agreement. His contract must be in writing, and signed by him; but the statute requires no written evidence of the engagement of a lessee or grantee. The Statute of Frauds was passed for the protection of landowners. It was intended to guard them against perjuries in the proof of parol contracts. To secure this protection it prescribed a rule of evidence, by which alone their estates can be diverted. This is in<a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>timated in <em>Lowry v. Mehaffey, </em><a href="/watts/10/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="10 Watts 387" data-case-ids="1851016" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0387-01">10 Watts 387</a> [1840]. There it was ruled that an agreement for the sale of land reduced to writing, and signed by the vendor alone, and delivered to the vendee, is all that the statute requires. It is true that in that case it appeared the contract had been partially executed; but not sufficiently to give effect to a parol sale. After all, it was the signature of the agreement by the vendor alone which made the sale effective. The same thing was ruled in <em>McFarson’s Appeal, </em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20503" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Jones 503">1 Jones 503</a>. The case of <em>Wilson v. Clarke, </em><a href="/watts-serg/1/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 554" data-case-ids="1852513" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0554-01">1 W. &amp; S. 554</a>, is not in conflict with these decisions. There the contract rested entirely in parol. The vendor had signed no agreement. He could not, therefore, have been compelled to make a conveyance, and for this reason he was not allowed to enforce the contract specifically against the other party. But in the present case the vendor has made a deed for the land and signed it; he has sent it to an agent to be delivered. The vendees examined it, were satisfied with it, accepted it, and paid the hand-money to the agent. The contract was made and closed at that time. The parties then agreed that the deed should remain in the agent’s hands until the time of credit expired for the remaining purchase-money, or until it should be paid. Surely it cannot be said the plaintiff was not bound by the contract then made. He could not take back his deed with the $2,500 paid him in hand. Had the defendants tendered the remaining purchase-money, a court of equity would doubtless have compelled a consummation of the contract in the delivery of the deed. The contract therefore was mutually obligatory, and evidenced by all that the Statute of Frauds requires.” See also <em>Johnston v. </em>Cowan, <a href="/pa/59/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="59 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="426934" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0275-01">59 Pa. 275</a>, 280; <em>Smith &amp; Fleck’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/69/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="69 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1026415" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0474-01">69 Pa. 474</a>, 480; <em>Witman v.
