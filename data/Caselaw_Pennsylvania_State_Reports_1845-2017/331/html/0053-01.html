This provision was contained also in the by-laws of the state council and in the constitution of Nokomis Tribe.</p>

The applicants in that proceeding testified that the Tribe was under the control of the state and national councils and was bound by the laws of the Order. The charter stated that one of the objects of the corporation was to accumulate, by means of dues and assessments, a sick and death benefit fund for members, or the widows or children or other heirs of deceased members, who were in good standing in the Tribe at the time of their sickness or death.</p>

As already stated, its charter from the State of Pennsylvania was obtained upon the representation that the Tribe was under the control of the parent bodies of the Order and subject to their laws, The incorporation effected a change, not of identity, but of legal form, and did not in any way affect the obligations to the state and national councils which the unincorporated body had originally assumed and which were inherent in the status of the Tribe as a component part of the fraternal organization: <em>Commonwealth v. Heilman, </em><a href="/pa/241/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="241 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="976076" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0374-01">241 Pa. 374</a>. What was said in that case (p. 385 and p. 390) applies equally to the present situation: “The object in this [the incorporation of the state council of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics] was not to sever the relations of the state council with the rest of the order but for certain purposes, to give it legal personality. In other words, the state council was left just as it was before incorporation except that it was endowed with corporate powers. . . . The act [incorporating the state council] did not create a new society, nor was it the foundation of a new organization. It simply gave corporate form to an unincorporated branch of a society already in existence. It was not intended to create a new society with a purpose different from that of the old order, but, on the other hand, the manifest intention <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>was to preserve the old order, and to- make the incorporated branch an integral part of it.” To the same effect is <em>Schriner v. Sachs, </em><a href="/pa/253/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="253 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="1024028" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0611-01">253 Pa. 611</a>, 616.</p>

Section 304 provides for two kinds of nonprofit corporations: those organized upon a nonstock basis, and those upon a stock share basis. It is only in the case of the latter that, upon dissolution of the corporation, the shareholders are entitled to a pro rata distribution of the assets. In section 1001, which applies to the voluntary dissolution of all nonprofit corporations, paragraph B (6) refers to the rights of the members of the corporation, <em>“if any” </em>to share in the corporate assets, with apparent reference to the distinction made in section 304; and in paragraph C it is provided that the assets are to be marshalled and the property rights adjudicated, that property devoted to religious, literary, educational or charitable uses shall not be diverted from the objects for which it was donated or granted, and that the court shall- order the distribution of the property and assets of the corporation among the members <em>“entitled thereto,” </em>and shall direct the disposition to be made of any real or personal property devoted to a religious, literary, educational or charitable use. Thus the act provides for division of assets among the members of the corporation only if they are entitled under existing law, and, so far from compelling distribution among them irrespective of .all other facts and circumstances, expressly excludes property that, by the terms under which it was received by the corporation, should properly continue as a trust. In the present case, in ordering that the assets of Nokomis Tribe be delivered to the Great Council of Pennsylvania, the court decreed that they should be held by the state council for the use and benefit of the members of the Tribe who might become members at large in good standing, and for whose benefit, therefore, in sickness or death, the funds, according to the laws of the Order, had been <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>contributed. To allow the property to be divided among those who happen to be members of the Tribe at the time of its dissolution, instead of holding it as a benefit fund for those entitled, would be to violate the conditions under which the funds were accumulated, as well as the rules of the Order, the obligations of the Tribe, and the law of Pennsylvania as expressed in the cases herein-before cited.</p>
