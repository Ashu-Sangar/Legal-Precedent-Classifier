The Commonwealth alleges that on the night of July 8, 1937, Abraham Flax fatally shot his brother, Morris Flax, in the abdomen, the victim dying three days later. Defendant was charged in two bills of indictment, one with murder, and the other with voluntary and involuntary manslaughter.</p>

She further testified that defendant approached her husband and herself as they stood behind the cake counter and said to her husband: “How much trouble do you want out of me?”, and then shot him and threw him on the floor, and, while he had him on the floor, he fired two more shots wildly. She added: “My husband finally got the gun away from him, chased him out, and he [defendant] ran out and got in the machine.” She also testified that, while the brothers were struggling, she went to phone for help, that she heard her husband fire one shot outside but did not see him do it, and that her husband went to the hospital. At the hospital, according to her testimony, the defendant said: “ ‘There she is, I am sorry I didn’t shoot her,’ ” and her husband “hollered ‘enough’ and said that he [defendant] was the man shot him.” On cross-examination she admitted that her husband had his hand on the gun during the struggle on the floor during which the two shots were fired. For the purpose of impeaching her testimony, she was questioned on cross-examination as to a civil suit involving the proceeds of a life insurance policy containing a double indemnity clause for accidental death. She admitted that she was plaintiff in that case but denied knowledge of the fact that the suit involved the sum of $1,000 and that to succeed in that suit she would have to prove that her husband had not provoked an assault which resulted in his death.</p>

A motorcycle policeman testified that he had approached to Avithin twenty feet of the store when he heard three shots and saw defendant ran from the store and enter an automobile, that the defendant refused to stop at his command, that he pursued and apprehended him. The witness said: “I asked him what he did and he told me he just shot a man in the store.” He said that he took defendant to the hospital where the wounded man identified defendant as his brother and asserted that defendant had shot him, that the defendant made no comment as to this, and that “he said he would not talk until he got a lawyer.” The witness also testified that when defendant saw the deceased’s wife, he hollered: “There she is; I should have shot her.” A police officer testified that he arrived at the hospital “a minute after Morns,” that he found the revolver on the ground where Morris had dropped it, containing four empty shells and one loaded shell. On cross-examination he said that the bullet which had not been fired had “indications of being struck by the firing pin.” Another police officer testified that he asked defendant in the hospital ‘Svhether he had done any shooting” and he replied: “‘Yes, I shot my brother, Morris Flax.’ I asked him, ‘Why did you shoot your brother?’ He said, ‘Oh, domestic difficulty.’ ” The witness testified further that Morris Flax, upon being questioned in the presence of defendant, identified the latter as his brother and stated: “He shot me. He threatened to shoot me for quite some time.” A doctor who attended Morris Flax at the hospital testified that he died three days after admittance from “toxemia, super-induced by infection from the gunshot wound.”</p>

He then left the store without replying to his brother. He talked to his father outside in front of the store for some time. He re-entered the store to go upstairs to find his wife. He said: “I came in the middle of the store. My brother came out and said: ‘I have been going after you for a long time. I will fix you now, damn you.’ ” He testified that his brother was a larger man than he was, that he (the defendant) went to the stock room and got the revolver from the safe. He said: “We had the revolver over thirty years. I was coming out toward the front of the store, just with the intention of scaring my brother. I had the revolver in my hand, and had it pointing down toward the floor.” He testified that his brother then struck him and said to him: “ ‘Damn you, I will get you,’ and ‘I have been going after you a long time.’ ” The witness said that “when he fell down with that punch he had given me, I said, ‘I don’t want the gun to go off. We can get out of this; I will forgive you.’ He says, ‘I will fix you right.’ He grabbed the gun with his two hands. I was scared and worried then. He had his two hands on the gun. I was half-way on the floor. Then he grabbed—I had my hands on it; there were four hands on the gun, and we were both struggling with the gun.” After testifying how they were struggling with both their hands on the gun, he said: “There was one shot and another shot fired. I didn’t know that anyone had been hit, because I didn’t know what was happening; we were going around, naturally, while struggling, and we were laying on the floor, face to face, with the four hands on the gun; side by side. When I felt that my brother Morris had got the gun, I was scared then. I jumped up and ran out the door. . . . My brother jumped up and followed me out and <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>he fired at me going out the door and he fired again, and I tried to get away from my brother. ... I went around in front of my ear to get away <em>from </em>him, I went around the back. As I came to the driver’s seat, the door was closed. ... I shut the door and sat down to get away from my brother, and he had the gun—the glass in the door was down—he pointed the revolver at my head, and I felt like I am going now. . . . He kept on pulling the trigger and saying, ‘I’ll fix you,’ but it didn’t go off.” Defendant said that he then started the car and drove up 18th Street. He testified that he was apprehended a few blocks farther on by a motorcycle officer, that the first time he knew that anything had happened to his brother was when someone had said that his brother “ran to the hospital,” and that he drove to the hospital with the motorcycle officer. He said that when one of the police officers asked his brother: “Is this the man [meaning defendant]?” his brother replied, “Yes, that is him.” He testified further that when his sister-in-law came in later all that he said to her was “There is the cat responsible for our trouble.” On cross-examination he testified that his sister-in-law was present when her husband hit him but not when the shooting occurred.</p>

He said: “I didn’t see anything until I heard two shots fired: . . . Then I turned around, and I seen them both laying on the floor—both boys laying on the floor. . . . Abe [defendant] jumped up and went out of the store.” He testified that Morris had the gun, ran out of the store after defendant, and fired two shots outside. He further testified: “Abe ran around the machine; the machine was standing out at the curb. He said he wanted to start the car to get away. Morris pointed the gun at him and tried to shoot him right at his head, but it didn’t go off. So Abe went away, and Morris ran to the hospital, with the gun.” He also said that after he heard the two shots and went into the store, he didn’t see Mrs. Flax, the deceased’s wife, there.</p>

On cross-examination he testified that the two shots fired by Morris as he left the store were fired in the air. A brother of this witness testified that he was in the tailor shop, heard “about one” shot, ran outside in time to see Morris fire two shots in the air as he pursued defendant, and that Morris pointed the gun at the defendant just before the latter drove off in his car. The father of these two witnesses testified that he arrived in time to see Morris emerge from the store, fire twice in the air, and point the gun at defendant’s head without effect.</p>

In a murder case the jury are not bound to accept the version of the Commonwealth or that of the defense; it is their duty to consider all the testimony and to make up their minds therefrom as to the facts. It was possible in this case that the jury might have found that there was a certain amount of truth in the evidence produced by the Commonwealth and some truth in that produced by the de<a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>fense, but that neither side was wholly to be believed. On this theory, the jury might have believed the story of the threats to take defendant’s life, and that he was put in great fear by such threats; and that when he saw Boceo [the deceased] coming toward him it raised a passion of terror in his mind, and he shot under the control of that passion.” In that case we quoted from 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 172, as follows: “Voluntary manslaughter is a homicide intentionally committed under the influence of passion.” Page 173: “The term ‘passion’ as here used includes both anger and terror, provided they reach a degree of intensity sufficient to obscure temporarily the reason of the person affected.” “Passion, as used in a charge defining manslaughter . . . means any of the emotions of the mind known as anger, rage, sudden resentment or terror, rendering the mind incapable of cool reflection”: 6 Words &amp; Phrases, p. 5227. “Although anger is the passion usually existing in cases of this class, yet any other passion, as sudden resentment or terror, rendering the mind incapable of cool reflection, may reduce the grade of the crime”: 21 Cyc. 737.</p>

According to defendant’s testimony, above reviewed, the deceased when confronting defendant used language and indulged in conduct well calculated to raise in the latter apprehensions of grievous or fatal bodily harm. Defendant, after recounting his brother’s words and acts, declared: “I was scared and worried then.” This testimony, if credited by the jury, might well lead it to believe that defendant if he discharged the gun intentionally did so under the influence of well grounded fear or terror. If he did, he was at most guilty of no higher degree of crime than voluntary manslaughter.</p>

On the other hand, the version of the occurrence as told by the defendant and his witnesses, is, in substance that the shooting in this case was purely accidental. ... In other words, according to the version of this occurrence as told by the defense, no crime was committed by this prisoner, whereas if the occurrence happened in the manner and under the circumstances detailed by the witnesses for the Commonwealth, it would be murder in one or other of its degrees.”</p>

The defendant is under no obligation to take the stand and deny or explain or attempt to excuse the homicide, but if he does, and he explains or attempts to excuse it on the theory of self-defense or of an accidental killing, and even though the theory thus advanced by him in his testimony is rejected by the jury, the burden still remains on the Commonwealth to prove the essential ingredients of at least one of the crimes charged in the indictment <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>before it is entitled to a conviction.

If a malicious killing is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury cannot find defendant guilty of murder in <em>either </em>first <em>or </em>second degree. If the evidence does not warrant the conviction of defendant of murder in either the first or second degree, the jury must then consider whether or not the essentials of the crime of voluntary manslaughter are present, except in those cases where it is clear that there is no evidence and no permissible inference from the evidence, pointing to the offense of voluntary manslaughter, and the court then so charges the jury.</p>
    <p id="b205-3" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[139,1100,1154,915]]]'>The crime of voluntary manslaughter consists of an intentional and unlawful killing of a human being without malice, either express or implied, but committed under the immediate influence of sudden passion. Just as malice is the impelling power of murder, either anger or rage or resentment or terror is the impelling power of voluntary manslaughter. The sudden passion which will reduce an unlawful killing to voluntary manslaughter must be due to a legally adequate provocation. While there is no such thing as justifiable or excusable malice, the law does recognize justifiable or excusable passion, whether that passion be anger, rage, resentment or terror. It is legally justifiable or excusable when there is a legally sufficient cause for it. The law regards with some tolerance an unlawful act impelled by a justifiably passionate heart, but has no toleration whatever for an unlawful act impelled by a malicious heart.</p>

When a new trial is had on this murder indictment the defendant cannot, of course, be tried for murder in the first degree. The verdict of the jury in the trial now being reviewed was equivalent to defendant’s acquittal of that crime. See <em>Com. v. </em>
