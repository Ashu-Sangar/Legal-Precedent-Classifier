This account had been in the name of both as “Joint Owners. Payable to either before or after the death of the other.” The bank asserted that because of an “Agreement of Waiver and Release” executed by the husband for a substantial consideration during the reorganization of the bank, there was no longer any liability on the account. Appellees contended, however, and the trial court ruled, that, the deposit being held by the entire-ties, the wife’s failure to join personally in this agreement rendered the release ineffective.

At common law four main types of <em>“joint estates” </em>or <em>co-ownership </em>existed: joint tenancies, tenancies in common, coparcenary, and tenancies by entire-ties. Each had salient differences: Tiffany, Real Property (2d ed.), vol. 1, chapter VII, analyzes them fully. See also Tiedeman, Real Property (3d ed.), chapter IX. Joint tenants at common law hold the entire estate by the half and by the whole, <em>per my et per tout. </em>See <em>Leach’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/282/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="282 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1088332" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0545-01">282 Pa. 545</a>, 549.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Joint tenancies have four unities: interest, title, time and possession. We need not discuss fully the attributes of tenancy in common or coparcenary. See 1 Tiffany, Real Property 643.

All four of the unities are present. But as Blackstone says (page 182) : “. . . if an estate in fee be given to a man and his wife, they are neither properly joint-tenants, nor tenants in common: for husband and wife being considered as one person in law, they cannot take the estate by moieties, but both are seised of the entirety, <em>per tout, et non per my: </em>the consequence of which is, that neither the husband nor the wife can dispose of any part without the assent of the other, but the whole must remain to the survivor.” To the four unities of a joint tenancy therefore is added the unity of the husband and wife as a person in the law. Coke upon Littleton, section 291, in treating the subject of entireties, refers to the unity of husband and wife as the basis for the estate and relies on Bracton's <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>maxim: “Man and wife are as one person, for they are one in flesh and blood.” <em>As a consequence of this relation many incidents flow therefrom quite different from those arising from a joint tenancy or any other form of co-ownership. </em>While a tenancy by entireties resembles a common law joint tenancy in that each spouse owns the whole and therefore is entitled to enjoyment of the entirety and to survivorship,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> it differs in that neither one has any individual portion which can be alienated or separated, or which can be reached by the creditors of either spouse.

The existence of the estate depends on the marital relationship. At common law, <em>one of the incidents </em>which arose from this same relationship was the <em>control </em>exercised by the husband over the estate and its management. See <em>Fairchild v.

As an incident of these estates by entireties is the power that each gives the other, at the time of the estate’s creation, to act for the other. This conclusion is beyond debate. In <em>Milano v. Fayette T. &amp; T. Co., </em>supra, the Superior Court discussed the difference between deposits in the name of husband and wife and those in the name of husband or wife. There the deposit read “and,” and the bank paid out on an order drawn by the husband alone. President Judge Keller clearly distinguished the cases where deposits were payable to either husband or wife, on the ground that while in such cases there can exist authority to withdraw the corpus, there was no such authority to the husband alone where the words “payable to husband and wife” were used.

Even after these acts either spouse might lease and collect the rent as an incident of that relationship. At p. 533, the Court said: “. . . presumptively the moneys received will be expended for the benefit of both of them.” In <em>Casner v.

This act did not destroy the res of the estate but inured to its preservation. The refusal in <em>Schroeder v. Gulf Refining Co.
