    <p id="b164-7" data-blocks='[["BL_164.9",164,[285,868,1155,1130]]]'>Defendant’s husband, Louis Levin, a merchant, became financially involved. In order to effect a contemplated settlement with his creditors he needed $2,000 in addition to funds on hand. He applied to plaintiff bank for a loan in that amount. His application was refused, but the president of the bank informed him that they would make a loan to defendant, Levin’s wife. The reason for their selection of her as the borrower probably lay in the fact that the property in which she and her husband lived was owned by her and the title was in her name. Levin brought her to the bank and there she signed a judgment note for $4,000 payable to plaintiff one day after date. The bank withheld $2,100, which it applied in liquidation of the balance then due it upon a note on which Levin was liable as endorser. The balance of $1,884.67 ($1,900 less the discount) was credited to defendant, but that same afternoon she checked out this sum to her husband, who on the following day deposited it in his own account for use in the settlement. To the extent to which interest on the note was thereafter paid to the bank it was paid by Levin.</p>

The present proceedings originated in a petition by her to open the judgment and allow her to defend on the ground that she was a married woman and had signed the note as an accommodation maker for her husband. The judgment was opened <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>by agreement of tbe parties and tbe case proceeded to trial.

Even from plaintiff’s own evidence it appears that all the negotiations for the loan were with Levin. The original application was by him, it was at the bank’s suggestion that the loan was made instead to defendant, and the president of the bank knew that the money was intended solely for Levin. More than half of it was retained to pay his indebtedness to the bank and was not delivered to defendant at all. It is true that the balance, as a matter of form, was credited to her account, but, by what was obviously pre-arrangement, it was immediately turned over to her husband for the use for which it was originally designed. Defendant had no financial interest of her own in the loan, received no personal benefit from it, was permitted no voice in its disposition, and was not afforded any real opportunity to exercise rights of ownership with respect to it. These circumstances distinguish the transaction sharply from such a case, for example, as <em>New Philadelphia Loan Association v. Druian, </em><a href="/pa-super/101/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="101 Pa. Super. 62" data-case-ids="692967" data-case-paths="/pa-super/101/0062-01">101 Pa. Superior Ct. 62</a>, 65, and their collective weight was such that the court could not have declared as a matter of law that defendant did not sustain the burden cast upon her of proving her exemption <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>from liability. Tbe most to which plaintiff was entitled was to have the question submitted to a jury, and the verdict of that tribunal, there being no complaint of trial errors, is conclusive.</p>
