The case was heard on bill and answer. If there is any objection to such a proceeding in equity, it may be resolved by dealing with the case<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> as a proceeding for a declaratory judgment construing the deed or contract: section 2, Act of June 18, 1923, P.

      <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>for the use of the inhabitants of the Said County of Dauphin.” The deed was executed in performance of a contract (if written, it has been lost) recited in a bond dated March 4, 1785, given by Harris to the Commonwealth. The contract appears to have provided that, in consideration of the creation of Dauphin County as a separate county<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and the establishment of Harrisburg as the county seat, Harris would convey the said lots as sites for a courthouse and jail. The commissioners were authorized by the Act of March 4, 1785, 2 Sm. L. 284, 286, to accept the lots for the purposes specified, pursuant to which the deed referred to was executed and delivered. The courthouse and jail were erected. The answer admitted that steps had been taken, as averred by plaintiffs, to sell the land, subject to the approval of the court of common pleas of the county. See Act of May 2, 1929, P. L. 1278, Art. VIII, section 675, 16 PS section 675, as amended by Act of April 21, 1937, P. L. 328.</p>

It has long been settled that mere expression of a purpose will not of and by itself debase a fee: <em>Kerlin v.

It has likewise been held that when limitations are relied on to debase a fee they must be created by express terms or clear implication, a result of the policy of the law favoring alienability of land: <em>Methodist Church v.

Easton, </em><a href="/us/170/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="170 U.S. 383" data-case-ids="3599507" data-case-paths="/us/170/0383-01">170 U. S. 383</a>, at 397, in construing quite similar title papers, is particularly appropriate: “If the grant be viewed as one merely to trustees to hold Tor the uses and purposes mentioned in the act of the assembly,’ it is clear that the fee was not upon a condition subsequent nor one upon limitation. There are no apt, technical words (such as so <em>that; provided; if it shall happen; </em>etc.: 4 Kent Com., note b, p. 132; 2 Washburn on Real Property, p. 3) <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>contained in the grant, nor is the declaration of the use coupled with any clause of reentry or a provision that the estate conveyed should cease or be void on any contingency. (Ib.) So, also, we fail to find in the patent the usual and apt words to create a limitation (such as <em>while; so long as; until; during; </em>&amp;c.: 4 Kent, Ib.), or words of similar import. And, for reasons already stated, if we disregard the absence of technical terms or provisions importing a condition or limitation, and examine the deed with a view of eliciting the clear intention of the parties, we are driven to the conclusion that it was the intention of the grantors to convey their entire estate in the land.” See also Eestatement, Property, section 44 and comments. Cases like <em>Pennsylvania Horticultural Society v. </em>Craig, <a href="/pa/240/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="240 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="993205" data-case-paths="/pa/240/0137-01">240 Pa. 137</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.%20678" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="87 A. 678">87 A. 678</a>, and <em>Slegel v.
