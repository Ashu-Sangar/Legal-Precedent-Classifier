The petition was filed on the morning of December 31, 1937, following reported public declarations alleged to have been made by the Mayor, to the effect that he would on that day take possession of petitioner’s property. Petitioner gave notice to defendants that the petition would be presented and that application for a rule to show cause and for a restraining order would be asked for. Counsel <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>for the petitioner in the presence of the city solicitor, who had accepted service on behalf of defendants, appeared before a majority of the members of the court and formally presented the petition. Counsel for both sides were heard. When the hearing began the Mayor had not yet issued his Proclamation, but before the hearing was concluded, the Proclamation was promulgated. A rule to show cause why the court should not take original jurisdiction of the proceeding was granted, with an order restraining defendants from interfering with plaintiff’s property <em>pendente lite; </em>defendants were directed to answer and the application was set down to be heard January 6, 1938. Defendants filed an answer from which it appeared at the argument that issues of fact were raised. The court accordingly referred the petition and answer, together with plaintiff’s bill in equity, which had been made part of the petition, as the suit of which the court was asked to take original jurisdiction, to Honorable Thomas D. Finletter, President Judge of Court of Common Pleas No. 4 of Philadelphia County “to hear the evidence, determine the facts, make findings thereon and report to this court.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The learned judge, with characteristic care and thoroughness, heard the parties and the evidence<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> presented by them and prepared his report. Though not required to do so by the order of reference, he exhibited his report <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>to the parties with leave to file exceptions. Defendants filed exceptions<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> which, after hearing, were dismissed; his report, together with his action on the exceptions, was then filed in this court. Defendants were directed to file an answer to the bill which had been made part of the petition, and the entire proceeding was ordered for argument May 23,1938. Counsel were informed that argument would then be heard on the whole case, i. e., on the rule to show cause why original jurisdiction should not be taken of the cause set forth in the bill and also on the merits of the bill and the answer to it; this procedure was adopted because the bill in equity contained the same averments as the petition for the rule, so that there was no reason why two arguments should be heard, one on the rule and one on the bill and answer. The case was then fully argued and has since been duly considered; all the members of the court who heard the argument agree that the rule should be made absolute and that, on the merits of the bill and answer, an injunction<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> should be granted as prayed for.</p>

The Mayor insisted that the Gas Works Company was indebted to the City in a large sum composed of claims asserted under a number of headings; these claims he incorporated in the answer by reference to a pending proceeding in equity brought by the City in Court of Common Pleas No. 4, asking for an accounting based on the same claims. We quote from paragraph 15 of the answers stating defendants’ position in this respect: “That, in addition to the said items of surcharge set forth in the Controller’s Reports, as hereinbefore referred to, <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>there are other sums due to the said City by the said Philadelphia Gas Works Company, all of which are specifically set forth in a certain Bill of Complaint filed by the City of Philadelphia against the United Gas Improvement Company, [and others] ... in the Court of Common Pleas No. 4, as of December Term, 1935, No. 6464, which action is now pending and in which the City seeks an accounting of and to recover the amounts set forth in the surcharges appearing in the said Controller’s Reports and for the further causes set forth in the said Bill of Complaint.

    <p id="b399-4" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[106,1059,1154,860]]]'>The City’s equity proceeding, asking for an accounting, had not been tried (though under the rules, ample time for trial had passed) when the present proceeding began. Whether the existence of the asserted indebtedness to the City would have constituted a reason for not accompanying the termination notice with payment for betterments and additions, within the terms of the lease, need not now be decided because President Judge Fin-letter, in his report, specifically finds that when the notice was given March 16, 1936, nothing was due on account of those claims made by defendants in their answer to the petition or in the bill filed in Common Pleas No. 4, but that, on the contrary, the City was indebted to the Gas Works Company, and that on December 31, 1937, the amount due under the betterments clause was $288,179.70.</p>

What has been said of one is therefore applicable to the other. We can reach no other conclusion than that plaintiff is entitled to the equitable relief prayed for. The defendant Mayor’s threats, culminating in his Proclamation repeating them under color of his office, and in direct contradiction of the ordinance of Council passed over his veto December 29, 1937, exhibited such disregard for law that it was necessary immediately, in granting the rule to show cause on December 31, 1937, also to restrain defendants from taking any of the threatened steps to interfere with plaintiff’s peaceful possession and operation of the Gas Works pending the determination of the rule. Defendants not only proposed to trespass on property lawfully in plaintiff’s use and possession, and by the ordinance passed by Council on December 29th intended to remain in its possession, but also to exclude plaintiff therefrom; they threatened a continuing trespass. The record sufficiently shows the character of plaintiff’s operations and the necessity of supplying, without interruption, enormous gas consumption required by residents of Philadelphia, to indicate the probable magnitude of damage resulting to plaintiff and to residents of the city if the threatened trespass were not restrained.

Defendants’ position seems to be, first, that the City had a remedy of which it was deprived, to sue for its real property in ejectment and have a jury trial; second, that the effect of our decision on the bill and answer will be to control Court of Common Pleas No. 4 in making its final decree in the City’s equity suit in that Court. We have already referred to the agreement of the parties that both cases should be regarded as heard together by President Judge Finletter. That City’s argument is that, as his findings of fact in the suit in No. 4 Court will probably be the same as those reported to this Court under the order of reference, if we now accept the findings reported to us, the judges of Common Pleas No. 4 will be constrained to follow the views of this court expressed in the decree now to be made; in other words, that the judges of the court below will accept President Judge Finletter’s findings because we have accepted them. That result may follow and properly, too; but it does not support the contention of want of due process. Due process is as much required by the state constitution as by the fourteenth amendment and, as we understand it, is, for circumstances such as are now presented, defined in the same terms. This court has ample power now, if such action were deemed advisable,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> to remove the equity suit into this court and dis<a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>pose of it without waiting for its further consideration by the learned judges of Common Pleas No. 4. But we have not considered that step necessary because defendants themselves made their bill in that case part of their answer in this. We refer to the subject only to show that if our disposition of the proceeding of which we have taken original jurisdiction happens to dispose of a proceeding involving the same issues pending below, defendants are not deprived of due process; apart from our undoubted power to bring the record here by certiorari and dispose of it, defendants themselves elected to submit their claim here.</p>
