He refers to the Act of July 9, 1919, P. L. 814, 36 PS section 3421 et seq., providing for a commission to act with a similar commission created by New Jersey in building the <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>bridge. Tbe legislature had prescribed that tbe bridge building commission should consist of tbe Board of Commissioners of Public Grounds and Buildings of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">4</a> tbe Mayor of Tbe City of Philadelphia, and two other citizens “to be appointed by tbe Governor.” By subsequent amendments<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">5</a> tbe Governor was authorized to appoint two additional members, and tbe Governor, Auditor General and State Treasurer were substituted for tbe Board of Commissioners of Public Grounds and Buildings.</p>
    <p id="b461-3" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[123,881,1156,685]]]'>Tbe statute now before us contains a provision, Article VI, of tbe agreement, in these words: “Tbe control, operation, tolls and other revenues of tbe aforesaid existing bridge across tbe Delaware River between tbe City of Philadelphia and tbe City of Camden, and of all real and personal property appurtenant thereto or used in connection therewith, shall vest in the commission on tbe first day of July, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-one, and tbe terms of tbe members of tbe aforesaid Pennsylvania Commission [i. e., the bridge building commission] and tbe aforesaid New Jersey Interstate Bridge Commission shall cease and terminate on that date.”</p>

Tbe power of tbe legislature to destroy that commission is not now challenged. Tbe learned court below thought that, as tbe earlier legislation bad authorized tbe Governor to appoint members to tbe former commission, tbe legislature must have intended in tbe new Act to say that be should be regarded as having now appointed tbe <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>four men whom he or his predecessor in office had previously appointed to the abolished commission.</p>
    <p id="b462-4" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[283,454,1154,532]]]'>The learned judge also expressed an alternative view to the effect that the Act did not create the Commission, but merely authorized its creation by the Governor’s execution of the contract, which execution operated as an appointment of the members by the Governor. Two additional positions are taken by appellees’ counsel, (1) “It would be unconstitutional for the legislature to appoint the members of a non-legislative body such as the” Commission; (2) the legislature by resolution approved the removal.</p>
    <p id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[283,999,1154,1074]]]'>1. Considering the first position, we again quote the legislative words designating who shall constitute the Pennsylvania members of the corporation at its inception. “The first eight commissioners for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall be the Governor of the Commonwealth, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer, the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, and the four additional persons now serving as members of the Pennsylvania Commission, existing by virtue of” previous legislation already referred to. We cannot see the slightest difficulty in understanding that provision to be a legislative designation or appointment by accurate description of the eight members by reference to offices then held by them. The appointment was complete; the Governor could add nothing to it; he could take nothing from it; the appointees were clearly described. He could have vetoed the bill; instead, he approved it, but his approval was not the selection of members of the commission, because that had already been done by the legislature.</p>
    <p id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.6",462,[283,2085,1153,262]],["BL_463.1",463,[122,346,1152,479]]]'>2. We can see no basis for the contention that, by signing the contract, the Governor made the appointments. Once both states passed the law, the Governor’s duty to sign the contract became ministerial so far as it had any relation to the first members of the proposed <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>corporation; tlie authority to execute the contract in a fox*m agx*eed to had been conferred by the statute which the Governor had approved. On behalf of New Jersey the contract was executed (we assume) by the New Jersey Interstate Bridge Commission; the states were competent to agi’ee upon any agency for execution that was mutually agreeable. Signing the contract was not appointing members within the words of Article VI, section 4, of the Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b463-3" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[122,837,1154,369]]]'>3. The third ground relied on by appellees is based on the doctrine of the separation of powers. Appellees say, “Under our system of the separation of powers it seems very doubtful whether it is within the province of the Legislature to create a body exercising no legislative functions whatsoever, but performing only executive duties, and then to name the individual members thereof.”</p>
    <p id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[122,1218,1155,1129]],["BL_464.1",464,[284,351,1153,96]]]'>It may first be noted that appellees’ statement is not accurate in describing the Commission as “a body exercising no legislative functions whatsoever, but performing only executive duties.” The Commission has duties that are legislative in character. The portion of the bridge in Pennsylvania and the approaches to it in the City of Philadelphia are part of the highway system of Pennsylvania: see <em>Westmoreland Chemical Co. v. Pub. Serv. Com., </em><a href="/pa/294/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="294 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1113416" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0451-01">294 Pa. 451</a>, 456 et seq., <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20407" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="144 A. 407">144 A. 407</a>; <em>Tranter v.

Moreover, an examination of Article IV contained in section 1 of the Act of 1931, P. L. 579, shows that delegable duties in the maintenance and improvement of highways have been delegated to the Commission. It is therefore unnecessary to refer to cases on this subject from other jurisdictions, cited in the briefs. There would also seem to be an obvious difficulty in accepting appellees’ view on this point: the same statute expressly provides that the legislature of New Jersey shall appoint the members (after the first eight appointed by description) from time to time. We must assume that the sa^e doc<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>trine of the separation of powers that appellees would invoke is likewise respected in New Jersey.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">6</a>

    <p id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.4",464,[283,458,1153,534]]]'>4. Appellees’ fourth point is also without merit. On January 11, 1937, after the Governor’s removal notice of December 10, 1936, both branches of the legislature passed a concurrent resolution reciting in its preamble that appellants had questioned the Governor’s authority; it also provided: “WHEREAS, The General Assembly is of the opinion that the removed commissioners are not appointees of the General Assembly, and were properly removed by the Governor of the Commonwealth ; now, therefore, be it</p>

      <em>Resolved </em>(if the House of Representatives concur [we assume it did]), that it is the sense of the General Assembly that the said Thomas B.

    <p id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[279,1328,1155,584]]]'>It is the duty of the courts to determine what the Act of 1931 means; the legislature has no power by resolution to determine how that statute shall be interpreted in its application to a past transaction or that appellants “were lawfully removed as members of the [Commission] and that they no longer hold office as such”: <em>Reiser v. William Tell Saving Fund Assn., </em><a href="/pa/39/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="39 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="996355" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0137-01">39 Pa. 137</a>.

It should however be added that we are construing a contract made by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey. It may very well have been considered desirable, in relinquishing the con<a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>trol theretofore exercised severally by the two states and in turning the property over to the two-state corporation, that both states desired that the corporation should have the benefit of the experience acquired by the members of the superseded state commissions and for that reason provided that they should be designated as the legislative appointees to serve until the end of the unexpired terms for which they had been appointed to the superseded commissions. We regard the meaning of the words of the appointment, quoted above, as too plain for argument but refer to the subject now on the principle that even if there was ambiguity a state should be reluctant to interpret ambiguous language in its favor.
