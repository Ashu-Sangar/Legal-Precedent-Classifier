This issue arises out of the following provision of the policy: “This entire policy shall be void, unless otherwise provided by agreement in writing added thereto, — (a) if the interest of the insured be other than unconditional and sole ownership; ... or (d) if any change other than by the death of the insured take place in the interest, title or possession of the subject of insurance (except change of occupants without increase of hazard).”</p>

Smith, her father, a deed for the farm on which the barn and contents covered by the policy of insurance were located. He procured the insurance in her behalf. She gave him a power of attorney, which she alone signed, her husband not joining, in pursuance of which he entered into an agreement with William N. Soles and Katherine Tyson, for the conveyance to them of the farm and personal property thereon for a cash consideration of $5,000, of which $200 was paid at the signing of the agreement. As part of the consideration, Soles and Tyson were to convey certain property which belonged to them to plaintiff. Apparently, owing to some difficulty in making title, this conveyance has never been carried through. However, Soles and Tyson entered into possession of the farm on March 21,1934, a few days after the agreement was executed, and continued to occupy it at the time of the fire on November 9, 1934, and down to the present time. No deed has been made to them.</p>
