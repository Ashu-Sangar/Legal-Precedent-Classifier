The court in its decree surcharged the accountant as to one mortgage investment but dismissed all the remaining exceptions.

    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[307,638,1151,1020]]]'>The trust was created by the will of George M. Hartón, deceased, who died in 1920. The relevant provision of his will did not relieve accountant from the duty of maintaining a trust corpus of legal investments. The accountant invested funds of the estate in securities of three types: ordinary or “straight” mortgages, wholly owned by the trust estate; participating interests in single mortgages; and participating interests in a group or aggregate of mortgages comprising what is known as a mortgage pool. The beneficiary of the trust is George M. Hartón, Jr., a son of the testator. By the terms of the will the trust terminated on October 23, 1933, when the <em>cestui que trust </em>became of age, the corpus being now payable to him. The trustee filed its account in Aprilj 1935, together with a supplement bringing it down to the date of the audit, and requested the court to malee distribution in kind of certain assets, including the interests of the estate in real property. To this account various exceptions were filed.</p>

Payton Wright mortgage,” $9,000 in amount, on a Murrayhill Avenue property, a duplex dwelling, in Pittsburgh. Wright had given his bond and mortgage on the property 24 years before, in 1899, to the executor of a decedent’s estate and the latter sold the mortgage to accountant, which took title thereto in its own name and so held it for the trust estate until, prompted by our decision in <em>Yost’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/316/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="316 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="1159022" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0463-01">316 Pa. 463</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.%20383" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="175 A. 383">175 A. 383</a>, it assigned the mortgage of record to itself as trustee. When the mortgage was taken third parties were in possession of the premises as owners, and accountant does not ap<a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>pear to have made any investigation to discover the whereabouts or solvency of the bondsman, Wright; he is now dead and it is admitted the bond is valueless. Wright’s grantees assumed no liability on the mortgage. The interest was paid until November, 1933, when it went into default, and no rent was received thereafter until after foreclosure in February, 1935.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[114,735,1157,1677]]]'>The exception to this item in the account, as presented to the court below, challenged the propriety of the investment on several grounds. The court found all but one of the latter untenable; it imposed a surcharge on the sole ground that, as exceptant claimed, “the mortgage was negligently managed.” The court justified the surcharge principally on the basis of two inspections of the premises made by the auditing judge after the audit, held in May, 1936, which, it said, showed the following: “For many years the house, the walks around the house, and the lot with its retaining wall in the front and steps to the house level, have been greatly neglected. The poplar trees along Murrayhill Avenue have lifted the sidewalks and the street has not been kept in good repair. The trustee should have noted all the defects in this property and required payments on the principal of the mortgage. ... A superficial examination of the premises shows that it will take a very large sum of money to restore this property in such manner as to make it desirable and bring it in demand as an investment.” The court below in its opinion further said: “An inspection was made after the trial. A walk around the house and a view of the rear dispelled all doubt about the necessity for sustaining the exception which complained of bad judgment. But without any inspection at all, the photographs and the facts disclosed in the testimony, and, especially, that the mortgage was twenty-four years old when it was purchased in 1923, and the bond accompanying it was outlawed, and there was no chance to recover except from the mortgaged premises, were sufficient to sustain the exception.”</p>

The surcharge appears to have been imposed, at least in part, because the investment was improvidently <em>made </em>in the first instance. Apart from accountant’s pertinent contention that no objection was made to the original investment, we discern nothing in the record before us to indicate that accountant was wanting in ordinary prudence either in making or in managing the investment.</p>

There was no lack of good faith, and promptly after our decision in <em>Yost’s Estate, </em>supra, the correct status of the investment was placed on record. The beneficiary received proper notices and no objection on this account was made, as found by the court itself. The circumstances were clearly such as to require the application of the principle established in <em>Guthrie’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/320/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="320 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="1163656" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0530-01">320 Pa. 530</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20248" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="182 A. 248">182 A. 248</a>, and <em>Dillon’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/324/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="324 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="1171324" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0252-01">324 Pa. 252</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20134" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="188 A. 134">188 A. 134</a>, where trustees in taking titles to “straight” mortgages in their own names were held to have acted in good faith and not required to account in cash for the sum invested in the mortgages.</p>

The fact that the mortgage was one of many years’ standing when purchased by accountant did not necessarily condemn it. The mortgaged premises were appraised in March, 1923, before the investment was accepted, at $15,000. The margin of security was then ample, and the mortgage’s age did not exclude it from the field of legitimate trust investment. It was not essential, to make the mortgage a <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>legal investment under the applicable provision of the Fiduciaries Act then in force (Act of June 29, 1923, P. L. 955, section 41(a) 1, 20 PS section 801), that the accountant secure evidence of the financial responsibility of Wright, the mortgagor and bondsman, or ascertain that the debt could be collected from him before taking an assignment of the mortgage. We said in <em>Curran’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/312/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="312 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="1150684" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0416-01">312 Pa. 416</a>, 421, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.%20597" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="167 A. 597">167 A. 597</a>: “The important question is, is there a mortgage of real estate, a real security?” See also <em>Maroney’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/311/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="311 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1146224" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0336-01">311 Pa. 336</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20914" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="166 A. 914">166 A. 914</a>. Accountant could do no more, when charged with a breach of its fiduciary duty, than show, as it did, that when the money was invested, the apparently reliable information which it obtained showed that the margin of security was ample, that there was no default, and that in all other respects the investment was suitable for fiduciary purposes.</p>
    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[118,1263,1157,1129]]]'>The charge of mismanagement is not sustained. Accountant’s evidence showed that the interest on the mortgage was regularly paid until November, 1933, prior to which the trust had terminated by exceptant’s reaching majority. The only taxes then in arrears were for the year 1933. In 1926 and 1929 accountant secured re-appraisals of the premises, and since these showed that the security was still adequate, extensions of the mortgage were granted. On re-appraisal in 1932, at $13,200, no further extension was granted. Efforts to secure payment of the mortgage, or reduction of the principal, were unavailing. Finally, a year and a quarter after default, it became apparent that the owner could not carry the property and foreclosure was resorted to. It was not shown that an earlier foreclosure would have benefited the estate, or that the delay in settlement of the trustee’s account was in any way prejudicial to the exceptant’s interest. After foreclosure a substantial sum was spent by accountant in rehabilitating the property, it was placed in tenantable condition, and was rented at the time of the audit.</p>

      <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>The record is barren of evidence to convict accountant of neglect in administering either the mortgage investment or the premises themselves after possession was taken. We cannot consider the facts disclosed by the personal inspections of the auditing judge, made after the hearing in 1986, as controlling. If repair of the premises had been neglected, as the court declared, there was nothing to demonstrate that this condition existed during the regular course of administration of the trust, up to October, 1933, or that thereafter the trustee would have been justified in doing or spending more, by way of rehabilitation of the premises, than it proved it did on taking possession. Nor was there evidence tending to show that accountant neglected, prior to that date, to ascertain that the owner was maintaining the premises in a fit condition. The examination of the property made by the auditing judge, which is analogous to that of a jury of view, could have little bearing on the question of proper maintenance. We do not doubt the propriety of the inspection, as within his competent powers as the trier of fact: 2 Wigmore, Evidence (2d ed.), 709, section 1169. Here, however, the issue was not the condition of the premises at the time of the audit, but whether the trustee had observed common prudence in requiring the owner to maintain the premises in reasonable repair during the life of the mortgage, and in caring for the premises itself after occupancy was taken over from the owner. Just as in the cases holding that a jury’s view is to enable it more thoroughly to comprehend and weigh the testimony <em>(Flower v. Baltimore, etc., R.

One of the exceptions was to an investment in a participating interest in a $225,000 mortgage on certain store and apartment buildings, of which the share of this estate was $1,500. When the mortgage was taken by accountant, the property was appraised by the latter’s employee, a competent judge of real estate, at a valuation of $424,000. There is no suggestion that this was in excess of the fair value of the premises, and where the dealings between the mortgagor and the trustee were, as here, without suggestion of collusion, no complaint can justly be made that the appraisement was made by an employee rather than a so-called “disinterested third party.” It is not apparent that the appraisement was for that reason more favorable to the mortgagor than it would otherwise have been.</p>

The balance, to the extent required by the mortgage, was then applied in payment of interest on the principal amount thereof and distributed as income to the participating estates, on which the accountant likewise took commissions of five per cent as compensation for its services as trustee, so long as there was no default. Such an arrangement, far from amounting to a secret profit received by the trustee at the expense of the trust estates, was for their benefit and enabled the trustee at <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>all times to see that the property was efficiently managed to the advantage of all. The compensation received by the trustee as rental agent for the owner was not money which the participating trust interests would otherwise be entitled to. They would have belonged to the owner, or would have been paid out to some other rental agent as fair compensation for services rendered. It was not shown that the rental commissions were in any sense a profit; on the contrary, they were just charges for services performed by accountant in its required administration of the trust, and their receipt does not offend the admitted rule against a trustee’s obtaining a bonus or commission from dealings with specific trust property, as commented upon in A. L. I. Restatement of Trusts, sections 170 and 203 (pp. 438 and 549).</p>

The Act of 1925 modified the established rule, sanctioned for decades by statute as well as judicial decision, that a trust company must so designate its trust investments as to indicate clearly to which trust each investment belongs; it provided that the fiduciary relationship might appear <em>solely upon the boohs and records of the trustee, </em>where <em>participating interests in a general trust fund </em>of mortgages on real estate <em>are allotted to various estates. </em>It is claimed that where investments of this character were made before the Act of 1925, supra, became effective, a surcharge must be imposed, since in many instances the mortgages were taken in the name of the trustee in its corporate capacity, without designation of their trust status as a matter of public record.</p>

Clearly the exceptants should not be permitted to shift their loss to these trustees. It would be unconscionable to require the trustees to account in cash under the facts of this case.

It is to be understood, however, that the decree of the court below is affirmed not because the conduct of the trustees was rightful, nor because there was an affirmance of their conduct by the exceptants, but because, under the circumstances, a grave injustice would result if the trustees were required to account in cash as claimed.”</p>

The certificates are offered for distribution to the beneficiary instead of cash and the sum represented by them cannot be realized at the present time. The pool referred to is known as No. 1 in the Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company and was closed by appropriate action of that corporation on January 10, 1932, and thereafter no new mortgages were added. On July 17, 1933, the pool was closed by direction of the orphans’ court and liquidation <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>began. There has been liquidation of all claims of participants to the extent of 18 per cent and some to the extent of 35 per cent, the latter allowed by the courts in necessitous cases. No payments in excess of 35 per cent have been permitted nor will they be until all participants have received a like amount. On the day it was closed, Pool No. 1, created and operated by the Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company, had a total face value of $14,491,515 and it consisted of 1,500 mortgages. . . . The pool is composed entirely of installment mortgages. Interest and an installment of principal of all the mortgages were payable each month. There were no foreclosure of mortgages in the pool prior to November, 1931, and until that time there were no mortgages in default permitted to remain in the pool. When default occurred the mortgage was withdrawn and another substituted.”</p>

It would be unconscionable to impose a surcharge on the present accountant on the sole ground of the technical breach of trust asserted, without proof of other violation of duty more clearly responsible for the loss which, events may ultimately show, has occurred.

As stated above, the pool contains an aggregate of 1,500 mortgages with a face value of many millions of dollars. Two thousand different trust estates, similar to except-ant’s, share in this fund. Exceptant is as yet (save perhaps one other) the only party who has made such a demand. An orderly process of liquidation is now under way, under the control of the Orphans’ Court and Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. As liquidation is accomplished, payments are distributed pro rata to the interested estates. It is too soon to determine what losses, if any, will be sustained.

No one of them has a right to an accounting which will injure the other participants. There is no right to have repeated accountings of a trust consisting of a pool of mortgages. One accounting in each pool covering all the transactions from its creation until the day of closing, July 17, 1933, will be sufficient to determine the legality of all questions involved until the time for liquidation began. These and supplemental accountings of the management of the trusts until the final distribution when required by the concurrent orders of the common pleas and orphans’ court will be sufficient to satisfy all requirements. . . .
