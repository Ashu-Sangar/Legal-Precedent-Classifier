        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\n\u201cThe case turns,\u201d as the learned chancellor said, \u201cupon a single issue of fact, namely, whether the partnership was composed of all three parties to the bill, or only of the two defendants.\u201d It was a joint venture in a single transaction\u2014tbe purchase of a going business with the object of selling it at a profit. He found that the plaintiff and both defendants were equally interested and decreed accordingly. One of defendants, Goldberg, appeals. In opposing the position taken by Goldberg on the evidence, the plaintiff-appellee points to the findings of fact, affirmed by the court in banc, and therefore conclusive on this review. Goldberg makes the only answer possible to such a contention: that the evidence does not support the findings made. We have examined the record in the light of Goldberg\u2019s contention and can see no ground for differing from the conclusion of the learned court below. Goldberg makes another contention, though plaintiff says it was not presented below, that plaintiff\u2019s bill should be dismissed as a resort to equity in violation of the clean hands maxim.\n1. A short statement of the facts will suffice to show why we must affirm the decree. The plaintiff and Goldberg and plaintiff\u2019s brother had been in other joint ventures. Goldberg and plaintiff\u2019s brother wished to purchase all the capital stock of a corporation, Mitchell Fletclier Company, engaged in selling groceries, etc. The two men needed money to buy. Goldberg asked plaintiff to lend him $20,000 for the purpose but plaintiff declined. Goldberg then invited him to become a joint venturer on equal shares with him and plaintiff\u2019s brother; plaintiff agreed and raised his advancement from the desired loan of $20,000 to $23,000 which he paid at the settlement for joint account. The transaction was put through with an equal division to Goldberg and plaintiff\u2019s brother of the shares of the purchased corporation. Plaintiff then filed this bill for an accounting and to obtain his one-third of the shares of stock and a like part of any profits that may be realized from its sale. The position of plaintiff\u2019s brother, who did not appeal, is, and has been, that if, as plaintiff claimed, Goldberg invited plaintiff into the transaction as an equal partner with Goldberg and himself, he ratified Goldberg\u2019s act and submitted himself to the decree of the court. As the evidence supports the findings made there is nothing in that phase of the case, as we have intimated, which would justify differing from the decree brought up for review.\n2. As to the application of the clean hands maxim, a word will suffice. While Goldberg was negotiating with plaintiff, he revealed that one, McCulloch, had been active in procuring the sale and had become entitled to a commission in an amount then undetermined. Plaintiff declined to become a party unless and until McCulloch had been settled with. Plaintiff testified, inter alia, \u201cI asked him for the moment whether Mr. McCulloch\u2019s interest had been defined, whether it was understood just what was Mr. McCulloch to get, and he said that it had not been agreed upon. I told him that under no consideration\u2014I had known Mr. McCulloch for a number of years\u2014would I go into this particular deal unless Mr. McCulloch\u2019s compensation was definitely agreed upon beforehand. He said, \u2018That is a very good idea. You let me handle Mr. McCulloch.\u2019 I said, \u2018Harry, I want yon to understand I am not going to put any funds in this unless and until Mr. McCulloch is perfectly satisfied and it is agreed upon.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, if Mr. McCulloch asks you, you tell him that you have no interest in the deal, that he has to deal with me.\u2019 I told him that I would do that. . . .\n\u201cBy Mr. McWilliams: Q. Interrupting you a minute, did Mr. Goldberg tell you why he wanted you, if Mr. Mc-Culloch asks you what your interest in the deal was, to so reply? A. Yes, he did. He said, \u2018You are very easy. You let me handle McCulloch. He knows you for a good number of years. I don\u2019t know him, and I will straighten him out fast.\u2019\n\u201cBy the Court: Q. That is all right, but why did he ask you to lie to him? A. He didn\u2019t want me to have any part of the negotiations with him. Q. You didn\u2019t have to have any negotiations. You didn\u2019t have to lie. Why did he ask you to lie about it? A. As a matter of fact, I wouldn\u2019t be lying. I wouldn\u2019t have any interest unless Mr. McCulloch\u2019s position was definitely straightened out. I knew from the early part of January that Mr. McCulloch was in the proposition. Q. I was just curious why he asked you to lie about it when it wasn\u2019t necessary. All you had to say to Mr. McCulloch is, \u2018Deal with Goldberg. I am not going to deal with you.\u2019 A. I did that later.\u201d\nThey acted accordingly and a rate of commission acceptable to McCulloch was agreed to, and apparently he has been satisfied. Of this phase of the transactions the learned chancellor said: \u201cThis arrangement was carried out. The plaintiff represented to McCulloch that he had no personal interest in the transaction, being present only as a representative of his brother, and the fee which McCulloch was to receive was definitely agreed upon. This, of course, was a deception, and, while it may not be justified in the forum of ethics, it in no way affects the rights of the parties to this litigation.\u201d\nMcCulloch is not a party nor concerned in any way with the result of this suit. The clean hands maxim, which affects misconduct in the matter in suit, therefore has no application: see Dempster v. Baxmyer, 231 Pa. 28, 36, 79 A. 805; Comstock v. Thompson, 286 Pa. 457, 133 A. 638; Belmont Lab., Inc., v. Heist, 300 Pa. 542, 151 A. 15; Valley Smokeless Coal Co. v. Manufacturers\u2019 Water Co., 302 Pa. 232, 153 A. 327; Frazier v. Mansfield, 305 Pa. 359, 157 A. 798.\nDecree affirmed, costs to he paid by appellant.\nAppellant places some reliance on what we think is an obvious inadvertence. At page 39 of his argument, the following appears: \u201cIn the Adjudication it is said that appellant \u2018admits that the plaintiff took part in the subsequent negotiations for the sale of the company\u2019s business to the Thomas C. Fluke Company, but contends that the plaintiff\u2019s activities in that transaction were also only as the representative of his brother.\u2019 Not only is no such admission to be found in appellant\u2019s testimony, but the plaintiff himself admitted that he had nothing to do with the sale of the company assets to the Thomas Fluke Company (testimony of plaintiff).\u201d\nNegotiations for the sale of the stock to Snellenburg and Co. and also to The Thomas 0. Fluke Co. were had, the Fluke Company ultimately becoming the purchaser. The evidence (p. 34a) is that plaintifE participated in the efforts to sell to Snellenburg & Co. The learned chancellor\u2019s statement, complained of in the quotation made from appellant\u2019s brief, is an obvious inadvertent substitution of Fluke Company for the Snellenburg Company\u2014and amounts to nothing on the merits.",
