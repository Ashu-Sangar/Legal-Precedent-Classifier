These facts are referred to merely as a part of the history of the case, and not as bearing upon its law.

It is plain, that under the common law the plaintiff could not be a tenant by the curtesy, for the reason that there had never been any issue born of the marriage. It was conceded that he could not claim curtesy under the common law, but it was contended that he is entitled to it under article 3, section 1, of the intestate act of 1833, P. L. 315. That act is entitled “ An act relating to the descent and distribution of the estates of intestates.” Article 3, section 1, of that act, provides:</p>
    <p id="b333-6" data-blocks='[["BL_333.6",333,[186,1259,1165,440]]]'>“ Where such intestate shall leave a husband, he shall take the whole personal estate, and the real estate shall descend and pass as hereinafter provided, saving to the husband his right as tenant by the curtesy, which shall take place, although there be no issue of the marriage, in all cases where the issue, if any, would have inherited.” Section 2 provides that the estate shall descend to the children .... and the descendants. Section four provides that it shall descend to the brothers and sisters of the whole blood.</p>

Thus, in Guthrie’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>, it was held that estates tail are not embraced within the intestate act of 1833, and do not descend under it, but according to the course of common law. It is further to be observed that the act of 1833, as we understand it, disposes only of estates over which the intestate had a power of testamentary disposition, and it steps in to supply the failure of such disposal. The words of the act are: “ Real and personal estates of a decedent remaining after the payment of debts and legal charges, and which shall not have been sold or disposed <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>of by will, or otherwise limited by marriage settlement, shall be divided and enjoyed as follows,” etc. The intestate act of 1705 only regulated the descent of lands amongst the children, where the father is seized thereof, and might dispose of them by deed or will. It leaves other cases of descent as they were at common law. Then came the act of 1794, which was a substitute for that of 1705, the language of which is: “The remaining part of any lands, tenements and hereditaments and personal estate of any person deceased, not sold or disposed of by will, nor otherwise limited by marriage settlement, shall be divided and enjoyed in manner following,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b334-5" data-blocks='[["BL_334.5",334,[263,950,1161,349]]]'>It will thus be seen that the act of 1883 substantially adopts the language of the acts referred to, and we must presume .that it was used in the sense then understood, and not in view of such interest as had never been held to come within their provisions. The common law is the law of Pennsylvania, and can only be changed by legislative enactment clearly indicating an intention to work a change.</p>
    <p id="b334-6" data-blocks='[["BL_334.6",334,[263,1305,1162,289]]]'>It was said by Mr. Justice Woodward, in Commonwealth v. Naile, 88 Pa., at page 434: “ The right of the husband as tenant by the curtesy rests on the common law, and is excepted out of the statute of distributions, while by the terms of that statute the wife takes an interest in all the real and personal estate of her husband.”</p>

At no period of time after her father’s death had she an interest that could have descended to anybody as her heir upon her death, nor had she any testamentary power over it. When the breath left her body all her interest in and power over it ceased. There was no limitation over; no executory devise or springing use to continue and carry the estate over to a substituted devisee. It is true, Mrs. McMasters died intestate, and if the property in question were a part of her estate it would come within the act of 1833, but she left no estate upon which that act could operate. The plaintiff is claiming his curtesy, not out of the estate of his wife, but out of the estate of her father, Daniel Negley. Upon Mrs. McMaster’s death, the heirs of Daniel Negley were in by operation of <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>law for condition broken, as effectually as they would have been in had Daniel Negley died wholly intestate.</p>
    <p id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.5",335,[216,511,1165,916]]]'>It is contended, however, that these views are in conflict with Thornton’s Executors v. Krepps, <a href="/pa/37/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="37 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="418864" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0391-01">37 Pa. 391</a>. This ease was relied upon by the learned judge below as sustaining his view that the plaintiff below was entitled to his curtesy. A careful examination of that ease, however, shows that it does not control the one in hand. It differs from it in two material aspects. In the first place, there was a child born of the marriage. It is stated in the report of the case that Eliza Ann Krepps was delivered of a stillborn child; while the defendant offered evidence on the trial to show that it was born alive, and had moved and cried. While no point appears to have been made in the opinion of the court or the arguments of counsel upon this subject, it is fair to infer from the statement of facts that the child was born alive. On the one hand there was mere assertion by counsel that the child was stillborn, while on the other there was proof that it was born alive. We may fairly assume that the fact was so. This would give the husband his curtesy at common law.</p>
    <p id="b335-6" data-blocks='[["BL_335.6",335,[220,1432,1167,855]]]'>In the second place, there was a devise over in the following words: “ Provided that should the said Eliza Ann die in her minority, and without lawful issue, then living, the lands hereby devised shall revert and become part of the residue of my estate hereinafter disposed of.” The testator, in a subsequent clause of his will, devised and bequeathed “ all the rest and residue of his estate to his executors,” and appointed the plaintiffs as his executors. It will thus be seen that the devise carried the entire estate of the testator. There was no estate left in him by way of reversion or otherwise. It had all passed out of him. Whereas, in the case in hand, Daniel Negley never parted with his entire estate. He gave his daughter, Sallie Ella, a conditional estate with the provision that upon the breach of the condition the estate granted should instantly revert to him or to his estate, and go to his heirs as heirs of him, Daniel Negley, and not as heirs of his daughter, Sallie Ella. He died intestate as to this reversion.</p>

That case <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>was ruled by Buckworth v. Thirkell, 3 Bos. &amp; . P. 652. In that case, however, there was a devise over, while in Buchanan v. Shaffer, there was a devise over, and also a child born alive, capable of inheriting the estate at common law. This was a case of common law curtesy. Evans v. Evans, <a href="/pa/9/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="9 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="960769" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0190-01">9 Pa. 190</a>, is the only remaining Pennsylvania case that bears upon the question. That was a case of dower, and it was held that a widow is dowable of a fee simple estate, determinable by ex-ecutory devise on her husband dying without issue, living at the time of his death. The testator devised his lands equally to his sons, George and Oliver, and his wife Sarah. Sarah devised to her two sons George and Oliver, their heirs and assigns, share and share alike; “but, should either of my two sons die without leaving lawful issue, living at the time of his death, then the estate of such son, so dying without issue, shall vest in the surviving brother and his heirs forever.”</p>

The intention of the testator is the polar star which should guide the court in construing a will. Broom’s Legal Maxims, 554. Daniel Negley never intended that if his daughter, Sallie Ella, died before arriving at the age of twenty-five years, without children, that the estate devised to her should go to a husband of whom he could know nothing by anticipation. On the contrary, he expressly provided that under such circumstances the property devised to her should go immediately to his, the testator’s heirs under the intestate laws. To sustain the contention of the plaintiff, and give him an estate by the' curtesy in this property, is to break the will of Daniel Negley, and to divert his estate from those whom he intended to have and to enjoy it.</p>
