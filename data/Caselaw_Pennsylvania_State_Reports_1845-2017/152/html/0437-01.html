Defendant in his affidavit of defence denied that a loan had ever been made to him, and pleaded non assumpsit. At the trial plaintiff testified that he had used the sum loaned in paying a bill due by defendant, and that defendant had told him to make a due bill and put it in the cash drawer, but that, instead of doing so, plaintiff had credited himself in the regular books. Defendant testified that plaintiff, when he was about to leave his position as bookkeeper, stated that defendant owed him the sum claimed, which he had used in the business; that having confidence in plaintiff and no knowledge of the transaction, he told him to fill up a cheek for wages, and include his own claim in it. Plaintiff did so, and defendant signed the check. Plaintiff then went with the bookkeeper, who was to succeed him, to bank to cash the check. The money was handed to the bookkeeper, who absconded. Defendant requested leave to file a plea of payment, which the court refused, and gave binding instructions for plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the amendment should have been allowed; that the testimony of the defendant was relevant under the amendment; and that the case should have been submitted to the jury.</p>

The former testified to facts which, if true, fully sustained all the material averments of his claim; and, in the absence of countervailing evidence, entitled him to a verdict on the issue presented by the pleadings. Among other things, he testified that in the latter part of September, 1889, while he was still employed as defendant’s bookkeeper, “ a party came in to collect a bill and there was no money in the cash-drawer. I said I had $117.31 which I would let him (defendant) have for a few days, and he said he was very glad and told me to make a due bill and put it in the cash-drawer; but instead of doing this, as my time was about up, I credited myself in the regular books.” He further, testified in substance that the money thus temporarily loaned to the defendant was never repaid.</p>

On the contrary, the substance of his testimony, on that subject, was that after defendant had drawn the check for $470, he requested him to accompany Dell to the bank and introduce him as his successor; that he did as he was directed, and Dell, after being introduced to the bank officer, drew the money and started to take it, as he supposed, to defendant’s office; but, on returning there in the afternoon, he was surprised to learn, for the first time, that Dell had disappeared.</p>

That motion was denied; and thereupon the learned trial judge, for reasons given in that part of his charge recited in the second specification, directed a verdict in favor of plaintiff for the amount of his claim.</p>

The defendant proved an admitted indebtedness to plaintiff of at least $117, founded on a particular use of money, which, for sake of technical accuracy, he appears to. have refused to call a loan. The only possible defence he had to that, under the evidence, was payment, and the only proof of payment, if any, had to be sought for in his own testimony, as to the transaction in which he claimed the recognized debt had been paid.
