As to that office, no further act of assembly was required to carry into effect the 5th section of article 14 of the constitution, and the act of 1876 was held not to repeal, as to him, the local act.

The case is essentially different in this respect from the case of the county treasurer. The contemporary interpretation by the financial officers of the county and their advisers was that the commissions on forfeited recognizances thereafter went in full to the county treasury, and the district attorney’s compensation has been treated as salary alone at §5,000 per annum.

The officer is in no way dependent on the district attorney, nor accountable to him, nor can he be called on officially to assist him. The duties are specified in the act and he is made an assistant only in name. No fees are earned by his office directly or attached thereto.

The framer of the act evidently supposed that ■the assistant was appointed by and was a clerk or deputy of the district attorney, as in other parts of the state.
