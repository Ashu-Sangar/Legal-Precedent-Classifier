The witness, then on the stand, had already testified that according to a specific provision of the owner’s agreement with the contractor, the latter was to receive, in cash, $5,000, the full consideration for furnishing materials and erecting the house, and that no lien should be filed against the building either by said contractor or any subcontractor or material-man. In the language of Mr. Braden, the witness, “ there were to be no liens of any character filed by Mr. Scott himself, or any subcontractor or any material-man under him; the house was to be finished by the first of November, 1889; the money was to be paid, six hundred dollars when the foundation was completed, a thousand dollars when the roof was on, a thousand dollars when the house was plastered, and the remaining twenty-four hundred dollars when the house was completed .... according to the specifications; that was the contract, . . . and all of these matters were expressly stipulated and agreed upon by Mr. Scott and Mrs. Braden.” The learned trial judge held that, in the circumstances, it was not incompetent for the witness to testify to what he did under the contract set up on behalf of the owner, for the purpose of showing that he acted consistently therewith. It does not appear that the plaintiffs were prejudiced in any manner by this ruling. What, if anything, the witness testified to under the offer, is not shown in the specification. Rulings on questions of evidence, without more, amount to nothing. The specification must not only show that the ruling complained of is erroneous, but also that testimony, prejudicial to the party complaining, was actually introduced under the erroneous ruling.</p>

    <p id="b105-4" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[166,857,1168,967]]]'>There was no error in this.

If he fails to do so,, he is visited with notice of every fact that such inquiry would have elicited. Whenever inquiry becomes a duty, and that duty is neglected, the negligent party is conclusively presumed to have had notice of such facts as reasonable inquiry would have disclosed.</p>
