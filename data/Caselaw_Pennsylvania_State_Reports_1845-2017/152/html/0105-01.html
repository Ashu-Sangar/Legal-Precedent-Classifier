    <p class="syllabus" id="b129-4" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[173,570,1167,937]]]'>After the register had granted letters testamentary, a writing purporting to be a will of later date was presented to the register for probate with a request that the former decree of probate be annulled. Parties in interest filed objections to proceedings before the register and requested an orphans’ court to be appointed for the decision of the difficult and disputable matters in controversy, pursuant to the act of March 15, 1832, § 26. The register called an orphans’ court and certified for decision (1) whether he had power to revoke the letters, (2) whether they should be revoked, and (3) whether the later writing was the last will of the testator. Objections were filed that the register had no jurisdiction and that the proper proceeding was by appeal f om the decree of probate. The court overruled the objections on the ground that the register had jurisdiction and must decide the question, after which it could come before the court on appeal. The same parties before objecting then presented their petition to said court, setting out the prior proceedings and that there were disputable and difficult matters involved, and asking the court to hear the testimony thereon, and to direct an issue to the common pleas to try (1) whether or not the signature to the latter paper was testator’s signature, (2) whether there was undue influence, and (3) whether the testator was of sufficient mental capacity to execute a will. The court refused the petition and made a decree returning the record to the register. <em>Held, </em>that an appeal to the Supreme Court would not lie.</p>

On May 16,1892, his will, dated May 17, 1888, was duly probated, and letters testamentary thereon were granted to Thomas W. Pierce and E. Malin Hoopes, executors therein named, by the register of wills of Chester county. Subsequently, Caleb H. Bradley filed with said register a petition, setting out that there was a later will of said decedent, bearing date Jan. 22,1888, and a codicil thereto, dated Aug. 15, 1891, of which he was the executor, and asking that said letters testamentary be revoked, that said decree of probate be opened <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>and annulled, and that the alleged will, in which he was named as executor, be probated. Several hearings were had before the register, and a large amount of testimony taken. On July 22,1892, several of the parties interested, under the probated will, filed objections to further proceedings before the register, and requested that an orphans’ court be appointed for the decision of the difficult and disputable matters in controversy before him, pursuant to the act of March 15, 1832, § 25. On July 25,1892, the register, in compliance with said request, Called an orphans’ court, to meet August 15,1892, and certified to said court the following questions for decision: (1) To de-. termine whether the register of wills has power and authority to revoke the letters testamentary granted to the said Thomas W. Pierce and E. Malin Hoopes, and to reopen and annul the decree probating the will dated May 17, 1888. (2) Whether said letters testamentary should be revoked and said decree of probate annulled. (3) Whether the writings dated Jan. 27, 1888, and Aug. 15, 1891, are, or are not the last will and testament of the said A. Taylor Hoopes. Of this hearing, said register gave notice to all parties in interest. The case was continued from day to day until September 26, 1892, when objections were filed in said court, that the register had no jurisdiction of the matters in controversy, and that the only way the matter could properly be proceeded' in was on an appeal from the decision of the register probating the will of the.date of May 17, 1888. After argument, the court overruled the objections, in an opinion filed and decree made Oct. 3, 1892.</p>
