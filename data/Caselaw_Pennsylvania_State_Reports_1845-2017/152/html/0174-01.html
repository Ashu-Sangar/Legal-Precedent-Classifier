    <p class="summary" id="b199-5" data-blocks='[["BL_199.6",199,[179,891,1166,1309]]]'>“ In the twenty-nine cases entitled as above, the persons suing in the name of the commonwealth are one and the same, the questions raised by the affidavits are in all respects similar and the rules for judgment for want of sufficient affidavits of defence in the respective cases are founded upon reasons which are identical; they may, therefore, be considered together. In a few of these cases the amount sought to be recovered in each case is one thousand dollars, and in all the other cases the court is asked to order the entry of judgment in each case for the sum of five hundred dollars. The theory of the affidavits and statements of claim is as follows, viz.: If, on a certain day, A has in his possession two pounds of oleomargarine with intent to sell the same he is subject to a penalty of one hundred dollars, if he exposes the same for sale he incurs a second penalty of like amount, if he sells one pound he becomes liable to a third penalty of the same amount, if he then has the intent to sell the remaining pound he is to be mulct in a fourth penalty of similar amount and if he exposes the same for sale a fifth penalty of one hundred dollars is to be added. Without passing upon the question as to whether or not a defendant in an action of this nature is required to file an affidavit of defence, the court are unanimously of opinion that this multiplication of penalties cannot be sustained. The sale, in such a case, embraces all that has gone before and leads up to it, as necessary incidents, and constitutes one completed violation of the statute.</p>
