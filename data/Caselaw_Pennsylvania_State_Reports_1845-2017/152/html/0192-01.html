Gilbert, 1 Cox, 63); and hence if the distribution is to be made when all attain the age of twenty-one, or when the youngest attains the age of twenty-one, all, whenever born, may be admitted: Hughes v. Hughes, 3 Bro. C. C. 434; 14 Yesey, 256.

The act of 1853, unlike the Thelussen act, does not permit accumulation during an arbitrary period of twenty-one years, but confines it to an existing minority, and for the benefit of the minor (Washington’s Estate, 25 Smith, 102; Carson’s Appeal, 3 Outerb. 325); and hence, if ‘ the youngest child ’ spoken of in the will is to be understood as the youngest child of John McBride, whenever born, and the accumulation' as continuing until he shall attain the age of twenty-one, not only will the trust be invalid so far as concerns such accumulations, but as the persons who are to take are uncertain until the time for distribution, the accumulations themselves, instead of enuring to the benefit of the children of John, will, under the authorities, go to the residuary legatees to their entire exclusion: Ellis v. Maxwell, 3 Beav. 587; Gray on Perp. § 704, etc. And not only this, but as the law contemplates the possibility of the birth of issue, no matter what may be the age of the parents, no distribution of the principal could be made until the death of John McBride, because until then it could not be known that any of his liv<a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>ing children would be the ‘youngest.’ The inconvenience thus arising would, of course, be of no consequence if the testator’s meaning is clear and unequivocal, but it is not to be lost sight of in construing the will and in determining the meaning of what he has said. See Bonaffon’s Estate, 14 W. N. 501. A construction which will satisfy the language used without leading to absurd or inconvenient results is to be preferred, still more so if the opposite construction will defeat the will altogether, and divert the bounty of the testator from those whom he manifestly intended to benefit, and give it to persons whom he thought he had already sufficiently provided for. Kevern v. Williams, supra; Bonaffon’s Estate, supra; Gray on Perp. § 633.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[276,1349,1161,1112]]]'>“The act of 1853 forbids accumulation except for the benefit of an existing minority, but with this qualification: ‘ Provided, That any donation, bequest, or devise for any literary, scientific, charitable, or religious purpose shall not come within the prohibition of this section.’ Literally, this would apply to contingent no less than vested gifts for the excepted purposes, but the act is a remedial one, and is to be interpreted so that the mischief may be suppressed and the remedy made effectual. It is to be construed in a manner that will ‘ supresse subtill inventions to creepe out of the statutes’ (Co. Litt., 230, <em>a.-l.') </em>; and unless the proviso be confined to direct gifts for charitable, etc., purposes, it is clear that all that would be necessary to prevent its operation in any case would be to insert in the will directing an accumulation for any period, within the limits of the rule against perpetuities, a provision that if all persons for whom it was intended should be then dead, the fund with its increase should go for religious or charitable or literary purposes. The act only excepts gifts of the character referred to where religious, charitable, or literary use is the sole and exclusive purpose of the accumulation. Anything beyond this would defeat the operation of the statute, which must, therefore, be understood accordingly.</p>

The gift is for ‘ the use of Charles Joseph McBride, Catharine Philomena McBride, and Francis Aloysius McBride, children of my son John McBride, and such other children, lawful issue, which he may have, the said sum to accumulate until the youngest surviving of these children shall have attained the age of twenty-one years.’ This may mean ‘ such other children ’ as the son may have in the lifetime of the testator; such other children as he may have at any time while he lives; or such other children as he may have before the time of distribution. If it is to be understood as confined to children born during the lifetime of the testator, the three who have since been born must be excluded. If it is to be understood as including all who may by possibility be born in the son’s lifetime, the trust for accumulation fails altogether, the accumulations pass to the residuary legatees, and the grandchildren get not even a share of the principal until the death of their father. But, it will be observed, the period of distribution is not ‘ when the youngest child ’ who may be born to the son shall have attained the age of twenty-one yearn, but ‘ when the youngest of these.’ What is meant by ‘ these ? ’ The names of the children then in being had just been mentioned by the testator, and the words which follow were words of general description merely. The word 'these ’ may refer to the designated children or it may refer to the whole class. In the former case the intention bf the testator will be in accordance with the law, and may be fully carried into execution; in the latter it fails utterly. We are warranted, therefore, under the authorities referred to, in adopting the former as the proper construction. <em>Benignos faoiendce sunt interpretaciones propter simplicitatem laicorum ut res magis valeat quwm pereat.</em>

It is not denied in the exceptions which were dismissed by the orphans’ court in banc, or in the specifications of error filed in this court, that the appellees are members of the Roman Catholic Church, but it is contended that inasmuch as this conceded fact does not specifically appear in the adjudication the decree should be reversed. If it be true, as now intimated by the counsel for the appellant in their his<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>tory of the case, that some of the appellees do not answer the testator’s description of the persons entitled to share in the distribution, it is a matter which affects not the St. John’s Orphan Asylum, but the other appellees, because by the terms of the will such grandchildren as answer that description at the time of distribution take the whole fund. If one of the five grandchildren to whom the trust fund was awarded was qualified to receive it the claim of the appellant is as effectually defeated as if all were qualified. If on the other hand all of the appellees are now incompetent to share in the distribution, it is difficult to understand why the appellant resists a construction which would give it the fund it is so anxious to appropriate to its own uses. We conclude in view of the concession on the audit, the attitude of the appellant on the question of construction and the absence of even a suggestion that all the grandchildren are disqualified, that the ninth specification requires no further consideration and should be dismissed.</p>

The conclusion reached by him in a clear and able opinion was, that the words, “ the youngest surviving of these children,” refer to the children of John named in the will and living at the time of its execution, and that the persons entitled to the fund at the time of distribution are such of John’s children or their issue, as then answer the testator’s description of the primary objects of his bounty. This construction gives the fund in equal shares to the five children of John, now living, and harmonizes best with the obvious purpose of the testator in the creation of the trust and the disposition of its principal and accumulations. It was plainly his intention that John’s children or their issue having the requisite qualifications, should have the full benefit of this trust, but it is clear that they cannot if the construction contended for by the appellant prevails. The statutory limit of a trust for accumulation to take effect at the death of the creator of it is twenty-one years, and such a trust for any period beyond this limit is void as to the excess. Act of April 18, 1853, P. L. 503 ; Brown et al. v. Williamson’s Executors, <a href="/pa/36/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="36 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="992170" data-case-paths="/pa/36/0338-01">36 Pa. 338</a>. A trust to accumulate until the youngest surviving of the chib <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>dren John may have attains the age of twenty-one years is transgressive. It must according to the contention of the appellant continue while John lives, and it may cover a period of twenty-One years after his death. The presumption is that the testator knew and endeavored to comply with the law applicable to the trust he created, and if his will fairly admits of a construction which sustains the trust and gives the proceeds of it to his intended beneficiaries it should be adopted. It was in'the light of these principles that the learned auditing judge read and construed the will, and the learned orphans’ court in banc approved the adjudication. Is such construction justified by the language of the will and the authorities pertinent to the subject ? It sustains and its results are in harmony with the letter and spirit of the trust. If the words “ until the youngest surviving of these children shall have attained the age of twenty-one years ” refer to the children the testator had previously, in the same paragraph of his will, designated by their „ names, the time for distribution came when Catharine was twenty-one, because she was the youngest of “ these children ” who attained that age, and if the words “ such other children lawful issue which he may have ” mean such other children as John may have at that time, the adjudication is right. We think this construction is fairly warranted by the authorities referred to in the opinion of the learned auditing judge, and that by it effect is given to the manifest intention of the testator. As it terminates the trust and is decisive against the claim of the appellant, we need not discuss the matters which are merely incidental, further than to say that the appellees are not estopped by the petition under which The Real Estate, Title, Insurance and Trust Company was appointed trustee from now asserting their claim to the trust fund.</p>
