The defendant undertook to show that the ordinance above referred to and all proceedings thereunder, including assessments for costs of construction, were irregular and void, for the following',’ among other reasons: 1st. Because the ordinance provides for ,the construction of a main sewer with four lateral sewers, or branches, under one estimate for the whole work., 2d.- Because the whole of said sewer, including its branches, is declared to be a main sewer, and also that the whole shall be a local or lateral sewer for lands abutting theréon. 3d. Because the assessments on defendant’s lot, confirmed by councils against <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>its objections, are a general assessment of $46.03, and a special or local assessment of $63.37, for the construction of said main sewer and four lateral sewers taken together, without anything to distinguish the cost of either separately. In this connection, it was contended that the sewer on Duncomb street proper is the only part of the work that can with any propriety be called a main sewer, and that those connecting therewith but not located on said street are in no sense main sewers, or parts of the main or Duncomb street sewer; and it is claimed that fact is established by the evidence, notwithstanding the determination of councils to the contrary.</p>
    <p id="b377-3" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[173,928,1186,1421]]]'>This is a mistake; and it results from the unwarranted as-, sumption that a main sewer cannot have branches which constitute a necessary part of such main sewer; and that after councils have considered the necessity for constructing such main sewer, including its branches as part thereof, and have regularly legislated thereon, it may be shown, on the trial of a scire facias to enforce payment of assessments, that councils were mistaken, — that what they, in the proper exercise of'legislative judgment, considered a necessary part of a main sewer, is at best nothing more than a local or lateral sewer. As we have seen, the authority, “ to cause sewers of all kinds to be constructed or reconstructed,” is vested exclusively in councils. In the exercise of their legislative judgment, enlightened by the skill and experience of the city engineer, they have an undoubted right to adopt a system of sewerage for each sewer district, and in doing so to determine the location of main, as distinguished from merely local or lateral sewers. Whether a main sewer or a merely local or lateral one is necessary on a pañtictdaFsfreekdr pórtioh,óf a street is a question of engineer-' "mg“and legislative_ judgment,"vested exclusively in councils,, 'and not reviewable, except under extraordinary circumstances which have no existence in this case. To hold otherwise, and' thus permit the introduction of testimony for the purpose of showing that the regularly declared judgment of councils was erroneous, etc., would be productive of disastrous results.. It follows, therefore, that much of the testimony introduced by the defendant was irrelevant and incompetent; and that the position assumed by it is wholly untenable.</p>

    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[258,574,1167,548]]]'>In thus withdrawing the case from the jury, it must be presumed the court did not undertake to decide any question of fact raised, or supposed to have been raised, by the testimony. The ruling must have been based on some question or questions of law that were supposed to control the case. Such a question was presented by the point recited in the sixth specification, viz.: “ The thirteenth article of the act of May 23, 1889, under which the plaintiff attempted to act in the construction of said sewers and collection of the cost thereof, is contrary to the provisions of s_ectionJLl,_arf._l, of the constitution of this commonwealth, and void.”</p>

The principle is too firmly settled by a long line of cases, including Hammett v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/65/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="65 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="430574" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0146-01">65 Pa. 146</a>, Michener v. Same, <a href="/pa/118/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="118 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="556717" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0535-01">118 Pa. 535</a>, and on down to Harrisburg v. Segelbaum, <a href="/pa/151/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="151 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="836719" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0172-01">151 Pa. 172</a>, to be now shaken. In Michener v. Phila., supra, it was held that laws and ordinances authorizing the construction of sewers were not unconstitutional, that the judgment of city councils as to the necessity for their construction is final and conclusive, and that on_a_ scire facias sur municipal claim for the assessed cost of construction the defendant will not be permitted to prove that the sewer was not a private benefit to him or his property, nor a matter of necessity to the public. Referring to that ground of defence, it was there said, that such assessments are “ a species of taxation, and all taxation is presumed to be for the benefit, directly or indirectly, of the taxpayer or his property. Laid, <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>as taxes are, under general laws, there will always be cases of individual hardship. . . . When a man comes to pay his general taxes, he cannot be permitted to allege that he derives no benefit therefrom. And it would be intolerable, if, in every instance of special taxation, the question of benefits could be thrown into the jury box. It would introduce into municipal government a novel and dangerous feature.”</p>
    <p id="b379-3" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[160,757,1167,238]]]'>In the case before us, it is not even alleged that the sewer was badly constructed or that it cost less than is claimed by the city, or that defendant’s property is not benefited by the construction, to an extent at least fully equal to the sum assessed thereon.</p>
    <p id="b379-4" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[159,1014,1167,147]]]'>The burden of defendant’s complaint in its third to seventh points, inclusive, is that, for reasons therein suggested, the assessments are illegal and void.</p>

An examination of the record shows that the proceedings of councils were in accordance with the provisions of the act; and it also fails to disclose any valid ground of defence to plaintiff’s-claim. The specifications of error are all sustained.</p>
