The fact that he failed in that contention, does not necessarily show that he is wrong in this. If he mistook his title then it does not bar him from asserting it now. It is conceded that the will in question did not give an estate tail to his daughter. It was said in the opinion of the court in the case above cited: “ It is hardly probable, though this is not important, in the view we take of the case, that he (the testator) meant to create an estate tail, however much the words used would seem to indicate it, for he evidently intended no benefit to his daughter’s husband, and an estate tail would make him a tenant by the curtesy upon the death of his wife.” We are still of opinion that the testator did not intend to give his daughter’s husband any benefit under his will, and while we do not assert the general proposition that the husband could not, under any circumstances, be his daughter’s heir, we feel quite safe in saying the testator did not intend that his son-in-law should take any part of his estate in case the said Lydia should die without leaving issue living at the time of her death. On the contrary, he expressly provides that in such case the said estate so devised to Lydia should revert back and be a part of his residuary estate.</p>

That it was something more than a trust to protect the separate use, is apparent from the fact, that it is provided in the fourteenth paragraph of the will, before cited, that at any time the said trustee shall think right, proper and prudent he may surrender any of the foregoing trusts; “ he may surrender and assign the same to Nancy Guthrie, Lydia Wallace, Euphemia Marshall, or either or all said trusts, but it is my wish that he would not do so unless fully satisfied of the propriety of that. course.” <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>This means, not merely that he had the power to surrender to Lydia Wallace a mere life estate, but that he might end and execute the entire trust by conveying to each of the testator’s daughters the estate in fee, clear and discharged of the trust.

The true interpretation of this will is to be gathered from within its four corners. An examination of it plainly shows a manifest intention on the part of the testator to clothe the trustee with the title so that he could execute the trusts of the will in accordance with the desire of the testator. The trustee had the power, as before observed, to surrender the entire trust, and by this one act to put an end to the interest of any one else. It is not to the purpose that the trustee never exercised this power. The will speaks from the death of the testator, and the power remained in the trustee up to the death of Lydia Wallace. The whole legal title was put in the trustee to preserve the estate for Lydia, and for such issue as she may leave surviving her at the time of her death, and in default of issue living at that time, then to carry it back to the testator’s residuary estate. A careful consideration of the whole will leads us to the conclusion that the testator contemplated a definite failure of issue. It will be observed that there is no devise over, but Lydia’s share, <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>upon the happening of the contingency referred to, is to revert' to and become a part of the residuary estate of the testator.</p>

So, when the time at which the devise over is to take effect is expressly or impliedly limited to a particular period within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years after, or if he die without, leaving issue behind him, or leaving issue at the time of his decease, or if the devise over be of a life estate, which implies necessarily that such devisee may outlive the first estate, the testator has been considered as meaning a failure of issue within a fixed period, and not an indefinite failure: Eichelberger v.
