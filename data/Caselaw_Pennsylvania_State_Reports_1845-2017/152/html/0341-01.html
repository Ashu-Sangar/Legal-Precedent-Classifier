This action, however, would preclude him in case of a recovery by the wife in this action from setting up any claim in the future to the fund in controversy. You will take, therefore, these matters I have just mentioned into consideration, merely as affecting the credibility of the witnesses and the reasonableness of the contention of the parties. This controversy is not one in which the creditors of the husband are questioning the title of the wife to hold property, transferred to the wife by the husband, or one in which the question of a separate estate of the wife is the issue directly involved, and where the rule of law requires the wife to maintain her rights by clear proof of her ownership as a separate estate, or such as is derived from her separate estate. [It is a controversy between debtor and <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>creditor; it is the purchase of a piece of real estate for a fixed price, and when the purchaser has acquired title a dispute has arisen as to whether the husband or the wife is the vendor, and the materiality of that question grows out of the fact that the credits claimed by the defendant are principally against the husband and only affect his rights to the fund. It is to the interest of Mrs. Reed and her husband that the claim should be the wife’s, because the evidence shows that if it belongs to the husband it is involved in the settlement of partnership obligations, and losses or liabilities alleged to exist between Mr* Reed and Mr. Klaus; and it is equally the interest of Mr. Klaus that he should have the purchase money for the house applied to his claims against Mr. Reed.] [5] These suggestions are only by way of consideration, as a means of determining in what respect interest may affect their testimony.</p>

If the' contract was made with the husband, and the wife had no legal or equitable estate in the premises or fund in dispute, and that the proceedings adopted were merely for the purpose of enabling the husband to secure control of his own property, the wife would have no claim to the money.”] [7]</p>

That said mortgage was paid as the installments came due, that neither the bond nor mortgage ever stood in the name of Mrs. Reed; the presumption therefore is that the record disclosed the truth, and Klaus had a right to rely upon such presumption, and to deal with Reed as the owner of the property, and as Mrs. Reed seeks in this action to establish a state of facts, different from those disclosed by the record, she must show by clear and satisfactory evidence that she was the bona fide beneficial owner of the mortgage in question, and that Klaus had knowledge or notice of such ownership on her part when he bought the property in question. <em>Answer: </em>This point is affirmed, that is to say, that if Mrs. Reed has based her right to this money as her separate estate, and adverse to the rights of her husband and his creditors, she ought, in order to support the existence of her alleged contract with the defendant, to show that she was the bona fide beneficial owner, and that Klaus ought to have knowledge or notice of such ownership on her part.” [2]</p>

The plaintiff was a married woman, and the suit was brought in the name of her husband and herself, but in her right. It was tried below upon an erroneous theory, involving a large amount of testimony, and consuming a great deal of time to little purpose. The principal defence was that the property did not belong to Mrs. Reed, but to her husband, and that Mrs. Reed’s claim upon it was in violation of the rights of her husband’s creditors. This resulted in the examination of many matters that had no relevancy to the issue.</p>
    <p id="b370-6" data-blocks='[["BL_370.9",370,[251,1248,1162,288]]]'>The first specification alleges that the court below erred in affirming the defendant’s second point.

    <p id="b370-7" data-blocks='[["BL_370.10",370,[249,1554,1164,807]]]'>The error in affirming this point was manifest. It is difficult to see of what possible interest it was to the defendant to whom the money should go. In any event, he was bound to pay the purchase money due to some one, and as both Mr. and Mrs. Reed testified that the property belonged to the latter, payment to her would protect him in any event. It matters not that the defendant supposed the property to have belonged to Mr. Reed. If, in point of fact, it belonged to his wife, the defendant would be bound to pay the purchase money to her when that fact was disclosed. He would only be protected so far as he had paid it to Mr. Reed without notice of the wife’s claim ; but the point goes further than this, and rules that if the purchase money was unpaid, the fact that Mr. Reed did not disclose the fact of his wife’s interest to the defendant would have entitled Mr. Reed to the purchase money, even against the claim of his wife, the real owner.</p>

The effect of this was to rule that if the defendant had no knowledge or notice that Mrs. Reed was the owner when he bought the property in question, she would not be entitled to recover.</p>

It does not matter whether the defendant had such knowledge or not, so far as the balance of the unpaid purchase money is concerned. The bringing of this suit was notice. As before observed, if he has paid any portion of it to the husband under the belief that he was the owner, and without notice of the wife’s claim, he would be protected to that extent, but no further.</p>
