It appears as though this' point should be affirmed, if no change has been made within twenty-one years. The jury will from all the evidence say whether or not there was any change in the user within twenty-one years prior to the commencement of this suit, whether or not any change of the place of its flow was made by Samuel Eshleman, the plaintiff, or the township, whether or not any other places where the water used to flow were closed and a greater volume of water thrown into the drain at Eshleman’s. It would have to be used openly, notoriously, uninterruptedly and continuously and adversely, as it was used at the time suit was brought, for twenty-one years prior to the time of bringing this suit, in 1888, to give <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>the defendant such right. The public, the township, the defendant here, and its officers have but an easement, have but the right to pass through the plaintiff’s land over the public road, with the right to repair and keep it in good order for safe and convenient travel, and in so doing they have an undoubted right to enter upon his other land adjoining this roadbed on either side, and to cut ditches and make drains where it can be done to carry off the surface water collecting on the road, in such numbers, and at such points as in their judgments will best accomplish that purpose, doing the least injury to private property, without regard to where it would Sow, if left alone, or naturally or how long it had continued to flow. The law gives them authority to do so. But they would have no right to increase the volume of water on this road by closing or permitting other drains thereon to he closed, and throw the water which ran therein, in enlarged and greatly increased volume, upon plaintiff’s land to his injury within twenty-one years prior to the time this suit was brought, in 1888.” [16]</p>

There was no natural water course, such as is j-ecognized by law, shown here, no definite channel having a bed, sides or banks — no stream of water flowing — nothing more than mere surface drainage from rains, snows, etc.” [17] “ 8. If the plaintiff bought his land in 1869, with a visible water course upon it, for the use and benefit of the township, which had been enjoyed by it continuously, notoriously and adversely, for more than twenty-one years, he has no right to complain, and is entitled to no compensation for the continuance of it. <em>Answer: </em>This point is refused. .

It is their duty to place these drains where best for the road and least injurious to private property. Courts say, one supervisor has power to make contract and employ men to do and make ordinary repairs, or work upon the roads, such as digging and making drains to carry off the water from a road already opened and in use, but one cannot bind the township by contracts for the opening of a new road.” [20]</p>

If the supervisor permitted plaintiff to change the drain, provided he would make it at his own expense, and nothing was said about his keeping it open after he had completed it, his duty was performed when it was finished. The drain thus made on the east side then took the place of the other drain where the water ran off defendant’s road in on Eshleman, and became a township drain to carry the surface water from the road, and was to he cleaned as other township road drains, by the township supervisor.

This evidence consisted mainly of the opinions of witnesses respecting the difference in the market value of the property with the water flowing upon and across it as described by them, and the market value of it with the water excluded from it. These opinions were evidently formed on the theory of a continued and permanent use of the property by the municipal authorities for the purpose of drainage in the manner complained of. It was a species of evidence appropriate to a case for the recovery of damages resulting from an easement created by the exercise of the power of eminent domain, but it was not applicable to this issue. In the recent case of Robb v. Carnegie, <a href="/pa/145/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="145 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="825917" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0324-01">145 Pa. 324</a>, and Lentz v. Carnegie, Ibid. 612, this subject was fully considered, and it was held that the true measure of damages in a case like the present, is the cost of remedying the injury unless that equals or exceeds the value of the thing injured, when such value becomes the measure. <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>The case in hand is an action of trespass for turning the water, or permitting it to run from the highway, upon the laud of the appellee. In the act or omission complained of there was no acquisition by the township of a right to turn the water upon his land, or to allow it to flow there. The injury inflicted was not necessarily continuing and permanent, because it was practicable to restore the property to its former condition. In his charge to the jury the learned judge said: “ In estimating the damages you will be confined within six years prior to February 1, 1888. My own judgment is that you should not go further back than 1885, when the witnesses say the drain on the east side was closed and the water was turned in on plaintiff’s property by the supervisors. You must be confined to actual damages done during the time stated, and the loss and injury to his property, not permanently but during the period stated, for if the water be taken away his injury will cease. Nor can you allow any damages since February 1, 1888, when suit was brought; if any damages have been sustained since that, they form the subject of another action.” The substantial correctness of this instruction is not questioned by either party, and it serves to show that error was committed in the admission of the evidence under consideration, but it fails to render such error harmless. In the view we have taken of this evidence the refusal to allow the questions on cross-examination which is the subject of complaint in the third and fourth specifications, becomes unimportant. These questions were pertinent to the examination in chief, and consistency called for their allowance, but as the evidence to which they referred was inadmissible a discussion of them at this time would be profitless. We are not satisfied that any error was committed in the rejection of the question contained in the ninth specification.</p>

It matters not whether the easement was obtained by grant or <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>prescription. In either case something more than mere nonuser for a period of three years was required to destroy it. In considering the permission to the appellee to turn the water on the east side of the road it is important to know what the rights of the township were at the time it was given. If such permission involved the surrender of an easement by virtue of which the township could lawfully and without expense turn the water on the appellee’s land on the west side of the road, it was not within the power of one supervisor to grant it. A transaction in which a valuable right of the township is relinquished without compensation is not within the scope of powers and duties which are merely ministerial. The appellant’s first point was therefore pertinent to the issue, and should have been affirmed without qualification. The evidence on which it was predicated was sufficient to authorize a finding of such user by the township as was described in it. The answer to it was obscure and misleading and practically a denial of it. The point invited the jury to consider the evidence respecting the user by the township of the appellee’s land on the west side of the road prior to 1882, and the purpose of it was to ascertain the rights of the parties at the time of the alleged permission to the appellee to convey the water across his field on the east side. If it was found that there was such an adverse user by the township as clothed it with a prescriptive right to turn the water upon the land of the appellee on the west side of the highway, the instruction concerning the effect of the permission given to him by the supervisor was erroneous, because, as we have already seen, it was not within the power of one supervisor to surrender such right.</p>

It was for the jury to determine from the evidence on what terms the permission was given.</p>
