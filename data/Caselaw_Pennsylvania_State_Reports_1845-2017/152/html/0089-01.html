McKee, his stepson, for about $1,000, which were liens on a piece of land inherited by William from his mother, worth about $1,300. Alex. McKee caused writs of execution to be issued on said judgments, and employed G. E. Patterson, now deceased, as his attorney. He did not see Mr. Patterson in person, but sent a message employing him, and ordering said executions., by Jos. McKee, the defendant, a son of Alex. McKee. The land of Wm. McKee was levied on, and after due advertisement was sold by the sheriff at public sale and was bought by Jos. McKee, the defendant, for $100. Jos. McKee paid this bid to the sheriff out of his own funds, and Mr. Patterson, as attorney for Alex. McKee, received the amount distributed to his client’s judgment. Some time thereafter Jos. McKee sold said land to one Giles, and Alex. McKee joined in the deed of conveyance wherein it is stated that Alex. McKee joined in said deed in order to convey an estate by the courtesy he had as the husband of the deceased mother of Wm. McKee, and the title of Jos. McKee, under the sheriff’s sale, was also therein recited. A bond for the purchase money was taken by Jos. McKee. Alex. McKee lived for some time after the sale to Giles. After the death of Alex. McKee the land was sold by the sheriff, on an execution based on the bond given by Giles to Jos. McKee for the purchase money, and at said sale Jos. McKee again bought said land, and still holds it. Alex. McKee was about eighty years old when he died. There was no evidence that his mental powers had failed unusually for <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>one of his age. There was no evidence that Jos. McKee had any influence over his father superior to that of the other children. There was no evidence that Jos. McKee had attempted to influence his father in any way, or that he was in a position of advantage with respect to him.</p>

It was claimed, however, that the equitable title was in him by reason of a resulting trust. Such trust must result from the payment of the purchase money or by a fraud in obtaining the title. It was not pretended that the money was paid by Alex. McKee, or that his money was used in the transaction. It was not disputed that Jos. McKee paid for it with his own money. Nor are we able to see that any such fraud was practiced by the latter in obtaining the title as would make him a trustee ex-maleficio.</p>
