The elevators were completed by the Otis Bros. &amp; Co. under the provisions of the agreement made in writing, bearing date the 23d day of November, 1887. Norcross Bros, paid the money called for by the agreement, $9,000, and the same was accepted by the Otis Bros. &amp; Co. . . . Two actions at law have been brought by the Otis Bros. Co. against Nor-cross Bros, to recover what they allege to still be due and owing to them for the erection of the elevators, to wit, the sum of $10,000. One of these actions was discontinued and the other is still undisposed of. Norcross Bros., upon the completion of the court house on March 10,1888, and upon final estimate, had coming to them from the county the sum of $26,800, the sum of $20,000 being for the furnishment of the court house, and $6,800 being for the balance due on the contract for the building of the court house and jail. Two warrants were given to the plaintiffs for these amounts, when the payment of one of the warrants for the $6,800 was stopped by the county commissioners, owing to a notice given to them by Mr. McKee, the attorney for the Otis Bros. Co., to withhold payment of the same for the reason that the labor rendered and performed, and the materials furnished and used in and about the construction of the said buildings, had not been fully ■ settled and paid for by Norcross Bros, in compliance with the provisions of their contract with the county, requiring such to be done before payment is made to said Norcross Bros, by the county, and in consequence the payment of $6,800 was withheld. . . .</p>

This mode of proceeding, that is by the giving of notice, is not expressly forbidden by the contract of the Otis Bros.

What the precise terms of this notice were does not appear. It was not in writing, and we have only oral evidence of its character..

Whatever may have been the rule of the common law in England prior to the time of Henry hi, at the present day, and according to the law as it stands now, the bringing of an ordinary action, however maliciously, and however great the want of probable cause, will not support a subsequent action for malicious prosecution: Pollock on Torts, 206. And a mere civil suit, however malicious or unfounded, cannot be made the ground for an action of damages. In Muldoon v. Rickey, <a href="/pa/103/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="103 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="449143" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0110-01">103 Pa. 110</a>, it was held, that no action lies to recover damages for the prosecution of a civil suit, however unfounded, where there has been no actual interference with either the person pr property of ihe defendant. The case cited was an action of ejectment, in which the declaration averred that it had been instituted maliciously and without probable cause, and that in consequence thereof the plaintiff was injured in circumstances, and was hindered and prevented from using the properties in controversy, to borrow money for his business, by means whereof he was damaged, etc. This court held, reversing the court below, that the plaintiff could not recover.</p>

On the other hand, where one abuses legal process, as by maliciously holding one to bail, or wantonly levies an execution for a larger sum than is due, or after the payment of the debt, an action would lie against him, for these are illegal acts, and damage is thereby sustained.</p>

That the action did not operate as a legal restraint upon the fund in question is shown by the fact that Norcross Brothers immediately brought suit against the county and recovered.

      <em>We </em>are quite sure that if there was a case in the books which even seemingly sustains the contention of the appellees the industry of their learned counsel would have discovered it. In Potts v. Imlay, 1 Southard, 330, Chief Justice Kirkpatrick alleged that the books for four hundred years back had been <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>searched to find an instance where an action on the case for the malicious prosecution of a civil suit, like the one there trying, had been successfully maintained, and that it was conceded by the counsel for the plaintiff that no such case had been found. We understand, therefore, why no case has been cited in the present instance.</p>
