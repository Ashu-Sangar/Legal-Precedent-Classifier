If the jurjr believes, from the evidence, that from September, 1887, to February, 1891, — the date of bringing this suit — the defendant company from time to time entered upon plaintiff’s premises, and placed boats, barges or flats thereon, between high and low water mark, and kept them there for an unreasonable time, and made a profit out of the property of the plaintiff by so using the same, such use and occupation was not an incident to the right of navigation, but was an unlawful invasion of plaintiff’s rights, for which she is entitled to recover damages.” Affirmed. [1]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[163,946,1169,1018]]]'>“2. If the jury find that the defendant company did so use and occupy plaintiff’s property, then the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for all the loss and damage she has sustained by reason of said occupation of her property by the defendant company. And if the jury believe that said occupation of plaintiff’s property was willful and deliberate, and was a wanton invasion of plaintiff’s rights, then they are not restricted to compensation only in giving damages, but in addition to compensation may give such further damages as will tend to prevent a repetition of the wrong, either by the defendant company or by others. <em>Answer: </em>Ordinarily in cases of this kind, the measure of damages is compensation for the injury done. But where the injury was done in a malicious or wanton spirit, and in utter disregard of plaintiff’s rights, the jury may go beyond mere compensation, and give a greater sum by way of punishment for the wrong committed. If the defendant used the river in front of plaintiff’s property under a mistaken idea that they had a right so to use it, and not with any force or violence, and not with any intention or thought of injuring the plaintiffs, the verdict should be for compensation only.” [2]</p>

I think the jury may consider in addition to that this other element, if you find it from the evidence, that the plaintiffs were prevented from renting their front in consequence of the use made of it by the defendants. According to the testimony of the defendants, they claimed a right to do what they were doing, let their barges slip down and remain some time in front of the plaintiffs’ property. The plaintiffs might not be able to rent it when the defendants claim that right, because it would involve, perhaps, a law suit; a person would not probably be willing to rent it, knowing that he would be involved in a law suit with the defendants under their claim of usage, and if you find from the evidence that such was the case, then that may be an additional element of damages in this case.” [7]</p>

That the defendant’s moorage was not necessary to the exercise of the right of navigation is too clear to doubt.
