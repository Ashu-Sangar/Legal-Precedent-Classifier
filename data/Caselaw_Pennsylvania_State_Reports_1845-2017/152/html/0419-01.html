Mr. Fleming, her husband, had requested Mr. Whitesell, an attorney at law and notary public, to come to his house in the evening and take the acknowledgment of the grantors to the deed of assignment. After Mr. Whitesell came, she went out of the room into an adjoining one, and her husband followed her, and told her that if she would convey her property to the assignee he would be able to pay the entire debt of the firm, and would have the business left. He said that the indebtedness amounted to $250,000, and that with her real estate, in addition to the firm and individual assets, he could pay the debts and save the business, and it was with <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>that impression that she finally signed the deed. She hesitated about signing it, and her daughter, Mrs. Reno, advised her not to sign it. Her son, Cochran Fleming, Jr., after talking with his father and John B. Reno, and being informed by his father that with Mrs. Fleming’s real estate in addition to the securi-' ties he supposed he had, the debts could be paid and the business left, advised his mother to sign the deed, and told her at the time that she would be a very much happier woman if this was done; that then she could have money if she wanted it, and that the firm would have the business left and be in better circumstances than before the assignment. Her husband said to her that if she would sign the deed it would pay all their debts and give him the business free. She asked him if she could not keep out the lot in the rear of Mrs. Reno’s residence. He put the pen in her hand and said, ‘ No, you can’t reserve anything. What is yours is mine, and I want you to sign the deed.’ She asked the notary if the deed -would convey the lots of her daughters, Mrs. Reno and Mrs. Nevin. And being informed that it would not affect them, she signed and acknowledged the deed. The deed was executed without the payment of the sum of one dollar as- therein expressed, or any other consideration by any party. The indebtedness of the firm of Fleming Brothers on the 3d day of October, 1890, ex-o ceeded $600,000. Jonathan Kidd Fleming, a member of the firm of Fleming Brothers, states it at $620,000.”</p>

The case is peculiar. The firm of Fleming Bros., composed of Cochran Fleming, plaintiff’s husband, J. Kidd Fleming, and Cochran Fleming, Jr., became insolvent and unable to pay its debts. A deed of voluntary assignment was executed by the members of the firm as a firm, and by the individual members thereof. The wife of Cochran Fleming, the plaintiff in this bill, joined in that deed of voluntary assignment by which her separate estate was conveyed to the assignee for the benefit of the creditors oi the firm. The master finds that she first knew the insolvency of the firm on the 3d day of October, 1890, at the time the deed was <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>presented to her for signature and acknowledgment, and that she was pressed and urged by her husband to sign it upon the representation that by doing so she would save to him and her said sons the business in which they were engaged under the name of Fleming Brothers; that she begged that some portion of her property should be omitted; her husband refused that any portion should be excluded, and that being greatly worried and distressed by the misfortunes of her husband and sons, and overcome by the demands of her husband, without advice or time or opportunity to obtain advice as to her legal rights, signed and acknowledged said instrument; that no consideration was paid by any creditor of Fleming Brothers to the plaintiff or her husband, or to any member of the firm of Fleming Brothers, or by said Ogden, the assignee, for or by reason offher joining in this assignment.</p>
    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[249,1158,1167,237]]]'>It further appears from the report of the learned master that she signed the deed, relying upon the representation of her husband that the debts of his firm amounted to only two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, whereas is fact they exceeded six hundred thousand.</p>
    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[249,1413,1167,196]]]'>The representation and inducement, that by signing the deed she would thereby save the business of the firm, and prevent the insolvency of her husband and sons, was untrue in point of fact, and undoubtedly misled her.</p>

They did not give the firm credit iipon the strength of her ownership of this real estate. They gave her no consideration for the assignment, and she was undoubtedly deceived and misled by her husband, unintentionally perhaps, as to the condition of the firm at the time of the assignment. We can understand how a wife would be willing to part with her property to save her husband and sons from ruin, and to preserve a business for their support, but no woman of any sense would voluntarily throw her estate into such a yawning gulf of insol<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>vency as this ease discloses; that she did not do it voluntarily is clear upon the evidence and findings of the master, and we see no reason in law or morals, why her property should be applied under such circumstances to the payment of the debts of the firm.</p>
