Evans, decided by Judge Slagle [<a href="/citations/?q=35%20Pitts%20L.J.%20399" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="35 Pitts L.J. 399">35 Pitts. L.

O’Brien, August term of this court. The right of workingmen to organize into associations cannot be questioned ; and the right of the members of such associations, either as individuals or as an organization, to cease to work for any employer and to use all lawful and peaceful means to induce others to refuse to work for such employer are equally well founded. But the members of such associations have no right, by force, menances or threats, to attempt to prevent the members of any other association, or men who belong to no association, from working upon such terms as they may be willing to do, nor, upon the other hand, have nonunion workmen any right to use such means to prevent the members of any association or union from working upon such terms as they may agree-upon with any employer. When any number of men so con-ij duct themselves as to commit a continuing trespass or become i a nuisance they may be enjoined. Under the affidavits sub-' mitted there can be no doubt that a number of the defendants, with others, have been in the habit of collecting in crowds about the establishment of the plaintiffs, having followed their workmen to and from their boarding houses, and purposely interfered with them in passing along the public streets, in some instances even resorting to actual force. The purpose of those engaged in these proceedings was evidently correctly stated by one of the defendants when, in reply to the words of one of the plaintiffs, ‘ Our men are getting sick and tired of this,’ he said, ‘ That is what we are here for, to make them <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>sick and tired.’ The whole course of those actively engaged in these movements was a menace to the workmen of the plaintiffs, as well as to the public peace.</p>
