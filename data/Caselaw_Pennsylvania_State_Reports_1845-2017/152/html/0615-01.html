This has not been made to appear. It is not denied that he was a creditor of ■Schmertz, and the only ground on which the judgment held by him was seriously attacked is that it was given for a larger amount than was necessary to cover the liabilities of Loeffler for Schmertz. The learned judge below finds that at the time the judgment of $100,000 was given, June 13, 1891, the claims and liabilities of said Loeffler for said Schmertz amounted to $101,616.66.
