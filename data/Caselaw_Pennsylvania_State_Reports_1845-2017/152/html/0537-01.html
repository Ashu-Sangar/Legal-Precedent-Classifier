The contract was subject to a proviso “ that said member is in good standing in this order at the time of his death.” Another condition of the instrument was, “that said member complies in the future with the laws, rules and regulations now governing said council and fund, or that may hereafter be enacted by the Supreme Council to govern said council and fund.”</p>

The witnesses by whom this proof was offered were themselves members of the council and subject to calls for assessments, and they were objected to as incompetent on the ground of interest, and the argument in support of the objection was, that one of the parties to the thing or contract was dead, and that his right therein had passed to the plaintiff, who represented his interest in the subject of the controversy..</p>

It is equally true that if that section is inapplicable to the case the witnesses were clearly competent, for the reason that competency is now the rule and incompetence only exists by force of the exceptions contained in the statute. It is very plain to us that the exception of the 5th section of the statute is inapplicable, for the very simple reason that no right of the deceased to the subject in controversy has passed, either by his act or by the act of the law, to the plaintiff. The deceased never had any right to the benefit which was to be paid to his wife. It was hers and hers only, payable to her exclusively, and, of course, no one but she could maintain any action for its recovery. She is a living person and no other person ever had or could have the right to recover this money. As between her and the defendant there is a clear contention as to whether the funds shall be paid by the defendant to her, and there is no contention, and cannot be, upon that subject, as between the defendant and the legal representatives of the deceased. The plaintiff is not such a representative. She takes, if she takes at all, in her own right alone as the beneficiary of the fund, and she does not represent any right or interest of her deceased husband in the fund. She represents herself and her own rights only in the subject in controversy. The cases of Washington Beneficial Society v. Bacher, <a href="/pa/20/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="20 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="972298" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0425-01">20 Pa. 425</a>, and Marion Beneficial Society v.

There was really no serious contention as to the delinquency.of the deceased and his suspension as a member. His own letter of April 10,1888, was both a concession that he was in arrears, and that he knew that he had been suspended. The check he sent was insufficient to pay his arrearages, and it was promptly returned to him because it could not be received under the rules and regulations of the association. These rules pointed out the manner in which a suspended member could be reinstated, but, although he lived several months after his suspension, he never applied to be reinstated after the letter of April 10th was written.</p>
