That said plaintiff demanded in addition the sum of $86.00 to cover alleged payment of taxes by him on account of or upon said mortgage debt. That deponent declined to pay the same, upon the ground that said plaintiff had no claim against deponent for or by reason of any taxes as aforesaid. That when deponent as purchaser of the property covered by said mortgage bought and paid for the same, a receipt was produced by the owner or his agent as follows, viz.: [The receipt was headed ‘monthly statement’ and was for ‘six months’ interest ’ on the house, Sept. 20, 1891.]</p>

The plaintiff, if he ever paid any taxes for or on account of said <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>mortgage by giving receipts and statements as aforesaid, es-topped himself from making any claim for taxes against this deponent who was thereby misled. That said statements and receipts running through a series of years was in effect a waiver of any further claim. But no allegation or averment has been made in this suit of any payment of any taxes by the plaintiff, and deponent is advised that in the absence of such averment no further affidavit of defence is necessary. That if any claims for taxes had been made and the same had not been waived the whole mortgage would have been paid.”</p>

The appellant here is the terre tenant of the property bound by the mortgage in question. The said mortgage contains a provision that, in addition to the interest, all sums which might be assessed by or under the laws of this commonwealth for taxes upon the loan secured by said mortgage, should be paid by the mortgagor. This provision could have been seen by the appellant if he had examined the mortgage prior to his purchase of the property. There is nothing to show that he made such examination or any inquiry in regard to it. He claims to have been misled by a receipt for the six months in<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>terest prior to his purchase, which he says was produced and exhibited to him by his vendor. If he was misled by this it was clearly his own negligence. He had no right to assume that because the interest was paid up to the time of his .purchase, the taxes or any other liability under the mortgage had also been paid, nor can we say that the receipt for the interest created any presumption that the taxes referred to in the mortgage had also been paid. There was no deception practiced upon the appellant, and, as before observed, if he was misled it was his own negligence. It may be and probably is a hard case, but we see no way to relieve the appellant.</p>
