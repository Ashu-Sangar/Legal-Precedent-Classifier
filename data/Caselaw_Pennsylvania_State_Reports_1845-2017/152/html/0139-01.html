It is not pretended that these men, whom I say you may allow, were appointed in accordance with that law, and, therefore, whether or not they were invested with the power of the sheriff by virtue of his deputization, they were not entitled to be paid as deputies because not appointed according to law. [Therefore, in any view of the case, in my judgment, these parties were outside of the ordinary means within the control of the sheriff, and I instruct you, for the purpose of this case, that if these men were employed, as alleged by the sheriff, at the instance of the defendants, and upon the express promise by them to pay the amount expended by him in employing and subsisting these men and providing them with the means of carrying out their duties, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.] [2] Therefore, the only questions of fact' that I see for you to determine are: Were these men employed at the instance and request of the defendants, and under a promise by them to pay their expenses ?

I may say, however, that unless the evidence shows that Mr. Dickey acted under authority of the defendants, anything he said or did would not bind them. It is true it appears that he was attorney for the parties in a suit that was pending in the court of common pleas No. 2, of this county, but as a mere attorney at law he would have no right to make any such agreement as is alleged in this case, so as to bind the defendants. If they are bound by his act at all you must find that he was acting not as an attorney at law, but as an agent authorized by them to so act. [And in referring to this matter I will simply call your attention to this fact: On the part of the plaintiff it is alleged that Mr. Dickey called with Mr. E. L. Clark, the president of the Allegheny Bessemer Steel Company, and that the first conversation was had in his presence; that he then said, in the presence of. Mr. Clark, that the expenses incident to this mode of pro<a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>ceeding would be paid by tbe Allegheny Bessemer Steel Com: pany, and after that was done it was desired by the sheriff that he have notice in writing, which was drawn up and presented. Dr. McCandless testifies positively that this conversation was had in the presence of Mr. Clark, and if that was so, if Mr. Dickey in his presence, speaking for them, made this promise, then the defendants would be bound by it, because they could not at any subsequent, time dispute his authority.] [3] If they permitted him in their presence to make this application and did not' then and there repudiate it, they could not, after the services were performed, repudiate it; and, therefore, if you believe that Mr. Dickey made this promise to Dr. McCandless in the presence of Mr. Clark, the president of the company, they would be bound by his acts.”</p>

    <p id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.9",166,[232,1258,1165,859]]]'>In 1889, plaintiff was sheriff of Allegheny county, and defendants were proprietors of the Bessemer Steel Works at Duquesne on the Monongahela river, several miles above Pittsburgh. In April of that year, a strike, inaugurated by defendants’ employees, resulted.in stoppage of the works, considerable disorder in the vicinity thereof, threats of violence, etc. In company with their attorney, some of the defendants called on the sheriff, informed him of the threatening condition of affairs and requested him to protect their property and preserve the peace. At his instance, a written notice was prepared and served on him in accordance with the act of May 31, 1841, extended to Allegheny county by the act of March 20, 1849, P. L. 184. As the result of this, the sheriff employed and armed special deputies, placed them in charge of the property, paid them for their services and furnished them with subsistence, all at his own expense. He also sent up to defendants’ works some of his regular deputies.</p>

    <p id="b167-3" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[146,482,1165,1522]]]'>On the trial, the main issue of fact was as to the alleged promise of defendants. The evidence on that subject was amply sufficient to justify the submission of the question to the jury. That was done with entire fairness. Calling attention of the jury to the subject, the learned trial judge said: “ The only questions of fact that I see for you to determine are, were these men employed at the instance and request of the defendants and under a promise by them to pay their expenses ? And, if so, is the amount charged here a reasonable and proper amount for that service ? ” Then, after referring to the testimony relating to the alleged contract, he instructed the jury thus: “You will take all the testimony together and say whether or not you believe that contract was made. If you do not believe the contract was made, that is an end of the case, and your verdict should be for the defendants. If you find that the original contract was not made as alleged by the plaintiff, then you may consider the testimony as to the amount of subsistence furnished these men. You will remember that testimony : that Mr. Clark said the sheriff told him that the men were there, and there was no place for them to stay, and that they must have something to eat; and that he told him to go to some place and procure lodgings and provisions. Whether that applied to the whole of the subsistence, or a part, and what part, is for you. Even if you should find that there was no contract originally as to the employment of these men, it seems to me that the circumstances would justify you in considering the question whether or not Mr. Clark did not agree that the subsistence should be paid. If so, you can then find for the subsistence alone, or such portion of it as you believe he agreed to pay.”</p>
    <p id="b167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[142,2011,1164,396]]]'>The verdict was in favor of plaintiff for the amount paid by him for services of the special deputies and their subsistence, excluding, by express direction of the court, the item for services of persons who, at the time, were regular deputies in the sheriff's office, — and of course, it is predicated of the finding of fact by the jury, that the contract was made as alleged by plaintiff.

Without referring specially to the testimony bearing on that subject, it cannot be doubted that there was an abundance of evidence tending to prove the contract as claimed by plaintiff. Its preponderance in his favor is so decided that the jury could have little if any difficulty in finding as they did. The answers of one of the defendants, to a few categorical questions put to him on cross-examination, indicate that there was some understanding as to the payment of the special deputies and their subsistence; and, to that extent at least, they are corroborative of the plaintiffs’ evidence. Mr. Clark was asked: “Was it not very well understood by you that the men sent up there by the sheriff, were to be paid by you, and the expenses paid by you?” His answer was: “Well, I believed we would pay something; that was my idea. Q. Wasn’t it your understanding that the company would pay the expenses of the subsistence of these men <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>and transportation ? A. I said in regard to that point, — I told the sheriff we would do that. As to the question of what amount would be paid, I felt we would be called upon to pay something. I always felt so. There was no understanding with any officers on that subject, nor did we talk it over.”</p>
    <p id="b169-3" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[187,629,1166,758]]]'>Referring to the interview with the sheriff, in which he complained of the insufficiency of the protection afforded, Mr. Park was asked: “ Was the term or word expenses used, and, if so, in what connection? . A. Well, during this interview I said that the concern was a wealthy institution, and they were determined at any expense to stop that trouble, meaning, of course, our own expense, and expenses incident to loss of trade and all such things as that.” Afterwards, on cross-examination, the same witness said he had no understanding that the sheriff was paying personally for the services and subsistence of the special deputies or not; “That had not been talked of or ■thought of.” “Q. What was your impression? A. I don’t know that I had any impression about it; it was a thing I hadn’t thought of, nor had I talked of it with the sheriff or anybody else.”</p>

That act, as was said in Overholtzer v. McMichael, <a href="/pa/10/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="10 Pa. 139" data-case-ids="962686" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0139-01">10 Pa. 139</a>, “gives the penalty in three classes of cases: 1st. Where the officer takes greater or other fees than those limited by the law, for any recognized service done by him; 2d. Where he takes fees, though not beyond the legal limit, for a recognized service not actually performed ; 3d. Where he takes a fee for any pretended service or services not provided for by the act. Between these classes there is an obvious difference. The first two, being clearly defined by the statute, admit of description with legal precision; and this the language of the act seems to- require, as is pointed <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>out in the case cited. But the last class prohibits every non-enumerated service as a basis of compensation, without any attempt at specification, which, indeed, would be wholly impracticable. The language of the statute, in effect is: ‘ for every service here particularized as the subject of fees, you shall be paid a certain sum ; but beyond this you are prohibited from receiving anything.’ The prohibition is sweeping and general, and the offence, thus constituted, consists in exacting pay where none is allowed by law. It matters not what the nature of the pretended service may be, it is still extortion without color of right.”</p>

The entire claim is for the pajr and subsistence of extra men employed, by him, of his own motion, and not authorized by the salary board, as provided by the seventh section of the act of 1876.</p>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[236,1599,1162,753]]]'>It is quite true the sheriff is demanding money for himself; but it is equally true that he is not demanding it as compensation for his own services, or for the services of his regularly appointed deputies, authorized by the act of 1876 ; nor in fact is it for anything of the kind. He is demanding it as money which he actually expended, as the jury has found, in paying and subsisting special deputies selected by himself, without authority of the salary board, at the instance and request of the defendants, for their special benefit, and upon the faith of their promise to refund the amount thus advanced. It would be a strained construction of a penal act to hold that a claim for money thus advanced is in any sense demanded as compensation for plaintiff’s own services or services of his regurlarly authorized and appointed deputies. No such element as that entered into the composition of the verdict.</p>

While the law which forbids the enforcement of such contracts has a higher mission to perform than to aid those who are disposed to repudiate their obligations, it necessarily follows that the latter may invoke its assistance whenever it suits their purpose. As was said by Lord Mansfield, in Holman v. Johnson, 1 Cowp. 341, 343: “ The objection that a contract is immoral or illegal as between plaintiff and defendant sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed, but it is founded in general principles of policy, which the defendant has the advantage of, contrary to the real justice as between him and the plaintiff, by accident, if I may say so. The principle of public policy is this: <em>ex dolo malo non oritur </em>actio.”</p>

It was therefore his duty when notified, “ to take all legal means ” to preserve the peace and prevent the destruction of property. If this could be done by the ordinary but necessarily limited force, under his control, viz.: the regular deputies authorized by the salary board under the act of 1876, it was 'his duty to use them. If that force was insufficient, it was his duty to employ all other legal means necessary to effect the purpose; and, according to Curtis v.

In the language of the learned judge: “ To say that the sheriff was bound to use all lawful means to prevent the threatened destruction of property, is to say that he must use all the means that are not unlawful; and this would include all those physical and moral means which might be adapted to the occasion, whether pointed out by the law or not, — means which are not properly official, and which cannot reasonably be exacted of public officers. To declare him liable for damages, and guilty of a misdemeanor in office for not adopting" unofficial means, would be an anomaly not readily to be assented to, and we can hardly suppose that this is the meaning of the law.”</p>

These may be lawful, because not forbidden; but they are not <em>legal </em>means, because not prescribed by law as means to be used by him in his office.

On the contrary, as we have seen, they requested him to send to their works special deputies, who, in the language of Mr. Park, would give them the same protection that is “ received from the usual policemen on the streets in the city.” In explanation of this he said: “ In the city, people are not allowed to congregate, make a noise, stand on the corners and interrupt and annoy passers-by, and stop people from going into stores,” etc. . . . “ That is what I wanted. ... I wanted that town kept in the same peaceable condition that it was before the strike.” The same witness also testified that, on several occasions, the special deputies, at their request, acted as guards in escorting the defendant’s men from the city up to the mills; that the police and guard duty, performed by those deputies, continued about six weeks. This indicates the character of the protection defendants demanded, received and agreed to pay the cost of. As we have seen, such services as these are not strictly within the line of the official duties of the sheriff, or of his regularly authorized deputies; nor was it ever contemplated that the posse comitatus should be called out <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>for such protracted service of the kind demanded by the defendants.</p>
