He admits it by appearing and taking defence. As well might a freeholder sued by capias plead his privilege in bar, or a defendant in any case that the summons was not served. These questions are collateral altogether to the merits.’ The author of Troubat &amp; Haly’s Practice says : ‘ It may be added that such a plea (domicil pleaded in abatement) would if pleaded alone be no answer to the declaration, and the court would not, even if the plea of domicil be found for defendant, dissolve the attachment merely to enable him to abstract his property from the plaintiff’s execution.’</p>

    <p id="b534-7" data-blocks='[["BL_534.10",534,[240,1196,1157,553]]]'>This is an action for the wages of manual, labor. It was brought before an alderman and under the foreign attachment act of May 8,1874, P. L. 123. It was proven by the affidavit of the plaintiff to the satisfaction of the magistrate that the defendant was a nonresident and the bond required by the act was given before the attachment was issued. The subsequent proceedings were regular and resulted, on the 18th of April, 1891, in a judgment for the plaintiff for $234.25 and costs. From this judgment the defendant, on the 27th of April, 1891, having by his agent or attorney made affidavit and given bail for the debt and costs, as required by law in such cases, appealed.</p>
    <p id="b534-8" data-blocks='[["BL_534.11",534,[241,1755,1165,651]],["BL_535.1",535,[185,389,1160,298]]]'>The record of the proceedings in the court of common pleas to which the appeal was taken shows that a plea in abatement was entered on the 9th and an affidavit of defence was made, on the 27th of June, 1891. The material fact alleged in the plea and affidavit was that when the writ of foreign attachment was issued the defendant was a resident of the state of Pennsylvania. The plaintiff, having filed a statement of his claim on the 25th of June, 1891, obtained a rule on the 15th of July, 1891, to show cause why judgment should not be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. This rule was made absolute on the 30th of September, 1891, and judgment was entered against the defendant for $240.55. From this judgment the appeal to this court was taken, and the <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>single question presented by it is whether the affidavit contains a valid defence to the action. The answer to this question depends on the effect to be given to the appeal from the judgment of the magistrate, the entry of bail for the debt and costs, and the general appearance for the defendant in the court of common pleas.</p>
    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[184,696,1160,810]]]'>We think that by the entry of bail for the payment of the debt, interest, and costs, the attachment was dissolved and the goods of the defendant were released from its grasp, and that the appeal and unconditional appearance constitute a complete answer to all objections founded upon an alleged want of jurisdiction of the person. It is true that this bail was given on appeal, but it was bail to the action, security for the claim, and such as was required by law, on appeals from judgments for the wages of manual labor. It is like, and affords precisely the same protection to the plaintiff in the action as the bail which under the act of 1836 dissolves the attachment; and we discover no valid reason for denying to it the same effect. After entering this security the defendant cannot be heard in the common pleas to allege irregularities and defects in the prior proceedings, but the action must proceed in due course as if commenced by summons, duly served.</p>
