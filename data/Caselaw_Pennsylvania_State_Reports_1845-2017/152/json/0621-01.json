The third does not conform to the rules of court and will not be considered. The fourth specification alleges that the court below erred in allowing interest on the liens to the day of distribution. This was doubtless an oversight, and would have been corrected in the court below had the attention of the learned judge been called to it. The interest should have been allowed only to time of sale.\nWith this modification the decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.",

T., 1892, by J. J. Pepperday, mortgage creditor, from order of O. P. Cambria Co., No. 24, June T., 1890, overruling exceptions to auditor\u2019s report, distributing proceeds of sheriff\u2019s sale of realty, Johnson Allen, use J. J. Pepperday, v. Evaline S. Oxnard et al..\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Hbydrick, JJ.\nDistribution of fund raised by sheriff\u2019s sale of the real estate of Evaline S. Oxnard.\nFrom the report of the auditor, M. B. Stephens, Esq., it appeared that by deed dated Sept. 3,1889, acknowledged Oct. 31,\n1889, and recorded Dec. 11,1889, Johnson Allen conveyed the land in question to Evaline S. Oxnard, subject to a mortgage given for the purchase money, dated Sept. 3, 1889, acknowledged Nov. 2,1889, but notrecorded until March 1,1890. Judgment was confessed on the notes accompanying the mortgage March 5,\n1890. After execution of deed, and before recording of mortgage, a house was built upon the land, and various mechanics\u2019 liens attached. The liens allowed were conceded to be-in proper form. One of them claimed for work begun Oct. 28, 1889, and stated defendant\u2019s title as an equitable one. Appellant claimed that there was no evidence that the material was necessary for the improvement of the separate estate or on the wife\u2019s credit. The evidence showed that she knew of the building contracted for by her husband, and did nob object. The auditor distributed the fund to the mechanics\u2019 liens in preference to the mortgage, allowing interest on the liens to the date of distribution. Various exceptions were filed to the auditor\u2019s report, all of which were overruled by the court in an opinion by Barker, P. J.\nJanuary 3, 1893:\nErrors assigned were (11) in not awarding sufficient of the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale to satisfy the purchase money mortgage ; (2) in awarding the money to the mechanics\u2019 liens; (8) in overruling the exceptions, but not quoting them; (4) in allowing interest on the liens to the day of distribution.\nDavid Q.
