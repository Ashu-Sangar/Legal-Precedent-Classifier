Heard with preceding cases.\nThe facts as they appeared before White, J., were substantially similar to those of the preceding cases. The exceptions filed by appellants, property owners, were among others as follows:\n\u201c 6. Neither the city of Pittsburgh nor the viewers have ascertained and determined the true costs and expenses of making said improvement, and the sum so reported is largely in excess of the actual cost and expense.\u201d\nError assigned was entry of decree dismissing exceptions and confirming report, quoting decree.\nC.
