The land was partitioned, and the tract in dispute was allotted to one of the illegitimate children, Mary Zimmerman. Mary Zimmerman died on September 2, 1882, intestate, without issue, but leaving to survive her a husband, Charles Zimmerman. Zimmerman died on December 4, 1899, leaving a will by which he bequeathed the land in question to his son and daughter, the defendants. At the trial the jury rendered a verdict for plaintiffs, the illegitimate brothers and sisters of the decedent. Subsequently the court entered judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto.</p>
