L. 72, a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff cannot be sustained where the evidence shows only a negative reply to an application by the plaintiff to the defendant for permission to purchase and use on defendant’s line a number of wooden coal cars of a kind used by other coal operators which the plaintiff had an executory contract to purchase.</p>

In such a case the mere assertion by the railroad company of its rights to exclude from its tracks the cars which plaintiff proposed to buy entailed no’ loss or injury. Until the plaintiff was in actual possession of the cars it proposed to offer for service it was open to the defendant to retreat from the position it had taken if it so desired; it was equally open to the plaintiff to abandon its scheme of providing itself with private cars. The claim for damages therefore rests on nothing better than a pure hypothetical basis, since the injury complained of was never actually realized.</p>

Since none of the rulings of the court with respect to the first complaint are assigned for error, it calls for no consideration at our hands. If the joinder of the two was not| in accord with the rules of practice, such circumstance might have availed the defendant on demurrer; but with the general plea entered* the right to object was gone and the plaintiff could not thereafter be compelled to elect as between the two. This.disposes of the first assignment of error, and brings us directly to the more serious question in the case, arising upon these facts. The plaintiff being without cars of its own was entirely dependent upon the defendant railroad company for cars in which to) transport its coal to market, differing in this respect from many other operating companies in the same region, which, while entitled to a ratable allotment of cars owned by the railroad company, had in addition their own private cars which they were permitted by the railroad company to employ. Beginning with the period covered by the action, the plaintiff company, not because the defendant had discriminatéd against it in the matter of the distribution of its own cars, but solely with a view to enlarge its facilities for shipment in cars furnished by itself, made application through its president to the Huntingdon &amp; Broad Top Railroad Company for the purchase from it of two hundred cars of like character and description with those employed by other operators on the lines of defendant and by defendant itself. The negotiation was between the president of <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>the plaintiff company and the superintendent of the Huntingdon <em>&amp; </em>Broad Top Company in the latter’s office at Huntingdon.

We will further assume, without deciding, that the negotiation between the plaintiff and the Huntingdon &amp; Broad Top Railroad Company amounted to a contract for the sale and purchase of two hundred such cars. These concessions yield points which were earnestly contended for on one side and as earnestly disputed on the other. We make the concessions for the purpose of the argument. Notwithstanding their liberality it may readily be seen how incomplete they leave the plaintiff’s case with respect to that branch of it we are now considering. Except as supplemented by facts which not only do not <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>appear, but which evidently have no existence, the plaintiff’s case must rest upon a purely hypothetical basis. With nothing more in the case that we have conceded, a recovery by the plaintiff would necessarily assume, without the slightest evidence, that the plaintiff could and would have complied with the terms of the contract with the Huntingdon &amp; Broad Top Railroad Company; and, what is equally important, that the Huntingdon &amp; Broadtop Railroad Company would not have failed to deliver the cars. In either event what would have legally resulted? Simply a claim for damages against the party in default. Specific performance of the contract between the parties could not have been enforced by either. What stronger position then did the plaintiff occupy because of its contract than it would have been in had it simply shown that the same kind of cars were procurable in the general market? The case as exhibited presents this situation — plaintiff having no cars of its own inquired of the defendant whether, in case it obtained some answering a certain description, the defendant would permit of them being used in plaintiff’s service upon its lines; the defendant company refused, accompanying its refusal with reasons which may or may not have been a justification of its action, — a question which the parties were alike qualified to decide, each for itself — thereupon, the question between them at this point being one of rights, for reasons left entirely to conjecture, plaintiff surrendered whatever advantage it had under its contract without having once reached a position with respect tó the cars that would have enabled it to exercise the right it demanded had the right been conceded by the defendant. It is not with abstract rights we are here dealing but with a question of injury which is made the basis of the present action. What is complained of is injury that resulted from undue and unreasonable discrimination in denying plaintiff facilities for the transportation of freight which defendant had extended to others. The reference is to the fact that <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>some shippers were employing their own cars in the transportation of coal, and that plaintiff was denied the privilege of using its privately owned cars in like business. If plaintiff had no such cars, where was the discrimination and where was the injury? A mere refusal to admit or recognize a right in another cannot in itself be made the subject of a legal action for damages. There must be injury to redress before the law will take cognizance of the dispute. Especially so when the claim is under the specific act we are considering, which makes the offending party liable to the party injured for damages treble the amount of the injury' suffered. The mere assertion by the defendant of its right to exclude from its tracks the cars which plaintiff proposed to buy entailed no loss or injury. Until the plaintiff was in actual possession of the cars it proposed to offer for service, it was open to the defendant to retreat from the position it had taken if it so desired; it was equally open to the plaintiff to abandon its scheme of providing itself with private cars; and so we repeat that the claim for damages in this case rests on nothing better than a pure hypothetical basis, since the injury complained of was never actually realized, certainly not through any discrimination by the defendant. If loss resulted to the plaintiff it is to be referred to its own failure to put itself in position where it would have had a right to demand equal facilities. If it failed to do this because of greater confidence in the strength of defendant’s position than its own, with regard to their respective rights in the matter, it was a case of damnum absque injuria.</p>

    <blockquote id="b449-4" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[153,806,1148,418]]]'>“That there is no evidence in the case which would warrant the jury in finding that had defendant agreed to accept the Huntingdon &amp; Broad Top wooden cars of the capacity of sixty thousand pounds as the private or individual cars of the plaintiff, the latter would have purchased two hundred of these cars, and in the absence of evidence to warrant such a conclusion the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.6",449,[202,1245,603,34]]]'>The answer of the court was:</p>
    <blockquote id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.7",449,[153,1299,1146,207]]]'>“This is refused as stated, because the question as we look at it, is for the jury as to whether or not there was a contract entered into in good faith by Mr. Fraser for the plaintiff company.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b449-7" data-blocks='[["BL_449.8",449,[154,1517,1145,197]]]'>The error in this answer has been sufficiently indicated in what we have already said. The point should have been affirmed. The ninth assignment of error is therefore sustained.</p>

In an opinion just handed down, in the case of the Puritan Coal Mining Company v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, <a href="/pa/237/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="237 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="988989" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0420-01">237 Pa. 420</a>, we have given full expression to our views, holding in that case that Federal and State jurisdictions were concurrent, for the reason that Congress had not legislated specifically with reference to the offense there charged. It is unnecessary to repeat <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>here what was there said. This case is ruled by that. In the absence of specific legislation by Congress of the offense here charged, whether in the first or second complaint, the jurisdiction of our own courts remains undisturbed.</p>
