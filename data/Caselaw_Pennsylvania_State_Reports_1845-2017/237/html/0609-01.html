    <p class="summary" id="b640-8" data-blocks='[["BL_640.14",640,[324,2012,1144,265]]]'>W. C.

To remedy this oversight the Act of March 2, 1911, P. L. 8, was passed, which provided in the second proviso of Section 5, “That the terms of the successors, (that is Duff and Aye,) to officers whose terms expire in the year 1911, shall begin on the first Monday of December in that year and shall be extended as follows: the two year term until the 1st Monday of January, 1914.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b641-3" data-blocks='[["BL_641.4",641,[138,884,1147,263]]]'>This legislation gave the overseers elected in November, 1911, terms of two years and one month.

    <p class="summary" id="b641-5" data-blocks='[["BL_641.6",641,[138,1432,1148,1028]]]'>We cannot see how that act can help the respondents. By the express condition of the schedule to the Constitution, Overseers of the Poor elected in 1910 should serve until the 1st Monday of December, 1911. The respondents were elected in February, 1910. Their contention is that they hold office until the 1st Monday of January, 1914. But the Act of June 19, 1911, provides that overseers “elected on the municipal election day,” that is, in November, 1911, shall hold office for the term of four years. That is Duff and Aye, who were elected in November, 1911, will hold their office until the 1st Monday of January, 1916. But where is there any provision in the Constitution, its Schedule, or the Acts of Assembly, that extends the term of Bailey and Schrecengost from the 1st Monday of December, 1911, to 1st Monday of January, 1914. This, in our opinion, they cannot do. Even if their case falls within the provisions of that act, it being in conflict with the Constitution, must yield.</p>

L. 1052. The schedule had done its duty in bridging over the time between the adoption of the amendments and the convening of the legislature. The Act of 19th June, 1911, was enacted long before the time fixed in the schedule for the expiration of the terms of overseer of the poor and carried into complete operation the intendment of the amendments and the schedule.</p>
