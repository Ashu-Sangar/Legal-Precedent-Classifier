A judgment will not be reversed for the refusal of the court to withdraw a juror and continue the case becausé of alleged objectionable remarks of counsel where the assignment of error fails to show precisely what the remarks were, and there is nothing upon the record which shows that counsel made the assertion attributed to him, and where he denies having made any such statement.</p>

The defense was that the plaintiff had attempted to get on a moving car. The issue was submitted to the jury, and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff; the defendant has appealed. There is but one assignment of error and that complains of the refusal of the trial judge to withdraw a juror and continue the case because of certain objectionable remarks made by counsel for the plaintiff during the course of his address to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[309,839,1146,1570]],["BL_357.1",357,[171,354,1147,482]]]'>The appellant contends that the plaintiff’s counsel said to the jury “that if the car was so crowded as to require the conductor to be inside, the company was negligent in not providing three men to manage it.” While the excerpts from the notes of testimony covered by the assignment of error indicate that something of this nature may have been said, counsel denies having made any such statement, and the assignment fails to show precisely what his remarks were; whatever they may have been there is nothing upon the record which shows that he made the assertion attributed to him by counsel for the appellant. Not having the language objected to before us, we cannot say that the court below committed error in its rulings in respect thereto. However, we are of opinion that the statement made by counsel for the plaintiff after the refusal to withdraw a juror, to the effect that “ a verdict against a corporation of this kind would be a blessing for this company as well as the community; it will preserve the safety of passengers in the community; it will act as a safeguard and a warning to the company,” was highly improper, and had an application for the withdrawal of a juror and continuance of the case based thereon been declined, it might well have been urged as reversible error; but this course was not pursued. On the contrary, counsel for the defendant merely stated to the court, “I object to that line of argument that there should be three men on a car; there is no custom shown or necessity for it.” The court replied, <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>“we will take care of that ---- to the jury”; and counsel then said, “I simply note my objection.” From this we must take it that the defendant did not then desire to insist upon the withdrawal of a juror, else counsel would have directed the court’s attention particularly to the objectionable matter indicated by us, insisted upon his rights, and if refused, secured an exception. But instead of so doing, he simply noted an objection.</p>
