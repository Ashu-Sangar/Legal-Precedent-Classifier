But corporate powers can never be created by implication nor extended by construction. No privilege is granted, unless it be expressed in plain and unequivocal words, testifying the intention of the legislature in á manner too plain to be misunderstood. When the State means to clothe a corporate body with a portion of her own sovereignty, and to disarm herself to that extent of the powers which belong to her, it is so easy to say so that we will never believe it to be meant when it is not said; and words of equivocal import are so easily inserted by mistake or fraud, that every consideration of justice and policy requires that they should be treated as nugatory, when they do find their way into the enactments of the legislature. In the construction of a charter, to be in doubt is to be resolved; and every resolution which springs from doubt is against the corporation. This is the rule sustained by all the courts in this country and in England. No other has ever received the sanction of any authority to which we owe much deference.” See, also, Brown v. Radnor Township Electric Light Company, <a href="/pa/208/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="208 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="998161" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0453-01">208 Pa. 453</a>.

L. 1360, in equity, for an injunction to restrain such act.” It was also held that “there can be no authority or power conferred upon a corporation by the certificate or letters <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>patent, except such as are clearly given by, or necessarily implied from, the language of the statute under which they are granted.

L. 73, provided for the incorporation of companies for “the manufacture and supply of gas or the supply of light or heat to the public by any other means.” In Scranton Electric Light and Heat Company’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/122/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="122 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1948407" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0154-01">122 Pa. 154</a>, it was held that this did not authorize the incorporation of companies for the supply of electric light to consumers. Mr. Justice Gordon, delivering the opinion of the court, said: “Did the legislature intend to embrace electric lighting in the language, ‘companies incorporated under the provisions of this statute, for the supply of water to the public, or for the manufacture of gas, or the supply of light or heat to the public by any other means’? Before answering this question, we must call attention to what has heretofore been regarded as an unalterable rule; that is, that a legislátive grant to a corporation of exclusive privileges is, as said by Mr. Justice Green, in Emerson y. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/108/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="108 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="539253" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0111-01">108 Pa. 111</a>, to be construed most strictly, and we may add, that every intendment not obviously in favor of the grant must be construed against it. Monopolies are'favorites neither with courts nor people. They operate in restraint of competition, and are, hence, as a rule, detrimental to the public welfare; nor are they at all allowable except where the resultant advantage is in favor of the public, as, for instance, where a water <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>or gas company could not exist except as a monopoly. ......In the case above cited, the sharpest technicality of construction was adopted in order to defeat the extravagant demand of the corporation claiming the exclusive privilege to furnish the City of Pittsburgh with natural gas for the purposes of fuel. But in the case before us, it is apparent that the legislature did not, in the making of the Act of 1874, ihtend to embrace lighting by electricity. It is true, that the language of this statute seems, at first sight, to be broad enough to embrace all methods of lighting-and heating then known, or that might thereafter become known, yet, we suppose, it will not be contended that the intention was to grant to this company the exclusive privilege of furnishing to the citizens of Scranton coal, wood, oil, and other well known and ordinary materials for lighting and heating. Not, indeed, tha,t the law-makers could not have conferred such power, but because it is not probable that they intended to confer a power so unreasonable. It is, therefore, obvious that we must consult not only the letter of the act, but also the intention of its makers. If, however, it were designed to embrace a method of lighting by electricity, a method not then in use for economic purposes, it is remarkable that the means necessary for its proper distribution were not provided for. Under the 34th section of the act, the only one upon which the plaintiff relies for its exclusive right, there is no power conferred to enter upon the public streets for the erection of poles and placing of wires, the privilege of so entering being confined to the laying of pipes only. From this it is clear that the legislature had in mind, not a then unknown process of public lighting and heating, but a process involving the use of gas, or some similar material, for the distribution of which pipes only were necessary.” In Allegheny County Light Company v. Booth, <a href="/pa/216/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="216 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="950427" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0564-01">216 Pa. 564</a>, the company was incorporated in 1880 under the Act of 1874, for the purpose of the manufacture and supply <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>oí light-. Afterwards, the company surrendered its original charter, and took out letters patent under the Act of May 8, 1889, P. L. 136, providing for the incorporation of companies for the supply of light, heat and power by electricity. It was held that the right of the company to change its system from poles and wires to conduits was expressly provided for in the Act of 1889. Mr. Justice Brown said: “But the appellant was not authorized, under its original charter, to supply light by electricity....... In locating and installing their systems of distributing electricity, electric light companies are given by this section the right of eminent domain upon public streets, lanes,' alleys or highways outside of city or borough limits, and, within such limits, they may use the streets with municipal consent. This is a limited right of eminent domain, the limitation upon it being found in the words of the grant of it.” The Act of May 8, 1889, P. L. 136, provides: “Clause 1. Every such corporation shall have the authority to supply light, heat and power, or any of them, by electricity, to the public in the borough, town, city or district where it may be located, and to such persons, partnerships and corporations, residing therein or adjacent thereto, as may desire the same, at such prices as may be agreed upon, and the power, also, to make, erect and maintain the necessary buildings, machinery and apparatus for supplying such light, heat and power, or any of them, and to distribute the same, with the right to enter upon any public street, lane, alley or highway for such purpose, to alter, inspect and repair its system of distribution.” In Brown v. Radnor Township Electric Light Company, <a href="/pa/208/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="208 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="998161" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0453-01">208 Pa. 453</a>, it was held that an electric light company might be incorporated for a township, and that the word “district” was not to be restricted merely to a division of a city or borough. It was also decided that such an incorporated company, by the express terms of the act, had a limited power of eminent domain, and, under such <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>power, might enter upon the bed of a turnpike road and erect its poles and string its wires, notwithstanding the objection of abutting owners who own the fee in the bed of the road. Mr. Justice Dean, in delivering the opinion of the court, said: “It is difficult to see how the power thus conferred can be said to be by implication or construction; true, no power to actually take and appropriate land is given, but an additional servitude is imposed upon the land, a servitude additional to that of the turnpike company, and this by express positive grant.” It is not, however, decided that such a company has the right, generally, to enter upon and occupy land; and that right would appear to be confined by the act of assembly to the public streets, lanes, alleys or highways,</p>

In addition, the acts themselves seem to us to designate as the purposes intended something in the nature of pneumatic tubes, through which specific articles might be carried. The Act of 1866 states the purpose of the Dispatch Company to be “to provide, erect, operate and maintain machinery, engines, tubes and apparatus, which may be deemed necessary for the transmission of property of any kind, entrusted to the care of said corporation, whether upon the surface of the earth, or under the same,” and the right is given to it “to enter upon such lands and enclosures, streets, lanes and alleys, roads, highways and bridges, as it may be necessary to occupy, for the purposes aforesaid.” The Act of 1870 declares “that the business of said corporation (the Novelty Power Company) shall be the receipt, delivery, transportation, storage, transmission, conveyance o;f <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>goods, merchandise, letters, packages, messages, parcels, property of any and every kind and description.” And the Act of 1868, which is a supplement to the Aqt of 1866, declares '“that nothing contained in said act shall be held to prohibit the said corporation from transporting persons within their pneumatic tubes.” It cannot be contended that the electric wires which the company now intends to erect extend either upon the surface of the earth or under the same; and as the general right of eminent domain is such an act of sovereign authority which even electric light companies do not, as we have shown, now possess, can it be reasonably supposed that the legislature, in passing these special acts, had in contemplation the grant of any such power? If it had so meant, we think it would have said so, and that a failure to so declare is a denial of the right.</p>
