Mrs. Wingrove alleged that on August 19, 1905, as she was boarding a car of the defendant company in the city of Harrisburg, it was prematurely started, and she was thrown down and severely injured. The case was tried twice in the court below. The second trial resulted in á verdict for the plaintiff, Sarah Wingrove, in the sum of $4,500, and for W. G. Wingrove in the sum of $300. A motion for a new trial was made by defendant, which for some unexplained reason was not disposed of for nearly three years. On February 27, 1912, the court below made an order requiring the plaintiff to remit $1,500 of the verdict in her favor, or submit to a new trial. A remittitur was filed reducing the verdict to $3,000, and judgment was entered thereupon. Defendant has appealed.</p>

These witnesses then testified that Mrs. Wingrove had suffered a fracture of a rib, or separation of the cartilage from the bony'part of the rib. Upon' the second trial, neither of these doctors was called to’ testify, nor was there any allegation that plaintiff’s'-rib .had been fractured. Defendant offered the testimony of th'd phy<a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>sicians at the former trial, and proposed to follow it with evidence that plaintiff was not in any way suffering from a fractured rib; and this for the purpose of affecting her credibility. Counsel for appellant have cited no authority to support their position that the credibility of the plaintiff can be attacked in this way. If admitted, the evidence would not have contradicted any testimony given on the second trial.

The question raised by the offer was not as to the right of the defendant to show the fact of a conspiracy to fabricate evidence, but it was to the admissibility of the record of the Court of Quarter Sessions to establish that fact. We think the learned judge was right in excluding the record for that purpose. In 2 Elliott on Evidence, Section 1525, Note 28, it is said: “Judgments in criminal cases where the State is prosecutor, are generally held inadmissible to establish the facts of a civil case, and vice versa.” In Bennett v. Fulmer, <a href="/pa/49/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="49 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="998553" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0155-01">49 Pa. 155</a>, it was held, as appears from the syllabus, that “The record of a criminal prosecution against defendants for forcible entry and detainer, wherein plaintiffs were prosecutors and witnesses, is not admissible on the trial of the civil action of trespass involving the title to the premises.” In Summers v. Brewing Co., <a href="/pa/143/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="143 Pa. 114" data-case-ids="978548" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0114-01">143 Pa. 114</a>, an action to recover damages for injuries sustained by a child by being run down by defendant’s wagon, it was held, as appears from the syllabus, “The record of a prosecution of the driver for assault and battery, in the Quarter Sessions, instituted by the father and next-friend of the.child, offered to show that at the trial' <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>thereof there was no contention that the driver was asleep when the accident occurred, was irrelevant to the issue and properly excluded.”</p>

It does appear from the evidence that Mrs. Wingrove testified that she could not remember very much that happened after she got in the car; that when the conductor came around a passenger took her purse and paid her fare for her; and that she was assisted home. On cross-examination she said further that when she reached her home after the accident, she was suffering pain over her whole body. We think this testimony was sufficient to warrant the suggestion of the trial judge that the plaintiff’s condition may have prevented her making complaint to the conductor.
