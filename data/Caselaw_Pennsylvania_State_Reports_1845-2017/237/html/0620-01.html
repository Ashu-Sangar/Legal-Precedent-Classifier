L. 669, is the “legal representative” of the member within the meaning of the by-laws; and if such action results in a nonsuit, the judgment of nonsuit is a “judgment in such suit,” within the meaning of the by-laws. Thereafter the widow cannot maintain an action against the company for death benefits; and this is the case although she may have, after the nonsuit had been entered, gone through the form of withdrawing her claim in the trespass case and discontinuing that suit.</p>

Upon the trial of that cause, a judgment of nonsuit against the plaintiff was entered, which the court, upon motion duly made, refused to take off, from which judgment no appeal was taken. Before the time for appeal had expired, the plaintiff entered, by praecipe in the prothonotary’s office, without authority of the court first had, a withdrawal of “the claim made in this case” and a discontinuance of the suit, directing the prothonotary “to so mark the same of record.” She subsequently brought suit for the death benefit under the membership of her husband in the relief association. An affidavit of defense was filed by the defendant, and, upon motion for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense, the court discharged the rule granted therepn and filed a carefully prepared opinion. Upon the trial of the cause, the plaintiff’s testimony established the facts set forth in the defendant’s affidavit of defense and, upon motion, at the conclusion of the plaintiff’s case, the court granted a nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off. The case before us for consideration is the appeal of the plaintiff from this refusal of the court.</p>

Any compromise of such claim or suit, or judgment in such suit, shall preclude any claim upon the Relief Fund for benefits on account of such injury or death, and the acceptance of benefits from the relief fund by a member or his beneficiary or beneficiaries, on account of injury or death, shall operate as a release and satisfaction of all claims against the company and any and all of the corporations associated therewith in the administration of their relief department, for damages arising from such injury or death.”</p>

As <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>we understand it, the widow was not the administratrix of the decedent. She brought her action under the Act of April 15, 1851, P. L. 669, for damages by reason of his death. This question has been dealt with and practically settled in Jack v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa-super/43/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="43 Pa. Super. 337" data-case-ids="415183" data-case-paths="/pa-super/43/0337-01">43 Pa. Superior Ct. 337</a>, in which the fifty-eighth section of the rules governing the relief fund was considered and passed , upon. It is, perhaps, true that ordinarily the phrase “legal representative” refers to the administrators or executors of a decedent, but the term is not confined exclusively to such representatives. In the case under consideration, the law fixes the representative of the decedent as the widow, and, inasmuch as she is named by the law as the representative of the decedent, she, of course, is for that purpose the legal representative.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b653-3" data-blocks='[["BL_653.4",653,[157,1248,1150,917]]]'>As was said in Hughes v. D. &amp; H.

If the defendant would not have been liable to him in the first instance, it was not made liable to her after his death. We are not aware of any case, certainly our attention has not been called to any, in which a widow has recovered for injuries to her husband where he could not have done so himself, if he had survived. And, on principle, it is perfectly clear that she never can do so, for the original right of action is in him and hers is but the succession or substitution for his, where he has not asserted it himself. If he has done so, his action survives, if he has not, then by virtue of the statute she brings hers in its place, but for the same cause: Birch v. Pittsburg, Etc., Ry.

The <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>eighteenth section provides for the case of a party injured who has brought an action for his injury, but subsequently dies, and directs that in such case the action shall not abate by reason of the death but shall survive to- his personal representatives. Section 19 provides that, if no action has been brought for the injury during the life of the party injured, the widow, or if there is no widow, the personal representatives may maintain an action and recover damages for the death thus occasioned. Thus both classes of cases are provided for, the one, where an action was brought by the injured party during his life but the plaintiff died pending the action, and the other where no action had been brought at the time of the death of the party injured.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.4",654,[296,1131,1150,1296]],["BL_655.1",655,[141,357,1147,100]]]'>While it is very true that the injured party could in no circumstances recover damages for his own death, yet it is equally true that the course of action provided for by both sections is death resulting from injuries. The act did not undertake to give a cause of action to the party injured for the injuries he had sustained, because such a right of action already existed, independently of the act. Hence it cannot be argued that the intention of the eighteenth section was to give one right of action to the party injured and another and independent right of action for the same injury to his widow. The cause of action is the same in both sections, to wit, the death of the party, the only difference being that the eighteenth section provided for an action already pending, that it should not abate but should survive to the personal representative, and the nineteenth section provided that, in case no action has been brought before the death of the party, an action might be brought by the widow, or if there was no widow, then by the personal representatives.” Whether by the widow, or, in the absence of such a party, by the personal representatives they were both in their order legal representatives of the party, because their status was fixed by law and that law made them the legal representatives of the party for <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>damages for the death of whom the action could be brought. ,</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b655-3" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[142,467,1150,1292]]]'>Was the judgment of nonsuit a judgment in the cáse such as is contemplated in the fifty-eighth section* supra? We think it was. The plaintiff; exhausted her legal right in the presentation of her case. The court held that presentation insufficient for her recovery and entered a nonsuit upon which judgment was entered. This, of course, was conclusive, so far as it went. It carried the costs and settled the question, so far as that suit was concerned, and was a final judgment therein. True, the defendant had a right to bring another suit and was not precluded from doing so by the judgment of nonsuit, but, so far as the suit then pending was concerned, the judgment of nonsuit was a final disposition of it, and, in our opinion, clearly constituted a conclusive judgment in the case. The plaintiff! had a right to appeal, of course, but she did not appeal, and as the court well says in its opinion discharging the motion for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, her withdrawal of the suit and discontinuance thereof was a nullity, because there was nothing to withdraw and nothing to discontinue. The case had been ultimately disposed of by a conclusive judgment, and that was the end of it, so far as that suit was concerned.</p>

We are clearly of the opinion that the court gave the proper construction to the fifty-eighth section of the rule of the relief association and that being so the sixty-fifth section becomes unimportant, inasmuch as the superintendent and the advisory committee on appeal held that the judgment in the action in trespass for damages for the death of the plaintiff’s husband was con-<a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>elusive as to her right to share in the relief fund under her husband’s membership in the association.</p>
