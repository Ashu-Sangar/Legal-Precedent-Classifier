These witnesses state positively that, as they observed the tree from the. ground, there was nothing whatever to indicate that it was not in a perfectly sound and healthy condition, though it was noticed that an outer portion of it had previously broken off and disappeared. It is further testified on behalf of the defendant, and not denied by the' plaintiff, that the opening of the park season, about the 15th of May, 1908, the defendant had several men engaged for a period of about two weeks in cleaning up the park, cutting down decayed trees and taking off limbs that were in bad condition, and that other and later inspections were made from time to time before the accident. The portion of the limb which caused the injury was from seven to nine feet in length and eight or nine inches in diameter, and fell from a height variously estimated at from forty to seventy feet.</p>

Sec., 996, the rule applicable to cases such as the one we are now considering is thus stated “The duty assumed by the owners of places to which the public thus resort in large numbers is manifestly analogous to that which the law imposes on carriers of passengers. Nevertheless it has been measured by the standard of ordinary care. Doubtless the true theory is that such persons assume the obligation of exercising reasonable care, and that what will be reasonable care will be a degree of care proportioned to the danger incurred and the number of persons who will be subjected to that danger. A good expression of the rule of liability, applicable to such cases, is found in the English case to the effect that the proprietor, of such structure is not a warrantor or insurer that it is absolutely safe, but that he impliedly warrants that it is safe for the purpose intended, save only as to those defects which are unseen, unknown and undiscoverable, — not only unknown to himself but undiscoverable by the exercise of any reasonable skill and diligence, or by any ordinary and reasonable means ..of injury and examination. Such being the nature of the obligation, it is obvious that the proprietor of such a building is under a continuing duty of inspection, to the end of seeing that it is reasonably safe for the protection of those whom he invites to come into it; and that if he neglects his duty in this respect, so that it becomes unsafe, the question of his knowledge or ignorance of the defects which render it unsafe is immaterial.”</p>

They found that the decay was open and obvious and that the inspections were not the ordinary and reasonable ones in common use. The questions propounded to the jury, to which they were requested to make special findings, did not indicate whether the observable condition of decay mentioned related to a time before or after the fall; and there is nothing in any of the answers to indicate that the jury found that the defect in the limb was open and obvious while it remained on the tree. Of course, the decayed condition was obvious after it ■ had fallen, but there is not a scintilla of testimony tending to show that such condition was observable while it was attached to the tree; nor is there any evidence from which such inference could have been drawn. The question of the defendant’s negligence in that regard is to be determined, not by what was discovered in the limb after the fall, but by what it did or omitted to do before the accident, and the uncontradicted testimony of several witnesses establishes the fact that upon an examination made by them from the ground the day before the accident there was no observable appearance of unsoundness in the limb; that it, in fact, then had a sound and healthy appearance. Likewise, the special finding as <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>to the method of inspection employed was absolutely without evidence to support it. And what other or different method should the defendant have adopted? The only other we can conceive of would have been by climbing the tree for the purpose of examination. But why require that the tree be mounted for such purpose when the limb appeared to be healthy and strong? If it were defendant’s duty to employ such method of examination for this particular limb, then in order to protect itself from the charge of negligence it would be obliged to climb every tree and inspect every limb thereon, it matters not how healthy or strong might be its appearance upon inspection from the ground. This in our judgment -would be an unreasonable requirement and would impose upon the defendant a greater degree of care under the circumstances than it was required to observe.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b188-4" data-blocks='[["BL_188.4",188,[319,1291,1145,967]]]'>The jury evidently found from the testimony that the limb was decayed, and therefore dangerous. As the only evidence showing a condition of decay was that which related to its appearance after the accident, they must have inferred that by a proper method of inspection, the danger was observable before the fall. If, as we have already indicated, the method of inspection was all that was reasonably required, the jury must have further inferred that the dangerous defect in the limb was observable by that inspection. Such inference, however, is but a presumption with nothing but another presumption to support it, and this is never allowed. It is a matter of common knowledge that the limbs sometimes do decay while attached to the tree without any external evidence of such condition. The jury might, with at least equal reason, have inferred that, when inspected the day prior to the accident, the limb had the appearance of being perfectly sound.</p>
