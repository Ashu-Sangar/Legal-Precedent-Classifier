They each held under patents the dividing lino between which was a north and south line which touched. the shore of the lake at an acute angle. In 1833 the Canal Commissioners of Pennsylvania/dammed the outlet of Conneaut Lake, by this meaiis raising the water about twelve feet and causing an overflow of the lands of both Power and Foust. The land of Foust which. was thus submerged amounted to about nine acres. The flowage covered all the property which is now in dispute. The water thus stored was a reservoir for the supply of the Erie division of the Pennsylvania Canal. This was the purpose of its construction and this use was the reason of the construction of the dam.</p>

By this arrangement, Foust ceded to Power his title, whatever it was, to a wedge-shaped piece of land lying back from the lake, and Power, in like manner, ceded to Foust a wedge-shaped piece of land abutting on the lake. As a result, each tract preserved the same acreage, but the division line ran at right angles instead of obliquely to the lake. There was no dispute as to the consentable line thus established. By various conveyances not necessary to refer to such title as the Commonwealth acquired to the lands in dispute passed to Henry Dreutlein, the petitioner in this proceeding, who became the defendant under the issue framed by the court, and the title of Cornelius Foust passed to the respondents, Andrew Foust and Alva Foust, who were made plaintiffs in the issue.</p>

The other property not actually used for the permanent structure work of the canal and its immediate accessories was regarded as taken only to such extent as the Commonwealth might need it. When the canals as a system of transportation became obsolete and their place was taken by the railroads as a new and more effective means of transportation, in almost every instance the canal was taken over and occupied by some railroad as a more modern and up-to-date means of effecting the same purpose that the canal had originally been created to serve. There was, therefore, very strong equity underlying any mere technical construction of the words of the statute, to hold that the land owner having been paid once for what purported to be the permanent occupation of the soil, should not be paid for a second time, for what was really in effect the same public use. Whatever may be the reasons, however, the court felt satisfied that the title of the State in the canal itself and its immediate works, meaning by that works so constructed, excavated or other<a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>wise dealt with as to be apparently permanent, were taken by the state in fee. As to that which lies off the line of the canal, where under the terms of the act the canal is not constructed through the plaintiff’s property, we submit that the question is determined by the general character of the state’s occupancy, the purpose apparently fixed upon it and the apparent title for which the damages were assessed.</p>

If it be true that the occupation of the land by the Commonwealth was not permanent and continuing, but only of temporary or limited duration, it reverted, upon the abandonment of the canal, to the original riparian owner, under whom the appellants claim. On the other hand, if the canal commissioners, by submerging the land, took it from the owner for the purpose of permanently increasing the water supply to be stored in the lake for the permanent use of the canal, the Commonwealth took a fee in the land, just as it did in the bed of the canal itself. This is to be regarded as settled by an unbroken line of cases, among which are Haldeman v. Penna. Central R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/50/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="50 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="425175" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0425-01">50 Pa. 425</a>; Craig v.

Railroad Company the question was whether the Commonwealth had acquired a fee in a certain tract of land or a mere easement in it, to be used as a basin in connection with the canal, which, upon the abandonment of the canal,, reverted to the original owners; and, in holding that it did not so revert, this court said: “Why should the Commonwealth consent to take and hold a less estate or interest in the basin than in the bed of the canal or towing-path? The basin was as necessary a part of the improvement as either, and its use Avas intended to be as permanent. There was then the same reason for taking an absolute estate <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>in one as the other......There can be no doubt of the right of the Commonwealth, under the Acts of February 25, 1826, P. L. 55, and of April 9, 1827, P. L. 192, to take the land for the purpose of constructing the basin; nor of the owner’s right to have the damages which he sustained by reason thereof, assessed under the provision of the latter act. But the right of the Commonwealth to the land so taken, was an absolute estate in perpetuity; Commonwealth v. McAllister, <a href="/watts/2/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 Watts 190" data-case-ids="1840173" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0190-01">2 Watts 190</a>; Haldeman v. Penna.

Another case in which it was held that the Commonwealth had taken an estate in perpetuity in a piece of land which it had appropriated for the purpose of constructing a reservoir to furnish a supply of water to a canal is Delosier, et al., v. Pennsylvania Canal Company, 11 Atl. Repr. 400. It was there contended that an estate in perpetuity had not been taken by the Commonwealth ; that it was the owner only of that portion of the land which formed the bed of the canal proper; that the statute expressly stipulated that nothing but an easement could be acquired to any other land taken, and, as the reservoir formed no part of the bed of the canal, on its abandonment the land reverted to the former owners. This contention was not sustained by our late Brother Dean, who presided at the trial of the case in the court below, and, in affirming the judgment upon a verdict directed by him, we said: “The boundaries of the land seized for the use of the State were sufficiently defined; and that the fee thereto vested in the Commonwealth is a matter now so well settled by previous decisions that discussion concerning it is unnecessary.”</p>

This necessarily caused an overflow on the strip of land surrounding the lake, which included the part here in dispute. When it was submerged it was taken from the then owner by the Commonwealth for permanent use, and, therefore, in perpetuity, just as the land for the bed of the canal had been taken. The land taken for that bed would have been permanently useless unless water permanently flowed through it, and, that water might so flow through it, the canal commissioners took, not temporarily, but permanently, the strip of land surrounding the lake. The three acres claimed by the appellants are part of that land and were included in the strip of which we said, in Conneaut Lake Ice Company v. Quigley, <a href="/pa/225/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="225 Pa. 605" data-case-ids="965375" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0605-01">225 Pa. 605</a>: “When the Commonwealth enlarged the lake, and raised its level, it overflowed a strip of ground all around the lake.

In charging the jury, the learned trial judge below submitted to them the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to establish such title, but subsequently, upon being informed that they could not agree upon a verdict, he instructed them that the evidence was insufficient to establish title by adverse possession, and they were directed to find for the defendant. It would serve no useful purpose to review in detail the evidence upon which the appellants rely to establish title by adverse possession. It is sufficient to say that, tested by the well-known' rules as to the proof required to establish such a title, <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>the ultimate conclusion of the learned trial judge was correct, that the appellants had failed to show such adverse, hostile, exclusive, continuoús and notorious possession as has ripened into a title in them.</p>
