    <p class="summary" id="b605-6" data-blocks='[["BL_605.6",605,[160,1249,1146,536]]]'>1. Nearly a century ago the national government constructed a turnpike road from Cumberland to the West, crossing the Monongahela river at Brownsville and the Ohio river at. Wheeling. Some years ago this road within its boundaries, by Act of Congress, was turned over to the care of the State of Pennsylvania, and was, at the time of the filing of this bill, under the supervision of the Commissioner of Highways of this State, and is perhaps the most traveled of any highway in the counties of Fayette and Washington.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b605-7" data-blocks='[["BL_605.7",605,[160,1796,1148,540]]]'>2. At the point where this road crosses the Monongahela river two towns are located, one on the east bank of the river in Fayette County known generally as Brownsville, although composed of different sections known as Bridgeport, South Brownsville and Brownsville proper; on the west bank of the river in Washington County is located the town of West Brownsville and its suburbs. These towns, each having a large population, extend up and down the river opposite each other for considerable distance, perhaps a mile or more.</p>

For a long number of years tbe only way that the citizens of West Brownsville, in Washington County, crossed the river to Brownsville, in Fayette County, was over a bridge across the river on the line of this National turnpike, and which was used to connect the termination of the Nátional pike on the east bank of the river with the termination of the National pike on the west bank of the river. After this bridge was destroyed, as hereinafter found, the citizens of Washington County and the citizens of Fayette County have had no way of crossing the river between these two towns except by a ferry operated by a company incorporated for that purpose at a point near the site of the bridge. This bridge was erected by a corporation chartered under an Act of Assembly approved March 16, 1830, P. L. 102, in the year 1836, and it operated said bridge from the time of its construction up until the fall of 1910, charging toll for all who passed over it, as was permitted by its charter.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b606-4" data-blocks='[["BL_606.4",606,[320,1406,1147,692]]]'>1. The Monongahela river is a navigable stream over which the United States Government has control for the purposes of navigation, and some time prior to 1910 the Secretary of War, under authority given him by an Act of Congress, declared this bridge to be an unreasonable obstruction of navigation upon said river and ordered that the said bridge be raised and remodeled so as not to obstruct navigation, requiring the length of the channel span to be 390 feet and its elevation so as to give a clearance of 52 feet above the level of the water of the fourth pool of the Monongahela river, and in default of such remodeling ordered the bridge to be torn down.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.5",606,[319,2117,1145,256]]]'>5.

      <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>6. There being a universal demand by the citizens both of Washington and Fayette Counties for a free bridge across the river between these two towns, proceedings were started in both counties having in view the erection of a free bridge by the two counties. The proceeding in both counties was started under the Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 551, as amended by the Act of April 23, 1903, P. L. 289, which required the Court of Quarter Sessions of each of the counties, upon proper petitions being presented, to appoint three viewers from each county, and these six viewers to act jointly and report to the Court of Quarter Sessions of the two counties. Viewers were appointed and acted and reported in favor of a free bridge over the Monongahela river, and they designated, as the site for the new bridge the site of the old bridge. The bridge company at that time had previously abandoned that site and conveyed away their title to the land they owned at the approaches of their bridge on either side of the river. The report of viewers was by the Court of Quarter Sessions of both counties laid before the next grand jury of the respective counties and by said grand juries approved. This approval was reported to the courts, and by them respectively approved nisi. The bridge company before the approval of the court became absolute, filed exceptions to the' report of the viewers, and these exceptions were argued before the two judges of Fayette County and the two judges of Washington County by agreement sitting together to hear the argument, and after argument and joint consideration of the facts and arguments, the courts of each of the counties filed opinions sustaining the exceptions of the bridge company. The thirteenth exception was in these words: “That the Act of May 6, 1897, as amended by the Act’ of May 13, 1901, and as further amended by the Act of April 25, 1907, is the only method by which a bridge can be constructed by the counties of Washington and Fayette <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>at the site of the proposed bridge as recommended by the viewers.” The decree of this court filed July 17, 1911, is in these words: “And now, July 17, 1911, the exceptions herein filed to the report of viewers came on to be heard and were argued by counsel before Umbel, P. J., and Van Swearingen, J., of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Fayette County, and McIlvaine, P. J., and Taylor, J., of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Washington County, sitting jointly; whereupon, upon due consideration, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed by this court that exception 13 herein filed be and the same is sustained, and the report of viewers under the Act of 1836 is set aside, and it is recommended that the county commissioners of the two counties proceed to rebuild the bridge in question under the Act of May 6, 1897, as amended by the Act of May 13, 1901, as further amended by the Act of April 25, 1907, as set out in opinion of Van Swearingen, J., herein filed in Fayette County Court of Quarter Sessions, to No. 2, September Term, 1910, Road Docket, in that county.”</p>

To No. 1076, February Term, 1912, in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County, a mandamus proceeding was started by a number of citizens of Washington County against the present defendants and an alternative writ of mandamus was issued against them, directing them in conjunction with the commissioners of Fayette County to proceed to erect a bridge on the site of the old bridge and to take its place, complying with the requirements of the Act of Congress. That mandamus proceeding was proceeded in and a peremptory mandamus before the filing of this bill was issued against the commissioners, and like proceedings were had with like results in Fayette County, and in pursuance to a joint action taken by the two boards they resolved to proceed to erect a bridge on the site of the old bridge, as set forth in the direct findings of fact.</p>

Opposition to the location of the bridge on the old site was first manifested at the time the viewers had the matter under consideration, and when the mandamus proceeding in this county was started a number of citizens who opposed (not the bridge but the building of it on that location) asked to intervene as defendants, and this court held that they had no right. After the court so held the plaintiffs who are also opposed to the building of the bridge on this location but desire the county commissioners to build a free joint bridge at another location more convenient for them, filed the bill in this proceeding.</p>
