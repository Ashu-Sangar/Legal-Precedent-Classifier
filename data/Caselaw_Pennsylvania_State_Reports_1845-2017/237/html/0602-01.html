Anthony heirs, being the owners of one hundred acres of land in Eldred Township, Jefferson County, Pa., November 26, 1902, leased the same to Thomas Neal, Jr., for oil and gas purposes. This lease provided that the lessee should have and hold the land for said purposes for the term of two years from its date and as much longer as oil or gas was found thereon in paying quantities. In consideration thereof the lessee was to deliver into tanks or pipe lines to the lessors’ credit the one-eighth part of all oil produced from the premises and pay one hundred and fifty dollars per year for each gas well during the time gas was sold or marketed from the premises. The lease further provided that it should “become null and void if a well is not completed on the premises within two years from the date hereof, unless the lessee thereafter pay fifty dollars per acre per year until a well is completed.” This lease was duly recorded December 11, 1902, in Jefferson county deed book No. 99, page 27.</p>

Thomas Neal, Jr., June 20,1903, assigned the lease to the Oil City Fuel Supply Company and at the same time delivered to it the original lease. The assignment was duly acknowledged, but never recorded. June 22, 1904, the lease, by a writing duly executed and acknowledged, was cancelled and annulled by mutual consent of the parties, and the lease, with the written can<a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>cellation thereof, delivered to J. E. Anthony, one of the original lessors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b634-5" data-blocks='[["BL_634.4",634,[330,465,1145,579]]]'>4. Subsequently the W. O. Anthony heirs, March 25, 1911, executed and delivered to the plaintiff, the Midland Gas Company, a lease of this same land for oil and gas purposes and at the same time delivered to it the Thomas Neal, Jr., lease, together with the assignment thereof to the Oil City Fuel Supply Company and the written cancellation by it of said lease; but informed the plaintiff company that the defendant, the Jefferson County Gas Company, claimed the land and had been paying rental thereon to some of the heirs, but had no lease for it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b634-6" data-blocks='[["BL_634.5",634,[328,1066,1146,969]]]'>5. • The plaintiff caused the writing cancelling and annulling the Thomas Neal, Jr., lease to be recorded June 6, 1911, in Jefferson County deed book No. 128, page 475, and the Anthony lease to it to be recorded June 20, 1911, in Jefferson County deed book No. 128, page 544; and on the same day that the lease was recorded it went into the actual possession of the leased premises and proceeded to drill the same for oil and gas, and on July 27, 1911, found gas in paying quantities. It thereupon started drilling a second well, when the defendants, claiming to be the owner of the Thomas Neal, Jr., lease referred to in the preceding findings, went upon the land and located a well midway between the plaintiff’s wells, which they proposed to drill. The plaintiff then filed this bill and obtained a preliminary injunction restraining the defendants from drilling said well, etc., which injunction subsequently, on hearing, was continued until the final disposition of the case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b634-7" data-blocks='[["BL_634.6",634,[329,2047,1143,373]],["BL_635.1",635,[141,376,1148,592]]]'>6. The defendants allege, but have failed to offer any evidence in support thereof, that Thomas Neal, Jr., January 5, 1903, assigned the Anthony lease dated November 26, 1902, to the defendant, the Jefferson County Gas Company, which was prior to his assignment of said lease to the Oil City Fuel Supply Company, which latter assignment was recorded November 14, 1903, in <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>Jefferson County deed book No. 102, page 312. This assignment was not acknowledged by the lessee, Thomas Neal, Jr., and it was placed on record by virtue of an affidavit made by the subscribing witness before the Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas of Jefferson County. The Prothonotary being without authority to take proof of the execution of the assignment, it was improperly recorded. There was no attempt to prove the assignment except by the production of this void record. The alleged assignment was not produced, and no witness was called who ever saw such assignment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[142,981,1149,1302]]]'>7. The defendant, the Jefferson County Gas Company, in July, 1905, called on a number of the lessees in the Thomas Neal, Jr., lease and represented to them that it was the owner of the Neal lease, and wanted to pay the rental therein stipulated for failure to drill the land. These lessors at first refused to accept the rent, stating that the Neal lease had been cancelled and surrendered; but on the representations of this defendant that some fraud, without disclosing what it was, had been practiced and that it was the owner of the lease, they were finally prevailed upon to accept the rent and thereupon to execute receipts therefor, stating that it was the rental stipulated to be paid in the lease from W. O. Anthony, et al., to Thomas Neal, Jr., bearing date November 26,1902, of one hundred acres of land in Eldred Township, Jefferson County, Pa., said lease being recorded in Jefferson County deed book No. 99, page 27, and now belonging to the said Jefferson County Gas Company. This was repeated each year as to five of the eight lessors, and by virtue thereof the defendants claim to own the five-eighths of the oil and gas in said land under its alleged assignment of the Thomas Neal, Jr., lease and the payment of this rental thereunder, thereby extending said lease to the 26th day of November, 1911.</p>

Neither Thomas Neal, Jr., nor any other person claiming to hold under the said lease to him, ever entered into the actual possession of the leased premises or operated the same or made any improvements thereon until after the plaintiff took a lease of said land and proceeded to drill a well thereon as stated in the fifth finding of fact.</p>

To decide otherwise would be to hold that a party could take advantage of his own fraud to acquire the title of another to real estate by estoppel. Under these circumstances there is no contract to rescind and no obligation resting upon the party thus imposed upon to refund the rental received before controverting the erroneous claims of the party who paid it.</p>
