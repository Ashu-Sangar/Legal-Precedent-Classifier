    <p id="b99-8" data-blocks='[["BL_99.14",99,[138,1266,1154,692]]]'>The defendant was admittedly indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $30,990.47, the balance due on a contract for the erection of a school building. The only reason for withholding payment was that a notice of a lien in conformity with the provisions of the Act’of May 6, 1909, P. L. 441, had been served upon its treasurer by a sub-contractor under the plaintiff. The case, turned on the effect of this notice. The learned referee reported that the notice was inoperative, and without legal effect because the Act of May 6,1909, under which it was given, is unconstitutional. His report was confirmed by the court and judgment was entered in accordance therewith.</p>
