It is admitted that Walter Holroyd Todd died in the lifetime of his grandmother, leaving one child, Anne Wilson Todd, a minor, to survive him. The auditor awarded to the trustee of the minor child, the sum of $837 as interest on the legacy of $25;000 given as' above, from the dáte of the death of testatrix, to May 6,1910, when it was paid by the excutors to the trustee. To this award of interest the Sarah A. Todd Memorial Home, the residuary legatee, excepted; but the court below dismissed the exception and confirmed thé report.</p>

Mr. Chief Justice Gibson said, in Gill’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/2/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Pa. 221" data-case-ids="951150" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0221-01">2 Pa. 221</a> (p. 222) : “The case of a destitute child, which alone is excepted out of the rule that, in the absence of specific intention to the contrary, á legacy does not bear interest, before it is payable, rests on the natural obligation of a father to maintain the helpless being he has contributed to bring into the world, till it can maintain itself; and interest is allowed on a legacy to it, not as interest, but as maintenance.” In Leech’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/44/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="44 Pa. 140" data-case-ids="484264" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0140-01">44 Pa. 140</a>, Mr. Chief Justice Lowkie said (p. 142) : “It is only by equity that any (interest) can be allowed, and it allows none on such a legacy except where the relation of the legatee to the testator, in connection with circumstances of destitution and dependence of the legatee seems to demand it, and thus to support the supposition that it was intended.” In 2 Williams on Executors (7th Am. Ed. 1895) § 1287, it is said: “A further exception to the rule exists in the case of a legacy given to a child by a parent, or one in loco parentis, whether by way of- portion or not j in which instance the court will give interest from the death, to create a provision for its maintenance.” At Section 1201 it is also said: “The proper definition of a person in loco parentis to a child is,- á person who means to put himself in the situation of the lawful father of the child, with reference to the father’s office and duty of making a provision for the child...; Mothers, greatuncles, uncles, grandfathers .or grandmothers, or putative fathers are not to be considered in loco parentunq unless they have intended to assume the office and duty of a parent.”</blockquote>
