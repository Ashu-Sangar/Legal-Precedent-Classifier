In its report to the Auditor General for that year of capital stock it set forth that its total property and assets amounted to $3,991,658.59.

The bonds were purchased with cash derived from the sale of manufactured products, and were held as a fund to be used to meet the growing necessities of the defendant’s manufacturing business.

Its capital stock is in the State' to tbe extent that its property which represents its capital stock is in tbe State. So much of its capital stock is taxable in tbe State as is represented by its property taxable in tbe State. Tbe real question therefore before us is whether tbe property sought to be taxed as representing tbe capital stock is in tbe State for the purposes of taxation within tbe contemplation of law. For years the doctrine has “been sustained by tbe courts of this State that the situs of intangible personal property for taxation, such as bonds, mortgages and other evidences of indebtedness, is tbe domicile of tbe owner. It was so held in Commonwealth v. Standard Oil Company, <a href="/pa/101/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="101 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="500862" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0119-01">101 Pa. 119</a>, and even as late as in Commonwealth v.

And in the Standard Oil case it was <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>further held, that although the revenue statute imposed a tax on the capital stock of a corporation doing business in this State, it did not mean that the whole capital stock was taxable in the State, but only so much thereof as was within the taxing jurisdiction of the State, so that shares of stock in corporations in the State owned by the defendant were not taxable here, but in the State of Ohio, its domicile.

It is true that in other jurisdictions the doctrine has been modified and limited by express statute, and the power of the states, to so legislate, as suggested by the learned counsel for the Commonwealth, has been sustained: New Orleans v. Stempel, <a href="/us/175/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="175 U.S. 309" data-case-ids="1239494" data-case-paths="/us/175/0309-01">175 U. S. 309</a> (20 Sup. Ct.

S. 346</a>, but it has not been pointed out to us, nor have we been able to find, that the doctrine has been modified or limited in this State by any statutory provision. It would seem that if a change or modification was intended to be made, the legislature would have clearly' indicated it. In the absence of any such indication, we must construe the revenue statutes in the light of the doctrine that intangible personal property follows the person of the owner. We are constrained to conclude, therefore, that it was not the intention of the legislature to tax through its capital stock such property of a cor<a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>poration as was not under the decisions of the State courts within the taxing jurisdiction of the State. Accordingly it results that the cash in bank and the bonds in bank for safe keeping in this State are not within the jurisdiction of the State for purposes of taxation, although physically present here, and that being so, that the capital stock represented by them is not in the State and subject to the tax imposed on the capital stock of corporations.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[150,870,1153,1355]]]'>Besides what we have said, it appears that the cash in bank is used in connection with the defendant’s business. It represents capital stock employed in carrying on the business, and is incident and appurtenant thereto. It is impossible to conceive of carrying on a business without a bank account. Of course the amount of cash in bank is an important consideration when the question of exemption is claimed. If the amount is no more than is reasonably necessary, and the deposit is strictly incident to and employed in the business, it is entitled to the same exemption allowed other property actually employed. We do not mean to say that all cash in bank, to any amount, would be exempt, but so much as is essential to and actually used in the business. There is no suggestion by the Commonwealth that the sum of $50,000 in the present case is in excess of the business needs of the defendant. However, the principal question which is here involved is not one of exemption, but one of express or affirmative taxation. The domicile of the defendant is the State of New Jersey, the state of its incorporation or its origin: Bank of Augusta v.
