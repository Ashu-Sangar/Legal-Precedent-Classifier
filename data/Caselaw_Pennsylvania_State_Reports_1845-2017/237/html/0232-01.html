Dill, contractors, evidently contemplating the securing of a contract with the S. R. Moss Cigar Company, Incorporated, a short time prior to May 23,1907, met John F. Herr, the plaintiff, and secured from him prices for lumber to be used in a building which was about to be erected, known as the Moss building. On May 23, 1907, the Dills submitted to the Moss Company a proposition in writing for the erection of this building, and the offer thus made was marked “accepted.” Contained in this offer, however, were the words: “We sign the within agreement, guaranteeing to execute a legal contract as soon as same can be properly drawn up, and herewith agree to furnish bond in the sum of sixty-nine thousand ($69,-000.00) dollars. Said bond to be approved by you and your architect and engineer.” On May 23,1907, the Dill Brothers had a conversation with Herr, in which they instructed him to furnish the lumber for the Moss build<a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>ing, to be delivered from time to time, on verbal orders, at the prices which had been submitted to them by Herr prior to May 23, 1907. They gave Herr the approximate quantities to be furnished, but, at that time, gave no definite orders as to classes of lumber, or dimensions, or lengths. On June 1, 1907, a regular contract was signed by the Dills and the S. R. Moss Cigar Company, Incorporated, for the construction of this building; and, on the same day, a paper was executed and delivered to the S. R. Moss Cigar Company, in which was the following stipulation: “Now, for a valuable consideration, the said parties of the first part agree that no lien or claim of mechanics or materialmen or of any other nature whatsoever, shall be filed by any one whatsoever, including the contractor himself, the parties of the first part hereto, or any sub-contractor or materialmen, against the building herein mentioned and contracted to be erected on the premises above described.” Between June 7, 1907, and December 26, 1907, inclusive, materials were furnished by Herr to the Dill Brothers for use in the Moss building, amounting to $1,877.21, and all of these items make up the amount in the lien filed. Subsequently notice was given by Herr that he intended to file a lien, and, on the 11th day of May, 1908, a lien was duly filed against the said building, and the present scire facias was issued to collect it. It was also found that, on May 31, 1907, work was being done at the foundations of the building, but that this work was done by the S. R. Moss Cigar Company on its own account, and it was not included in the Dill contract for the erection of the building. Can the plaintiff, under this state of facts, maintain his lien?</p>

L. 431, and its amendment of April 24, ‘1903, P. L. 297, it is declared that “the right to file a claim may be waived by agreement between the claimant and the party with whom he contracts, or by any conduct which operates <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>to equitably estop the claimant. If the legal effect of the contract between the owner and the contractor is, that no claim shall be filed by any one, such provision shall be binding; but the only admissible evidence thereof, as against a sub-contractor, shall be proof of actual notice thereof to him, before any labor or materials furnished by <em>him; </em>or proof that a duly written and signed contract to that effect has been filed in the office of the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas of the county or counties where the structure or other improvement is situate, prior to the commencement of the work upon the ground, or within ten days after the execution of the principal contract, or not less than ten days prior to the contract with the claimant.”' It has been found by the special verdict that the paper which is claimed to have been a waiver of the right to file liens against this building was filed in the prothonotary’s office on Monday, June 3, 1907, and it has already been decided by the Supreme Court, in Burger v. Moss Cigar Co., <a href="/pa/225/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="225 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="965276" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0400-01">225 Pa. 400</a>, that this agreement was a valid contract by which every person, entitled by law to file a mechanic’s lien was prohibited from so doing.

R. Moss Cigar Company for its'elf and they were not included within the Dill contract. While the act of assembly provides that there shall be “proof that a duly written and signed contract to that effect has been filed in the office of the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas of the county or counties where the structure or other improvement is situate, prior to the commencement of the work upon the ground, or within ten days after the execution of the principal contract, or not less than ten days prior to the contract with the claimant,” (this is evidently intended to mean the work on the ground <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>under the contract by virtue of which the sub-contract- or claims, and it certainly cannot mean work done independently of that contract by the owners for themselves).— (1). If this interpretation of the act of assembly is correct, then no work was done in or about the construction of this building before the agreement or waiver was placed upon the record. But, in any event, the agreement waiving the right to file liens was filed in the prothonotary’s office of this county Within ten days after the execution of the principal contract and not less then ten days prior to the contract with the claimant. The original proposition accepted by the Moss Company was dated May 23,1907. The agreement of waiver of liens was filed in the prothonotary’s office on Monday, June 3, 1907. The ten days mentioned in the act of assembly would have expired on Sunday, June 2, 1907. But the Act of June 20, 1883, P. L. 136, enacts: “That where by any existing law or rule of court, or by any law or rule of court that may hereafter be enacted and made, the performance or doing of any act, duty, matter, payment, or thing, shall be ordered and directed, and where any court shall, by special or other order, direct the performance or doing of any act, matter, payment, sentence or decree, and the period of time or duration for the performance or doing thereof shall be prescribed or fixed, such time in all cases shall be so computed as to exclude the first, and include the last days of any such prescribed or fixed period, or duration of time; provided, that whenever the last day of any such period shall fall on Sunday, or on any day made' a legal holiday by the laws of this Commonwealth, or of the United States, such day shall be omitted from the computation: And provided, that this act shall not apply to the payment of negotiable paper.” Therefore, as it is found that the agreement was filed on Monday, June 3, 1907, (and if it is concluded that the acceptance of the Dill proposition constitutes the contract as made May 23, 1907, then that <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>day was within the ten days allowed by the act of assembly for the filing of the same, and it was a bar to the recovery of any claims by sub-contractors under the Dill contract).— (2). If it is conceded (and it must be, for it has been so found by the jury) that the contract, though dated May 23, 1907, was executed on June 1,1907, and that this was the real contract between the parties, then there can be no question in this regard, because the agreement of waiver was filed the second day thereafter.</p>

R. Moss Cigar Company. The notice was to the effect that the plaintiff claimed a lien against the building erected “by H. G-. &amp; L. J. Dill, for material and lumber furnished by me to the said H.

Dill, and used by them in the construction of your said building the said lumber being furnished upon their verbal order, as shown by the sworn statement attached hereto.” The affidavit stated that “H.

Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, <a href="/pa-super/41/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="41 Pa. Super. 224" data-case-ids="884180" data-case-paths="/pa-super/41/0224-01">41 Pa.

Hanson, contractor, to whom the above material was sold, or by orders by his foreman.” Under this notice, a rule to strike off the mechanic’s lien was made absolute, and Henderson, J., delivering the opinion of the court, said: “It is expressly required by this statute that the notice contain a SAVorn statement ‘setting forth the contract’ and the amount alleged to be still due ‘and how made up.’ This provision is obligatory on him who would claim the benefits of the statute. Compliance with that which is specifically directed is necessary to secure a lien. Substantial conformity will not answer as to that.” He later added: “The <em>notice </em>given in this case does not set forth the contract within the meaning of the statute, and the lien Avas, therefore, properly stricken from the record.” In Miller v. Fitz, <a href="/pa-super/41/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="41 Pa. Super. 582" data-case-ids="884173" data-case-paths="/pa-super/41/0582-01">41 Pa.
