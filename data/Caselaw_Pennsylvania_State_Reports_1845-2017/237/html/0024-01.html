Her case rested entirely on the presumption of marriage arising from cohabitation and reputation. The voluminous testimony may be summarized by the statement that the decedent was a man of dissipated habits, who frequently went on drinking sprees, that lasted for weeks, and at times for months. During these periods he lived in various parts of the city and avoided meeting the members of his family. He was supported by a weekly allowance from his father’s estate, and all his life he had a home at the house of his mother, where a room was set apart for him. To this home he went shortly before his death and from'it he was buried.</p>

She had been once convicted and sentenced in Philadelphia for keeping a bawdy house. She first met the decedent on his visit to a house of ill-fame that she conducted, and they subsequently lived together at times in houses where she conducted the business of let<a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>ting apartments. While living together, she' was known to persons who furnished supplies to the house and to the servants as Mrs. Patterson, and to them and to some others the decedent spoke of her and introduced her as his wife. When they stopped at hotels in other cities, they Were registered as man and wife. Some two years before his death he made a will in which he mentioned her as “my intended wife.” But during the whole of this time he was known to his kindred and friends as a single man, and she as his mistress. In their relations to each other while occupying rooms in houses rented or owned by her, there was nothing to indicate that they regarded their cohabitation as matrimonial. During this time she purchased and sold real estate in her maiden name,' describing herself as a single woman, kept her bank account in the name of the man from whom she was divorced and loaned money to the decedent and receipted for collateral securities received from him to secure the loan, in her maiden name.</p>
