T., 1901, by George Scbleicber et al., from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., JulyT., 1900, No. 252, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in the Estate of George Schleicher, Deceased.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that the testator, by the residuary clause of his will, bequeathed as follows :\n\u201c Item. A full one third part of all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, I give, devise and bequeath to my executors hereinafter named, or the survivor to be by them or him paid over in such amounts and to such uses as they may in their best judgments determine, to such German Charitable Institutions and German Societies in the City of Philadelphia as they may in their discretion select, said discretion to be by said executors, or the survivor, exercised without any right, claim, dictation or control of any other person or power whatsoever, I having full confidence both in their judgment and that they will faithfully carry out my wishes in regard to the proper disposition of said fund.\u201d\nThe executors, by an instrument in writing, as follows, indicated the German charitable institutions or societies which in their discretion should be the beneficiaries under the above elatise of the testator\u2019s will:\n\u201c To the Honorable, the Judges of the Orphans\u2019 Court for the City and County of Philadelphia.\n\u201cWe, the undersigned, the executors of the last Will and Testament of George Schleicher, deceased, late of the City and County of Philadelphia, by virtue of the power conferred upon us by the said last Will and Testament, and in exercise of the discretion therein given us, have selected, and by these presents do select the following German Charitable Institutions and German Societies (in the City of Philadelphia, to and among whom the full one third part of all the rest, residue and remainder of the estate of the said George Schleicher, deceased, shall be paid and divided, as follows, to wit:\n\u201c German Hospital of the City of Philadelphia; the sum of five thousand dollars, for the endowment of a Free Bed to be called the \u2018 George Schleicher Free Bed.\u2019\n\u201c Samaritan Shelter, of' the City of Philadelphia, the sum of fifteen hundred dollars.\n\u201c The Orphans\u2019 Home and Asylum for the Aged and Infirm of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, located at Germantown, Philadelphia, for the benefit of the Orphans\u2019 Department of the said Institution, the sum of fifteen hundred dollars.\n\u201cDeutches Protestantisch.es Altenheim, Lawndale, Philadelphia, the sum of fifteen hundred dollars.\n\u201c German Society of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia, the remainder of said one third part of the residuary estate of said George Schleicher, deceased, to and for such uses as the executors shall designate.\n\u201c In witness whereof, we have set our hands and seals at Philadelphia this seventh day of June A. D. 1901.\n\u201c Carl F. Lauber. [Seal]\n\u201c Henry Berges.\u201d [Seal]\nIt was contended that the above provision of the testator\u2019s will is invalid, and that as to the property included therein the testator died intestate, because the terms of this bequest manifest an intention to create a trust, and that the trust is not a charitable one in the legal sense, and is void for uncertainty and indefiniteness, etc.\nThe auditing judge sustained the action of the executors in awarding the one-third part of the estate to the societies named. Exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed, Ashman, J., filing the following opinion:\nWe shall not, perhaps, subject the testator\u2019s language to any violent strain, if we shall hold that he vested his executors with a power which, inasmuch as its exercise was subject to no review whatever, amounted, as in Beck\u2019s Appeal, 116 Pa. 547, to an absolute gift of the subject-matter. If it be objected that the power was indefinite and incapable of enforcement by any of its possible objects, the answer is, that the testator so intended it; he reposed in his executors a discretion \u201c to be exercised without any right, claim, dictation, or control of any other person or power whatsoever,\u201d and he assigned as the reason for this latitude of action, his \u201c full confidence in their judgment,\u201d and his belief \u201c that they will faithfully carry out his wishes in regard to the disposition of the fund.\u201d With this sweeping delegation of authority, founded wholly upon his personal confidence in the donees, the testator\u2019s reference to certain classes of objects was simply an expression of desire that they would carry out what he declared were his wishes. A different question is presented if the words to which we have alluded were not precatory, and if a trust was created. Indefiniteness in a trust for charitable uses will not vitiate the gift, and the sole point to be here settled is whether the trust, assuming it to be a trust, can be perverted, in whole or in part, to other objects than charities. The testator\u2019s primary intention was to aid German charities; his words were \u201c to such German Charitable Institutions and German Societies in the City of Philadelphia as they may select.\u201d It is very clear that if he had used the phrase \u201c German Charitable Institutions and Societies,\u201d the word \u201c charitable \u201d would have qualified both classes of beneficiaries. Is its effect destroyed because the testator has chosen to describe both classes as German? The answer to this inquiry need not be rested upon the rule that the court will solve, when practicable, in favor of a charity, a seeming ambiguity in the testator\u2019s language. That the societies were to be charitable as truly as the institutions seems to be a grammatical necessity. The matter is indeed less open to doubt than the gift in Pickering v. Shotwell, 10 Pa. 23; there the trust was of a residue \u201c to be applied under the direction of the monthly meeting of friends, as a fund for the distribution of good books among poor people in the back part of Pennsylvania, or to the support of an institution or free school in or near Philadelphia.\u201d It was taken for granted that the institution intended was to be charitable in character, and the trust was upheld. Exceptions dismissed.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nFrank P. Prichard, with him Thomas S. Gates, Jay Gates and Gustavus Remak, Jr., for appellants.\nG. E.
