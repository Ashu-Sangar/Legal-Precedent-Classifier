T., 1901, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Washington Co., Nov. T., 1900, No. 101, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Pennsylvania Savings Fund and Loan Association v. W. M. George & Co., Limited.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nEjectment for a tract of land in Robinson township. Before Mcilvaine, J.\nThe trial judge stated the facts to be as follows:\nOn May 25,1894, judgment was entered against Mrs. W. A. Newton, and in favor of W. M. George & Company, Limited, for $466.77, and the proper entry was made by the prothonotary on the D. S. B. docket and also on the judgment index. Both of these entries were made on May 25, 1894, and showed a judgment against Mrs. W. A. Newton, and not Mrs. Nancy A. Newton, nor Mrs. N. A. Newton.\nOn January 10, 1896, the Pennsylvania Savings Fund and Loan Association, the plaintiff in this case, caused to be entered of record in the recorder\u2019s office of' the county a mortgage, made and duly acknowledged on December 20,1895, by Nancy A. Newton and her husband William Newton, wherein the land described in the writ in this case was conveyed to it to secure the payment of the sum of $1,100. To No. 141 of May term, 1899, of this court judgment was obtained by the said Pennsylvania Savings Fund and Loan Association against Nancy A. Newton and William Newton for $1,080.60, upon a scire facias duly issued on said mortgage, and on July 6, 1899, the plaintiff in this judgment issued a writ of levari facias thereon and upon that writ the sheriff, in due course, sold and conveyed the land described in the writ to the plaintiff in this suit, the deed being acknowledged in open court on August 31,1899.\nOn January 20,1896, ten days after the association\u2019s mortgage had been recorded, the prothonotary, at the request of some one acting for Wm. M. George & Company, Limited, erased on the D. S. B. docket, whereupon judgment had been entered against Mrs. W. A. Newton, the letter \u201c W.\u201d and substituted the letter \u201c N., \u2019\u2019and on the same day entered on the judgment index in favor of Wm. M. George & Company, Limited, another judgment against Mrs. N. A. Newton.\nTo No. 164, May term, 1898, W. M. George & Company, Limited, caused a writ of scire facias to issue against Mrs. N. A. Newton, alias Mrs. W. A. Newton, sur judgment entered to No. 62, August term, 1894, which was duly prosecuted, and on March 25,1898, judgment was, on motion of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, entered for want of an appearance and affidavit of defense. The plaintiff in this judgment caused a writ of fieri facias to be issued upon this judgment and upon that writ the property was sold and conveyed by the sheriff to W. M. George & Company, Limited, the defendants in this case, the sheriff\u2019s deed being acknowledged in open court, May-10,1899, three months or more before the plaintiff obtained its deed. The person who executed the mortgage to the Pennsylvania Savings Fund and Loan Association, and who executed the note upon which judgment was entered to No. 62, August term, 1894, was one and the same, and her true name was Mrs. Nancy A. Newton, and not Mrs. W. A. Newton. There were no liens against Mrs. Nancy A. Newton except the mortgage of the plaintiff and the judgment of the defendant.\nThe court gave binding instructions for plaintiff.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in giving binding instructions for plaintiff,\nDavid Sterrett, for appellants.\nJ. Q. Ewing and Harvey Henderson, for appellee, were not heard. - \u2022\nNovember 8, 1901:"
