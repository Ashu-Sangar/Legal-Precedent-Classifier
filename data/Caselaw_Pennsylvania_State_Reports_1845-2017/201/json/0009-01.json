Berlin, in which an opinion has just been filed. The conclusion therein reached* that the transaction involved, did not upon its facts, constitute such a \u201c doing of business \u201d as falls within the prohibition of the act of April 22, 1874, makes any extended discussion unnecessary in this case.\nFor the reasons therein stated, the judgment of the Superior Court in this case is reversed, and it is ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff, in the sum of $1,210.08, with interest from March 28, 1899, and costs.",
