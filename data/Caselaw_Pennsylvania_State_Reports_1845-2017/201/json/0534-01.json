L. 158.\nWhere the principal contactor in a building operation has sublet a portion of the contract to a partnership consisting of two persons, and the subcontractors have given a bond with surety to a trust company which has insured the completion of the operation without liens, and after the death of one of the subcontractors suit is brought upon such bond, the contractor may testify as to conversations with the dead partner in the presence of the other partner absent at the trial.\nContract\u2014Building contract\u2014Principal and surety.\nWhere a trust company has insured the completion of a building operation without liens, and takes a bond with surety from subcontractors, and the subcontractors fail to do their work, and their surety, although notified does not finish the work, and the trust company thereupon enters into a contract with the principal contractor to finish the work, and takes from him a bond for its completion, the surety of the subcontractors is not relieved from liability to the trust company for loss because the latter took the bond from the principal contractor.\nArgued Jan. 13, 1902.\nAppeal, No. 248, Jan. T., 1901, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., Dec. T., 1899, No. 1073, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Equitable Trust Company v. H. W. Bowen and Alfonso F. Alfieri, and the Continental Title & Trust Company.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit upon a bond. Before Beitler, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that Richard Humphreys was the principal contractor in a building operation. Humphreys entered into a contract with H. W. Bowen and Alfonso F. Alfieri by which the latter agreed to furnish certain material and do certain work upon the buildings.\nThe contract signed by Humphreys and Bowen and Alfieri was upon a printed form or blank, which contained the printed recital that Humphreys was about to erect fifty houses, \u201c According to certain plans, drawings, designs and specifications which are made a part of this contract and have been examined by the said party of the second part, signed by the parties hereto and deposited with the Equitable Trust Company insuring this operation.\u201d\nThere was evidence that the parties had waived the stipulation as to signing the plans and specifications.\nThe Equitable Trust Company insured the owners, the completion of the building operation without liens. To protect itself the Equitable Trust Company took a bond from Bowen and Alfieri with the Continental Title & Trust Company as surety for the performance of Bowen and Alfieri\u2019s contract with Humphreys. This bond did not refer in any way to the signed plans and specifications. Bowen and Alfieri did not complete the work for which they had contracted, and the Continental Title & Trust Company, although notified, did not complete the work. The Equitable Trust Company thereupon entered into a contract with Humphreys, the principal contractor to do the work and took from him a bond to secure its completion. The transaction resulted in a loss to the Equitable Trust Company.\nThe Continental Trust Company claimed that it was discharged by reason of the failure to sign the plans and specifications deposited with the Equitable Trust Company, and also by the fact that the Equitable Trust Company had taken from Humphreys a bond conditioned for the completion of the work for which Bowen and Alfieri had contracted.\nThe court permitted under objection and exception, Humphreys to testify to the conversation which he had had with Bowen before the latter\u2019s death in the presence of Alfieri who was absent at the trial.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $4,854.15. Defendants appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1) in permitting Humphreys to testify as to conversations with Bowen, and (18) in refusing binding instructions for defendant.\nJohn G. Johnson, with him J. W. Bayard, J. \"Washington Logue and Alex. Simpson, Jr., for appellant.\nJohn O. Bell, with him James Fitzpatrick and Anthony A. Hirst, for appellee.\nFebruary 24, 1902:"
