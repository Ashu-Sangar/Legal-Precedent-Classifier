L. Newmyer at the time of his death. He left a widow and two children. After his death suit was brought against his administrators, and judgment was obtained against them, and execution was duly issued under which the sheriff levied upon and sold the property to E. B. McCormick, the plaintiff. A sheriff’s deed was duly executed to him therefor. The widow was not made defendant as widow, although she was defendant as one of the administrators of her husband’s estate. The children were not made parties, and no notice of the proceedings was given to them. On December 18, 1897, E. B. McCormick, the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale, brought this action in ejectment against Lizzie A. Skelly, formerly Lizzie A Newmyer, (the widow having remarried) and Edward Mahoney, to recover possession of the premises described in his deed from the sheriff. The defendants pleaded “ not guilty.” Upon the trial the plaintiff showed title in J. L. Newmyer and put in evidence the record <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>of the judgments and executions against the administrators of Newmyer, and the deed from the sheriff. He also showed the death of J. L. Newmyer and the possession of the defendants. It appeared from cross-examination of plaintiff’s witnesses, that Newmyer left two minor children, who lived upon the premises in controversy at the time of his death, and who were living at the time of the trial of the fejectment suit.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[303,738,1186,758]]]'>The defendants offered no evidence and requested the court to give binding instructions in their favor. This the learned trial judge declined to do, but instructed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the following question of law reserved: “ It appearing that in addition to the widow of James Newmyer, who is at present defendant, that he also left surviving him two children, who were not parties to the action against the estate of James Newmyer, deceased, and who have not been served with any writ of scire facias issued from said judgment after its recovery and before the sheriff’s sale at vend. ex. 100 August term, 1897. If the court be of opinion that by reason of this fact no title passed to the purchaser at such sale, then judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto is to be entered; otherwise judgment is to be entered on the verdict.”</p>

This action and the refusal to give binding instructions for the defendants are assigned for error. The question to be decided is whether the title to the premises, which are the'subject of ejectment passed by. the sheriff’s sale. The determination of this question depends upon the regularity of the proceedings under which the sale toot place. It is asserted by appellants that no title passed by the sale because the widow and heirs of J. L. Newmyer were not made parties to the suits in which the judgments were obtained, as is required under section 84 of the act of February 24, 1834, where it is intended to charge decedent’s real estate with the payment of his debts. The act in question has been thoroughly construed, and its provisions applied many times.</p>

See Kunselman v.

Newmyer left heirs or devisees the title of the plaintiff derived through the sheriff’s sale upon a judgment to which they were not parties, is not good and he cannot recover in this suit. It is not a question of pleading in this case, it is a question of title; the heirs cannot be made parties here. The question of law reserved does' not of course include all of the facts of the case. Without reference to the record and the other evidence, the point does not disclose such facts as would justify a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, even on his own theory of the case. No importance can therefore be given to the fact that the reservation refers to the children simply as such, and not as heirs. If the fact that they are heirs, appears from other evidence in the case it is sufficient. The question as to who are heirs is a question of law, and not of fact. The evidence shows and the reserved point states that Newmyer left two children, who occupied the premises in dispute, together with their mother, and that these children are still living. Were they heirs or devisees within the meaning of the act of 1834? If so the failure to give notice to them is fatal to the plaintiff’s case. The court below holds that there is no evidence that Newmyer died intestate and none that the children are his heirs; but this finding is in the face of the fact that the original judgment was obtained against the administrators of Newmyer. This record was in evidence and was an essential part of the plaintiff’s proof. The finding of the fact of intestacy is neces<a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>sarily involved in the grant of general letters of administration. While the exact point here involved does not seem to have been decided, there are many analogous cases involving the same principle. There is a long line of cases holding that the grant of letters testamentary is prima facie evidence of the validity of the will.</p>

Thomson, <a href="/pa/60/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="60 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1014404" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0177-01">60 Pa. 177</a>, was cited to sustain the contention of the plaintiff, but it was there held that a good title vested in the purchaser at sheriff’s sale because under the will of decedent there was a conversion of the real estate and it passed to the widow and devisees as personalty. <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>They had therefore no interest in it as real estate, and notice to the executors was sufficient.</p>

Grim, <a href="/pa/26/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="26 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="977343" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0095-01">26 Pa. 95</a>, as authority for the proposition that where a person conveys land in fraud of his creditors and dies, it is not necessary that his heirs should be made parties to a judgment against his personal representatives, in order to charge the land. In the present case there was no evidence that the defendant, Newmyer, had conveyed his land in fraud of his creditors. Something of the kind was intimated in the argument, but no evidence appears to support it. We can see no good reason in this case for refusing to apply the provisions of the act of 1884.</p>
