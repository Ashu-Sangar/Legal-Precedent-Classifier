If it be objected <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>that the power was indefinite and incapable of enforcement by any of its possible objects, the answer is, that the testator so intended it; he reposed in his executors a discretion “ to be exercised without any right, claim, dictation, or control of any other person or power whatsoever,” and he assigned as the reason for this latitude of action, his “ full confidence in their judgment,” and his belief “ that they will faithfully carry out his wishes in regard to the disposition of the fund.” With this sweeping delegation of authority, founded wholly upon his personal confidence in the donees, the testator’s reference to certain classes of objects was simply an expression of desire that they would carry out what he declared were his wishes. A different question is presented if the words to which we have alluded were not precatory, and if a trust was created. Indefiniteness in a trust for charitable uses will not vitiate the gift, and the sole point to be here settled is whether the trust, assuming it to be a trust, can be perverted, in whole or in part, to other objects than charities. The testator’s primary intention was to aid German charities; his words were “ to such German Charitable Institutions and German Societies in the City of Philadelphia as they may select.” It is very clear that if he had used the phrase “ German Charitable Institutions and Societies,” the word “ charitable ” would have qualified both classes of beneficiaries. Is its effect destroyed because the testator has chosen to describe both classes as German? The answer to this inquiry need not be rested upon the rule that the court will solve, when practicable, in favor of a charity, a seeming ambiguity in the testator’s language. That the societies were to be charitable as truly as the institutions seems to be a grammatical necessity. The matter is indeed less open to doubt than the gift in Pickering v. Shotwell, <a href="/pa/10/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="962665" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0023-01">10 Pa. 23</a>; there the trust was of a residue “ to be applied under the direction of the monthly meeting of friends, as a fund for the distribution of good books among poor people in the back part of Pennsylvania, or to the support of an institution or free school in or near Philadelphia.” It was taken for granted that the institution intended was to be charitable in character, and the trust was upheld. Exceptions dismissed.</p>
