Then, applying the rule in this case that the first duty of the court is to ascertain what was the intention, and then having done that, to say whether there are words to carry that intention into effect, I am satisfied the intention was to dispose of all her property, and I am of opinion both upon principle and authority-that the words are sufficient for the purpose.</p>

R. 19 Ch. Div. 432, where testator owning a one-third interest in a partnership business at the date of executing his will bequeathed it in trust for his wife. He subsequently acquired the interests of his brothers in the business and at the time of his death was the sole owner. It was held that the wife was entitled to the whole income. Vice Chancellor Bacon said: “ The court leans against intestacy in all cases, not from compassion, but as a fixed principle of law. The law is opposed to intestacy; and the Wills Act proceeds exactly upon this principle, though not recognizing it in terms. ... In this case the testator having a one-third share at the time when he made his will in 1857, by a series óf accidents, which I need not describe, became entitled to the entirety. One of the results is that by the purchase of the other shares the testator’s share has become increased. . . . Then inasmuch as he has said: ‘ I, being a manufacturer in partnership give all my interest in the partnership to my wife, including one third of the capital, one third of the profits, one third of the buildings and stock in trade and so on,’ enumerating them particularly, because he afterward becomes possessed of a larger interest than one third, it is said that the interest which passed by his will is confined to that one third which he had in the year 1857, and is not to comprehend the interest which he had in 1881 when he died. In my opinion that would be a very violent construction. It is clear that it would disappoint the intention -of the testator. ... In my opinion the twenty-third section of the Wills Act has direct application, and I hold that the acquisition of a larger interest does not affect in the slightest degree the disposition which the testator made of all the interest which he had in the houses, chattels and other property in the copartnership business, although the partnership <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>had ceased to exist, and he had become the sole owner of the property.”</p>

Sir John Romilly, master of rolls, said: “ The question is whether this copyhold garden passed under the devise, and I am of opinion that it did.” After quoting the words of the section of the Wills Act, he added: “ The burden of proof lies, therefore, to show that it did not pass, and this from the will itself.
