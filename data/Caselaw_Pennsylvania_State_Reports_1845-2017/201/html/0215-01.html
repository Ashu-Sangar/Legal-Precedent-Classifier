As Lucinda Woods was living at the time of the filing of the bill it was not then necessary to decide whether she had any greater estate, but that question is now presented for determination, and is the only question before us.</p>

The plaintiffs’ claim is, that the will having given to Lucinda Woods a life estate with remainder to her issue, with a devise over upon failure of issue, the word “ issue ” is to be deemed a word of inheritance, and that the effect of the will is to give her an estate tail, under the rule in Shelley’s Case, which becomes a fee under the statute. It has been frequently held that prima facie the word “ issue ” in a will is equivalent to “heirs of the body,” but that if anything appears in <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>the will to show that the word was intended to have a less extended meaning, and to apply to children or to descendants of a particular class, or at a particular time, it is to be deemed a word of purchase and not of limitation, in order to carry out the intention of the testator: O’Rourke v. Sherwin, <a href="/pa/156/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="156 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="844893" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0285-01">156 Pa. 285</a>, and cases there cited.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[122,679,1179,811]]]'>The provisions of the will relied upon by the defendant as showing the word “ issue ” not to be used in the sense of “ heirs of the body ” are those which direct that at the death of Lucinda Woods the land shall go to her surviving issue, and that the same shall go to them, share and share alike. It seems to us there can be no doubt that the “ surviving issue ” of Lucinda Woods, referred to in the second of the foregoing paragraphs, means issue of Lucinda Woods living at her death. It would seem, therefore, that the word “ issue ” in this will must mean the descendants of Lucinda Woods at a particular time—that is, at the time of her death. This, together with the direction for distribution in equal shares among such descendants, would seem, under the cases, to be sufficient to indicate that the word “ issue ” in the second of the foregoing paragraphs is not a word of limitation but of purchase: Robins v.

No doubt a direction, that at the decease of Lucinda Woods failing issue, standing by itself would indicate indefinite failure of issue, but it is manifest that the words “ failing issue ” in that paragraph mean nothing more than if the words used were “failing issue as aforesaid.” We fail to see anything in the testator’s use of the word “ inherit ” in the second paragraph, which would indicate an intention on his part to use the word “ issue ” as equivalent to “ heirs of the body.” The testator does not use technical terms correctly, and no doubt used the words “be inherited by” as the equivalent of “go to ” or “be received by.” The undoubted intention of the testator was to give Lucinda Woods only a life estate, and the interpretation of the will as claimed by her would defeat that intention, as is often the result of the application of the rule in Shelley’s Case to wills unskillfully drawn—a result which the courts have always been anxious to avoid whenever possible, having “ seized with avidity on any circumstance, however trivial, <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>demoting an intention to fix the contingency at the time of the death,” thereby avoiding the application of that rule: Miller’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20Pa.%20565" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="145 Pa. 565">145 Pa. 565</a>.</p>

The conclusión arrived at by the learned judge of the court below in his clear and concise opinion plainly and distinctly holds that Lucinda Hill has only a life estate in the land in question. An examination of the cases cited show numerous decisions of this court which sustain the opinion referred to, and satisfy us that no error was committed by the court below.</p>
