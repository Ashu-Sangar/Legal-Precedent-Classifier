    <p class="syllabus" id="b51-8" data-blocks='[["BL_51.9",51,[103,1378,1182,597]]]'>A coal lease provided that the lessee should pay ten cents per ton royalty, and should mine and ship the coal with all proper and due diligence. The lessee covenanted to mine at least 50,000 tons of coal each year, or pay royalty on that amount. The lease further provided that the lessor could repossess himself of the premises in the event of the failure of the lessee to pay the royalties at the time specified, but he was required to give sixty days’ notice in writing of his intention to do so. The lessee went into possession of the premises, and was in possession nearly six years thereafter when notice was served upon him by the lessor. During this time he had only paid $89.00 in royalties, although up to the time of service of the notice he had mined over 40,000 tons. There was no evidence offered to excuse the nonpayment of royalties, nor was there any evidence of waiver on the part of the lessor. <em>Held, </em>that the lessor was entitled to recover possession in ejectment.</p>

If the court refuse to charge as requested in the first point, then as defendant’s own testimony shows that up until June 1, 1900, he has actually mined from the leased property 70,929 tons, on which the stipulated royalty would be $4,592.90, on which he has paid but $89.05, the plaintiff is entitled in any event to a verdict for the premises described in the writ, to be <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>released upon the payment of $4,503.85, with interest thereon, within such reasonable time as the jury may fix.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b54-5" data-blocks='[["BL_54.6",54,[252,1090,1189,860]]]'>The evidence showed that the defendant had entered into possession of the coal immediately after the date of the lease, and that up to the time of the service of the notice by the plaintiff of its intention to repossess the coal, had mined over 40,000 tons, which, after deducing the amount allowed towards the improvements of defendant, left a balance of almost $2,000 due. The evidence also disclosed that up to the time of the trial the defendant had mined 70,000 tons and yet had only paid, as stated above, $89.05, being for the months of August, September and October, 1893. We can discover in the evidence in the case no attempt on the part of the defendant to excuse or explain the nonpayment of the royalty, nor was any evidence of a waiver on the part of the plaintiff of the payment of the royalty due at the time the notice referred to above was given, and we have failed to discover any reason in the evidence or the law cited why the plaintiff should not have the right to enforce the forfeiture clause recited above.</p>

The putting another tenant on the premises without demand on, or notice to, Kreutz, was not the way to enforce the forfeiture,” and yet, after the declaration above in the opinion, Chief Justice Woodward says that the infirmity of the plaintiff’s case, by reason of his utter failure to show performance or offer of performance of covenants, prevented him from taking advantage of the failure of the lessee to resort to the proper steps to enforce the forfeiture.</p>

    <p id="b56-6" data-blocks='[["BL_56.8",56,[257,738,1188,1236]]]'>This was an action of ejectment brought by the Walnut Run Coal Company to recover the possession of the coal underlying about 400 acres of land in Susquehanna township. The defendant had notice of the ejectment and conceded that it had failed to comply with the terms of the lease. Testimony was taken by the parties litigant and a verdict was rendered by the jury subject to the reservation by the court of “ the question raised by the first point as well as the right to enter an absolute judgment for the plaintiff, non obstante veredicto.” The court upon a fair and just determination of the question involved entered the following decree or judgment, to wit: “ And now, December 8, 1900, the question reserved under the first point submitted by the plaintiff’s counsel is determined in favor of the plaintiff, and it is directed that on payment of the jury fee, judgment be entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant for the premises described in the writ, non obstante veredicto.” The action of the court was clearly right and nothing is discoverable in it which warrants criticism or affords any just cause of complaint. It is not necessary to refer herein to any of the matters included in the contract or agreement of the parties. It is sufficient to say that all of the matters contained therein which relate to the question involved appear in the clear and satisfactory opinion of the learned court below. On that opinion we affirm the judgment entered by said court.</p>
