Wood. The testatrix died in January, 1880, and her will was duly admitted to probate. James T. Wood, the son, died on or about May 27, 1896, leaving to survive him a widow, Annie M. Wood, a son, James Wood, the husband of the appellant, and a daughter Anna T. Wood, who was twenty-one years of age September 26, 1900. James Wood died on October 2, 1896, at the age of twenty-one years intestate, leaving no children, but a widow Nellie W. Wood, the appellant.</p>

Although the trust was to continue until the death of James T. Wood and his youngest child should reach the age of twenty-one, ultimately, at the determination of the trust, the beneficiaries were to get the corpus itself. The wife and children of James T. Wood were in esse when the testatrix died, and their enjoyment of the income of the estate given and devised to them began at once. The provision for such enjoyment indicates the intention of the testatrix that what she gave her grandchildren should vest immediately: “ While it is true as a general rule, as before observed, that where the time or other condition is annexed to the substance of the gift and not merely to the payment, the legacy is contingent, yet it is equally true that a well recognized exception to the rule is, that when interest, whether by way of maintenance or otherwise, is given to the legatee in the mean time, the legacy shall, notwithstanding the gift appears to be postponed, vest immediately on the death of the testator. This circumstance indicates an intention that the beneficial enjoyment shall begin at once, and payment <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>only of the principal or capital be postponed. When a legacy is given by a direction to pay when the legatee attains a certain age, the direction to pay may import either a gift at the specified age or a present gift with a postponed payment; and if the interest is given in the mean time, it shows that a present gift was intended: Provenchere’s App., <a href="/pa/67/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="67 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="1022478" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0463-01">67 Pa. 463</a>; In re-Hart’s Trusts, 3 DeG. &amp; J. 195; ” Reed’s App., <a href="/pa/118/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="118 Pa. 215" data-case-ids="556778" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0215-01">118 Pa. 215</a>. It is true the two-thirds inteiests vested subject to the condition that it might open and let in after born children, but such opening and letting in though diminishing would not divest the interest. It is also true that the present right to the future of the whole interest might have been defeated by some future event, the death of the wife of James T. Wood and all of his children and their issue in his lifetime, but it was none the less a vested estate: “ The question of vested or contingent is not to be tested by the certainty or uncertainty of obtaining the actual enjoyment; for that would make the character of the estate depend, not upon the terms of its creation, but on the form of the result. Neither does it depend upon the defeasibility or indefeasibility of the right of possession; for many estates are vested without possession, as well as with, which are yet defeasible. If there is a present right to a future possession though that right may be defeated by some future event, contingent or certain, there is nevertheless a vested estate : ” Manderson v. Lukens, <a href="/pa/23/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="23 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="974089" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0031-01">23 Pa. 31</a>.

She there directed that, as soon as practicable after her decease, an inventory and just valuation and appraisement should be made of all her property, real and personal; that her executors should immediately proceed to divide the real estate into six equal shares or purparts; according to the valuation made by them, and that “ such valuation and appraisement and distribution of my property and estate shall be in writing, and signed and acknowledged by the appraisers hereby appointed for that purpose, and shall be recorded at length on the records of the orphans’ court of Allegheny county, and shall expressly designate by name the several parties entitled undqr the provisions of this my will as <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>devisees or cestui que trusts to each particular share or purpart of my said estate according to the disposition thereof hereinafter made.” The testatrix wanted it to be known, as soon as practicable after her death, from the records of the court, not only who w'ould take under her will, but what each would take. They were to be designated by name as the parties entitled then, when the record was made, to what she had left them. The present right to the corpus, to be enjoyed in the future, was to be set forth, and those who were to enjoy it were to be specifically named. The expressed intention seems to be that the estates given should vest, not years after her death, but as soon as she died. They were not only to vest, but it was to be definitely ascertained and known who took and just what each was to get.</p>
