On this petition the decree now appealed from was made. The proper practice would have been to decide the question on the exception to the account. In the present form there was no case before the court. The decree therefore is reversed and the petition directed to be dismissed, but with leave to reinstate the exceptions and for further proceedings as indicated in this opinion.</p>
