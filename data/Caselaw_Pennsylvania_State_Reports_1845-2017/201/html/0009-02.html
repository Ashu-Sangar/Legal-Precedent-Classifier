    <p class="summary" id="b38-7" data-blocks='[["BL_38.13",38,[279,903,1189,979]]]'>At the trial it appeared that William Fox, plaintiff, and his brother, were assignees of their father, David Fox. On November 13, 1885, they sold under an order of court certain real estate of their assignor. The defendant who was the plaintiff’s attorney bought the real estate for $7,437, and paid for it with his own money. At the time of the sale he promised plaintiff that he would convey the property to him on payment of the full amount of the purchase money with interest, or if he could sell to any other person for more than would make him whole, he would give the surplus to the plaintiff. Plaintiff was never able to raise the money to buy back the farm, and in 1894, defendant sold the land to William J. Copeland for $9,850, taking a mortgage for the entire purchase money. Plaintiff in the mean time had been in possession of the land as tenant. Copeland never paid anything on account of the mortgage, and in December, 1896, he reconveyed the farm to the defendant to save the expenses of a foreclosure of the mortgage. It did not appear that defendant made any profit out of the transaction, or was guilty of any fraudulent conduct towards the plaintiff.</p>
