In such a case the evidence is sufficient to sustain a finding that no abandonment of the stone and of the tools was intended by the plaintiff.</p>

He took out a large quantity of cut stone, some of which lie could not sell at the time. He went away on other business, and while away made several efforts to sell the stone. Two years after his departure Kepple sold the stone and the tools which the plaintiff had left to the defendants, and also leased to them the quarry, indemnifying them against any claim by plaintiff. Defendants sold the stone and used the tools. Two years after defendants had taken possession of the quarry plaintiff instituted this suit. Hie court refused to give binding instructions for defendant, and submitted to the jury the question of abandonment.</p>
