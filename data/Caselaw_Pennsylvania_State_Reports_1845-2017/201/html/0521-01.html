Unless he shows some valid reason to excuse him, a passenger is bound to put himself in the appointed place, and if he does not he takes the risk of his location elsewhere. This is the settled rule of all our cases : ” Thane v. Scranton Traction Co., <a href="/pa/191/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="191 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="907076" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0249-01">191 Pa. 249</a>.

It was overwhelmingly established by the testimony that the conduct of the deceased was disorderly and reckless ; that he disregarded repeated warnings of his <em>danger; </em>and that when injured he was holding the upright hand fail with his arms extended and his body and head thrown back from the car. These facts should have prevented a recovery <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>with tbe jury. But there was one fact that appeared from tbe testimony of tbe plaintiff’s witnesses which was conclusive against her right to recover, and should have been so declared by the court. It was said in the charge : “ I have read the testimony carefully, and there is not a single witness for the plaintiff who says there was no standing room in the car. They all one by one and one after the other admitted that there was standing room; that the man need not have stood in a dangerous place, and that he could have obtained a place of safety if he had thought proper. I have said that every witness for the plaintiff has affirmed that there was standing room.” The correctness of this statement is not and cannot be questioned. There was then no legal ground for recovery, and the defendant’s tenth point asking for a peremptory instruction for the defendant should have been affirmed.</p>
