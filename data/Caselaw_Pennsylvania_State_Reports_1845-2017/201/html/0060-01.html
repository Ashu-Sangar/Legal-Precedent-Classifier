This is distinctly specified in regard to each separate subject for which royalty is to be paid, viz: iron ore, coal and limestone. Two kinds of coal are provided for, screened block and screened bituminous, and no distinction is made between them as to roj’alty or as to the size of the mesh in the screen. There is no ground to infer any intended distinction as to the ton by which the royalty is to be measured. On the contrary the kind of ton being specified at the first mention of coal, the presumption is that it was intended to apply to all kinds of coal that were mentioned.</p>
