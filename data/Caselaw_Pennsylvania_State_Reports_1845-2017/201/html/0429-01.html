By her will Hannah Wood created a separate use trust for her daughter, Rebecca J. Friend. Mrs. Friend was also a beneficiary in a separate use trust under the will of her father, James Wood. Under both wills she had power of appointment. Mrs. Friend also owned real and personal property in her own right. At the time of her death she was a widow. By her will she gave “all the rest and residue of my [her] property and estate real and personal ” to her two sons, James W. Friend and Harry T. Friend. James W. Friend was the trustee under the will of the father of testatrix. Mrs. Friend directed in her will that James W. Friend should not be required to account as trustee under the will of her father/ and she also directed that no account, inventory or appraisement of her personal estate should be made or filed by her executors. By a codicil she directed as follows:</p>

Friend. By the will of her mother, Hannah Wood, there was devised to trustees, for the sole and <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>separate use of Rebecca J. Friend, a one fourth of the real estate sought to be partitioned in these proceedings. The will gave to Mrs. Friend the power of appointment, by will or other instrument in writing in the nature thereof, and in default of appointment, then to her issue. The question arises, did she exercise the power of appointment as regards this property in her will, which she executed on June 10,1896. The Act of June 4, 1879, P. L. 88, section 8, provides that a general devise or bequest of the testator’s real or personal estate shall operate as an execution of the power of appointment, unless a contrary intention shall appear in the will. We do not understand that it is controverted, on the part of the counsel for Porter C. Friend and others, that the devise of “all the rest and residue of my property and estate, real and personal, I hereby bequeath and devise to my sons, James W. Friend and Harry T. Friend, their heirs, executors and administrators, share and share alike,” would carry' the trust estate under the will of Hannah Wood, if it were not for other portions of the will of Mrs. Friend, which it is alleged show a contrary intention on the part of the testatrix. After adding a clause, providing that whoever should contest her will should be deprived of any beneficial interest under it, and the appointment of executors, the testatrix executed her will with the above residuary clause standing as we have quoted, but on the same day, and apparently after the execution of her will, she added the following codicil :• “ It is my intention, in the foregoing will, executed by me this day, and is my desire that the property and estate disposed of thereby shall include all my estate, real and personal, whether in my possession at the time of my decease, or held in trust for my use and benefit, by trustees under the will of my father, James Wood, deceased.”</p>

Friend, and the Max-wells, that the testatrix in the codicil shows that she intended to exclude from the provisions of her will the estate held in trust for her by trustees under the will of her mother, Hannah Wood, and we think that is the true intention of Mrs. Friend, as shown by her entire will.</p>

But there are other parts of the will which support this interpretation. The trustee under the will of James Wood was James W. Friend, a son of the testatrix, and the trustee under the will of Hannah Wood was the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Pittsburg. The executrix provides, in the fourth paragraph of her will, that James W. Friend shall not be required to account as trustee under the will of her father, James Wood; and in the fifth clause provides that no account, inventory or appraisement of her personal estate shall be made or filed by her executors in court. The evident intention of the testatrix being so far as the estate which passed by her will was concerned, there should be no accounting on the part of those in control of it. But she does not provide that there shall be no account filed by the trustee under the will of her mother, Hannah Wood. And if she intended to pass the estate held in trust for her under the will of Hannah Wood, then there must be an account filed in the court of that part of her estate. The doctrine that the courts will so construe a will, if possible, as to prevent the testator from dying intestate as to any of his estate, does not apply with the same force in this case as in the cases where that doctrine has been applied. Strictly speaking Rebecca J. Friend did not die intestate as to the estate which she derived from her mother, but that estate, by her failure to exercise the power of appointment given her, passed under the will of her mother. Mrs. Friend evidently added the codicil to her will for some purpose; we must assume that in passing upon the meaning of her will. The only purpose that she could have would be to make more definite and clear the part or character of her estate which she intended should pass by the residuary clause of her will. The only information which is added by the codicil, is that there are two estates to pass, namely, the estate to which she held the legal title, and the estate held in trust for her un<a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>der the will of her father, James Wood; no other construction can be given to that codicil, and give it any force and effect whatever.</p>
