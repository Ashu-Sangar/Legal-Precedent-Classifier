It will not do this unless by reason of mistake or some other cause falling within the legitimate powers of a court of equity it shall see that justice demands the exercise of its jurisdiction’irrespective of the lapse of such time. But if a party who insists upon exact time has himself been the cause of delay, a court of equity will, notwithstanding, decree specific performance.</p>

    <p id="b124-7" data-blocks='[["BL_124.7",124,[298,781,1185,922]]]'>No case has been cited by counsel, or revealed by diligent search in which a party in default has been allowed to declare a forfeiture. Benedict v. Lynch, 1 Johnson’s Ch. 370, cited by appellant, makes an exception broad enough to sustain this statement. We agree with the conclusion of the court below as set forth in the affirmance of defendant’s third request-¿or findings of law. “ That as plaintiffs never performed or offered to perform their part of said agreement, and never tendered a deed ‘clear of all encumbrances whatsoever,’ no default can be imputed to the defendant and the agreement cannot be can-celled.” Since the argument of this case, our attention has been called to the Act of June 10, 1893, P, L. 415, entitled, “An act to provide for the quieting of titles to land,” and the suggestion has been made that this act provided a complete statutory remedy for the plaintiffs. Whether it does or not, we do not here decide, as the question was not argued, nor was it considered by the court below. The bill was properly dismissed upon the merits.</p>
