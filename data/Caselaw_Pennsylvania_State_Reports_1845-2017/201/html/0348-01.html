    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[279,738,1190,1132]]]'>The defendant owed a few thousand dollars, and had but a few hundred. He proposed to his creditors that instead of using his money to procure a discharge in bankruptcy, he should distribute it among them in discharge of his indebtedness. The plaintiff either personally or through an attorney who was fully authorized to act for him, assented to this proposition and agreed upon an amount for which he would give a release. He was told who the other creditors were, the amounts due them, and what each was to receive in settlement. He was shown an agreement with one of them and was asked to sign a similar agreement to be shown the others. He prepared and executed an agreement addressed “ To whom it may concern,” in which he stated the terms on which he would settle. Manifestly the purpose in executing an agreement in this form was to promote a settlement, and it was given with the express understanding that it should be shown to the other creditors to induce them to settle, and it was shown them. This was not a separate settlement with a separate creditor, but a joint agreement between creditors, and a good composition. The fact that one creditor whose claim was disputed was not a party, does not invalidate the settlement, as the agreement was not contingent upon all the creditors’ settling: Laird v.
