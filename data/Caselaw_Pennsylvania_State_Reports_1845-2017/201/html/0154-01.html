The recognition and provision for such changes are matters for the local authorities. In Com. v. Beaver, <a href="/pa/171/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="171 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="985575" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0542-01">supra,</a> the borough council in order to avoid sacrifice of a line of trees planted by citizens for shade or ornament made a change in the use of the public square, by devoting part of it to a roadway for driving. It was held to be within their discretion. “ The council can regulate, care for and improve the public squares .... in any way not inconsistent with the proper public use: ” Com. v. Beaver Boro., <a href="/pa/171/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="171 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="985575" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0542-01">supra., p. 559</a>.</p>

The court below has found that such use has ceased in fact, and there is no one here complaining in the character of a traveler deprived of his privileges in that regard. Even if there were, it would hardly seem that he could complain of an encroachment that only proposes to occupy one thirteenth of the lot. From the photographs submitted and statements made at the argument, it appears that as the river transportation and business declined, this ground became neglected and for a long time past <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>has been used practically only as a dumping ground. It was clearly within the discretion of the council to lay it out as a park, and improve and ornament it as such. That is the public use which appellants claim should be made of it. But public buildings are equally within the purpose of the dedication, and in fact are the most prominent use to which such grounds are commonly devoted and upon which the question has most frequently come before the courts. See Mahon v. Luzerne County, <a href="/citations/?q=197%20Pa.%2017" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="197 Pa. 17">197 Pa. 17</a>. The adaptation and use of the ground for one or more public purposes, and its regulation accordingly are within the discretion of the public authorities so long as they do not transgress the terms or limitations of the original grant. Whether a preference given by such authorities to one or more of several permissible uses, is reasonable or not must be determined in each case, by its own circumstances. The ground proposed to be occupied by a permanent building in the present case is only one thirteenth of the whole lot, and the rest is to be improved and made a credit to the city. This is not only within the discretion of the council, but was found by the learned judge below to be a wise exercise of it.</p>
