The defendants demurred to the bill, and denied the jurisdiction of the court in the premises, and its power to grant the relief prayed for. The court sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill, basing its action upon the want of power in a court of equity to declare the marriage valid; it was also of the opinion that the plaintiff had a full and adequate remedy at law in the trial of the traverse.

    <p id="b401-7" data-blocks='[["BL_401.7",401,[105,1467,1181,239]]]'>In Howard v. Lewis, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Phila.%2050" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="6 Phila. 50">6 Phila. 50</a>, Allison, J., said: “ In Pennsylvania the jurisdiction of the courts of common pleas upon the subject of divorce, and in relation to the power to declare a marriage null and void, is purely statutory, both as to the form and the substance of the action.”</p>
    <p id="b401-8" data-blocks='[["BL_401.8",401,[104,1726,1183,406]]]'>Jurisdiction to declare a marriage void on account of the lunacy of one of the contracting parties, has never been conferred upon the courts of Pennsylvania, and consequently those courts have no such jurisdiction. The learned court below was, therefore, right in dismissing the bill for want of statutory jurisdiction. As to the adequacy of the remedy by means of the traverse of the inquisition, we do not decide. That question is not necessarily involved in the present appeal.</p>
