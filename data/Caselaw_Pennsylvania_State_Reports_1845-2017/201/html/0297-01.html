      <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off, Me Clung, J., filing the following opinion:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[289,477,1183,617]]]'>The nonsuit was entered in this case because plaintiff’s own testimony showed contributory negligence on the part of the victim of the accident. He was walking along a street occupied by a double track railway, on one of the main tracks, or so close to it as to be struck by the passing engine. It appears that there are no sidewalks on this street, but that there is at each side of these main tracks room for a wagon to pass along. Under these circumstances, without explanation of the necessity, we must conclude that it was negligence for this party to walk along the track, just as it would be negligence for foot passengers without necessity to leave a sidewalk and walk in the roadway.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.6",326,[289,1100,1181,98]]]'>But it is said that at the point of the accident there was a siding which made a third track on the street.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b326-6" data-blocks='[["BL_326.7",326,[290,1204,1183,87]]]'>This might justify or excuse a walking on the siding, but not on the main track.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b326-7" data-blocks='[["BL_326.8",326,[289,1308,1182,198]]]'>There would seem even here to have been abundant room on the side of the street away from the siding for this person to walk, and he could have here walked in safety from engines on either the main track or siding.</p>
