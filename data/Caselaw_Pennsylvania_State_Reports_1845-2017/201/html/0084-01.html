And as we gather the contention again on this point, it is that this plaintiff was negligent in two particulars: That he was in the station house and there was abundant room there for his accommodation, and, it is contended by the defendant, that the fact that he did not remain there until the train was ready for his reception was an act of negligence directly contributing to this accident. And applying the principle of the <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>law with respect to contributory negligence on part of the plaintiff, he ought not to recover. On the other side, the plaintiff contends there was no negligence in this fact: That he did just what a prudent and ordinarily careful man would have done under the circumstances, that he had the right to go out on the platform. The contention, as we understand it, is that at that particular time there was no such great crowd as gathered afterwards; and you are, therefore, to take into consideration these facts and circumstances in determining whether under the circumstances the plaintiff was or was not guilty of negligence. It would be impossible for the court to determine it as a matter of law, but it is for the jury. There is no rule of law which would require us to say the plaintiff ought to have remained in the waiting room.] [6] It is for the jury to determine whether the plaintiff acted as an ordinarily prudent and careful man would have acted under the circumstances in not remaining in the station house. It being contended on part of the plaintiff that he just did what the average prudent man would have done.</p>

The excursion train, after going west a certain distance on track No. 8, came back east to the station house on track No. 2 about 7: 85 A. M., according to the testimony of the conductor, for the purpose of taking on passengers. Now as that train advanced to the depot, it is contended,' quite a number of people rushed out on the track on which it was coming'up and it was necessary to get rid of this crowd, as the train could not advance so long as the people remained on that track; and, as defendant contends, by its officers it cleared the track and the train was allowed to approach the station, some of the people going north in leaving the track, to the side where the plaintiff was injured. The defendant alleges that here was a distinct act of negligence on part of the plaintiff; that he had no right to approach until the train was ready for his reception, and it was his business to go back on the platform when urged to do so by the officers.</p>

But the trouble is, these facts are all disputed in regard to this alleged act of negligence. The plaintiff, on the other side, disputes nearly every branch of this proposition. It is alleged by him that while on track No. 1 he was naturally forced over there by the crowd of people, and it was not his voluntary act. And he alleges, further, it was the act of this officer, who came up on the track and scattered the crowd to the right and to the left.] [4]</p>

At the time he was injured he was where he had no right to be. Passengers are bound to enter the train at the appropriate place, usually indicated by the platform, and to remain in the waiting room of the station or on the platform, according to the circumstances, until the train is ready: Flanagan v. Phila., etc., R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/181/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="181 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="891421" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0237-01">181 Pa. 237</a>.

When the train in the present case approached the station, there was a large crowd <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>of excursionists waiting, and several hundred of the more impatient of them rushed across the track in order to get in the cars quicker or more certainly from the uncrowded side. The plaintiff was among them and was injured while trying to get on from that side. If he went there voluntarily, he was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, and could not be allowed to recover. But he testified that he did not go there of his own will, that he and his wife had “at first stood on the platform under the shed, and the immense crowd came and crowded us forward, and we were crowded over as far as the second track. At that time there was someone coming along, I don’t know who, that parted the crowd to make room for the excursion train, and we were shoved over on the third track.” How long he was there before the freight train that caused the accident arrived, what opportunities he had to get into a safer place, and what variation of the circumstances may be shown by the other testimony are not material now, for on the plaintiff’s account, above quoted, his responsibility for contributory negligence as matter of law in being on the wrong side of the train, ceased, and it became a question for the jury. For this reason the learned judge refused to give a binding direction for a verdict for defendant, and left the whole matter to the jury with explicit instruction both in his general charge and in his answers to the points to find for defendant if the plaintiff was in any degree negligent himself.</p>
