    <p class="syllabus" id="b203-7" data-blocks='[["BL_203.7",203,[101,600,1183,645]]]'>In a suit against an electric railway company for damages for personal injuries, the evidence for the plaintiff tended to show that she stepped off the curb of a street at a crossing, and stopped until a car passed on the farther track. A large covered wagon was standing in the street between the near track and the curb, and cut off her view along the near track in the direction from which the cars came. The distance from the near track to the curb was seven feet and six inches. After the car on the far track had passed, plaintiff proceeded to cross the street, looking and listening for a oar. Just as she came to the near track a car came upon her suddenly before she was actually upon the track. She threw up her arms against the side of the car, and was in some manner thrown under it, so that the back wheels passed over her legs. The evidence as to the speed of the car and whether a signal was given was conflicting. The court was equally divided whether or not there should have been a binding direction for defendant.</p>
