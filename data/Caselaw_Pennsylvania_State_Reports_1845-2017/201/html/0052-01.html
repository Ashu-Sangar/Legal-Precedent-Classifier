    <p class="summary" id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[533,464,361,25]]]'>FINDING OF FACTS.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[123,524,1181,355]]]'>1. J. R. Burford is the owner of 106 acres of land in Perry Township, Armstrong county. Prior to January 25,1899, but forty acres of this land was leased for oil purposes. This forty-acre lease was known as the Quigley lease, and is owned by Mrs. Lynch, the mother of plaintiff. It has one producing oil well upon it which is, and has been operated by the plaintiff for his mother. It is adjacent to the lease in dispute.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-7" data-blocks='[["BL_81.7",81,[124,888,1182,924]]]'>2. On January 25, 1899, said J. R. Burford, the defendant, agreed to lease to Geo. W. Lynch, the plaintiff, “ a certain tract of land situate in aforesaid township, county and state, for the purpose of drilling and testing the same for oil, for the period of fifteen years from this date, or as long as oil is obtained in paying quantities, said lease beginning at south-west corner of farm and extending on a line with wells now producing on the Burford and Hiles farms, respectively, north-east to junction with Quigley lease on Burford farm, said lease covers ten rods on each side of line, containing five acres more or less, subject to a reservation of land surrounding farm buildings and marked by stakes, and as a protection against fire. Said second party to drill one well on this lease within ninety days from date of this lease, and if oil is obtained paying unto said first party one-eighth royalty of all oil or gas obtained on said lease. Said first party retains and reserves all rights and privileges to this property except what is necessary to drill, test and save oil or gas from this lease.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-8" data-blocks='[["BL_81.8",81,[128,1821,1179,292]]]'>3. In pursuance to this lease, Geo. W. Lynch on April 20, 1899, began to drill a well known as Lynch well No. 1 on said five acre tract and completed the same on May 19,1899, at a cost of $2,000. It has been pumped by him ever since and is a paying producing well. This well is about 800 feet from the reservation in the lease.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-9" data-blocks='[["BL_81.9",81,[117,2131,1191,304]],["BL_82.1",82,[306,367,1186,508]]]'>4. In the fall of 1890, Geo. W. Lynch, with the knowledge and consent of J. R. Burford located another well known as Lynch well No. 2 upon the five-acre tract. Prior to its location Burford had staked off the reservation mentioned in the lease making a circle from 195 to 200 feet around his farm ■ buildings. This well was located one foot one inch without <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>the reservation, and within 195 feet and four inches of Burford barn, and about 800 feet from the Lynch well No. 1, mentioned in third paragraph of findings of fact. Lynch finished the rig to put down this well early in the fall of 1900, laid his water line, but never commenced to drill the well, alleging as an excuse that he had so much trouble with the Lynch well No. 1 that he had not time to do so. On March 27, 1901, Burford prepared two notices which he had served upon Lynch, notifying him to remove his tools and rig and not to put any more wells down upon the lease.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[306,884,1186,818]]]'>5. In the early part of June, 1901, J. R. Burford erected a derrick on the five-acre tract about twenty-three feet within the reservation staked off by Burford under the provisions of the lease, and twenty-four feet nearer his buildings than the Lynch well No. 2, said Lynch well No. 2 being located 195 feet four inches from Burford’s barn. The Burford well is about 824 feet from the Lynch well No. 1, which is producing a small amount of oil. About June 13, 1901, Lynch learned that Burford was about to drill his well within the reservation as above described. He had graded the ground and put in part of the mud sills. On June 17, 1901, Lynch served a notice on Burford “not to drill a well or otherwise interfere with the lease on your farm containing five acres and held by George W. Lynch. Any attempt on your part to put down said well, or otherwise interfere with said lease will be met by an injunction.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.6",82,[306,1712,1183,198]]]'>Notwithstanding this notice, Burford proceeded to put down the well, and had so proceeded that he had it down between 1,400 and 1,600 feet or about 100 feet of the oil producing rock on July 29, 1901, when this injunction was granted.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b82-8" data-blocks='[["BL_82.8",82,[305,2022,1185,299]]]'>The question of law before us to decide is whether or not under the facts stated in our findings, J. R. Burford has the right-to drill in a well and take out the oil upon the reservation mentioned in the lease. The question is not a new one, and leases somewhat similar have been construed by the Supreme Court.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b83-5" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[123,582,1183,563]]]'>The Supreme Court in construing this agreement says: “Now although there is no express stipulation that his mining rights shall be exclusive of the grantors, is it not a fair and necessary inference from the premises ? Is it conceivable that the parties meant that when, after much labor and large expenditures, . Funk should strike oil, the grantors might sink wells on the adjoining acre and take not only a third of Funk’s product, but all they could pump from their own wells, though they should dry up and ruin his wells altogether ? If so to what end were the premises so carefully marked out and divided between the parties ? ”</p>

Brown. DeWitt, the assignee of Brown began the erection of a derrick to bore for gas within 300 yards of the building, and was enjoined, Mr. Justice Mitchell saying: “ From the nature of gas and gas operations already discussed, the grant of well rights is necessarily exclusive. It was so held even as to oil wells in Funkv.

    <p class="summary" id="b84-6" data-blocks='[["BL_84.6",84,[289,575,1189,664]]]'>Taking these cases as our guide it seems clear to us that Bur-ford has no right to drill a well on the so-called reservation against the will and protest of his lessee. From the time the lease was given, January 25, 1899, to March, 1901, when he had a difficulty with his tenant, no such a construction of the lease appears to have entered his mind. It is only after he thought that Lynch was not prosecuting the operations upon his land with due diligence that Burford undertook to increase his production by putting a well down on the reservation. Thus it appears that the parties to the contract for two years and upwards construed the contract as we now construe it. Contemporaneous construction of a contract by the parties is some help to a court in reaching a conclusion as to its true meaning.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b84-7" data-blocks='[["BL_84.7",84,[288,1247,1187,356]]]'>One of the reasons given in the lease for the reservation is “ a protection against fire.” Could Lynch have imagined at the time he entered this contract that he could not build a derrick within 200 feet of Burford’s buildings and drill a well thereon, lest it might fire his buildings, and yet Burford would have the privilege of putting up a derrick still twenty-four feet closer to his buildings and not endanger them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b84-8" data-blocks='[["BL_84.8",84,[288,1611,1187,345]]]'>Lynch has the right under the agreement to drill, test and save oil or gas from this lease. But if Burford is allowed to drill-his well Lynch cannot save all his oil, for as soon as Bur-ford begins to pump his well part of the oil within the bounds of Lynch’s lease is lost to him and goes into the possession of Burford. Something evidently- not contemplated by the parties at the time the contract was made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b84-9" data-blocks='[["BL_84.9",84,[286,1972,1187,460]]]'>“ Said lease covers ten rods on each side of said line containing five acres more or less.” This means the whole five acres. But the lessee cannot drill within a certain distance of Burford’s buildings. Why ? One reason given in the lease is damage from fire. Other reasons for not wanting an oil well drilled within 200 feet of your dwelling house can easily be named. Lynch under the-agreement was restricted from having a well within the reservation, as was also Burford. He reserved no such rights.</p>
