The validity of the mortgage was sustained, and judgment entered for the amount found due. On appeal to the Superior Court, the judgment was reversed, on the ground that the transaction involved an investment of part of the capital of the plaintiff company within the state of Pennsylvania, through an agency within the state, for the prosecution of the company’s corporate business, in violation of the act of April 22, 1874.</p>

Where was this contract to be performed ? Turning to the articles of association, we find that they provide for the organization of the plaintiff as a body corporate, with its principal office at Geneva, New York, with the usual executive officers, together with trustees, and a board of managers or directors. With regard to the funds, it is made the duty of the secretary, “ To receive all moneys paid into the association, and to pay the same over to the treasurer.” Loans can only be made by the board of directors, for, by article 8, section 2, “It shall be the duty of the board of directors to judge of the sufficiency of all property offered as a security for advances and loans, and attend generally to the financial affairs of the association.” Provision is also made for the payment of all <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>instalments upon the shares, and all fines and penalties, “ to the association.” The transfer and withdrawal of stock can only be made by giving the secretary notice, and procuring an entry to be made upon the books of the association.</p>

The by-laws are equally explicit. For instance, article 5, “ All applications for loans shall be examined and accepted or rejected by the board of directors.” By article 16: “ All remittances for admission, weekly and quarterly instalments, fines, penalties, interest and premiums; and all other payments, shall be made to the secretary of the association at their principal office in Geneva, New York.” And by article 24, “No payment of any kind shall be credited to a shareholder until received by the secretary at the principal office.” By an amendment of article 1 of the by-laws, “ All moneys to be paid by the association on account of its shares of stock, or otherwise, shall be payable at the home office of the association at Geneva, New York, after acceptance and approval of satisfactory proofs.” By article 25, as amended, “ Any shareholder desiring a loan from the association by way of advance on his shares, shall have his real property, offered as security for such advance, appraised by three shareholders of the association, appointed by the board of directors; or in such other manner as shall be satisfactory to the board of directors; such appraisal shall be in writing, and returned with his application for such advance, together with his official search, to the board of directors, and, if said appraisal and official search shall be approved by the board of directors, the shareholder shall be entitled to receive a loan, by way of advance,” etc.</p>

    <p id="b34-4" data-blocks='[["BL_34.5",34,[300,506,1189,713]]]'>The remaining question for consideration is, whether the transaction, on the part of the plaintiff, was such a “ doing of business ” in Pennsylvania as is contemplated in the prohibition of the act of April 22, 1874. As we have already seen, under the articles of association and the by-laws, and as a matter of fact, the business of the association was done in New York. Its corporate functions were all exercised there. The applications for stock and for the loan were made and considered in New York, and there accepted. By the express terms of the by-laws, the money paid by the stockholders and borrowers was to be paid there, as was also the payment of the money to the defendant by the association in the completion of the transaction. In the contemplation of the law, the entire contract, from inception to the finish, was performed in New York.</p>
    <p id="b34-5" data-blocks='[["BL_34.6",34,[289,1228,1195,1132]],["BL_35.1",35,[146,391,1183,96]]]'>The opinion of the Superior Court seems to be grounded upon the assumption that the transaction involved the investment or employment of a part of the plaintiff’s capital within the state of Pennsylvania. The money was, however, loaned on the bond, a New York contract, and the mortgage was given merely as security. The plaintiff took no title to any property in Pennsylvania by the transaction. It merely made a loan of part of its capital to one of its shareholders, who was a citizen of Pennsylvania. The capital, if employed in the state of Pennsylvania, was so employed by a citizen of Pennsylvania, and not by the plaintiff corporation. In so far as the business of loaning money was concerned, it was carried on in the state of New York, and not in the state of Pennsylvania. If the operations of the plaintiff be measured by the test of agency, they will not be found, under the decisions, to be in violation of the act of 1874. The act of a foreign corporation in selling goods here by agents, and shipping the goods to purchasers, is not doing business in this state, within the prohibition of the act: Mearshon v.

Its place of business was in Maryland, its capital, if it had any was there. It had contracts with some of its members, residing in Pennsylvania, by which they were to can their fruit and hold the same to be disposed of by the corporation.’ For these and other reasons it was held, that the corporation was not subject to the act of 1874.”</p>

No such result was in the contemplation of the learned trial judge, for, in answering the defendant’s fifteenth request for finding of facts, he refused to find that <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>the employment of capital in making loans to residents of Pennsylvania, and the loan to the defendant, was a “ doing of business ” within the contemplation of the act of assembly. The loan was made by the plaintiff in the State of New York. True, it was made with the knowledge that the capital so loaned was to be used by the borrower in the state of Pennsylvania. The action of the plaintiff was, however, bounded by the fact of making the loan. It could no more be said to be doing business with its capital in Pennsylvania, under such circumstances, then a .bank can be said to be engaged in the iron business, or in the lumber business, because of the fact of its loaning money to an iron manufacturer or a lumber dealer.</p>
    <p id="b36-4" data-blocks='[["BL_36.5",36,[280,1007,1189,666]]]'>Great reliance seems to have been placed upon the case of Swing v. Munson, <a href="/pa/191/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="191 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="907095" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0582-01">191 Pa. 582</a>, as sustaining the position of the appellee, but the question there was entirely different from that now under consideration. It did not involve the construction of the act of 1874. The question was as to the right to solicit and effect insurance within the state without complying with the stringent provisions of the act of April 4,1873. Insurance cases stand upon a basis of their own. The business of insurance has been held not to be commerce, as an insurance policy has been defined merely as a contract of indemnity, and, for this reason, not protected as interstate commerce. The case of Swing v. Munson, can, therefore, have no application to the question in hand.</p>
    <p id="b36-5" data-blocks='[["BL_36.6",36,[280,1678,1187,141]]]'>Our conclusion is, that the facts disclosed by this record, do not make a case within the prohibition of the act of April 22, 1874.</p>
    <p id="b36-6" data-blocks='[["BL_36.7",36,[281,1832,1187,198]]]'>It is, therefore, ordered that the judgment of the Superior Court be reversed, and that of the trial court be reinstated, and that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff, for the sum of §269.68, with interest from March 28,1899, and costs.</p>
