Plaintiff was not familiar with the sidewalk in question. At the point where the accident occurred the ice had formed from water flowing from the end of a pipe near the house-line across the sidewalk to the curb. The evidence showed that the city of New Castle had actual notice of the condition of the sidewalk for two or three days before the ac<a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>cident, but had done nothing.

    <p id="b80-9" data-blocks='[["BL_80.11",80,[319,1132,1183,353]]]'>The testimony required a submission of the case to the jury. It tended to show that the ridge of ice had existed on the sidewalk for sufficient time to imply notice to the city, even if there was not notice in fact. The plaintiff was entitled to traverse the sidewalk, using proper care in so doing, and whether he had used such care was also for the jury. We therefore dismiss the specifications of error.</p>
