Oil was subsequently struck but the lessee did not take the well, and the gas company continued operations. Subsequently the lessor and the gas company entered, into an agreement in writing. The lessor reduced the royalty on the gas in consideration of which reduction, the gas company covenanted as follows : “ Before finally abandoning said well said second party hereby agrees to fit up the same with pumping apparatus and test the capacity of it as an oil well. It is, however, distinctly understood that said test shall not in any way bind said company to continue the operations at said well, but it shall have the option to either operate it for oil or entirely abandon it.” Subsequently the gas company abandoned the property without complying with their covenant. <em>Held, </em>(1) that evidence was admissible as bearing upon the question of damages, as to the amount of oil found when the well was tendered to and not accepted by the lessee; (2) that it was admissible to show what would have been <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>the cost of drilling a well at the time the gas company abandoned the property; (3) that the lessor was entitled to more than nominal damages if it should be determined that'oil in paying quantities could have been found.</p>

W. Williams. These lessees subsequently assigned the lease to the Forest Oil Company and certain other persons. On June 15, 1891, the owners of the lease sublet the gas to the Western Pennsylvania Gas Company, but provided in the sublease that in case oil should be found the gas company should forthwith give notice to the lessees who should then have the right to test the well, and accept or refuse it as an oil well. David McClay subsequently died, and the land was divided into four portions, one of which became the property of J. F. McClay, the plaintiff.</p>

It notified the Forest Oil Company and the other lessees, and the latter after making a test declined to take the well. The rental provided in the original lease to be paid for gas wells was $250 per annum. On January 28, 1895, an agreement was entered into between J. F. McClay and the Western Pennsylvania Gas Company by which the rental was reduced to $175 per annum. In consideration of this reduction the gas company covenanted as follows:</p>

Of course you cannot fix that to the barrel, and the plaintiff is not bound to show you, to the barrel what it would have produced, but he is bound to produce evidence to show you that it would have produced at least the amount that you may fix upon. Then after you have got the amount,, if there is any evidence here in regard to the price of oil, you can take that into consideration, with the time he would get the royalty under the lease, up until 1905; or if there is any testimony here, gentlemen, as to what a royalty such as would have developed there in 1900, at the time of the breach, would have sold for, running for five years, that testimony can be taken into consideration.
