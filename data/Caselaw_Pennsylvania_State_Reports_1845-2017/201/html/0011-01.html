The purchasers subsequently sold the property at a profit. The two remaining children of Eisaman, the plaintiffs, claimed the existence of a contract with the defendants under which the latter were to buy the farm, and upon sale thereafter to account to plaintiffs for a share of the profits. The court found as a fact that no such contract existed, and accordingly dismissed the bill.</p>
