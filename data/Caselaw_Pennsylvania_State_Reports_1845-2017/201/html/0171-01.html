There are different ways of assessing the damages. The general rule, that you might find applicable to this case, might be this: If the lowest amount of damages that would make good this loss would be the difference between the value of this property, before the injury, in 1896, and its value after the injury, as resulting from the loss —not a drop in the value caused by other causes—if there were other causes, but the difference between the value of the property'before the injury, and its value after the injury, as affected by the injury, that would be one way of estimating the damage. There was some testimony that it would cost a considerable sum, and I have forgotten the figure, to make this property as good as it was before, by rebuilding or changing, or something of that sort. If that cost of repairing, or making it as good as it was, substantially, is less than this other rule, then you would use that.] [5]</p>

    <p id="b201-6" data-blocks='[["BL_201.11",201,[124,1256,1186,814]]]'>The plaintiff’s house was injured by water which during rain storms accumulated at the opening of a city sewer and flooded the street. The opening of the sewer was on the land of the Allegheny Cemetery Company, from which it received the surface drainage, conducted to it by natural and artificial drains. It was surrounded by a circular iron grating or crib six feet high to prevent it from becoming clogged with rubbish. The negligence alleged was that the cemetery company allowed large quantities of brush, weeds and cut grass to lie along the water courses and near the opening of the sewer, and that these were carried by the rains to the crib and so clogged it that the water did not have a free passage to the sewer. The main ground of the defense was that the rainfalls were so extraordinary that their consequences could not be foreseen, and that the injury was attributable solely to an act of God for which no one was liable.</p>

It is argued that the instruction was inadequate and misleading, in that it left the jury to find that any concurring negligence on the part of the company however trifling and fanciful, and although it did not produce the injury, and the absence of it would not have prevented it, made the company liable. Some expression in <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>the charge standing alone may be open to the objection urged, - but the charge considered as a whole, fully and properly states the law applicable to the case.</p>
