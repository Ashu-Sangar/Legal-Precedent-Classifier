The Harleigh mines and the Ebervale mines are situated upon the Black creek or a tributary. In 1886, according to the deposition of Mr. Maride, these mines were 'flooded and remained so until 1894, when the Jeddo tunnel, nearly five miles long at a grade of about fifteen feet to the <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>mile, from Butler valley through the mountain under the Harleigh and Ebervale flooded mines, was completed. The tunnel, Mr. Markle testified, was driven for the express purpose of winning the coal in these abandoned places. In 1886, they were permitted to fill with mine water, principally, or mostly, sulphur water. In 1894, this immense body consisting, as Mr. Markle says, in the neighborhood of one thousand million gallons, was tapped by boring a hole from the bottom of the mines down into the tunnel and putting into the hole or tap some sort of a spigot to regulate the discharge, and by such means the water was taken from Jeddo, or at least from Harleigh and Ebervale, conveyed through the tunnel into the Nescopeck creek and to Mr. Stevenson’s property. It is contended by the defendant that for the sulphur water thus discharged which may eventually have done damage to Mr. Stevenson, that he is not entitled to damages, that the supreme court has decided the owner of coal property may develop coal land or property, establish mines and breakers upon it and let the sulphur water pumped from the mines take its natural course to the nearest stream, and if this sulphur water thus discharged does damage to a lower riparian owner, such owner has no remedy. The Supreme Court has so decided. But in the Sanderson case, which has been referred to, the water was discharged from the mines and permitted to run into the stream or flow in a natural way from the mine into the stream and then down. Here, different from the Sanderson case, a large body of water was allowed to accumulate in an abandoned, or at least a mine not worked. For the purpose of securing the coal in the adandoned mine it was necessary to remove the water, which was carried into another water shed through a tunnel and then discharged into the stream. If there was nothing but the sulphur water perhaps the principle invoked here would apply. But it seems from the testimony the coal dirt sent down Black creek and its tributaries and thence upon Mr. Stevenson’s land may have been mixed with sulphur water discharged from the Jeddo tunnel and brought down the Nescopeck creek. The testimony tends to show this coal dirt when mingled in the stream with the sulphur water would produce more sulphur water. If you believe this to be the case and believe the coal dirt sent down Black creek mixed with the sulphur water discharged from the <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>Jeddo tunnel and thus put an increase of sulphur water in Mr. Stevenson’s dam and race which caused percolation through the soil and into his well, he may recover from the damage so done to his well water, as well as for the damage so done by reason of this culm in the stream.

But if it has reference purely to the mining of coal and shipping of coal then it is not affirmed.

Under the pleadings in this case if the plaintiff is entitled to recover he can only recover in this case for the loss of his crops on his farm from the day of 1890 by reason of the deposit of coal dirt thereon and for the loss in rental value of his factory or loss of earnings of the said factory during that period and the plaintiff having furnished no evidence of either loss of crops or of rental value of the farm and factory there can be no recovery. <em>Answer: </em>This is not correct. This part is, “If there has been any loss of crops.” I do not recall any such testimony. There is no allegation, or no proof at least, that any part of the farm other than about three or three and half acres along the creek was damaged by reason of the coal dirt or sulphur or any refuse in the stream; as to the small strip along the stream claimed to be agricultural land, it has not been shown clearly what crops were planted, what the failure of the crops was, or to what extent they were damaged.

Was the water then polluted? Having ascertained the condition of the stream at that time, the jury should then ascertain from the evidence, whether the condition had been made worse since that date, if so, to what extent ?

    <p id="b149-5" data-blocks='[["BL_149.8",149,[123,750,1181,812]]]'>The real complaint of the appellants is that the verdict is excessive. The only reason assigned in the application for a new trial in the court below was, that the damages assessed by the jury were too high, and, by the twenty-seventh and last assignment of error, which is not sustained, we are asked to reverse or modify the judgment for the same reason. We are urged not to remit the case for another trial, but, under the power conferred by the Act of May 20, 1891, P. L. 101, to reduce the verdict to such a sum as, in our judgment, under the testimony, will be right and proper. This we are at present unwilling to do, being of one mind that a jury, properly directed by the court as to the measure of damages, after hearing competent testimony, will return a just finding; and, as we are compelled to sustain some of the assignments of error, on a new trial there may be a verdict which will not be regarded as unreasonable.</p>
    <p id="b149-6" data-blocks='[["BL_149.9",149,[125,1581,1179,872]],["BL_150.1",150,[284,368,1183,461]]]'>The tenth point submitted by the defendants was as follows : “ If the jury find the plaintiff is entitled to recover, the true measure of damages for permanent injury in this case is the cost of removing the culm or coal dirt, unless the expense of removal of the coal dirt exceeds the value of the entire property, in which case the value of the property is the limit of the measure of damages, and in no event can there be a recovery in excess of the value of the entire property for a permanent injury.” This point was properly affirmed: Lentz v. Carnegie Bros. &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/145/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="145 Pa. 612" data-case-ids="825911" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0612-01">145 Pa. 612</a>; Eshleman v.

Sons of the plaintiff were allowed to testify to the depreciation of the value of their father’s property from 1890 until the day of the trial, due to the pollution of his stream by the defendants, and they fixed the annual depreciation at $10,000, or a total of $100,000 for <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>ten years. The question of depreciation of the value of the property was not properly before the jury; but, even if it had been, the opinions of these witnesses were reckless guesses, based upon no facts, and ought not to have been allowed to go to the jury, who may have been improperly and unduly influenced by them. These witnesses should have been examined on the question of damages from the standpoint of .the tenth point submitted by the defendants, and the first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[285,834,1186,1285]]]'>By agreement, the jury were instructed that they could return a verdict against one or all of the defendants as joint tort feasors, and the offer of the testimony of John Markle, taken in the case of John Geddig v. The Union Improvement Company, and the Jeddo Tunnel Company, Limited, was simply an offer to prove conclusively certain admissions that he had made. The testimony was admitted to affect only the witness who, at the time he testified, was president and chief engineer of the Jeddo Tunnel Company, Limited, which company is one of the defendants in this suit. The declarations of a party to the record, if against his interest, are always admissible, and, when the offer is to prove what he testified to in certain proceedings at law, it is an offer to prove conclusively what his admission was. Ordinarily, admissions as matters of proof are uncertain and generally liable to be contradicted; but when uttered words are taken down as testimony in a cause, there can be no mistake as to what the witness said, or as to what the admissions were. Markle was not a witness for the plaintiff, whom he ought to have subpoenaed, or whose testimony could be read only after proof to the court that the witness could not be produced; as stated, his deposition was offered and received as an admission of one of the defendants affecting only himself, and the cases brought to our notice as to the right to read the deposition of a witness do not apply. Markle’s deposition was properly received, and the third and fourth assignments are not sustained.</p>

He had the right to use the water of Nescopeck creek as it naturally flowed over his own property, and private parties polluting it cannot urge, in mitigation of the damages they cause, that they offered to give him a substitute for it. The right to arbitrarily decline the use of any other water proffered by the defendants was as absolute as the right to use his own unpolluted water, and the tenth assignment is overruled.</p>
    <p id="b151-3" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[148,949,1182,406]]]'>As the measure of damages in this case is the expense of removing the coal dirt, unless the cost of such removal shall exceed the value of the entire property, the offers which are the subject of the eleventh, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth assignments should have been allowed, for the real value of the property becomes important. The witnesses called were clearly competent to testify what it was, and the exclusion of their testimony was error. These assignments are sustained.</p>
