    <p class="summary" id="b46-5" data-blocks='[["BL_46.5",46,[328,625,1186,809]]]'>The first reason asssigned for striking off said lien is, that there is no warrant under the special act of 1868, supra, and its supplements, to file a lien for the materials mentioned in alleged lien. I do not understand from the statement of lien filed by the plaintiff or from his bill of particulars' thereto annexed, that he makes any claim for materials furnished, but only for the taking out of a set of rig timbers on April 13,1896, from which it would appear that said item was for the work and labor of taking out said rig timbers. Whether said timbers were taken out on said leasehold estate does not appear. But it can make no difference as to the latter item, if the plaintiff is not entitled to a lien on said leasehold estate for the pumping and producing of oil as alleged in his statement of lien, for if the item for taking out rig timbers was the subject of lien, standing alone, the plaintiff was too late in filing his lien therefor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b46-6" data-blocks='[["BL_46.6",46,[329,1453,1188,766]]]'>The second reason assigned for the striking off said lien is, that the alleged lien of plaintiff filed therein does not show that any notice of an intention to file a lien was given as required by law. This reason cannot be sustained. No such notice is required to be given in Clarion county, nor was it required at the date of the commencement or during the time of said pumping nor at any time thereafter. The act of June 2, 1873, vide Appendix, 1873, in P. L. of the year 1874, page 386, repealed the act of April 13, 1869, supra, and all subsequent acts and supplements relating to the notice therein required to be given by the persons furnishing material or doing work for or about leasehold estates, of their intention to claim a lien upon said property for the price and value of such labor or materials, so far as Clarion county is concerned; the provisions of said repealing act being only extended to the county of Clarion.</p>

This reason is a broad and general one, and its scope covers considerable <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>ground; it at least involves a construction and interpretation of the several acts of assembly hereinbefore referred to, which are clearly local or special laws in respect to mechanics’ liens upon leasehold estates in certain counties of this state. There can be no question that the Act of 1868, P. L. 752, supra, is a local act; it relates only to Venango county. The provisions of the latter act were extended to the counties of Crawford, Wax' ren and Clarion by the act of March 18, 1869, supra. The supplemental act of May 23,1871, supra, was passed, extending the provisions of the 1st and 2d sectioxxs of the act of 1868, relating to leasehold liens in the county of Venango, “so as to include all material furnished and work done for pumping and producing of oil.” Now it will be observed that the act of May 23, 1871, amending the original Venango county act of 1868, without reference to any subsequent act, was passed after the latter act had been extended to Clarion couixty. The question, therefore, is, did the act of May 23,1871, operate to change and enlarge the act as extended to Clarion aixd other counties by the act of March 18, 1869? We think not. Our view is, that in the absence of any act amending the act of 1868 as extended to Clarion county, the law still remains as to Clarion county as originally extended to it, subject to the partial repeal by the act of 1874, supra. The act of March 18, 1869, is in effect a re-enactment of the Venango act of 1868 as it then read, word for word, as the local law for leasehold liens in the counties of Crawford, Warren and Clarion. Moreover, it is in effect the same as if the whole wording of the act of 1868 had been writteix into the act of 1869, without any reference whatever to the Venango county act. If the act of 1869 as to Crawford, Warren and Clarion counties, had the words of the Venango act writtexx into the former, how could the act of 1871 operate to amend or in any way change or enlarge the act of 1869, without special reference to the latter, as well as to the act of 1868. Most certainly, under the latter proposition the act of 1869 would not have been in any way effected by the act of 1871. A repeal of one local act or an amendment thereof will not repeal or amend another local act applicable to another and different county, even if the provisions of the acts be the same, word for word, unless there be something in the repealing or amended act making it applicable to both local acts. <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>The Venango act went into force at the date of its approval. The extension of its provisions to Clarion county by the act of 1869, went into force on the date of its approval. In conclusion we think the act of 1868 as extended by the act of 1869 to Clarion county, still remains the law of Clarion county, subject to the partial repeal of the act of 1874, supra.</p>

We have made diligent search through our own state reports and the following text books: “ Validity of Statutes in Penna., by Sanderson,” “ Sutherland on Statutory Construction,” and “ Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes,” and failed to find anything in the way of a decision or rule to guide or assist us fin determining the questions raised under the third reason assigned in support of the rule. It is a significant fact, however, that the partial repealing act of 1874, refers specifically to all of the acts by way of extension, amendment or change of the Venango county act or supplementary thereto, passed for the counties of Armstrong, Butler, Clarion, Crawford, Forest and Warren, and also as to Venango county, the legislature therein recognizing the necessity of naming therein all of said local acts in order to render the partial repealing act of 1874 effective in each county above named.</p>

But that the latter act was repealed and entirely wiped out by the act of June 5, 1874, except as to the actual labor done by mechanics and laboring men. Furthermore, as the act of 1868 did not include pumping, and inasmuch as the act of 1871, which did include pumping was repealed by the act of 1874, it is therefore clear that the legislature never intended the act of 1868 to cover pumping, and inasmuch as the only act which did cover pumping was repealed by the act of 1874, it is likewise clear that no lien for pumping can be filed in Clarion county. And if the legislature intended that a pumper would be classed with those who were mechanics or laboring men as mentioned by the act <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>of 1874, why did they in the same act repeal the act of 1871 which expressly gives pumpers the right of lien ? If the contention of counsel for defendant be true, then we are wrong in holding that the act of 1871, in effect amendatory of the act of 1868, did not extend its provisions for pumping to the act of 1869 as to Clarion and other counties. If the proposition that the act of 1874, repealed the act of 1871 as to lien for “ all material furnished and work done for pumping and producing of oil, be true, then no lien could be successfully maintained for pumping and producing of oil in the county of Venango, and if no such lien could be had in the latter county, a fortiori, such lien could not be maintained in Clarion county in the case at bar. The argument in support of the foregoing proposition might be pressed with considerable force and reason, in that the repealing act, i. e., the partial repealing act of 1874 made no exception as to liens for material furnished and work done for pumping and producing oil given by the act of 1871, and therefore the lien for work and labor for such pumping and producing of oil on such leasehold estate and the property thereon, not having been expressly mentioned in the saving clause or exception in the act of 1874, it necessarily repealed the act of 1871. But we cannot assent to the latter proposition. To sustain it, would be an admission that our former views in the premises were not well founded. Aside from all that, it would involve a question as to the constitutionality of the act of 1874, which we prefer should be decided by the appellate courts. In the examination of the index of the laws of 1871, we find that the only reference therein as to the act of 1871, supra, is that of Venango county, it is not indexed as an act of or relating to either of the counties of Crawford, Clarion or Warren. In Sutherland on Statutory Construction, page 199, it is thus stated: “So a statute which refers to and adopts the provisions of another statute is not repealed by the subsequent repeal of the original statute adopted: ” Sika v. Chicago, etc., Ry. Co., <a href="/wis/21/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="21 Wis. 370" data-case-ids="11286041" data-case-paths="/wis/21/0370-01">21 Wis. 370</a>; Schwenke v. Union Depot &amp;R. R. Co., <a href="/colo/7/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Colo. 512" data-case-ids="2553020" data-case-paths="/colo/7/0512-01">7 Colo. 512</a>; 4 Pac. Repr. 905; Regina v. Stock, 3 Nev. &amp; Perry, 420. The same principles enunciated in the latter cases, in analogy would be applicable to the case at bar, and justifies our conclusion that the act of 1871, a supplement to the Venango act of 1868, and only amendatory thereof, having been passed after the latter <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>act or the .provisions thereof had been in effect adopted and extended to Crawford, Clarion and Warren counties by the act of 1869, the law still remains in the latter counties as originally extended to them, subject to the partial repeal by the act of 1874. That the act of 1871 did not operate to change the act of 1868 as extended to Clarion county. If we are correct in our conclusion, the plaintiff is not entitled to his alleged lien for pumping of oil. If his claim for pumping as aforesaid falls, necessarily his claim of lien for taking out rig timbers must fall with the other part of it, the claim therefor being barred by the limitation provided for in the act.</p>

The laborer is worthy of his hire, and he ought to be paid the price and value of his work, but we do not see our way clear to enforce the payment of his alleged claim under the mechanic’s lien law. There is another motion in this case for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and subsequently thereto a supplemental affidavit of defense was allowed to be filed by the court. The former motion for judgment has not been renewed since the filing of the latter affidavit, nor has there been any new motion for a like judgment. However, we think it best that the latter question as to judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense be held over until the present rule as to lien shall have been fully settled.</p>

In a careful examination and consideration of that opinion, we are satisfied that a correct conclusion was arrived at by the learned court below. Wo therefore affirm the order of the court and strike off the lien at the costs of the plaintiff.</p>
