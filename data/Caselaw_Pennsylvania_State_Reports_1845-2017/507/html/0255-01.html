Over a hundred years ago the Supreme Court of the United States was faced with a dispute in a southern church over the issue of slavery. In <em>Watson v.

Dissidents in the Walnut Street Church refused compliance and seized the local church. The national body of the Presbyterian Church brought suit to regain possession of the church property. The Supreme Court in an oft-cited case laid down a rubric for civil courts that has been honored, enforced, and enlarged ever since. The <em>Watson </em>Court defined what has come to be honored as the “deference rule”. They said in 1871:</p>

    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[266,833,1156,561]]]'>The wisdom of the <em>Watson </em>Court is as clear now as it ever was: the right to practice one’s belief and worship as one chooses is so deep a root of our constitutional culture that a court, even one with the best intentions, can be no more than a clumsy intruder into the most delicate and sensitive areas of human life. When Caesar enters the Temple to decide what the Temple believes, he can leave behind only his own views. The view of a court as to who are heretics among warring sects is worth nothing, and must count as nothing if our cherished diversity of religious views is to prevail.</p>

The right to organize voluntary religious associations to assist in the expression and dissemination of any religious doctrine, and to create tribunals for the decision of controverted questions of faith within the association, and for the ecclesiastical government of all the individual members, congregations, and officers within the general association, is unquestioned. All who unite themselves to such a body do so with an implied consent to this government, and are bound to submit to it. But it would be a vain consent and would lead to the total subversion of such religious bodies, if anyone aggrieved by one of their decisions could appeal to the secular courts and have them reversed. It is of the essence of these religious unions, and of their right to establish tribunals for the decision of questions arising among themselves, that those decisions should be binding in all cases of ecclesiastical cognizance, subject only to such appeals as the organism itself provides for.</blockquote>

From this consideration has evolved what is called the “neutral principles approach” delineated in <em>Presbyterian Church in the United States v.

    <blockquote id="b404-4" data-blocks='[["BL_404.4",404,[296,947,1121,1375]]]'>Thus, the First Amendment severely circumscribes the role that civil courts may play in resolving church property disputes. It is obvious, however, that not every civil court decision as to property claimed by a religious organization jeopardizes values protected by the First Amendment. Civil courts do not inhibit free exercise of religion merely by opening their doors to disputes involving church property. And there are neutral principles of law, developed for use in all property disputes, which can be applied without “establishing” churches to which property is awarded. But First Amendment values are plainly jeopardized when church property litigation is made to turn on the resolution by civil courts of controversies over religious doctrine and practice. If civil courts undertake to resolve such controversies in order to adjudicate the property dispute, the hazards are ever present of inhibiting the free development of religious doctrine and of implicating secular interests in matters of purely ecclesiastical concern. Because of these hazards, the First Amendment enjoins the employment of organs of government for essentially religious purposes, <em>Abington School District v. Schempp, </em><a href="/us/374/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="374 U.S. 203" data-case-ids="8318" data-case-paths="/us/374/0203-01">374 U.S. 203</a> [<a href="/us/374/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="374 U.S. 203" data-case-ids="8318" data-case-paths="/us/374/0203-01">83 S.Ct. 1560</a>, <a href="/us/374/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="374 U.S. 203" data-case-ids="8318" data-case-paths="/us/374/0203-01">10 L.Ed.2d 844</a>] (1963); the Amendment therefore commands civil courts to decide church property disputes without resolving underlying controversies over religious doctrine.</blockquote>

The putative settlor in this case was clearly Middlesex. In support of this conclusion we note that the Middlesex church was not a creation or offshoot of the central denomination. Rather, the record establishes that the Middlesex church was created and incorporated on the local level by members of the parish; and that all property was retained in the corporate name of the local church. Subsequently, when the local body voluntarily affiliated with UPCUSA’s predecessor, there was no express trust language in the denomination’s constitution. Also, it was undisputed that there was never any express trust language in the constitution during the entire period Middlesex remained affiliated with the denomination. In fact, a prior attempt by the predecessor denomination, circa 1929, to include express trust language in the constitution was defeated by the member churches.</p>
