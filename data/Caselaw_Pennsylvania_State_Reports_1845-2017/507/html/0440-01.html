Among other things, he was a painting contractor. On November 15, 1976, decedent received a call at home from a woman who identified herself as Melinda Kelly. The caller said she wanted an estimate for a painting job at a house into which she was about to move. Decedent referred her to his wife, Barbara Livezey. She took directions from the caller to a purported job site in Upper Bucks County. It was agreed that decedent would go to the site the following Saturday morning, November 20.</p>

He and the van were next seen by passing motorists on Keystone Road in Upper Bucks County. Two of the motorists who stopped at the scene were Donald Landis and Frank Smolinsky. They observed the van parked with the door open and decedent lying on the road near the van. Landis had heard gunshots shortly before. State Trooper Thomas Stotsenburgh arrived at the scene and found decedent dead of gunshot wounds. There were shotgun wadding and shells near the body. Stotsenburgh found a clipboard with directions to the purported job site. The street on which the job was to be done did not exist.</p>

The business was in debt, which led to disputes between the brothers. Early in <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>1976, decedent offered his brother $4,000 for his interest, which was refused. Decedent initiated legal proceedings to dissolve the partnership, which were in progress at the time of his death. The homicide made William the sole owner of the business. The business received $237,000 in life insurance proceeds. Debts were paid, and William netted $100,-000.</p>
    <p id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[256,705,1160,1128]]]'>William Livezey and Appellant were linked to the homicide by Jerome Randis, who spoke to the State Police on March 22, 1979. Randis said that he was associated with Livezey and Appellant in the drug business. He was present at or party to conversations in which they spoke of their involvement in the killing. On one occasion after the killing, Livezey and Appellant discussed the killing and Appellant said he wanted money for it. During conversations between Appellant and Randis, Appellant said that he arranged to have decedent lured to the scene of the killing, that he shot decedent with a shotgun obtained from William Livezey, and that he then threw the shotgun into the Delaware river. Randis was present on another occasion when Appellant told a third person he did a “hit” for William Livezey. On still another occasion, Livezey told Randis he arranged to have Appellant kill decedent. A further link was provided by Daniel Thurber, another associate of Appellant. Thurber was with Appellant in Florida after the killing. He testified that Appellant told him he “shot a guy in Pennsylvania,” was paid for it, and threw the weapon in a river.</p>

She heard eight women speak over the telephone and identified one of them as the caller who directed decedent to the scene of the homicide. The woman she identified was Eva Colson, the wife of Appellant. Shortly after the “lineup”, Eva Colson left her residence, and according to the testimony of a state trooper at trial, she had not been located thereafter.</p>

      <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>In December 1978, William Livezey went to the office of James Hansley, Police Chief of the Borough of Lansdale, Montgomery County to pay some traffic fines. Hansley had been acquainted with both Livezey and decedent. He told Livezey he was a suspect in the murder on the basis of what was then known about his business dealings. Livezey said he had discussed the matter with the State Police and had been advised by his attorney not to say anything. On February 20, 1979, Hansley learned that there were warrants outstanding for Livezey’s arrest on drug charges. He attempted to locate Livezey and was not able to do so. Livezey’s whereabouts were unknown until September 17, 1979, when police were called to a residence in Lansdale where a disturbance was going on. Livezey’s girlfriend, Barbara Kelly came out of the residence. She said that Livezey was inside, had a gun, and was determined not to be taken alive. Hansley attempted to persuade Livezey to come out. When this failed, tear gas canisters were thrown into the residence. One canister came into contact with a curtain on a window and started a fire. Police entered the residence after the fire was put out and found Livezey dead of a self-inflicted bullet wound in the head.</p>

Such claim, if accepted, would entitle him to a discharge. Appellant was arrested on February 20, 1980, which was more than three years after the crime. He argues that this was unfair because certain potential defense witnesses were dead or could not be located, those who could be located no longer had independent recollections of events, and Appellant himself no longer had a clear memory of events at the time of the murder. A state trooper gave reasons for the delay at a pre-trial hearing on this issue. The State Police did not believe they had probable cause to make any arrests until they spoke to Jerome Randis. After that, they determined that William Livezey and Martin and Eva Colson should be arrested. They desired to locate and arrest all three at the same time, fearing that if one were arrested, the other two would go <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>into hiding. They found that they were unable to locate any of the suspects in the Commonwealth. The State Police had information indicating that Appellant was in Wisconsin and Florida at different times. They followed leads in those states. Appellant was ultimately located and arrested in Tampa, Florida.</p>

The court held that proof of prejudice is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a finding of denial of due process. The prosecution is under no constitutional duty to file charges as soon as it obtains sufficient evidence to establish probable cause or prove guilt. It may delay doing so in order to continue its investigation. A delay for a reasonable investigation does not violate due process even if it adversely affects the defendant’s case. <em>Lovasco </em>involved an eighteen month delay in the filing of federal firearms charges. The delay was due to an investigation conducted for the purpose of finding co-conspirators. The Court determined that the delay for such purpose was reasonable. Consequently there was no denial of due process.</p>

We found that a four year delay in the filing of charges did not deny due process where the police had difficulty putting together the facts and the defendant was put on notice at the time of the murder that he was a suspect. A seven month delay in the arrest of a rape defendant did not deny due process where the police made reasonable efforts to locate him at the residences of relatives and at various hangouts, <em>Commonwealth v. Sanders, </em><a href="/pa-super/260/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="260 Pa.

In the instant case, although Appellant claims he was prejudiced, there is no evidence to support that contention. He appears to have had notice that he was a suspect, given his departure from the Commonwealth and the testimony of his statements that he committed the murder. The pre-ar<a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>rest delay was reasonable in view of the initial difficulty experienced by the police in ascertaining the facts, Appellant’s absence from the Commonwealth, and the diligent efforts to locate all of the suspects. Therefore, we find no denial of due process.</p>

Prospective jurors who stated that they would not under any circumstances vote for the death penalty were excluded. Appellant argues that this was improper because it resulted in a jury that was more conviction-prone and did not contain a representative cross-section of the community. The death qualification procedure followed here was approved in <em>Witherspoon v.

One of these is the refusal to excuse for cause Barbara Funk, a prospective juror who had ties to the victim’s and prosecutor’s families and prosecution witnesses. Funk knew decedent’s mother, who had taught her son in school approximately four years before the trial, and was acquainted with Frank Smolinsky, one of the motorists who <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>had discovered the decedent’s van, and with the wife of the state trooper who was the prosecuting officer.

One of the prospective witnesses was Jeff Burley, who did not testify. Burley had been a childhood acquaintance of Geiger’s cousin. Geiger was aware of that acquaintanceship but did not himself know Burley. The other witness was Chief Hansley. Geiger knew of Hansley because he resided in the same area. He did not know Hansley personally and had never had any dealings with him. Geiger said he would be able to evaluate both witnesses’ testimony the same as anyone else’s. In view of that testimony and the remoteness of the relationships, we find no basis for disqualification. Geiger knew a number of police officers from having previously worked in the security field. He testified that he would not be biased in favor of police witnesses and his verdict would not be influenced. He also testified that he would not be influenced by his having been a robbery victim.

First, Barbara Livezey testified that decedent’s truck was fired on five months before the murder. Second, the exhibits included the wallet of William Livezey, which contained a slip of paper on which the name “killer Eddy” and a telephone number were written. We find that neither of these pieces of evidence was exculpatory and that, therefore, no disclosure was required. Third, Daniel Thurber testified to a previously undisclosed inculpatory statement made by Appellant. The prosecutor testified and the trial court believed that the prosecution had not been aware of the statement. Fourth, challenged statements given by a Commonwealth witness and by a potential witness who did not testify, along with police reports concerning the death of William Livezey, were not in the possession of the Commonwealth prior to trial. They were turned over to the defense for review at the time of trial. The Commonwealth was not required to disclose these items of evidence, as it did not have them prior to trial.

The defense did in fact cross-examine Commonwealth witnesses on their criminal records. Another requested item was the names and addresses of all witnesses the Commonwealth intended to call at trial. The rule covers eyewitnesses only, and there is no requirement that the Commonwealth disclose the names and addresses of all witnesses, <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant also requested discovery of plea bargains, deals, or immunities offered to witnesses. The Commonwealth represented that there were no such deals. The defense explored this matter on cross-examination, and no deals were revealed. Appellant requested F.B.I. reports on William Livezey. The Commonwealth did not have any such reports. There was no evidence that they existed. Finally, Appellant requested tape recordings of conversations between decedent and William Livezey. Typewritten transcripts were provided.

First, he claims that it was improper to admit a photograph of decedent’s truck spattered with blood. The claim is waived, as Appellant did not object to the admission of the photograph at the time of trial, <em>Commonwealth v. Butts, </em><a href="/pa/495/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="495 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="1770756" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0528-01">495 Pa. 528</a>, <a href="/pa/495/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="495 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="1770756" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0528-01">434 A.2d 1216</a> (1981). Next, Appellant claims that it was error to allow a pathologist to give details of the autopsy performed on decedent. Medical testimony is admissible where it is relevant to establish the cause of death in a homicide case, <em>Commonwealth v. Hoffman, </em><a href="/pa/439/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="439 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1930989" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0348-01">439 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20726" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="266 A.2d 726">266 A.2d 726</a> (1970). In the instant case, the testimony showed that decedent died of a gunshot wound. It was relevant to establish criminal agency. Appellant also objects to the admission of testimony concerning the involvement of Appellant and William Livezey in drug traffic. Such testimony is admissible to show relationships among parties involved in crime, <em>Commonwealth v. Russell, </em><a href="/pa/459/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="459 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="481049" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0001-01">459 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="459 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="481049" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0001-01">326 A.2d 303</a> (1974). Appellant objected to a question addressed to Barbara Livezey as to whether William Livezey attended decedent’s funeral. The trial court sustained the objection. There was therefore no prejudice to Appellant. Appellant next claims that it was improper to admit testimony about changes in his appearance since the time of the murder. Appellant was described as looking “more sophisticated” and as having cut his hair, trimmed his beard, and begun to wear glasses. Evidence of flight or self-concealment on the part of a person who knows that he or she is wanted for a crime may be admitted to show consciousness of guilt and may form a basis, along with <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>other evidence, for an inference of guilt, <em>Commonwealth v.

Evidence of a change in appearance may be admitted to show concealment under this principle. See <em>Commonwealth v. Berrios, </em><a href="/pa/495/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="495 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="1770724" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0444-01">495 Pa. 444</a>, <a href="/pa/495/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="495 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="1770724" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0444-01">434 A.2d 1173</a> (1981). It was proper to admit the evidence of Appellant’s change in appearance along with that of his movements outside the Commonwealth. Appellant claims that Daniel Thurber improperly testified about a relationship between Appellant and Thurber’s wife. The claim is waived, as there was no objection to the testimony at trial. Finally Appellant claims that it was improper to admit testimony concerning the attempted arrest and suicide of William Livezey. The evidence was relevant, given that the relationship between Appellant and Livezey and their conspiracy to commit the murder had been established. Additionally, the suicide was relevant to show Livezey’s state of mind, <em>Commonwealth v. Homeyer, </em><a href="/pa/373/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="373 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="1240350" data-case-paths="/pa/373/0150-01">373 Pa. 150</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.2d%20743" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="94 A.2d 743">94 A.2d 743</a> (1953).</p>

One of these was a statement in his opening address that he would show that Appellant attempted to flee when arrested in Tampa, Florida and then did not present evidence thereon. The prosecutor had a Tampa detective available to testify. He offered to prove through his testimony that the Tampa police went to a house to arrest Appellant. When they knocked on the door and identified themselves, Appellant ran out the side door, whereupon he was arrested. The defense objected to the proposed testimony. The objection was overruled, but the prosecutor elected not to present the testimony. In <em>Commonwealth v. Farquharson, </em><a href="/pa/467/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="467 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1717363" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0050-01">467 Pa. 50</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="467 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1717363" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0050-01">354 A.2d 545</a> (1976), we held that when there is a good faith, reasonable basis for believing that a particular fact will be established during trial, it is proper to refer to such fact during the opening statement. We further held that even if an improper remark is made during an opening statement, there is no basis for relief unless the unavoidable effect is to prejudice <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>the jury so as to render it incapable of objective judgment. In the instant case, the prosecutor had the evidence available and reasonably expected to present it. The fact that he chose not to do so in the face of the objection by the defense did not render the opening statement improper. Furthermore, we find that the evidence was not prejudicial in view of the extensive evidence presented against Appellant. The prosecutor also stated in his opening that Eva Colson disappeared after learning that she was a suspect in the killing. That statement was proper, as the evidence established that she disappeared. Appellant also objects to the prosecutor’s statement that Appellant intended to kill his wife. Daniel Thurber testified that Appellant told him of such intention. That statement, too, was proper. Appellant objects to several statements made by the prosecutor in his closing address. A prosecutor’s closing remarks must be limited to facts in evidence and legitimate inferences therefrom, <em>Commonwealth v. Harvell, </em><a href="/pa/458/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="458 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="479728" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0406-01">458 Pa. 406</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=327%20A.2d%2027" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="327 A.2d 27">327 A.2d 27</a> (1974). Appellant objects to the following: The prosecutor described the effects of the gunshot wounds on decedent and said how they killed him. That statement was supported by the Pathologists’s testimony. The prosecutor said that William Livezey killed himself. That was consistent with the evidence, which showed that Livezey died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The evidence supports the prosecutor’s statements that William Livezey was involved in the killing of decedent and that Appellant did drug work for Livezey. The prosecutor described Appellant as the same type of person as William Livezey, Jerome Randis, Henry Glosemeyer, and Daniel Thurber. We have already discussed the evidence showing that Appellant conspired with Livezey to commit murder and was in the drug business with Livezey and Randis. Additionally, Glosemeyer testified that he sold drugs for Livezey. Thurber was a close associate of Appellant and resided with him in Florida for six months. We find all of the prosecutor’s statements to be reasonable in light of the evidence.</p>

Belevary was brought into the jurisdiction by the prosecution and was not initially available to the defense. However, the record shows that defense counsel’s telephone number was given to Belevary, that the defense attorney met with Belevary and discussed his possible testimony, and that Belevary was available for further meetings.

      <em>Commonwealth v.

Stanistreet’s putative testimony would have corroborated the Commonwealth’s theory of the case, i.e. that Livezey plotted the killing. Livezey’s statement that he killed decedent was consistent with his involvement and did not exculpate Appellant. Stanistreet’s testimony would not be likely to result in a different verdict, inasmuch as it does not contradict the Commonwealth’s case and there is ample evidence implicating both Livezey and Appellant. Since Appellant did not allege the existence of evidence that would have been likely to result in a different verdict, it was reasonable to deny an evidentiary hearing.</p>

Having so found, we will address Appellant’s claim that he was improperly sentenced to death. He raises several arguments in support of that claim. One is that he cannot be sentenced to death for a murder that occurred prior to the effective date of the death penalty statute. As <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>we have noted, the present statute went into effect on September 13, 1978. The previous death penalty statute had been declared unconstitutional, <em>Commonwealth v.

Since Appellant was convicted of a murder committed before September 13, 1978, his sentence must be modified to life imprisonment. It is so ordered.</p>
