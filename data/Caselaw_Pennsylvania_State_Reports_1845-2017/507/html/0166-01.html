At trial the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County concluded that Federation had committed an anticipatory breach of its lease and entered judgment in favor of Walnut. Damages were assessed at Two Hundred Ninety-two Thousand Dollars ($292,000) plus interest.</p>
    <p id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[285,1003,1157,526]]]'>On appeal a Superior Court panel determined that the lower court erred in its application of Pennsylvania contract law to the facts of this case. On the grounds that the evidence did not support the finding of an anticipatory breach and that the lower court had erroneously imposed on the Federation a duty to occupy the premises in addition to its obligation to pay rent, the Superior Court reversed and vacated the judgment against Federation. This Court granted Walnut’s petition for allowance of appeal on February 29, 1984.</p>

After a year and a half the committee recommended that Federation demolish its own building and construct a new one at its location at 1509-13 Walnut Street rather than buy an existing building at another site.</p>

Under that plan Federation was to relocate for the two years during which the demolition and construction at its own location would take place. Therefore, Federation <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>entered a lease agreement with Walnut for the rental of four floors of the building at 1528 Walnut Street.</p>

Attached to the lease before its execution by Federation was a letter, also dated November 8, 1973. The letter indicated that, as Federation well knew,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> part of the space referred to in the lease was then occupied by Catalytic, Inc. (“Catalytic”) whose lease would not expire until August 31, 1974. Every effort was promised to be made to tender delivery to Federation as close to May 1, 1974 as possible.</p>
    <p id="b311-5" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[240,1022,1147,700]]]'>Catalytic estimated that it would be able to vacate the premises some time in May of 1974. That move was delayed, however, by a sheet metal worker’s strike in May, 1974, which prevented prompt completion of the Center Square building project into which Catalytic was to move. These circumstances indicated to Catalytic that not only would it be unable to vacate the premises on Walnut Street during May, 1974, but also that it would have trouble meeting the August 31st deadline. Catalytic, therefore, requested an option to extend its lease for up to ninety (90) days from the August 31, 1974, deadline. Walnut refused this request noting its obligations to lease the space to Federation.</p>

On July 1st that building was purchased and Federation abandoned all plans to demolish and rebuild at its old location. A newspaper account of this transaction indicated that Federation had been motivated to make this purchase by the amount of money it would save on construction costs and rental fees in the temporary location.</p>

Federation claimed that its lease with Walnut was invalid because Walnut had failed to deliver possession by May 1st which it claimed to be the date for delivery under the lease.

Contrastingly, <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>however, Ronald Rnbin, then Assistant Treasurer of Federation, declared to Walnut agents that Federation “did not want to occupy [the four floors], had no use for it and would not consider any type of extension without a release of liability from the lease.” Exhibit 50, R. 796a.</p>

The July 24th statement that appellee had been advised that the lease would have no effect because of appellant’s failure to deliver the space in May is insufficient because it does not provide a definitive indication that appellee intends to act on this advice or treat the contract as void. Appellee’s August 1st statement that it did not wish to approve an extension for Catalytic because it would lend validity to the lease does not indicate that it will in fact not perform. Moreover, appellee’s statement that it had no use for the space and would not consider approving the extension without a release from its obligations under the lease indicates that <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>appellee did recognize at the very least a possible obligation under the contract.

Faced with Catalytic’s economic ultimatum, Federation’s refusal to recognize the validity of the lease and its directive to locate a new tenant, and Walnut’s duty to mitigate damages, Walnut finally granted Catalytic a three month extension. Under the circumstances, I agree with the trial court that it would have been the “height of folly” to cling to a belief that Federation would honor the lease agreement. The statements and actions of Federation officials were sufficiently positive to support Walnut’s reasonable interpretation that Federation would not take possession of 1528 Walnut Street on September 1st or thereafter. Accordingly, Walnut’s duty to tender possession — a duty which was otherwise a condition precedent to Federation’s obligation to pay rent— was excused, and Walnut was justified in suspending performance and in taking steps to avoid losses or mitigate damages.

Whether it was <em>obligated </em>to take possession or not, Federation made it absolutely clear that it <em>would not </em>take possession of 1528 Walnut Street and, therefore, Walnut’s obligation to tender possession as a condition precedent to Federation’s duty to pay rent was excused.</p>

The majority holds that “the Superior Court properly stated there is an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment accompanying every lease of real property. When the tenant is prevented from taking possession under the lease by affirmative acts of the lessor then that covenant is breached.” Slip opinion at 11. The basic flaw in this reasoning is that, as Federation concedes, it had no intention of “enjoying” the demised premises, quietly or otherwise. In fact, since Federation did not intend to use or occupy the premises and since it could not sublet or assign its lease without the permission of Walnut,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a> then the only thing Federation could have done with the premises was to pay rent upon them. <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>If, as Federation would have us believe, its only expectation under the lease as of late July — early August, 1974 was to pay rent for 1528 Walnut Street, then how could those expectations have been disappointed when Walnut granted Catalytic a three month extension? The ability of Federation to pay rent was unimpaired by the holdover of the prior tenant or the extension. The disingenuousness of Federation’s argument — that while it was not required to take possession and had no intention of doing so, Walnut’s failure to tender possession on September 1, 1974 was nevertheless a material breach — is apparent. Obviously, Federation did not negotiate and bargain for the privilege of paying rent for an unused building and any substitute tenant that Walnut may have found for the demised premises, including the holdover tenant, could <em>only benefit Federation </em>and diminish its liability on its duty to pay rent. As no expectations of Federation were disappointed and as Walnut’s granting of an extension to Catalytic was a good faith and reasonable attempt to mitigate Federation’s damages, Walnut’s failure to tender possession until October, 1974 cannot be deemed a material breach of contract. <em>See </em>Restatement Second of Contracts, § 241, Circumstances Significant in Determining whether a Failure Is Material.</p>

The tenant which eventually took over the demised premises in 1977 rented the space for approximately the same price as Federation had agreed upon. <em>See </em>lower court slip opinion at 17, n. 21 and 5, n. 2. During the two year lease period, Walnut had rented other office space at 1528 Walnut Street for about that same price. While agents for Walnut may not have offered the four floors in question at less than or equal to Federation’s price during the two year period, the leasing agent for Walnut testified that none of the eighteen prospective tenants contacted declined to rent the premises because of the rental price offered. Finally, Federation offered no evidence that any prospective tenants would have leased the premises had they been offered a rate less than or equal to that agreed to by Federation. From the foregoing, it is apparent that Walnut made reasonable efforts to mitigate damages, <em>see </em>Restatement Second of Contracts § 350, and that Federation, who was responsible for the loss, failed to meet its burden of proving that any of the losses sustained were avoidable.</p>
