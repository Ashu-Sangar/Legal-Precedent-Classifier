Appellant’s pre-trial motion to suppress statements that he made to the police after his arrest was denied.

By alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant has shown an extraordinary circumstance that prevents waiver of the issues in question. <em>Commonwealth v.

Superior Court held that since the claims raised in this appeal have been either waived or finally litigated, the appeal should be denied.

    <p id="b727-4" data-blocks='[["BL_727.4",727,[214,915,1148,742]]]'>As always, the argument is that if petitioner failed to take a timely appeal from an unfavorable judgment (thus rendering his claim “finally litigated”), he did so because counsel was ineffective in not taking the timely appeal, and therefore, the claim should not be treated as finally litigated. Moreover, the argument goes, even though petitioner may have been aware of the grounds for appeal but did not take an appeal (thus rendering his claim “waived”), the claim should not be considered waived because counsel was ineffective in not raising the issues. It is thus, riding on the coat tails of the ubiquitous and ever-asserted ineffective counsel, that petitioner presents his claims before this Court in an attempt to bore yet one more hole in the proverbial apple.</p>
