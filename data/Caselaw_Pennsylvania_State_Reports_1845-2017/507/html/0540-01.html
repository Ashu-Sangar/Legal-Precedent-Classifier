Corley. The essence of the Appellant’s argument is that his trial counsel was ineffective for having withdrawn an allegedly meritorious suppression motion. The lower court found, and Superior Court agreed, that because the suppression motion would properly have been denied, counsel could not be found ineffective for having withdrawn it. The issues raised by the motion would have been, (1) whether the exclusionary rule applies in the context of a “citizen’s arrest”, and, if so, (2) whether the arrest of the Appellant in this case was illegal, there not having been a felony committed in the presence of the arresting person. The Superior Court held “that the fruits of an illegal citizen’s arrest are subject to the full action of the Fourth Amendment and to the exclusionary rule,” <em>Commonwealth v. Corley, </em><a href="/pa-super/316/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="316 Pa.

The Superior Court acknowledged that this holding was contrary to <em>dicta </em>found in several previous cases, but there being no binding precedential authority on point, the court, in the common law tradition, reasoned that the rule permitting individuals to arrest for felonies committed in their presence should be extended to permit arrests for breaches of the peace as well. We granted allowance of appeal to review these holdings. While rejecting that court’s conclu<a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>sions as to the applicability of the exclusionary rule in the present context, we agree that the Appellant is not entitled to relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541 et seq., and therefore affirm.</p>

A store security guard saw the Appellant running toward the main escalator and also heard over his radio that there had been a shooting. The guard followed the Appellant out of the store, across the street, and into Gimbel’s department store. As he followed, he observed the Appellant put a gun in his jacket pocket. The Strawbridge guard detained the Appellant and removed his jacket. He then handcuffed the Appellant and took him to a detention room in the Strawbridge store. While there he removed the gun from the jacket pocket. A wallet with which the Appellant had attempted to establish his identity, later identified as belonging to the victim, was also removed but was returned to the Appellant as he was turned over to the Philadelphia police. This wallet was later found, partially obscured between the backrest and rear seat of a patrol car in which the Appellant had been seated, by an officer who noticed that the Appellant no longer had the wallet when he was taken into the station.</p>

This rule, according to Appellant, departs from the longstanding rule that a citizen may properly make an arrest only when he has definite knowledge that a felony has been committed, and reasonable grounds to conclude that the defendant committed it, <em>see, Commonwealth v. Chermansky, </em><a href="/pa/430/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="430 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1915736" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0170-01">430 Pa. 170</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=242%20A.2d%20237" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="242 A.2d 237">242 A.2d 237</a> (1968); <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

Moreover, Appellant argues, contrary to the Superior Court’s reasoning that citizens should be encouraged to stop breaches of the peace and should not be required to distinguish between those which are felonies and those which are not, the new rule sanctions vigilantism and requires a more difficult distinction to be made by the citizen arrestor, that between breaches of the peace which are misdemeanors and those which are summary offenses. The latter, Superior Court has indicated, may not be the basis of a citizen’s arrest. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b688-5" data-blocks='[["BL_688.4",688,[252,1060,1156,950]]]'>In the present case the Superior Court differentiated between a private individual conducting a search and one making a citizen’s arrest. The former, the court observed, can have purely personal motives and goals for undertaking a search. The latter, according to the court, “is, definition-ally, acting under the authority of the state.” <a href="/pa-super/316/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="316 Pa.

This because “through the common law tradition as interpreted and modified by the courts of this Commonwealth,” <em>Id. </em>n. 9, the state recognizes and sanctions the act, distinguishing it from an unprivileged battery or kidnapping. In addition the police, by taking the arrestee into custody, and the prosecutor, by seeking to use evidence gained as a result of the arrest, would have “ratified” the citizen’s arrest. “Since the very occurrence of the act is freighted with the authority of the state,” concluded the Superior Court, “if that act is committed improperly, the fruits of that arrest must be suppressed.” <a href="/pa-super/316/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="316 Pa.

We first note that the theory described by the court whereby “ratification” of an individual’s actions by police and prosecutors may support an <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>inference of state action would, even if correct, apply to both searches and citizen’s arrests. It cannot, therefore, be a basis for distinguishing between the two. Nor do we agree that the acts of an individual become imbued with the character of “state action” merely because they are in turn relied upon and used by the state in furtherance of state objectives. <em>Commonwealth v. Eshelman, </em>relied on by the Superior Court in support of this interpretation of “ratification”, is not to the contrary. In that case we specifically found that the searcher was, despite being off-duty, <em>“acting as a police officer </em>when he removed the package and turned it over to police.” <a href="/pa/477/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="477 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1738336" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0093-01">477 Pa. at 101</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="477 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1738336" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0093-01">383 A.2d at 842</a>. (Emphasis added). We further observed that this finding was supported by evidence that the police treated the searcher as a police officer, arranging for him to take the evidence to the state police for investigation. It was in this sense that the acts of the individual were “ratified” by the Commonwealth and the searcher was understood to be acting on behalf of the state. The mere use by police and prosecutors of the results of an individual’s actions does not serve to “ratify” those actions as conduct of the state.</p>
