On September 20, 1983, Common Pleas Court ordered the matter retransferred to Commonwealth Court inasmuch as Common Pleas Court could find no exception to the exclusive original jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court under § 761 for civil rights actions. We disapprove the practice of Courts of Common Pleas refusing jurisdiction and attempting to <em>“re-transfer” </em>matters to Commonwealth Court. The proper practice in cases such as this one would be for Common Pleas Court to dismiss the action and for the parties to take an appeal. No appeal was taken. The statute having, in the interim, been amended, Commonwealth Court then reconsidered its original order in light of the amended § 761(a)(l)(v), and again ordered the matter transferred to Common Pleas Court.

The term “officer” as used in § 761(a)(1), which confers on Commonwealth Court original jurisdiction of all civil actions against officers of the Commonwealth acting in their official capacity, has not been defined by the Legislature. Guided by the principle of statutory construction that words and phrases be construed according to their common and approved usage, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1903(a), in <em>Forney v. Harrisburg State Hospital, </em><a href="/pa-commw/18/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="18 Pa.

More recently the definition of “officer,” as that term is <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>used in § 761, has been refined to include “those persons who perform state-wide policymaking functions and who are charged with the responsibility for independent initiation of administrative policy regarding some sovereign function of state government.” <em>Opie v.

The basis for this refinement was Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that it was not the intent of the General Assembly to confer on that Court original jurisdiction over cases where local courts can much more conveniently and properly make the determination as to the liability of state employees who function on an essentially local or regional basis. <em><a href="/citations/?q=375%20A.2d%20396" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="375 A.2d 396">Id.</a> </em>Commonwealth Court’s conclusions were expressly approved by our Court. <em>Rhines v.

Although State Troopers may be commonly known as “officers of the law,” as their duties do not involve the statewide formulation or administration of policy, they are not “officers” for purposes of conferring jurisdiction on Commonwealth Court under § 761. Thus, the actions against the individual state troopers are clearly not within the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Commonwealth Court held that these claims fall within the exception to that Court’s jurisdiction “for actions or proceedings in the nature of trespass as to which the Commonwealth government formerly enjoyed sovereign or other immunity.” § 761(a)(l)(v). Resolution of this question is aided by analysis of the evolution of § 761 in its historic context,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> which shows that <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>in every instance where the sovereign’s immunity from tort liability was limited, the General Assembly immediately took action designed to vest jurisdiction of the new causes of action allowed against the sovereign in Common Pleas Court.</p>

Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/490/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="490 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1763757" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0156-01">490 Pa. 156</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="490 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1763757" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0156-01">415 A.2d 80</a> <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>(1980). The refusal of this Court to apply Act 152 retroactively resulted in an anomaly: Tort claims against the Commonwealth as to which the General Assembly had waived sovereign immunity by Act 152 fell within an exception to Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction and were, thus, properly commenced in Common Pleas Court, while tort actions brought against the Commonwealth as to which the General Assembly had not waived sovereign immunity by Act 152 were properly commenced in Commonwealth Court. In 1980, § 761, was amended again to provide an additional exception to Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction for “actions or proceedings in trespass as to which the Commonwealth government formerly enjoyed sovereign or other immunity.” This Amendment was retroactive to June 27, 1978, the effective date of the Judicial Code and the first enactment of § 761. Act of December 5, 1980, P.L. 1104, No. 189, §§ 1 and 7.</p>
    <p id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[269,1226,1154,566]]]'>Thus, we see that each time it became apparent to the General Assembly that actions for tort liability could be maintained against the Commonwealth or its officers in Commonwealth Court the General Assembly amended § 761 to provide that those actions be brought in Common Pleas Court and not in Commonwealth Court. This leads us inescapably to the conclusion that there exists a legislative intent that all actions against the Commonwealth or its officers acting in their official capacity, asserting tort liability, are outside the original jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court.</p>

The parties have raised no question whether the action against the Commonwealth and the State Police for failure to exercise due care in selecting, training and controlling the individual troopers, and the action for battery, false imprisonment, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation are actions in the nature of trespass. The parties argue that the <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>actions under <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="42 U.S.C. §§ 1983">42 U.S.C. §§ 1983</a> and 1985 are not actions in the nature of a trespass because they are based on statutory and not common law remedies. We reject this argument.</p>
    <p id="b537-5" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[218,543,1151,1274]]]'>Under early English common law practice, actions at law were commenced by issuance of a writ which authorized the law court in which the action was directed to be brought to assume jurisdiction of the action and which enforced the appearance of the defendant. The number and forms of those writs were limited and strictly prescribed, and no action could be brought unless it could fit into the form of some recognized writ. An action in trespass would lie “for redress in the shape of money damages for any unlawful injury done to the plaintiff, in respect either to his person, property, or rights, by the immediate force and violence of the defendant.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY, Rev. 4th Ed. 1674 (1968). An action of trespass was directed at serious and forcible breaches of the King’s peace vi et armis, whether for injuries to person or to property, of a kind likely to provoke immediate retaliation. Where a writ of trespass did not afford a remedy under the particular facts of the case, the plaintiff had to bring a special action on his own case. This gave rise to the name “action on the case”. Thus, trespass on the case, or an action on the case, became a supplement to the parent and generic action of trespass. It was designed to afford a remedy for wrongful conduct resulting in injuries which were not forcible or direct. PROSSER on TORTS, 4th ed., 28-29 (1971).</p>
    <p id="b537-6" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[217,1836,1146,362]]]'>Although characterization of actions according to these ancient writs remained viable in early Pennsylvania pleading and practice, this practice has long since been abandoned. Since the Act of May 25, 1887, P.L. 271, § 2, all actions <em>ex delicto, </em>which had formerly been recoverable in trespass or trespass on the case, were sued for and recovered in an “action of trespass.”</p>
