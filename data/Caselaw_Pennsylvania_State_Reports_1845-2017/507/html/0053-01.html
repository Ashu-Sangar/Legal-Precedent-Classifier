The result reached by the Commonwealth Court seriously undercuts a carefully designed legislative scheme intended to provide the municipality with a right of set-off against persons having claims or accounts against the political subdivision. The Commonwealth Court has also ignored the clear pronouncements of this Court in setting forth the prerequisites for the issuance of mandamus. We are therefore constrained to reverse the instant order and to remand the matter to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County for resolution.</p>

These orders were entered against the City on August 10, 1981 and December 31, 1981. No appeal was taken from these orders. Subsequently, in 1982 when presented with invoices from Equitable, the City made a demand for pay<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>ment from Equitable of annual permit fees totaling $208,-620.00 and informed Equitable that a set-off in the amount owed under the PUC orders would be made.

Equitable then filed an application for reconsideration on January 28, 1983 stating that it intended to petition the PUC to join as a party-petitioner. On February 1, 1983, while that application was pending, the City informed Equitable that it was bound by statute, Act of July 1, 1937, P.L. 2611, <em>as amended, </em>53 P.S. §§ 7231 <em>et seq. </em>(1972), to set-off the orders against the amount Equitable owed to the City. The City also stated that under section 7233, Equitable was required to enter into an agreement with the City and that should it fail to do so, the City would take action pursuant to section 7234.

Such an interpretation is contrary to accepted methods of statutory construction. A reading of section 7232, <em>supra, </em>discloses that the legislature intended to allow set-off in three situations: (1) delinquent taxes, (2) municipal claims, and (3) indebtedness to the political subdivision, <em>“which debt shall have been reduced to judgment in favor of such political subdivision.” </em>53 P.S. § 7232 (emphasis added). Appellant would have the emphasized language act as a gloss upon the entire section. We reject this argument because we must adhere to the accepted principle of English grammar, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a), which states that unless plainly meant otherwise a modifying clause operates only upon the phrase preceding it. This has long been the mode of statutory construction in this jurisdiction. <em>Chestnut Hill &amp; Spring House Turnpike Road Co. v.

The carefully designed legislative scheme in the Act of July 1, 1937, P.L. 2611, as amended by the Act of April 15, 1943, P.L. 53, No. 32, 53 P.S. §§ 7231-7235, was intended to authorize “political subdivisions, other than cities of the first class, to set-off delinquent taxes, municipal claims and judgments held thereby, and penalties, interest, and cost due thereon, against claims and accounts due by such political subdivisions” and to provide a procedure for doing so. Title of the Act of July 1, 1937, as amended Act of April 15, 1943. The legislature gave the municipalities this authority to aid in their collection of claims “arising out of, or resulting from a tax assessed, service supplied, work done, or improvement authorized and undertaken, by a municipality____” Act of May 16, 1923, P.L. 207, § 1, as amended, 53 P.S. § 7101. It was never intended that this scheme be utilized to circumvent the exclusive authority vested in the Public Utility Commission “to order any [rail highway] crossing ... to be relocated or altered”, 66 Pa. C.S. § 2702, or to determine the allocation of related costs, 66 Pa.C.S. § 2704. <em>See City of Philadelphia v. Philadelphia Electric Company, </em><a href="/pa/504/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="504 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1787692" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0312-01">504 Pa. 312</a>, <a href="/pa/504/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="504 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1787692" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0312-01">473 A.2d 997</a> (1984). The majority opinion now invites all of Pennsylvania’s municipalities to ignore the Commission’s authority in similar <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>fashion. By denying the Commission’s right to mandamus, set forth in 66 Pa.C.S. § 502, in support of its own unappealed orders in this case, the majority has unwittingly but effectively eroded that body’s authority in this type of case.</p>
