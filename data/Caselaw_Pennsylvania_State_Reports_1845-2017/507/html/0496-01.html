In so doing we direct the Commission to determine whether the distinctions traced in IRC § 167(Z) between assets placed in service at different times require separate calculation of the annual tax reductions attributable to those assets earlier placed in service. On examination the Commission may find that the decline in those tax deductions, concomitant with the ever-shrinking deductible base of such older assets, can be offset by the continuing tax reductions a going concern will obtain from rapid depreciation on the newer assets which it must from time to time provide. On the other hand, the Commission may find, after considering trends in both inflation and energy demand, that this continuing provision of new assets is not likely to produce such an offset. In such case the Commission is further directed to determine when the turn around to higher tax expense is likely to occur. Based on that last determination the Commission must finally determine whether it is reasonable to charge current ratepayers for those future tax expenses. Such findings and conclusions are necessary to enable the judiciary to exercise its reviewing function and to deal separately with the rate-making effect of normalization of federal tax expense for each of the three asset categories covered in the Commission’s order.</p>

However, the revenue required to meet this increased rate-making expense is much greater than the hypothetical tax increase itself.

Because the loss of this benefit in computing federal income taxes would result in even higher rates than those resulting from normalization of that tax expense, the Consumer Advocate does not, on this appeal, contest normalization of federal income tax expense for depreciation on post-1980 property (Category III). The Consumer Advocate points out that ERTA requires normalization of federal tax expense when a utility uses ACRS. A utility’s revenue requirement is higher if it does not take advantage of ACRS depreciation allowances than if it does not normalize. This result occurs because the ratepayer receives a rate base deduction under normalization which, in turn, reduces the <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>revenue requirement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Thus, flow-through would, for post-1980 assets, increase the cost to the ratepayers.

Suppose a company with $1,000,000.00 of depreciable plant applies straight-line depreciation for the purpose of computing its federal income taxes, it gets a depreciation deduction of $30,000. If it uses one of the liberalized methods, its depreciation deduction will be $60,000. Assuming a fifty percent tax rate the company can thus reduce its current income tax liability by $15,000.00. Under IRC § 168 the company must credit the $15,000 to a reserve for deferred taxes. If "flow-through” were used, <em>i.e., </em>if the taxes are not "normalized” by creating the reserve, this $15,000 tax saving would be passed on to ratepayers, resulting in lower current rates. 1 Priest, Principles of Public Utility Regulations 124 (1969). The revenue required in our case has a ratio of less than two to one because the applicable tax rate is only 46%, not 50%. If the rate were 50% the company would have to charge its customers $30,000 to get the $15,000 it must reserve.</p>

The battle for normalization in the courts having been largely lost, in 1981 Congress denied the use of ACRS rapid depreciation to those utilities which are not permitted to normalize. By limiting these utilities to straight-line depreciation the cost to the utility, and ultimately to its ratepayers, is sufficiently onerous to compel PUC approval of normalization of federal tax expense in connection with assets put in service thereafter.
