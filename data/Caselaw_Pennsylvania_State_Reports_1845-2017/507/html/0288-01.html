The company’s fictitious name was registered both in Montgomery County and also in Harrisburg, and the partnership purchased a plot of land for $4,000 in the Borough of Downing-<a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>town, Chester County on December 10, 1974. The deed named the grantee as Tyrone Development Company and did not indicate the names of any of the company’s principals. The Tax Claim Bureau records indicated the company’s address as 22 Darby Road, Havertown, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, which was the personal residence of John McGarrigle.</p>

The 1975 taxes that were paid (borough and school), were paid by a check which bore the printed designation “Tyrone Development Company,” with no address noted. In the fall of 1975, McGarrigle withdrew from the partnership and moved to a new address in Havertown. The taxing authorities of Chester County were not informed of this change in the partnership or of any new address and continued to send tax statements to McGarrigle’s old address at 22 Darby Road. McGarrigle’s mail was forwarded to his new address for a period of one year, until October, 1976.</p>

The borough taxes were paid by a check bearing the designation “Tyrone Development Company, 1003 Hunter’s Lane, Oreland, Pa. 19075.” However, the borough did not note that the address appearing on the check was a new address, and, in June of 1976 the Tax Claim Bureau sent a notice of delinquency to Tyrone Development Company at the old 22 Darby Road address. The notice was sent certified mail with delivery restricted to Tyrone Development Company. Although the notice was sent to the 22 Darby Road address, it was forwarded by the post office to McGarrigle’s new address, and Ann McGarrigle, John’s wife, signed the receipt. John McGarrigle then told Michael Tracy that he had received a tax delinquency notice, but Tracy thought that the delinquency notice referred to an amount which he had only recently paid, and so he took no further action. Having received no payment for the 1975 delinquency, the Tax Claim Bureau sent another notice, approximately a year <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>later, in June of 1977, of an impending tax sale because of tax delinquency. This notice also was addressed to the 22 Darby Road, Havertown address, but this time the notice was returned to the bureau undelivered because the one year forwarding order for McGarrigle’s address was no longer effective.</p>
    <p id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[237,630,1146,1485]]]'>On September 12, 1977 the property, which had been purchased for $4,000 and was valued, according to evidence of record, at $9,000 at the time of trial, was sold at tax sale for the sum of $400 to four individuals, Tom Swift et al, who are the appellees herein, because of a tax delinquency in the amount of $9.45. Early in 1978, when the two remaining partners of Tyrone Development Company were negotiating a sale of the property, they discovered that they no longer owned the property because it had been sold at a tax sale, and in March of 1978 they filed an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County to set aside the sale on the ground that the Tax Claim Bureau failed to comply with the notice provisions of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law. Common Pleas Court set aside the sale on the grounds that the notice provisions of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law requiring notice to be sent to the owner’s last known address, were not complied with. Noting that the Real Estate Tax Sale Law required notice of a tax sale to be sent to the owner’s last known address and that Tyrone Development Company paid some of the taxes it owed in 1976 by checks indicating a new address at 1003 Hunters Lane, Oreland, Pa., the court held that the borough tax collector was on notice that there had been an address change. Since the knowledge of the borough tax collector is imputed to the Tax Claim Bureau, the notice of sale, according to Common Pleas Court, was defective, for it was not mailed to Tyrone’s last known address, as is required under the Act.</p>

      <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>Somehow, over the years, taxing authorities have lost sight of the fact that it is a momentous event under the United States and the Pennsylvania Constitutions when a government subjects a citizen’s property to forfeiture for the non-payment of taxes. We have had occasion before to note that we hold no brief with wilful, persistent and long standing tax delinquents, but at the same time, we have also observed that the “strict provisions of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law were never meant to punish taxpayers who omitted through oversight or error ... to pay their taxes.” <em>Ross Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/366/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="366 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="8845121" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0100-01">366 Pa. 100</a>, 107, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20749" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="76 A.2d 749">76 A.2d 749</a>, 753 (1950). As this Court stated in <em>Hess v.

The collection of taxes, however, may not be implemented without due process of law that is guaranteed in the Commonwealth and federal constitutions; and this due process, as we have stated here, requires at a minimum that an owner of land be actually notified by government, if reasonably possible, before his land is forfeited by the state. Reasonable efforts to effect actual notice were not carried out in this case, and the tax sale of this property must be set aside.</p>

Therefore, I see no problem with requiring a taxing body to examine the Fictitious Name Registry. However, I cannot agree that a taxing body must do more if the property owner has failed to comply with the statute promulgated to insure that real parties in interest are listed so as to enable the general public to discover, locate and identify them.
