The Commission’s ruling permitted UGI to calculate its federal and state income taxes on the basis of a separate return even though UGI did not file a separate return but joined in a tax-saving consolidated return filed by its corporate parent. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court disapproved of the separate-return calculations used by UGI and concluded that tax calculations which fail to account for the tax benefits realized by participation in a consolidated return cannot be sanctioned.

In 1981, the UGI parent corporation operated two utilities and had 22 non-utility subsidiaries. Rapid expansion of the non utility companies generated for these subsidiary entities large tax losses and considerable investment tax credits. It was these losses and credits that <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>produced substantial reduction in the taxes due under a consolidated return. The appellants contend that tax losses and investment tax credits of a non utility member of a consolidated tax group do not relate in any way to the business of a utility member for rate-making purposes. Appellants insist that it is only in a situation where a chronic loss tax shelter company is a part of the consolidated group that allocation of non utility tax benefits to a utility member of the group is proper and sustainable. If no chronic loss company is present in the group, appellants argue it would be inconsistent to use those tax benefits to reduce the income tax expense allowance of a utility member without also including, in the rate-making process, consideration of the non utility costs which generated the tax losses and the tax credits. Appellants add, as the Commission held, that it is only where a chronic loss company is involved in the consolidated group that the savings realized by the filing of a consolidated tax return are to be flowed through to the ratepayers.</p>
