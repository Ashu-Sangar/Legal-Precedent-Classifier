Green and the City of Philadelphia was consolidated with the appeal of the appellant Consumer Advocate. <em>Green v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, </em>81 Pa.Cmwlth. 55, <a href="/citations/?q=473%20A.2d%20209" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="473 A.2d 209">473 A.2d 209</a> (1984). The Court heard and decided several questions raised in the appeals before it, including: (a) inclusion in the rate base of certain costs of various types of construction work in progress; (b) consideration of PECO’s poor and deteriorating financial condition; (c). allowance of an increase based upon future wage adjustment; (d) recovery of the cost of cancelling leases in 1985 for combustion turbine generating units which would then be obsolete; (e) the inclusion in the rate base of certain expenses involved in pollution control projects; and (f) approval of PECO’s normalization of state income tax benefits. None of these questions are before us. The only issue raised in the appeal to this court is the propriety of the inclusion in the rate base of PECO’s investment in nuclear fuel in process.</p>

Duquesne Light argued that ownership of the mines was necessary to insure a continuous supply of coal and to provide a strong bargaining position in buying coal on the open market. The Superior Court sustained the inclusion of the coal mines in the rate base concluding that the Commission’s determination that the utility had met its burden to show that the coal mines were used and useful in the public service was within the Commission’s discretion.</p>

      <blockquote id="b579-7" data-blocks='[["BL_579.7",579,[261,1505,1113,387]]]'>A. The Company is charged by law with the responsibility to serve its customers. In order to assure a continuing long-range supply of uranium for use with the Company’s nuclear generating units, the Company contracts in advance for its needed uranium supply. This investment is made solely to provide the fuel necessary to meet service requirements of the company’s customers. It is, therefore, the Company’s position that the investment is not distinguishable from other utility assets which are committed to the utility’s business and held for the benefit of customers. (Reproduced record, P. 472).</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b579-8" data-blocks='[["BL_579.8",579,[261,1899,1109,74]]]'>Q. Mr. Hill, why is it a prudent investment for the Company to invest in future uranium supply?</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b579-9" data-blocks='[["BL_579.9",579,[260,1979,1111,385]]]'>A. It is generally recognized that uranium is an increasingly scarce commodity and that its cost will accelerate at a rapid rate in the future. Acquisition of uranium rights at the present time, assures the Company of the availability of sufficient supply to maintain service operations with its lower cost nuclear facilities. Moreover, acquisition of such rights provides some protection against potential increases in uranium costs. The alternative for the Company is to acquire nuclear fuel on the open market at inflated prices with no assurance that needed supplies will be available even at exhorbitant prices. (Reproduced record, P. 492).</blockquote>

      <blockquote id="b580-9" data-blocks='[["BL_580.2",580,[302,1899,1120,466]]]'>A. Yes. Puting these carrying costs on a current pay-as-you-go basis will reduce the amount of costs capitalized as part of the investment. This in turn results in a permanent reduction in the long term cost of the procured uranium. The benefits of this cost reduction are returned to customers through lower burn-up charges during use of the fuel. If the Company’s rate base claim for this uranium supply investment is approved, the Company will terminate AFUDC accruals on this investment. The economic advantage of acquiring nuclear fuel in advance of need will then be passed on to our customers in the form of a lower cost of fuel through the current energy cost rate either now or in the future.

Because no factual findings have been made by the Commission on the applicability of § 1315 to nuclear fuel, and there is no record to support any such finding by any tribunal, I would remand to the Commission so that a record can be developed which will enable us to make a more educated determination.</p>
