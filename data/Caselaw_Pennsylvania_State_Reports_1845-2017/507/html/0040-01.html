This holding applies equally to judgments for arrearages and to orders requiring future payments when there are already substantial arrearages. Once there has been a demonstrated lack of intention of making future payments, we see no reason to force an individual who needs support to obtain a new judgment and commence enforcement proceedings for each missed payment. Such a requirement would be especially harsh in a case such as this; the parties’ briefs reveal that appellee now lives in Florida, and we would impose an unnecessary burden on appellant, who remains in Pennsylvania, were we to hold that she must commence enforcement proceedings in Florida every month in order to reach the pension payments once they have been sent to appellee. <em>See Commonwealth ex rel.
