However, it also correctly recognized that the subpoena power itself, set forth in Section 4(7) of the same Act, 71 P.S. § 1190.4(7), lay at the heart of the Legislature’s intent in reconstituting an agency to investigate organized crime and corruption and provide the Legislature with a factual basis for legislation to control these problems. Lacking the power to prescribe procedural rules, Commonwealth Court sought to preserve the Commission’s subpoena power by finding an alternative statutory enforcement procedure in Section 520 of the Administrative Code, Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 177, 71 P.S. § 200. To do so, however, that court had to overlook the anomaly of ordering the Commission to return to basically the former procedure which the Legislature rejected when it adopted Section 7 of the 1978 Act reconstituting the Commission. We granted plenary jurisdiction to resolve this dilemma.

This Court will, therefore, exercise its power under Article V, Section 10(c) of our Pennsylvania Constitution to prescribe such judicial procedures as are necessary for the enforcement of the Commission’s substantive right to issue subpoenas. It is appropriate for us to do so here in order to carry out the legislative intent of reconstituting the Commission with the subpoena power necessary to any effective investigating agency.

However, because the power to adopt general rules of procedure, although given to this Court as the governing authority of the Judicial Branch by Article V, Section 10(c) of our Constitution, is in the nature of a legislative rather than a judicial power, it should, ordinarily, be exercised only prospectively. We will so exercise it here and accordingly require the Commission to begin anew by reissuing and serving those subpoenas appropriate and relevant to the purpose of its investigation. In the event of a subpoenaed witness’s failure to respond, the Commission can then, if it wishes, seek Commonwealth Court’s aid to enforce the dishonored subpoenas by a constitutionally proper procedure. That procedure will also preserve the appellants’ due process right to a judicial test in Commonwealth Court of the validity of the subpoenas and their relevance to a properly authorized investigation of the Commission.</p>

The former Pennsylvania Crime Commission, created by the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 754, No. 235, § 2, 71 P.S. § 179 (Adm.Code § 469), <em>repealed, </em>1978, Oct. 4, P.L. 876, No. 169, § 12, was originally established as a “departmental <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>commission”, chaired by the Attorney General, within the Department of Justice. It was thus possessed of the general powers and duties invested in all such commissions by the Administrative Code of 1929. <em>See Commonwealth v. Weitkamp, </em><a href="/pa-super/255/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="255 Pa. Super. 305" data-case-ids="99348" data-case-paths="/pa-super/255/0305-01">255 Pa.Super. 305</a>, 317, <a href="/pa-super/255/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="255 Pa.

This status was changed, however, by the 1978 Act which entirely repealed the prior acts authorizing a Crime Commission and created a new Commission. Transition provisions of a limited duration, added to the prior acts to govern the transfer of functions from the old commission to the new, along with other references in Title 71 to the Commission as an “independent agency”, a category of governmental unit distinct from “departments, boards, [and] commissions”, <em>see </em>Commonwealth Attorneys Act, Act of Oct. 15, 1980, P.L. 950, No. 164, § 101 to § 506, 71 P.S. § 732-102 (Supp.1984), lend further support to the inescapable conclusion that the Pennsylvania Crime Commission as presently constituted is no longer an administrative departmental commission within the scheme of powers and duties set out by the Administrative Code of 1929. It is, rather, an independent agency whose powers must be found solely and entirely within its own enabling legislation. For this reason, I would hold that the Commonwealth Court erred in finding “residual powers” of subpoena enforcement for the Commission in Section 520 of the Administrative Code of 1929.</p>
    <p id="b299-4" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[245,1661,1147,450]]]'>Part of the Commonwealth Court’s rationale for turning to the Administrative Code of 1929 after finding Section 7 to be unconstitutional was its determination that the grant of subpoena power in Section 4(7) was severable from the enforcement provision and that the legislature did not intend to confer a subpoena power which was enforceable only by the specific method outlined in Section 7. This reasoning turns the relevant rule of statutory construction on its head.</p>

The corollary of this rule that the remainder <em>shall not </em>be affected <em>unless </em>certain conditions are found is that the remainder <em>shall </em>be affected <em>if </em>those conditions are found. Having determined that the enforcement mechanism provided was invalid, the court was not authorized to supply a valid mechanism in order to salvage the subpoena power, on the assumption that the legislature preferred the Commission have some enforceable subpoena power rather than none. Pursuant to the rule of construction, because the grant of subpoena power “standing alone, [is] incomplete and [is] incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent,” the grant of subpoena power is also affected by the determination that the enforcement mechanism is invalid. Although it may have been “obvious” to the Commonwealth Court that the “broad intent was that the Commission should have power to subpoena and an enforcement procedure for making that power meaningful,” 84 Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. at 239 n. 2, <a href="/citations/?q=479%20A.2d%20655" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="479 A.2d 655">479 A.2d at </a>658 n. 2, it is for the legislature, not the courts, to determine what enforcement procedures should be adopted. In this regard it is noteworthy that the General Assembly clearly understood the distinctions between the procedures as is evidenced by the detailed, accepted method drafted for the Commission to pursue a grant of immunity, 71 P.S. § 1190.6 (Supp.1974). Furthermore, as previously noted, the legislature entirely repealed the prior specific statutory remedy for a witness’ refusal to obey a Commission subpoena. Finally, the legislature has provided other governmen<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>tal units with enforcement mechanisms other than contempt. <em>See e.g., </em>71 P.S. § 1285 (Water and Power Resources Board) (failure to give testimony or produce documentary evidence classified as misdemeanor punishable by fine up to $500 and/or imprisonment of one year). There is, therefore, no basis for an inference that the legislature was more concerned with a generally enforceable subpoena power than with the particular enforcement power attempted to be utilized here. Nor can it be inferred that this particular legislation having failed, the legislature would intend to apply the means of enforcement chosen by the Commonwealth Court and not another.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> In accordance with the rules of statutory construction, therefore, the court was bound to hold that the subpoena power, as granted to the Commission by the Act of 1978, is invalid in its entirety.</p>

V, § 10. It attempts to bring the grant of subpoena power in Section 4(7) back within the scope of the severability rule by creating the elements necessary to prevent the finding that “standing alone, [the grant of subpoena power is] incomplete and [is] incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.” This it does by purporting to merely adopt rules of procedure whereby the Commission could enforce its subpoenas.</p>

Nowhere in this section are the courts of this Commonwealth granted the power to impose the punishment of civil contempt for disobedience or neglect of the process of administrative agencies. In instances where like sanctions are deemed appropriate for such disobedience or neglect, the legislature either has authorized a court to <em>proceed as for </em>civil contempt (as was attempted with Section 7), or has specifically <em>granted jurisdiction </em>to the courts to punish for contempt, <em>see e.g., </em>Administrative Code § 520, 71 P.S. § 200. Any authority which the courts of this Commonwealth have to treat disobedience of agency subpoenas as contempt comes, and must come, from the Acts of the General Assembly.

As a practical matter, the restriction on the Commission’s investigative power is limited to those circumstances where testimony is sought to be compelled. However limited this power might seem compared to the sweeping powers desired by the Commission, it is nevertheless sufficient to allow the Commission to fulfill its statutory function, <em>see, </em>71 P.S. § 1190.4, which is, essentially, only advisory to the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Should the General Assembly deem it necessary for the Commission to have subpoena power to more effectively pursue its statutory duty, such can be readily accomplished by enactment of appropriate legislation which comports with constitutional requirements.
