Bethlehem’s damages for the alleged breach were stated at $95 million.

After reviewing the evidence, Superior Court held that the trial court’s finding as to the intent of the parties must be affirmed because it was supported by competent evidence and because the lower court had not abused its discretion. Superior Court also noted the lower court’s determination that the parties had not included the terms necessary to calculate the escalation in price referred to in the contract.

Concerning item # 12, the fact that Litton told a potential buyer of its Erie shipyard that there was a “certain agreement” between Litton and Bethlehem which was contained in various letters was merely a recognition that this potential purchaser had a right under the draft acquisition agreement to know of potential liabilities. Litton may or may not have thought there was a contractual obligation between the parties, but it had a contractual obligation to inform American Shipbuilding of the possibility that if it purchased the Erie yard, it might be buying a lawsuit.</p>

Once an escalation index is agreed upon and that is applied to the base price (here $20,400,000.00), then the parties must agree upon the amount to be escalated during each quarter of the contract. The reason for this is that if an apportionment schedule is constructed which requires the buyer to pay a larger percentage of the apportionment at the end of the contract period, when prices and costs have gone up because of inflation, the buyer will pay significantly more escalation dollars than if he had paid early in the contract period. Thus, it is in the shipbuilder’s interest to delay the apportionment schedule until the end of the contract period, but it is in the buyer’s interest to pay as much of the apportionment as possible in the early quarters. In one hypothetical calculation of delivered price based on 93% of the escalation amount being paid in the last quarter, the shipbuilder’s price, <em>using this variable alone to calculate the delivered price of one ship, </em>was $5,493,000 more than the buyer’s calculated price as indicated in one of the buyer’s exhibits.

Under these conditions, the parties can hardly be said to have agreed on what additional terms, if any, would be included in a contract.</p>

The point is that far from leaving open terms which could be easily filled by a court, the parties left open what amounted to gaping holes in a multi-million dollar contract that no one but the parties themselves could fill. There is no “reasonably certain” basis upon which any court could fill the gaps, and thus the trial court’s findings as to the open terms are supported by competent evidence of record.</p>

But even if contractual intent were assumed, the contract would fall for indefiniteness because the open terms may not be filled by the court on the required “reasonably certain” basis, or in fact, on any basis at all short of sheer speculation.</p>

Such an offer, if it states that it will be held open for a definite time, not in excess of a statutorily limited period, does not fail for lack of consideration, <em>i.e. </em>it is not revocable during the period set up to the statutory limit. This Code section limits the time a firm offer can be held irrevocable to three months. Option contracts, however, are not governed by 13 Pa.C.S. § 2205. The firm offer which Code § 2-205 makes irrevocable for a limited time is sometimes loosely called an “option,” but it has a different character than the option contract recognized at common law. The Code discloses no legislative intent to eliminate the option contract, with its requirement of consideration. Hence, the necessary distinction between the “option” which is in reality a firm offer and the option contract.</p>

The letter set forth in Exhibit PX-4 stated that its offer would be firm and irrevocable until December 31, 1968, five months beyond the U.C.C. limitation. Because Bethlehem did not accept within the three-month limit the Code sets, Litton’s firm offer became revocable after July 25, 1968. Bethlehem’s letter of December 31 may be treated as an attempt to accept the original offer. As an acceptance of a firm offer it came too late. If timely, however, as a common law acceptance of an unrevoked offer for an option contract, it required consideration. By conforming to the requirements of § 2205 Bethlehem could at best only tender a new firm offer, this one subject to Litton’s, not Bethlehem’s, timely acceptance. While Litton’s counter-signature on this December 31 letter from Bethlehem comes within the Code’s three-month irrevocability period if it is itself considered a firm offer and not an <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>acceptance of Litton’s expired firm offer, the underlying option contract must still be supported by consideration.</p>
    <p id="b252-4" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[283,439,1157,1217]]]'>Thus, although Litton’s counter-signature on this letter may arguably evidence an intent to accept a firm offer from Bethlehem and create an option contract, it is nevertheless ineffective to do so. Consideration was lacking because Bethlehem offered no payment or other consideration for the option contract, either in December of 1968 or at any time. In short, there was no exchange and Bethlehem remained free to act entirely in accordance with its own will, judgment and interest. It would bind Litton, while leaving itself free. The acceptance here did not supply consideration in the form of a promise because Bethlehem did not commit itself to purchase any vessels, or undertake any obligation. It was free to let the option lapse. This lack of consideration precludes the offer, firm or otherwise, from ripening into a contract by either party’s timely acceptance. This is so, not because Bethlehem’s promise was illusory or because there was no mutuality of obligation, but because Bethlehem made no promise at all. The simple problem with Bethlehem’s case is that it did not offer to buy any additional ships now or pay for the right to require Litton to make one in the future under the terms of Litton’s offer, whatever those terms may be. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 79 comment f; § 87.</p>

That document says “we hereby extend to you an offer to enter into an option agreement to have us construct for you from one to five additional vessels in accordance with the specifications covering the construction of a self-unloading boat carrier for Bethlehem Steel Corporation. (No. Y 917) Dated March 1968,____” By that language it becomes plain that there was no intention to make the option a part of an overall contract for the construction of ships but simply the exten<a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>sion of an offer to contract separately for additional ships. This becomes even plainer when we consider Litton’s agreement to the extension of an additional so-called shorter term option to Bethlehem for the purchase of two ships.</p>
    <p id="b253-4" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[235,546,1147,578]]]'>I agree with Bethlehem that it is unnecessary to have a separate consideration for an option which is part of one overall transaction, and that such an option need not be a part of the writing setting out the terms of the main agreement. It is necessary that both writings be intended as part of one overall agreement supported by a single consideration. No such intention appears from the language of PX-4 or its relationship to the other documents. Indeed, its language speaks to an irrevocable offer to enter into an independent option agreement. As such, that agreement required a separate consideration.</p>
    <p id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[230,1142,1150,898]]]'>I have also carefully considered Bethlehem’s argument that we can find consideration for an option contract in the form of promissory estoppel or detrimental reliance under § 90 of Restatement (Second) of Contracts. In that connection we are referred to expenses which Bethlehem “obviously incurred” in its efforts to obtain additional ships from Litton. These obvious expenses are not specified and for them we are referred only to Bethlehem’s offer to perform the obligations specified in the exchange of letters. However, these tenders of performance come approximately five years after December 31, 1968, the latest date on which the contract could have been created, leaving nothing to show significant detriment or restrictions on Bethlehem’s will during the intervening five years. Under such circumstances I do not believe § 90 furnishes a basis for finding the detrimental reliance which may be substituted for the consideration otherwise necessary to support this contract.</p>

In such cases the Code saves the contract by implying a good faith obligation <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>to agree more precisely on the nature of the indefinite term. We might speculate that good faith discussions by these parties would have produced mutual agreement on an index commonly acceptable for long term ship building contracts. However, no such further negotiation would supply consideration. It could have been supplied only if Bethlehem was required to pay or promise something. In the absence of Bethlehem’s payment or promise, a promise by Litton could not create a contract.</p>

This approach is erroneous in two respects. First, it is clear from the pleadings that Bethlehem sought recovery on the grounds that Litton had breached not simply a ship construction contract, but an option contract. Although the option agreement alleged had as its subject the construction and sale of ships, it must stand as a separate agreement for purposes of legal analysis. Given the nature of option agreements as being preliminary in relation to final agreements, the trial court’s blurring of the distinctions between the two was a fundamental error. Second, insofar as it sought to determine the intent of the parties regarding a ship construction contract, the trial court erred in failing to adequately distinguish between the alleged contract between the parties and the formal writing which was to evidence that contract. There is no dispute that the parties did not execute a final document containing all the terms which the parties contemplated would constitute their final ship construction agreement. To say this, however, is not to say that the parties did not have an enforceable contract. <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>Neither is it to say that the parties’ contractual intent as to ship construction is properly determined by viewing the evidence solely in relation to the documents which the parties had executed regarding the option agreement.</p>

In other words, by PX-4 Litton made an offer to Bethlehem to build up to five ships and gave Bethlehem the opportunity to make this offer irrevocable for a period of five years by offering an option agreement.

This issue need not be decided, however, because until the time when Bethlehem attempted to “exercise its option” and accept Litton’s offer to build ships, Litton never gave indication that it had revoked the offer. Indeed, following Bethlehem’s letter of August 21, 1973 (Defendant’s Exhibit 7B) indicating Bethlehem’s intention to exercise its option, Litton responded by letter on August 29, 1973 (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 36) stating what action it was taking on the basis of the option agreement.

The most significant fact is not that the important escalation clause of the ship construction contract was never agreed upon, or that the parties would not have executed a written ship construction contract without agreement on an escalation index. Rather the most important finding is that Bethlehem was willing to consider a number of indices for the escalation clause, but Litton “did not intend to develop any language regarding a proposed ship construction contract,” Findings of Fact 30, 31, 33; Opinion at 9-10. In effect, when Bethlehem sought to “exercise its option” by accepting Litton’s outstanding offer to build ships, Litton prevented execution of a ship construction contract by failing to bargain in good faith on the open terms. This constituted a breach of the agreement formed by Bethlehem’s 1973 letter acceptance of Litton’s offer contained in the letter of April 25, 1968 and renewed by Litton’s agreement to its restatement in the letter of December 31, 1968.</p>

Justice Flaherty’s Opinion in <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>Support of Affirmance similarly finds that “there is no ‘reasonably certain’ way to know which of the thousands of possibilities for constructing an index the parties would have agreed upon.” Slip op. at 22. Were the remedy being sought specific performance of a contract, these difficulties would indeed make the determination of an “appropriate remedy” well nigh impossible. Because there is an available remedy in monetary damages, however, the proper inquiry is not what the parties would have agreed to, but what is reasonable. The court’s role in this situation is not to form a contract as the parties would have done, but to determine a remedy for the wrongful failure of the parties to reach agreement. The result of this confusion is painfully demonstrated in the present case, where it is not even the entire price term which was left open, but only the “extras” to be added on to an already agreed upon price. The court would have no difficulty in determining from the stated base price of $20,400,000 per ship that an “appropriate remedy” for a breach involving three ships would be <em>at least </em>$61,200,000. Yet because of the open escalation clause of the price term, the result is that <em>no </em>remedy is awarded. I find this result to be absurd and unconscionable.</p>

The lower court having failed to reach the merits of count two of the counter-claim, that claim in assumpsit being premised upon a finding that a binding and enforceable agreement existed under the terms of PX-1, I would allow Litton to pursue count two of its counterclaim in the trial court upon remand.</p>

"Goods” is defined as “all things <em>(including specially manufactured goods </em>) which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale____" 13 Pa.C.S.A. § 2105. Litton argues that there is nothing of record to indicate whether the boat under construction would have been "moveable” at the time it was “identified to the contract.” We reject this notion. Although a sample contract was exchanged with the letter of April 25 which contains articles which deal with a payment schedule and the vesting of title — events related to identification — , since these matters were never finally agreed to, 13 Pa.C.S.A. § 2501(a)(2) governs the matter, and provides that when there is no contrary agreement of the parties, in a sale for future goods identification occurs when the goods are shipped or marked as goods to which the contract refers.
