The incumbent could not run because he was mandated to retire. The date of his mandatory retirement was known from the day he was born, seventy years before. Thus, we deemed the certain knowledge that a vacancy was mandated, a fact known and knowable to all well before any type of electoral process commenced, that on a given, ineluctable date a vacancy would occur, was sufficient to satisfy the need to know beforehand that a vacancy would exist; and we found that such certainty satisfied the intention and purpose of the ten month requirement. One may choose his resignation for a host of reasons, or be compelled by unanticipated causes, all of which can take the electoral process by surprise and swallow that reasonable period given the public to consider matters of such importance.

The vacancy resulted from the decision of the incumbent, Frank T. Hazel, to resign prior to the scheduled expiration of his six year term. At the time of his resignation the district justice seat was already designated by the Secretary as an office for which candidates were to be nominated, since by operation of law the incumbent was in his last year of office. Regardless of the Secretary’s designation the Governor appointed Richard Colden, Jr. to fill the vacancy. Subsequently, Albert J.

      <em>Barbieri </em>and <em>Berardocco </em>are clearly distinguishable from the present case. Here there was not an anticipated expiration of Judge Williams’ term prior to the ten month period. Judge Williams did not reach mandatory retirement age, and his term of office was not due to expire until 1990. The basis for the exception to the “ten month” provision carved out in the above cases, i.e., an anticipated expiration of an incumbent’s term, known to the public prior to ten months preceding the municipal election, does not exist in this case.</p>
    <p id="b774-6" data-blocks='[["BL_774.5",774,[234,1060,1156,955]]]'>Petitioner argues that despite this distinction, the instant case is consistent in principle with <em>Barbieri </em>and <em>Berardocco, </em>in that the certainty of the vacancy arose before the commencement of the electoral process. However, petitioner has mistakenly assumed that the electoral process commences on the date on which the Secretary of the Commonwealth is scheduled to send notice of the offices for which candidates are to be nominated. Although no specific commencement date can be assigned, the framers of Section 13 determined that the electoral process requires at a minimum a ten-month period to allow candidates and election officials ample time to prepare for both primary and municipal elections. <em>Berardocco, supra, </em><a href="/pa/469/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="469 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="1722063" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0452-01">469 Pa. at 457</a>, <a href="/pa/469/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="469 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="1722063" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0452-01">366 A.2d at 576</a>.
