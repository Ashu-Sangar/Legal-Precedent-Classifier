The trustee, Girard Bank (formerly Girard Trust Company, now Mellon Bank (East), N.A.), had claimed the credit, in the amount of $45,692.86, against trust principal to reflect the total of compensation which it had paid to itself quarterly <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>as compensation for its services as trustee during the twenty-nine years of the trust’s existence. The sole issue on appeal is whether the trustee’s compensation was properly to be treated as a charge against principal, or whether the trustee should have taken its compensation from the income of the trust.</p>

Schwenk, died on June 6, 1949, leaving a will dated August 28, 1947. The will appointed Girard Bank as executor and created a testamentary trust, of which Girard Bank was to serve as trustee. Girard Bank received full compensation for its role as executor, as distinguished from trustee, when, in 1951, the executor’s account was approved and duties as a trustee commenced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Under the terms of the trust, testatrix’s sister, Gertrude T. Kauffman, was given a life estate in the income of the trust, and, upon Kauffman’s death, Girard Bank was to distribute the principal, in equal shares, to remaindermen consisting of the surviving children of the sisters of testatrix’s deceased husband. Following the death of Gertrude T. Kauffman on December 18, 1979, the appellants, as the remaindermen of the trust, objected to the trustee’s final account on grounds that compensation for services as a trustee should have been taken from income of the trust, rather than from trust principal.</p>

We believe this language is clear and unambiguous, and that the terms of the testamentary trust could not have been more explicit in their directive to pay trustee’s fees out of the income of the trust. In view of this express language in the will, the contention of Girard Bank that the will permits payment of such fees out of the principal of the trust is patently without merit.</p>

    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[249,1075,1159,1260]]]'>Fee agreements, governing the amount and manner of a testamentary trustee’s compensation, have long been recognized as a valid means of governing terms of a testamentary trustee’s compensation that have not been set forth in the will itself. See, e.g., <em>Sinnott’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/231/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="231 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="973864" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0299-01">231 Pa. 299</a>, 302, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.%20363" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="80 A. 363">80 A. 363</a>, 364 (1911). See also, Decedents, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 7185(c) (1975). Thus, in the present case, where the amount of the trustee’s compensation was not set forth in the will which created the trust, and only the source of the trustee’s payment was so specified, there is no dispute as to the fact that Girard Bank’s Standard Fee Schedule controls the amount of the fees that the trustee could properly have claimed, since that Schedule was specified in the letter which testatrix signed and returned to Girard Bank. As to the source of the trustee’s compensation, however, the will was not silent, and its terms must be regarded as controlling because they clearly express the testatrix’s intent as to the funds from which the trustee should be paid. Indeed, it would be an anomaly to allow a fee agreement, a document not designed to express testamentary intent, to nullify the operative provisions of a subsequent will, where the subsequent will would have supplanted the earlier document even if the earlier document had been a will in itself.</p>

Rather, the Schedules have in effect combined the two types of commissions by providing for periodic payments of trustee’s compensation throughout the life of the trust, the magnitude of such payments being determined ás a percentage of trust principal.

That agreement explicitly provided that all trustee’s fees would be charged against the principal of the trust unless the testatrix otherwise directed at the time the agreement was made. The testatrix signed the contract and did not elect to designate a source of trustee’s compensation other than principal.
