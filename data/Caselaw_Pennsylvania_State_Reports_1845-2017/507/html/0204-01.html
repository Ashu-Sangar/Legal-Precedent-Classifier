The bus had stopped at the corner of West Baltimore Avenue and Runnemede Street, Lansdowne, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, for him to exit with two friends. While the bus waited, Gerald walked in front of the bus to cross West Baltimore Avenue and was hit by an automobile passing the bus on the bus driver’s side. As a result of the accident, Gerald sustained widespread and permanent injuries which have rendered him a quadraplegic. On January 2, 1980, Gerald’s parents, William J. Reilly and Elizabeth C. Reilly, instituted an action on their son’s behalf and in their own right against SEPTA, its bus driver, Vance Zieganfuss, and the driver of the automobile that struck Gerald, William M. Baker, and his mother, <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>Bernice S. Baker, owner of the automobile that William M. Baker was driving.</p>

Raymond Kremer, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, and a jury. After a three week trial, the jury returned its verdict on February 24, 1983, in favor of Gerald and awarded him $7,875,000.00 in damages. William Baker was found to be 65% negligent, SEPTA and Zieganfuss, 30% negligent, and Gerald, 5% contributorily negligent. Accordingly, the trial court reduced the verdict by 5% in compliance with the jury’s finding of contributory negligence and further reduced the verdict by $15,000.00, the amount of wage loss recoverable under the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Finally, the court added delay damages permitted by Pa.R.C.P. 238<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>, resulting in a molded verdict of $9,815,525.00.

SEPTA’s counsel, Stuart A. Schwartz, Esquire, had represented SEPTA in June of 1981 in <em>Farnese v. SEPTA and City of Philadelphia, </em>C.P. April Term 1976, No. 2249. A jury in that case returned a verdict against SEPTA for 3.65 million dollars. The personal bias SEPTA’s counsel alluded to allegedly occurred after verdict. During the oral argument of SEPTA’s post-trial motions before the court <em>en banc </em>in the <em>Farnese </em>case, the trial judge and Mr. Schwartz exchanged words concerning Mr. Schwartz’s sincerity, truthfulness and integrity while representing SEPTA. When Mr. Schwartz argued that the verdict was excessive, Judge Kremer recalled that after the verdict, Mr. Schwartz remarked to him that the verdict had not been excessive. Mr. Schwartz disagreed with Judge Kremer’s recollection denying he ever made such a statement and an exchange of insults ensued wherein each gentleman called the other untruthful.</p>

Mr. Schwartz delayed filing his recusal motion some eight months, until the very eve of trial, February 8, 1983, during jury selection and just after an exhaustive settlement negotiation had ended in failure. When asked why SEPTA was making its motion on the eve of trial, instead of back in June of 1982, pursuant to the Court’s order, Mr. Schwartz responded: “The permission which was granted in the order, I believe, expired before the order was received by us, Your Honor” (p. 24, February 8, 1983). Additionally, Mr. Schwartz argued that SEPTA’s right to file a recusal motion could not be forfeited at any time (p. 24).

Because of Mr. Daniels’ prior representation of Judge Kremer, SEPTA argued that it was improper to appear before him in this action.

Supporting this application were factual allegations that: (a) Mr. Haaz, his former law clerk: 1) is Judge Kremer’s step-nephew, 2) acted as an attorney in this case, 3) represented Judge Kremer in an unrelated case; (b) Judge Kremer (while a practicing attorney) had represented Mr. Haaz and his mother in a legal matter, and (c) that Robert Mongeluzzi, an attorney affiliated with Mr. Daniels’ law firm (Daniels, Golden and Saltz, P.C.) is the trial judge’s son-in-law.</p>

Superior Court reviewed SEPTA’s argument that Judge Kremer should have recused himself because of his alleged hostility and found this argument to have been waived, but also determined the argument to be without merit. Superi- or Court further determined that SEPTA’s post-trial argument that Mr. Daniels had at one time represented the trial judge as a member of a class to be insufficient to require Judge Kremer’s recusal.

To remand to Judge Kremer for a determination of his own bias, prejudice or impartiality, would be improper, Superior Court concluded, for three reasons. First, Judge Kremer had already determined his own non-bias. Second, Superior Court reasoned that the recusal standard was an objective one that created a burden to show only that a reasonable observer might question a judge’s impartiality, not that the trial court’s actions actually resulted in prejudice. In this regard, Superior Court established a rule of judicial administration that in any recusal motion, a different judge would be required to rule on the motion, because the judge being asked to recuse could not objectively address the issue of his impartiality.

Since the integrity of the fact finding process was insulated by the verdict of the jury, and since no ruling of the trial judge and no specific event or incident which occurred during the trial gave rise to any question as to the trial judge’s objectivity or to the propriety of his rulings, there can be no possible suggestion that the parties received anything less than a full, fair, and impartial trial.</p>
