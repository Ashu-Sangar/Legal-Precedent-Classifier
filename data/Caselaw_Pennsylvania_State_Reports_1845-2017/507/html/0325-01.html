Without a hearing the Commission had reversed its determination that probable cause for enforcement existed and closed its case file after conciliation had failed. The Commission asserts Commonwealth Court erred in holding that its determination of no probable cause is an “adjudication” and as <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>such generally appealable. The Department asserts that requiring it to defend against appellee’s claim both before the Commission as well as in a <em>de novo </em>action brought in Common Pleas exposes it to dual proceedings contrary to the statute. We hold that the Commission’s decision not to pursue appellee’s discrimination claim is the subject of a limited review in the nature of mandamus under Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> on the peculiar facts of this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> However, insofar as Commonwealth Court’s order directs the Commission to hold a full evidentiary hearing on the issue of probable cause, it is disapproved as an order compelling the exercise of discretion in a particular way and is, to that extent, inappropriate in actions in the nature of mandamus. <em>Hotel Casey Co. v.

In those cases, however, the agency’s refusal to act left a complainant with no other forum in which to assert his right. <em>See, e.g., O’Brien, supra </em>(denial of request for hearing is appealable); <em>Burgerhoff v.

Thus, those cases expressly or impliedly treat the order refusing agency enforcement as an “adjudication” under 2 Pa.C.S. § 101.

Such a limited standard is particularly appropriate where, as here, the order does not adjudicate an individual right and the individual, denied administrative aid in enforcing his right, retains a right to bring an action in Common Pleas. To impose a broader standard of review would force the Commission to create a full record supporting its decision to dismiss a single complaint, which it feels is meritless, among the myriad of complaints brought before it, to the detriment of its role in developing the law of discrimination.</p>

Rather than force that court to take evidence to develop the record the agency itself should have made, we will require the Commission to promptly respond to complainant’s request for preliminary hearing or reconsideration. If it denies the same, the Commission must supplement the administrative record in a manner sufficient to show orderly consideration of this matter under published rules, followed by the exercise of discretion by individuals with direct or properly delegated statutory authority to dismiss complaints for lack of probable cause or to reconsider a determination of probable cause where conciliation has failed.

That clause does not guarantee or require that full notice and hearing rights be afforded at every possible opportunity. The only requirement is that such rights be available before personal or property rights are taken. The Human Relations Commission's jurisdiction is somewhat unusual because its power to “adjudicate” personal or property rights is concurrent, for the most part, with Common Pleas. The Common Pleas action is an original <em>de novo </em>action, not one analogous to situations where appeals from Commonwealth agencies are heard in Common Pleas. When the Commission dismisses a complaint on a finding of no probable cause, an action in Common Pleas is always available. The addition in 1974 of this concurrent right to sue in Common Pleas allows the Commission to terminate certain complaints it deems meritless by providing the complainant required due process of law by an original action in Common Pleas. This frees the Commission to address only those cases in which it does find probable cause. Most agencies, on the other hand, are designed to be the exclusive forum for enforcing certain rights. <em>See, e.g., </em>43 P.S. § 211.8(a) (giving the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board exclusive jurisdiction over unfair labor practices as defined under state law); 66 Pa.C.S. § 501 (public utilities jurisdiction).</p>

    <p id="b478-7" data-blocks='[["BL_478.8",478,[274,1023,1154,1191]]]'>The majority in essence states that a decision not to exercise jurisdiction by the Human Relations Commission is of a non-adjudicative nature and, therefore, not properly subject to judicial review. With that premise, I am in full accord. The personal or property rights of the disappointed claimant are not affected. 2 Pa.C.S. § 101. The complainant is free to proceed in the Court of Common Pleas under section 12(c) of the Human Relations Act, Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, <em>as amended, </em>43 P.S. § 962(c), or under section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>. The majority opinion then proceeds to discuss the question as to whether or not there was in fact an exercise of discretion. I can find no basis in this record for such an inquiry since it is clear that there was a determination that the Commission, after investigation, would take no further action. That decision is the reason for this very law suit. To proceed further from this point is in fact a review of the manner in which that discretion was exercised which should not be the subject of judicial inquiry. A basic principle of administrative law is to give deference to the administrative agency. It would appear, therefore, that there would be no need for any further inquiry as to the manner in which the decision was reached.</p>
