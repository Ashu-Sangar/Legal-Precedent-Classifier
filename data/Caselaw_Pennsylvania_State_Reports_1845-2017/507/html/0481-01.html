The Court of Common Pleas had affirmed a decision of the Shrewsbury Township Zoning Hearing Board denying appellant’s request for a variance and rejecting its challenge to certain provisions of the Township’s zoning ordinance designed to preserve agricultural land.

The Board determined that the second proposal was inconsistent with Sections 5.03(1)(1), 5.04(1) and 5.04(4) of Shrewsbury’s zoning ordinance and refused to grant a validity variance from those provisions. Appellant appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of York County charging that the Board abused its discretion in denying the requested validity variance and, in the alternative, that the provisions of Shrewsbury’s zoning ordinance are exclusionary and confiscatory and therefore unconstitutional. Common Pleas affirmed the Zoning Hearing Board’s substantive determinations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Commonwealth Court likewise held the challenged provisions constitutional, concluding that they “bear a rational relationship to the stated goal of agricultural preservation and do not effect irrational or discriminatory results.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Clearly, meaningful preservation of agricultural land could not be achieved under this type of regulatory scheme. Moreover, a local legislative body could rationally conclude that an ordinance allowing one-half acre lots or so-called “clustering” of residential development would not serve the purpose of farmland preservation on the ground that a fifty-acre development of tract homes with attendant amenities could not co-exist compatibly with an adjacent productive farm.

The <em>Hopewell </em>decision set forth a further requirement that the extent of permissible residential development bear a reasonable relationship to tract size, though a <em>per se </em>requirement that the relationship be a perfect linear one was not imposed. Zoning restrictions, such as the ones which this Court invalidated in <em>Hopewell, </em>which constitute examples of governmental capriciousness and which operate to infringe the due process rights of property owners, will not be upheld in their application. As stated in <em>Hopewell, </em>499 Pa. at 255, <a href="/pa/499/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="499 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1778915" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0246-01">452 A.2d at 1341</a>, “The substantive due process inquiry, involving a balancing of landowners’ rights against the public interest sought to be protected by an exercise of the police power, must accord substantial deference to the preservation of rights of property owners, within constraints of the ancient maxim of our common law, <em>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. </em>9 Coke 59 — So use your own property as not to injure your neighbors.” Further, when the validity of a zoning restriction is challenged, “the function of judicial review ... is to engage in a meaningful inquiry into the reasonableness of the restriction on land use in light of the deprivation of landowner’s freedom thereby incurred.” <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>
      <em>Hopewell, </em>499 Pa. at 256, <a href="/pa/499/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="499 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1778915" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0246-01">452 A.2d at 1342</a>. Indeed, a zoning ordinance can be sustained only when the restrictions imposed thereby upon landowner rights are regarded as “clearly necessary” when balanced against the public interest sought to be protected. <em>Hopewell, </em>499 Pa. at 257-258, <a href="/pa/499/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="499 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1778915" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0246-01">452 A.2d at 1342-1343</a>. The important public interest in preserving prime agricultural land supports the restriction that has been placed upon appellant’s land, insofar as development has been limited to the creation of four dwellings upon appellant’s forty-three acre tract. Thus, the ordinance in question is valid as applied.</p>
