At issue is whether appellant was, in the language of the statute, “at liberty on parole” while in that program. We are handicapped in dealing with this issue of first <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>impression by a deficient factual record. Faced with those deficiencies we remand this case to the Board for development of a factual record sufficient for review of whether the Eagleville program is a prison equivalent precluding the conclusion that appellant was “at liberty on parole.” However, since appellant agreed to attend Eagleville as part of his parole program, his attendance there is presumed to be “at liberty on parole,” and on the remand it will be up to him to show that Eagleville’s in-patient drug treatment program presented an environment so restrictive that he should get credit for time spent in it. Moreover, the Board’s resolution of that issue seems to us largely in its discretion and should not be disturbed unless the record shows the Board’s action to have been arbitrary.</p>

We are therefore left with the need for a factual determination as to the nature of the Eagleville program and whether the restrictions on appellant’s liberty there were the equivalent of incarceration entitling him to credit for the time spent in the program. The majority of jurisdictions which allow credit on backtime for time spent in rehabilitation programs examine the specifics of the program to make this determination. <em>See Annot. </em><a href="/citations/?q=24%20A.L.R.%204th%20789" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="24 A.L.R. 4th 789">24 A.L.R.4th 789</a> (1983) (credit for back time on probation violations).</p>

It is appellant’s burden, on remand, to show the specific characteristics of the Eagleville program that constituted restrictions on his liberty sufficient to warrant credit on his recomputed backtime, and persuade the Board of that fact. Moreover, we will not interfere with the Board’s determination of that issue unless it acts arbitrarily or plainly abuses its discretion. <em>See 2 </em>Pa.C.S. § 704; <em>Bradshaw v.

The Majority is of the belief that we must determine whether the restrictions on Cox’s freedom at Eagleville were the equivalent of incarceration. In support of this, the Majority cites <em>Hines v.

If we would remand this case and find that Eagleville had bars on the windows, armed guards, and a moat surrounding its •grounds, would we then hold that Eagleville is the equivalent of prison, and give Cox credit for time spent there, since he would then not be considered to have been “at liberty on parole?” But what, then, of Mr. Hines, who was told that, although it may not have seemed so to him at the time, he was “at liberty on parole” while sitting in an actual prison?</p>

For example: Does Pennsylvania "impose” the requirement that a lawyer be a member of the State Bar before he can practice law? Or does a lawyer "agree” to become a member of the Bar as a special condition of his practicing law in Pennsylvania?
