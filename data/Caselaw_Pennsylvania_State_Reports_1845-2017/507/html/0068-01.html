They acknowledge their inability to point to any provision of the Act explicitly providing that a policy may not prohibit stacking. Moreover, it is evident that the Insurance Commissioner is of the view that a policy that prohibits stacking is not contrary to the Act, for the Commissioner has approved the Allstate policy. <em>See </em>31 Pa.Code § 66.101.

While no provision of the No-fault Act explicitly provides that a policy may <em>not </em>prohibit stacking, neither does any provision explicitly provide that a policy <em>may </em>prohibit stacking. This being so, the Antanovichs and Brendlingers argue, we must consider the public policy <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>underlying the Act.

First, the Superior Court draws an improper inference from the legislative Findings and Purposes. 40 P.S. § 1009.102. That court acknowledged the Finding stressed by appellants, that “the maximum feasible restoration of all individuals injured and compensation of the economic losses of the survivors of all individuals killed in motor vehicle accidents ... is essential to the humane and purposeful functioning of commerce,” 40 P.S. § 1009.102(a)(3), but was not convinced that this Finding mandated stacking of no-fault benefits in order to achieve “maximum feasible restoration ... and compensation----” In its view, that Finding was outweighed by <em>other </em>Findings expressing the need for “a statewide, <em>low-cost, </em>comprehensive <em>and fair </em>system” of compensation and restoration of motor vehicle accident victims and their survivors, 40 P.S. § 1009.102(a)(4), (a)(6) and (a)(9), and by the declared “policy of the General Assembly to establish at <em>reasonable cost </em>to the purchaser of insurance, a Statewide system of prompt and adequate basic loss benefits for motor vehicle accident victims and the survivors of motor vehicle accident victims.” 40 P.S. § 1009.102(b). In my view, the legislative Findings and Purposes are neutral as regards stacking and I am unpersuaded by the Superior Court’s reasoning to the contrary. This is so because, while allowing stacking of basic loss benefits might increase the “low-cost” of the system, on the one hand, prohibiting stacking would reduce the “maximum feasible restoration of all individuals injured and compensation of ... economic losses” on the other hand.</p>

I would hold that, in charging additional premiums for each vehicle when a single premium for basic loss benefits on one vehicle would have sufficed to provide the “reasonable” limits on basic loss benefits set forth in section 202, the insurance companies have “obligated” themselves to provide added loss benefits by stacking the coverages that have been paid for.</p>
