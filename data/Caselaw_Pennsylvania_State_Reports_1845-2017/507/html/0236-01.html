During Mr. Gold-hammer’s absence due to illness the president of Lessner, Henry J. Lessner, began to review the company’s bank statements and cancelled checks and discovered irregularities. It was determined that between November, 1974 and January, 1979, appellee had augmented his less-than-Fifteen Thousand-Dollar-($15,000)-per-year salary by some Two Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($220,000). He had, without authorization, signed his name and forged the signature of the company’s secretary-treasurer to fifty-six (56) corporate checks which he either cashed or deposited in his personal checking account. To conceal his crimes, appellee <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>falsified the company books to reflect that the checks were drawn to pay various company accounts.</p>

The Superior Court held that “[w]hen the Commonwealth seeks to toll the statute under this section, it must allege the exception in the information or otherwise apprise defendant within a reasonable time that it intends to toll the statute of limitations.” <em>Commonwealth v. Eackles, <a href="/pa-super/286/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="286 Pa.

Clearly the defendant must be given notice of the Commonwealth’s intention to seek to toll the statute of limitations. <em>See Commonwealth v. Stockard, </em><a href="/pa/489/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="489 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1762397" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0209-01">489 Pa. 209</a>, <a href="/pa/489/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="489 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1762397" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0209-01">413 A.2d 1088</a> (1980). Notice alone, however, is not dispositive. There remains the substantive requirement that the allegation must be a correct statement of the law. In other words, it must not only be pleaded that the offense contains a material element of fraud or breach of fiduciary duty, the definition of the offense must also include such an element. A contrary rule would undermine the policies underlying the two-year statute of limitations and, in effect, permit the Commonwealth to extend the statute of limitations for the prosecution of any offense merely by reciting in the information the boilerplate allegation that the offense contained a material element of fraud or breach of fiduciary duty, regardless of whether the offense charged in fact contains such an element.</p>

This argument misapprehends the posture of the instant appeal. The legitimacy of those judgments of sentence and their underlying convictions is not at issue. Rather, the Commonwealth is arguing that the Superior Court erred in failing to remand this case for resentencing upon its reversal of the convictions and sentences on the theft charges.
