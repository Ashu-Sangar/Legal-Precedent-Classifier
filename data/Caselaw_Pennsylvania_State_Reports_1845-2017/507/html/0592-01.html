A witness directly behind the Smith vehicle testified that the tractor-trailer went through the stop signs without stopping. (N.T. 164) The defendant Smith testified that he did not see the stop signs although he offered no excuse for failing to see them. (N.T. 21, 49, 51) The defendant Smith testified that he did not see the sign that read “Exit Speed 25 Miles Per Hour” and again offered no excuse for his failure to do so. (N.T. 49) Hence this court refuses to accept the jury’s apportionment of damages to the defendant Smith where he failed to follow posted traffic directional signs, ignored posted traffic speed signs, and states that he did not see either one of two stop signs even though the evidence clearly establishes that he should have seen those signs.”</blockquote>

The Superior Court instead, countered the argument by finding that expert testimony suggested that the highway junction was ill designed and therefore the jury could find justification for their apportionment of liability. The jury could and did do exactly that. That, however, begs the question before us; the question being whether the trial judge’s reasons for his act in granting a new trial were justified. If he was supported by facts of record, the very point of his grant is that, notwithstanding all the facts, certain facts are so clearly of greater weight that to ignore them or to give them equal weight with all the facts is to deny justice. We cannot find it wrong to believe that an inattentive driver barrelling into a marked exist ramp at 40-45 miles an hour, who did not stop for a “clearly visible” stop sign because he did not see it, and who was unable to control his vehicle at the intersection, is more at fault than those who maintain the road he was not sure he was on.</p>

Rather, any retrial is to be limited to the issue of apportionment of negligence against the three defendants, each of whom was found to be negligent to some extent. Finally, we note that in this appeal the Commonwealth has separately challenged the trial court's refusal to grant their motion for judgment N.O.V. A review of the record satisfies us that a jury could have properly found that the Commonwealth was partially liable for the accident in question. Therefore, we detect no error in the decision of the trial court.</p>

I write separately only to emphasize that the scope of review on appeal from a trial court’s decision to grant a new trial on the ground that the jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence is extremely narrow. “Where ... the court below has concluded that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the weight of the evidence and that the interests of justice require granting of a new trial, this Court is most hesitant to disturb such conclusion.” <em>Martin v. Arnold, </em><a href="/pa/366/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="366 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="8845189" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0128-01">366 Pa. 128</a>, 131, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%2099" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="77 A.2d 99">77 A.2d 99</a>, 101 (1951). Superior Court exceeded its scope of review when it reversed the order granting a new trial. When the trial court takes the extraordinary step of granting a new trial, appellate courts in general and Superior Court in particular are under the same compulsion to defer to the trial court’s discretion in granting the new trial as they would be in reviewing its denial. <em>Lobozzo v.
