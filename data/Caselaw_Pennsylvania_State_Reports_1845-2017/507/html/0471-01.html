An accompanying opinion confirmed the Chief Counsel’s advice that the Chairman, as Chief Executive Officer under the regulations adopted by the Commission on January 3, 1978, has implied power to pay valid obligations and hire necessary personnel within the Commission’s approved complement. Appellant Larson took his first appeal from this opinion and order, which this Court modified on September 12, 1984.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Following remand, the order now before us was entered by the Commonwealth Court panel on cross-motions for summary judgment. In an accompanying opinion the lower court purports to base this latest order on the inherent powers of the Vice Chairman as “chief executive officer” of the Commission during the existence of a vacancy in the office of Chairman and on our decision in <em>Fidelity Bank et al. v. Pa. Turnpike Commission, </em><a href="/pa/498/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="498 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1776198" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0080-01">498 Pa. 80</a>, <a href="/pa/498/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="498 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1776198" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0080-01">444 A.2d 1154</a> (1982).</p>

The record in <em>Fidelity Bank </em>showed that the vacancies then existing on the Commission had reduced it below the three members required by statute for a quorum. Act of May 21, 1937, P.L. 744, No. 211, § 4, <em>as amended </em>July 3, 1974, P.L. 444, No. 154, § 1, 36 P.S. § 652d (Supp. 1984-1985). By contrast, the affidavits and other materials available to the lower court on the motions for summary judgment in this record are plainly insufficient to resolve the factual issue of whether the Commission’s very existence is threatened by a continuing impasse. We note, however, that the turnpike did not cease operations from March 5, 1984 to August 28, 1984, while Commonwealth Court held this case without action.</p>
