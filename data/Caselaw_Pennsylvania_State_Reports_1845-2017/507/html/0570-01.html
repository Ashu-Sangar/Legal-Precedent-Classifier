However, we are not persuaded that either method of allocating a credit week to one base year or the other is necessary, or is indicated by the statute.

The Board, in addition to arguing that the promulgation in question qualifies as a statement of policy, also urges in the alternative that if the instant pronouncement does constitute a regulation, it is an interpretative regulation rather than a legislative regulation, and is therefore not subject to compliance with the Commonwealth Documents Law. <em>See Uniontown Area School District v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, </em><a href="/pa/455/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="455 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="582037" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0052-01">455 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=313%20A.2d%20156" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="313 A.2d 156">313 A.2d 156</a> (1973). Since, however, we held in that case (and appellant concedes) that interpretative regulations depend for their validity solely upon the willingness of a reviewing court to decide that they in fact track a statute’s meaning, and since our decision is to the contrary here, we need not resolve that question.</p>

The effect of today’s holding is to say that no absolute method of allocating a credit week to a base year is mandated by the statute. Rather, it is possible for one calendar week to provide the basis for two distinct credit weeks, attributable to distinct base years. However, we emphasize that under no circumstances can one calendar week yield two credit weeks countable towards the same base year. Such a result is clearly proscribed by the statute.</p>
