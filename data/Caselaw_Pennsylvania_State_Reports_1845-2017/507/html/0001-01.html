In early December, 1980, the Board of Appeals concluded that HUP was neither a charitable organization nor engaged in manufacturing, and issued a decision denying the petition for refund. On petition for review of that decision, the Board of Finance and Revenue entered an order on May 27, 1981 affirming the denial of the petition for refund. Upon consideration of HUP’s petition for review of the order of the Board of Finance and Revenue, the Commonwealth Court, 75 Pa.Cmwlth. 154, <a href="/citations/?q=461%20A.2d%20894" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="461 A.2d 894">461 A.2d 894</a> (1983), affirmed that order reaching the same conclusions as the Board of Appeals of the Department of Revenue.

In 1963 an association of hospitals known as the Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania (“Hospital Council”) voluntarily embarked upon HUP under which participating hospitals prepare a statistical abstract of the medical record of each patient upon discharge. The statistical abstract includes such information as admission and discharge data, medical diagnosis, treatment, length of stay and the treating physician. This information is then collated and computerized, and complete reports are disseminated to area hospitals so that each institution can compare its utilization <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>statistics for particular diagnosis with those of other hospitals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

By 1967, however, HUP had become financially secure and the Hospital Council and the medical societies withdrew from the project. The hospitals themselves then undertook to fund HUP through direct payment to HUP for its services. Thus, from 1967 to the present, HUP has been solely financed through a fee-for-services arrangement.</p>

Even if such facts were shown, it would not follow that the dormitories of the plaintiff’s building were a public charity. In some of the earlier opinions of this court discussing tax exemption of alleged charitable institutions the latter are sometimes described in language which fails to furnish a practicable formula for determining in every instance whether an institution falls within the classification of one “of purely public charity.” A judicial desire to be liberal toward institutions which are doing praiseworthy public work has sometimes led the courts to invest the word “charity,” as used in the above excerpt from the Constitution, with a meaning not warranted either lexicologically or by a consideration of the ideology of the constitutional provision invoked. Webster’s New International Dictionary, 2d edition, defines a “charity” (in the institutional sense) as “an organization or institution engaged in the free assistance of the poor, incapacitated, distressed, etc.” Under this definition the characteristics of an organized charity are: <em>First, whatever it does for others is done free of charge, or at least so nearly free of charge as to make the charges nominal or negligible; second, that those to whom it renders help or services are those who are </em>

HUP premises its argument on the fact that while it was characterized as a joint venture of the Hospital Council and the Allegheny County Medical Society Foundation, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Sales and Use Tax granted it tax exemption in 1965. At that time, however, HUP was not incorporated as a nonprofit corporation; it was being sponsored by two entities with charitable status. As set forth in the facts, HUP is no longer funded by charitable contributions from medical societies. It is now being solely financed through a fee-for-services arrangement. The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue now has the power to review HUP’s charitable exemption in light of the fact that circumstances have changed significantly since its grant of exemption nearly twenty years ago. Thus, in this action, HUP stands on its own as a nonprofit corporation, and the 1965 determination by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Sales and Use Tax is not controlling.</p>

Unlike direct payments for health care, the type of research service provided by HUP is not one traditionally done by the government. Although government agencies utilize the information provided by HUP in the administration of Medicare and Medicaid programs, this fact does not support HUP’s contention that but for HUP, the government itself would engage in this research activity. HUP also has not established that the government currently performs this function in areas outside of its geographic scope. In fact, as previously noted, for-profit corporations, such as McAuto, a subsidiary of McDonnell-Douglass Corporation, and Quality Care Review, Inc. have entered the health data record processing field.</p>
