        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nWe granted the petition for permission to appeal of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania State Police, and John Balshy, Dean Shipe, Joseph Van Nort and John Holtz, individual Troopers of the Pennsylvania State Police, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 702 and Pa.R.A.P. 1311 et seq., from an interlocutory order of Commonwealth Court, 475 A.2d 182, retransferring to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County a matter which had previously been retransferred from Common Pleas Court to Commonwealth Court, to decide which forum has subject matter jurisdiction of the underlying controversy. For the reasons which follow, we hold that exclusive, original subject matter jurisdiction is vested in the Court of Common Pleas.\nThe incidents on which the instant civil action is founded occurred during the investigation and prosecution, from approximately April 24, 1979 until appellee\u2019s acquittal on September 26, 1979, of criminal charges in connection with a homicide. After his acquittal, appellee commenced the instant civil action against appellants in Commonwealth Court. The complaint avers causes of action against all appellants under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 for violations of appellee\u2019s civil rights by the Troopers\u2019 allegedly obtaining a search warrant based on falsehood; obtaining an arrest warrant without probable cause; preventing appellee from seeing his counsel; fabricating, destroying or concealing evidence in the murder trial; and assaulting and battering appellee. Appellee seeks damages from the Commonwealth and the Pennsylvania State Police for failure to exercise due care in selecting, training and controlling the state troopers. He also seeks damages for battery, false imprisonment, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation.\nBelieving the action to be controlled by \u00a7 761(a)(1) of the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, as amended, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 761(a)(1) (Supp.1984-1985), which generally vests in Commonwealth Court original jurisdiction of all civil actions against the Commonwealth government and its officers in their official capacity, on April 24, 1981 appellee filed a complaint in trespass in Commonwealth Court. That court, under 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 761(a)(l)(iv) (1981) (since amended), which provided an exception to the jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court in \u201cactions or proceedings in trespass as to which the Commonwealth government formerly enjoyed sovereign or other immunity,\u201d sua sponte transferred the matter to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. On September 20, 1983, Common Pleas Court ordered the matter retransferred to Commonwealth Court inasmuch as Common Pleas Court could find no exception to the exclusive original jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court under \u00a7 761 for civil rights actions. We disapprove the practice of Courts of Common Pleas refusing jurisdiction and attempting to \u201cre-transfer\u201d matters to Commonwealth Court. The proper practice in cases such as this one would be for Common Pleas Court to dismiss the action and for the parties to take an appeal. No appeal was taken. The statute having, in the interim, been amended, Commonwealth Court then reconsidered its original order in light of the amended \u00a7 761(a)(l)(v), and again ordered the matter transferred to Common Pleas Court. On motion of the Commonwealth, the matter was certified for interlocutory appeal under 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 702.\nBoth appellants, by the Attorney General, and appellee, by his counsel, have argued that jurisdiction of the underlying controversy is in Commonwealth Court under 42 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 761(a), and that paragraph (v) does not provide an exception to that court\u2019s jurisdiction. Based on our analysis of this particular case, the result would be no different if the matter were decided on \u00a7 761(a)(l)(iv) of the 1980 amendment.\nThe pertinent statutory provision is as follows:\n\u00a7 761. Original Jurisdiction\n(a) General Rule. \u2014 The Commonwealth Court shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions or proceedings:\n(1) Against the Commonwealth government, including any officer thereof, acting in his official capacity, except:\n(iii) actions or proceedings conducted pursuant to Chapter 85 (relating to matters affecting government units) [dealing with sovereign, governmental and official immunity];\n... and\n(v) actions or proceedings in the nature of trespass as to which the Commonwealth government formerly enjoyed sovereign immunity and actions or proceedings in the nature of assumpsit relating to such actions or proceedings in the nature of trespass.\n(b) Concurrent and exclusive jurisdiction. \u2014 The jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court under subsection (a) shall be exclusive except as provided in section 721 (relating to original jurisdiction [of the Supreme Court])____\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 761.\nFirst, we affirm the order of Commonwealth Court that, as to those counts against the individual Troopers, Commonwealth Court lacks jurisdiction. The term \u201cofficer\u201d as used in \u00a7 761(a)(1), which confers on Commonwealth Court original jurisdiction of all civil actions against officers of the Commonwealth acting in their official capacity, has not been defined by the Legislature. Guided by the principle of statutory construction that words and phrases be construed according to their common and approved usage, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1903(a), in Forney v. Harrisburg State Hospital, 18 Pa.Commw.Ct. 17, 21, 336 A.2d 709, 711 (1975), Commonwealth Court distinguished Commonwealth officers from ordinary Commonwealth employees, describing officers as those persons to whom are delegated some of the sovereign functions of government, and employees as persons who merely exercise subordinate ministerial functions. More recently the definition of \u201cofficer,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 761, has been refined to include \u201cthose persons who perform state-wide policymaking functions and who are charged with the responsibility for independent initiation of administrative policy regarding some sovereign function of state government.\u201d Opie v. Glascow, Inc., 30 Pa.Commw.Ct. 555, 559, 375 A.2d 396, 398 (1977). The basis for this refinement was Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that it was not the intent of the General Assembly to confer on that Court original jurisdiction over cases where local courts can much more conveniently and properly make the determination as to the liability of state employees who function on an essentially local or regional basis. Id. Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusions were expressly approved by our Court. Rhines v. Herzel, 481 Pa. 165, 169, 392 A.2d 298, 300-301 (1978); Kulik v. Stotelmyer, 481 Pa. 57, 59, 391 A.2d 1313, 1314-1315 (1978). Although State Troopers may be commonly known as \u201cofficers of the law,\u201d as their duties do not involve the statewide formulation or administration of policy, they are not \u201cofficers\u201d for purposes of conferring jurisdiction on Commonwealth Court under \u00a7 761. Thus, the actions against the individual state troopers are clearly not within the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court.\nThe more difficult question is whether Commonwealth Court has original jurisdiction with respect to the counts against the Commonwealth. Commonwealth Court held that these claims fall within the exception to that Court\u2019s jurisdiction \u201cfor actions or proceedings in the nature of trespass as to which the Commonwealth government formerly enjoyed sovereign or other immunity.\u201d \u00a7 761(a)(l)(v). Resolution of this question is aided by analysis of the evolution of \u00a7 761 in its historic context, which shows that in every instance where the sovereign\u2019s immunity from tort liability was limited, the General Assembly immediately took action designed to vest jurisdiction of the new causes of action allowed against the sovereign in Common Pleas Court.\nThe Commonwealth Court was created in the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1968.

V, \u00a7 4 of that document provides that the Commonwealth Court \u201cshall have such jurisdiction as shall be provided by law.\u201d This section was implemented by the General Assembly by passage of the Commonwealth Court Act, Act of January 6, 1970 (1969 P.L. 434, No. 185), \u00a7 8, repealed and replaced by the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, \u00a7 401, subsequently replaced by the Judiciary Act of 1976, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 761, as amended. The effect of the Commonwealth Court Act and its successors was to vest in the Commonwealth Court jurisdiction of those actions against the Commonwealth which were formerly brought in the' trial court for the seat of government, to-wit, the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Emhart Corp., 443 Pa. 397, 400, n. 1, 278 A.2d 916, 917, n. 1 (1971), appeal dismissed, 404 U.S. 981, 92 S.Ct. 451, 30 L.Ed.2d 364 (1971).\nThe Commonwealth Court Act provided, with exceptions not here relevant, for exclusive original jurisdiction in Commonwealth Court of (1) \u201call civil actions and proceedings against the Commonwealth, but this clause shall not be construed as a waiver by the Commonwealth of immunity to suit,\u201d and (2) \u201call civil actions and proceedings against officers of the Commonwealth in their official capacity.\u201d Section 8(a)(2)(ii) and (iii). Approximately one year later, and again in 1976, this provision was substantially reenacted in \u00a7 401 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, supra, and \u00a7 761 of the Judicial Code, supra. At the time of all these enactments, the Commonwealth and high public officials acting within the scope of their authority enjoyed absolute immunity from tort liability, Matson v. Margiotti, 371 Pa. 188, 88 A.2d 892 (1952) (overruled as to the issue of the Attorney General\u2019s common law powers Commonwealth v. Schab, 477 Pa. 55, 383 A.2d 819 (1978). By definition, all officers of the Commonwealth, for purposes of conferring original jurisdiction on Commonwealth Court, were also high public officials and immune from tort liability. Thus, actions filed against the Commonwealth and its officers acting in their official capacity, although within the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court, routinely resulted in dismissal on the grounds of immunity from liability, and did not culminate in conduct of trials in that forum. Claims against other defendants, which were joined in the original action, were transferred to an appropriate Court of Common Pleas for trial. See, Wallace v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Public Welfare, 32 Pa.Commw. 615, 380 A.2d 930 (1977) and Bass v. Cuyler, 36 Pa.Commw.Ct. 74, 387 A.2d 964 (1978). But see Freach v. Commonwealth, 471 Pa. 558, 370 A.2d 1163 (1977) (where Section 603 of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966 was held to authorize suits against the Commonwealth departments and agencies and certain Commonwealth officers.) As the Commonwealth Court Act and its successors were passed at a time when the Commonwealth and its officials acting within the scope of their official duties had absolute immunity from tort actions, it becomes apparent that when the General Assembly established Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction of actions against the Commonwealth and its officers, that body could not have envisioned that the Commonwealth Court would become a forum for the routine trial of tort claims.\nWhen, in 1978, this Court abrogated the doctrine of sovereign immunity, Mayle v. Pa. Depart. of Highways, 479 Pa. 384, 388 A.2d 709 (decided July 14, 1978), the General Assembly, by what has been termed \u201can impressive feat of legislative efficiency,\u201d Bershefsky v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Public Welfare, 491 Pa. 102, 106, n. 3, 418 A.2d 1331, 1333, n. 3 (1980) (Mr. Justice Nix, dissenting), immediately created statutory sovereign immunity by Act of September 28, 1978, P.L. 788, No. 152, immediately effective, formerly 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5101 et seq., presently found at 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8501 et seq. (1982). Act 152 expressed a clear intent of the General Assembly to bar all actions which accrued prior to the date of its enactment. Act 152, which responded to this Court\u2019s decision in Mayle, supra, and attempted to bar all tort actions against the Commonwealth except in certain limited circumstances enumerated therein, also provided an additional exception to Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction for \u201cactions on claims in which sovereign immunity has been waived pursuant to section 5110 (relating to limited waiver of sovereign immunity)----\u201d Act 152 further provided that the proper forum for actions against the Commonwealth, as to which immunity was waived under \u00a7 5110 was the Court of Common Pleas, and that proper venue was \u201cin a county in which the principal or local office of the Commonwealth agency is located or in which the cause of action arose or where the transaction or occurrence took place out of which the cause of action arose.\u201d Thus, it appears that once sovereign immunity was abrogated, paving the way for actions for tort liability against the Commonwealth to be brought in Commonwealth Court, the General Assembly immediately took action to remove from Commonwealth Court the responsibility for any resulting routine tort litigation.\nThe retroactivity of Act 152 quickly fell under constitutional attack, and the intent of the Legislature, that no tort litigation be brought in Commonwealth Court, was frustrated when this Court refused to give Act 152 retroactive effect. Gibson v. Commonwealth, 490 Pa. 156, 415 A.2d 80 (1980). The refusal of this Court to apply Act 152 retroactively resulted in an anomaly: Tort claims against the Commonwealth as to which the General Assembly had waived sovereign immunity by Act 152 fell within an exception to Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction and were, thus, properly commenced in Common Pleas Court, while tort actions brought against the Commonwealth as to which the General Assembly had not waived sovereign immunity by Act 152 were properly commenced in Commonwealth Court. In 1980, \u00a7 761, was amended again to provide an additional exception to Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction for \u201cactions or proceedings in trespass as to which the Commonwealth government formerly enjoyed sovereign or other immunity.\u201d This Amendment was retroactive to June 27, 1978, the effective date of the Judicial Code and the first enactment of \u00a7 761. Act of December 5, 1980, P.L. 1104, No. 189, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 7.\nThus, we see that each time it became apparent to the General Assembly that actions for tort liability could be maintained against the Commonwealth or its officers in Commonwealth Court the General Assembly amended \u00a7 761 to provide that those actions be brought in Common Pleas Court and not in Commonwealth Court. This leads us inescapably to the conclusion that there exists a legislative intent that all actions against the Commonwealth or its officers acting in their official capacity, asserting tort liability, are outside the original jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court.\nThe final question for our consideration then is whether the instant controversy is an \u201caction or proceeding in the nature of a trespass\u201d under \u00a7 761(a)(l)(v). The parties have raised no question whether the action against the Commonwealth and the State Police for failure to exercise due care in selecting, training and controlling the individual troopers, and the action for battery, false imprisonment, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation are actions in the nature of trespass. The parties argue that the actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 are not actions in the nature of a trespass because they are based on statutory and not common law remedies. We reject this argument.\nUnder early English common law practice, actions at law were commenced by issuance of a writ which authorized the law court in which the action was directed to be brought to assume jurisdiction of the action and which enforced the appearance of the defendant. The number and forms of those writs were limited and strictly prescribed, and no action could be brought unless it could fit into the form of some recognized writ. An action in trespass would lie \u201cfor redress in the shape of money damages for any unlawful injury done to the plaintiff, in respect either to his person, property, or rights, by the immediate force and violence of the defendant.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY, Rev. 4th Ed. 1674 (1968). An action of trespass was directed at serious and forcible breaches of the King\u2019s peace vi et armis, whether for injuries to person or to property, of a kind likely to provoke immediate retaliation. Where a writ of trespass did not afford a remedy under the particular facts of the case, the plaintiff had to bring a special action on his own case. This gave rise to the name \u201caction on the case\u201d. Thus, trespass on the case, or an action on the case, became a supplement to the parent and generic action of trespass. It was designed to afford a remedy for wrongful conduct resulting in injuries which were not forcible or direct. PROSSER on TORTS, 4th ed., 28-29 (1971).\nAlthough characterization of actions according to these ancient writs remained viable in early Pennsylvania pleading and practice, this practice has long since been abandoned. Since the Act of May 25, 1887, P.L. 271, \u00a7 2, all actions ex delicto, which had formerly been recoverable in trespass or trespass on the case, were sued for and recovered in an \u201caction of trespass.\u201d\nThe remedies available under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985, which provide that every person who acts under color of state law to deprive another of a constitutional right, and that persons who conspire for the purpose of depriving any person of the equal protection of the laws shall be answerable to the plaintiff in an action for damages, clearly create a species of tort liability. As such, these claims are pressed in a civil action, sounding in trespass, and the parties\u2019 argument that actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 are not actions in the nature of a trespass is totally without merit.\nWe hold today the clear intent of the General Assembly is that actions against the Commonwealth or its officers acting in their official capacity for money damages based on tort liability are outside the original jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court and are properly commenced in the Courts of Common Pleas.\nOrder of Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nHUTCHINSON, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\u00a7 1921.
