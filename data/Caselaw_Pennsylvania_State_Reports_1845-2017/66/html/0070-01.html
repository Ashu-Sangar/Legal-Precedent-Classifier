J., in delivering the opinion of the court, said: * * * “ The first and very serious objection to the sufficiency of this affidavit is, that it does not negative the fact of notice of the settlement at the department, although that is averred in the <em>narr. </em>to have been given within thirty days after the same was made, and a copy thereof sent to the company. Besides the law would presume that the officers did their duty, and they were required to give notice.” * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.7",71,[176,1218,1166,1244]]]'>“ The appeal in this case was tendered and offered to be taken on the 20th of July, which is in time so far as regards the notice by suit, but the auditor-general refused the appeal on the ground that actual notice had been given. This is also averred in the <em>narr., </em>and not answered by the affidavit as already stated. We must, therefore, as regards this affidavit, take it as conclusive that the defendant was duly notified and failed to appear in time; the consequence is, it is concluded by the settlement. Can this court take into consideration the repeal of the laws under which the tax was assessed ? We think not, if the settlement is conclusive. It is just as fixed and determined as the judgment of a court. It is said, however, that the laws having been repealed under which these taxes were assessed, there was a total want of jurisdiction, and the action of the state officers is a nullity. They certainly had general jurisdiction over the subject of taxes assessed against this corporation, and to determine for what years the same was due. If they decided erroneously, either as to particular years, or the general amount, the mode of redress was by appeal. The affidavit of defence, which should be full in all of its parts, does not even state that one had been taken or offered. A few words as to the effect of the repealing the laws under which a portion of these taxes were assessed for the years 1866 and 1867. * * * The legislature in consolidating all of the tax laws against corporations, inadvertently repealed the former statutes without providing for collecting the outstanding taxes assessed under the repealed laws. We have no doubt that it was not the intention of the legislature to exonerate or discharge the debtors to the government, but the legislature designed that the new laws should go into effect at the time the old ones ceased to act.” * * *</p>

It would be difficult to answer the argument of the plaintiff in error, if the repeal contained in the 16th section of the Act of May 1st 1868 were absolute. It is not, however, the repealing clause being qualified so as to repeal former acts only so far as they are altered and supplied by the Act of May 1st 1868. If we examine the Act of May 1st 1868 we shall find it entirely prospective in its operation, and consequently prospective only in its repeal; for it is only in this respect the act alters and supplies former acts. <em>Hereafter, </em>says the 1st section, no company shall go into operation without being registered. <em>Hereafter, </em>says the 2d section, it shall <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>be tbe duty of corporation officers to make tbe annual returns required for taxation. So in all tbe following sections tbe language imports future action. Tbe Act of May 1st 1868 was drafted and reported by a commission consisting of tbe auditor-general, secretary of tbe Commonwealth and state treasurer, under tbe Act of 12th April 1867, “to revise, collate and digest all public acts and statutes regulating and relating to the system of taxation.” It is not likely that gentlemen so familiar with tbe system of state taxation of corporations would intend an absolute repeal, and a consequent loss of all former uncollected taxes. , No doubt tbe repealing clause was drafted in terms to avoid this effect, and therefore to extend no farther than tbe act itself was intended to operate, to wit, upon future taxation. Hence tbe qualified language of tbe clause. Tbe settlement of accounts and tbe proceedings to enforce payment do not depend upon the laws repealed, but upon general laws, not repealed.</p>
    <p id="b73-6" data-blocks='[["BL_73.6",73,[358,1139,920,44]]]'>Tbe judgments in those cases are therefore affirmed.</p>
