The legislature, recognising the advantages of municipal organization to the inhabitants, gave this local taxation to aid in raising the necessary revenue to defray the city expenditure. The assessment is upon all goods sold in said city, to be levied and collected from the venders of said articles. This clearly covers goods in the warehouse of the defendants, sold by them, and the tax is to be collected from them by the very words of the law, for they are the venders of the articles.</p>
