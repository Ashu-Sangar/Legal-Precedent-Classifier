On the 15th day of April 1864 this lease was made, by which it was agreed to pay 10 per cent, per annum to the stockholders of the company on the par value of the stock, <em>excepting the amount owned at the time of each payment by the </em>lessee, and the tenant to <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>pay all taxes. This sum of 10 per cent, was the amount on which the tax on capital stock must be computed under the various Acts of Assembly. No returns were made to the auditor-general by the Atlantic and Ohio Company or its lessee for the years 1864, 1865, 1866 and 1867, until produced by repeated solicitations; but in October 1867 Mr. Shillingford, the treasurer, made his report under oath, as required by law, showing that 10 per cent, dividends were made on the capital stock, that being the sum paid by him to each stockholder, except the Western Union Company, which settled its affairs in its own way. The amount of its dividends was not furnished to the treasurer to be paid out. The company was subject to a penalty of 10 per cent, on each year’s taxes for its neglect to report. This was included in the settlement ; and as to the exaction of the penalty, no exception is taken in the specifications,'consequently that is not in the issue. The return made by the treasurer is primá facie correct and binding on the company, until a mistake is clearly proved. The error is attempted to be established by showing that the Western Union Company made no profits equal to 10 per cent, dividends on the stock of the Atlantic and Ohio Company. Only about one-half of that sum was divided among its stockholders on its whole lines, nor would this company, if standing alone, have made such profits. It is conceded that the outstanding stock was paid that amount; but it is said that the contract would not have been made but for the privilege of absorbing the stock of that company, as provided in the lease. [We are unable to see how, that stock is absorbed. If the individual stockholders transferred to the Western Union after the lease, that company, if it can hold it at all, retains it intact, — it still remains the stock of the Atlantic and Ohio Company, and is entitled to its 10 per cent, dividends. If sold to others, the purchasers could demand the 10 per cent, according to the lease, and if no dividends are claimed on the stock by the Western Union Company, the state has the right to treat the stock as of the value paid to those receiving dividends.] We greatly doubt the right of the Western Union Company to buy this stock, as no authority is shown in its charter to make such purchases: but even if it could be held by its officers as trustees, it is still outstanding, and entitled to the dividends. By such a purchase the value of stock in a Pennsylvania corporation cannot be destroyed or lessened, so as to affect the right of the state to its taxes. The state is not bound to accept the dividends made by a corporation it never chartered in lieu of one of its own creation. [We are of the opinion that the amount of dividends paid to the stockholders of the Atlantic and Ohio Company is the true and proper evidence of the vaiue of the stock under the Act of Assembly; that no sufficient evidence is shown of any error in the report of the treasurer, which must, <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>under all of the circumstances, be taken to have been correct, and therefore your verdict must be in favor of the Commonwealth for the amount fixed by the settlement, as it is conceded to have been predicated of that return. On the sum so found due you will compute interest for the time and at the rate fixed by the Act of Assembly to which we have referred.”]</p>

We think it did not. In looking at the (question before us, confusion begins only when we allow our attention to be attracted to the relation existing between the Atlantic and Ohio Company and the Western Union Company. But what has the state to do with the last-named company in enforcing her claim upon the former ? Literally nothing. She is dealing with her own corporation, and acting solely on the evidence of its doings in regard to the subject of its liability to taxes, viz., dividends made or declared. This is shown by its proper officer, the treasurer, in his return to the auditor-general; and the basis of that return is the dividends declared and paid. The company admits by its instrument under seal, that its stockholders are to receive from another company, for the use of its lines, money enough to enable it to divide 10 per cent, amongst all its stockholders, except stock held by its lessee. The latter chose to pay itself what it pleased. Was not this contract and its execution sufficient to.prove a proper basis of calculation in regard to all the stock ? Any other basis would have been wrong in regard to the state. She had nothing to do with the trades and bargains between these two companies. She has a mode of estimating and' collecting her taxes from her own corporations, no matter who holds the stock. By whomsoever the stock is held the measure of the tax is upon the dividends declared, and no such thing as partial dividends is ever to be presumed. When a dividend is declared, that gives the measure and furnishes the <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>rule for the tax.
