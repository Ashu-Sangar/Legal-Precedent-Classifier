First: Can the legislature impose the tax ? and, second: Is it done by our laws ? The power to tax rests upon necessity, and is inherent in every sovereignty. It is unlimited in extent, except by express constitutional prohibition, and in amount is co-extensive with the wants and necessities of the government. It applies to every species of property or rights, either created or protected by the law; and although it may not be imposed upon, or enforced against, the persons of <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>individuals not amenable to, or protected <em>by, the </em>laws of the state, yet it may against every species of property or rights which come within the limits of the Commonwealth. This corporation derives its franchises, in part, from Pennsylvania legislation; all of its property within the state is protected by our laws, and although the creditors of the company are beyond our borders, yet their debts, and the effects from which they must be paid, the <em>franchises and corpus </em>of the railroad, are under state jurisdiction and protection, and the holder of the obligation must depend upon our laws for its collection. What would his debt be worth if he could not look to our laws for its enforcement ? And the very property which stands as its security was created, and is upheld, by our authority. We think that it would be impossible to doubt the power of the state to tax the stock of the non-resident corporator in this road, or at least so much of it as is constructed in Pennsylvania, and to enforce payment if necessary by a seizure of the property and franchises of the corporation: and why should not the same right exist against the debts with which the road was built ? They equally have and require the protection of our laws, and the principle of taxation is correlative with protection.</p>

By the Act of May 1st 1854, Pamph. L. 536, it is declared ‘that all bonds and certificates of loans of any railroad company incorporated by this Commonwealth, be and the same shall be liable to taxation for state purposes <em>only.’ </em>Showing most clearly the legislative intention to relieve those debts from the burden of county and township taxes, but to subject them to that of the Commonwealth. No method was provided for collecting this tax where the creditor resided out of the Commonwealth, until the enactment of the Act of April 30th 1864, the 3d section of which required the president, treasurer, cashier or other officer of any company incorporated by the laws of this state, to deduct the state tax due upon its bonds or indebtedness, and pay over the same to the state treasurer. A similar provision is made as to city or county bonds, by the 4th section of the same act. See Pamph. L. 1864, p. 219. No exception is allowed as to the debts due to non-residents by either of these enactments. Money is quite as likely to be lent to citizens of another state by one of our cities or counties, as to a railroad company; yet it is probable that the duty and obligation of such city or county treasurer to retain the tax was never doubted. [No one can read these various enactments without coming to the conclusion that it was the legislative intention to collect a state tax from all creditors of corporations, whether pri<a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>vate or municipal, without regard to the residence of the holder of the obligation; and it is equally manifest that this system of retention was designed to meet the case of absentees, as our own citizens were obliged to return their amount of money at interest to the township assessors. If the non-resident holder of such bonds could not be taxed, the most gross frauds would be practised by colorable transfers to persons out of the state, or by handing over the coupons to such for presentation to the treasurers.]</p>

Therefore, where they lend money the loan may be taxed, and if the state, by its laws, chooses to make the debtor the collector, he may be ordered to withhold the amount from his obligation. If the creditor is a non-resident of the state, his person cannot be taxed, but his money, lent to our citizens or institutions, may be, on account of the protection furnished to his claim or the property on which it is secured, and the tax be collected through the medium of the debtor. The • laws tax the loan as property found here in Pennsylvania, and impose no heavier duty on it than on like property held by our own citizens.] See Maltby <em>v. </em>The Railroad Co., already cited; Hood’s Estate, 9 Hams 116.</p>

The railroad extending partly through four states, can its bonds be taxed at all ? If they can, must they be taxed in full or in the proportion of the length of the road in this state? We have no express Act of Assembly authorizing the tax to be apportioned, yet the unvarying custom of the state officers has measurably established the law against any claim to charge in full, where a large portion of the property is situated beyond our limits. It cannot be pretended that a state can by law impose a tax on that which is entirely beyond its jurisdiction, or on property to which its laws afford no protection. The custom to assess <em>fro </em>rata, to the extent of the improvement in the state, has received the sane-, tion of the court in several cases when applied to the <em>stock </em>of corporations, and we can see no reason why the same doctrine <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>should not prevail in regard to their bonds. The cases, we think, are strongly analogous. In The Easton Bridge Co. <em>v. </em>Northampton County, 9 Barr 416, Judge Coulter says: ‘This state can tax all that is within its bounds and which receives protection from its laws, unless exempted by the Constitution of the United States or of this state.’ That was a tax imposed both on the stock of the company and its money at interest. The bridge waá incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and extended across the Delaware river; one-half was situated in each state, and the tax was equally apportioned. In The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>The Trenton Delaware Bridge Co., this court held that the state of Pennsylvania could tax only one-half of the capital stock of the corporation, it being created by the laws of both states, and one-half of the bridge being in each. Pennsylvania could tax only the proportion of the property within her borders, as represented by the stock. The principal portion of the stock was owned by citizens of New Jersey, and the business of the company was transacted in that state. The decision was acquiesced in, both by the attorney-general and "the corporation. See the ease, reported in full in 9 Am. Law Reg. O. S. 298. Again, in the case of The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad Co., <em>5 </em>Casey 370, it was held by the Supreme Court that ‘ the stock of the company was subject to taxation in proportion to the amount <em>used </em>in this state.’ That would be evidenced by the length of the road in Pennsylvania. Fractions of time have also been recognised, though not mentioned in the statute.

Jackson sued the railroad company on the coupons due him for interest on his bonds. They were drawn in the usual form, payable to bearer, and the holder was a non-resident alien. The company defended as to the amount of tax paid by it to the Commonwealth, but it was not allowed by the court, which held that there could be no apportionment of the tax; that Pennsylvania undertook to collect taxes from claims beyond her jurisdiction; that if she could tax, Maryland could also, which would lead to double taxation; and as many of the railroads passed through several states, each could impose the same burden, which would be most oppressive. If this case depended on the Constitution or any law of the United States, we should certainly consider ourselves bound by that decision. But as we understand the subject, it must be controlled by Pennsylvania law alone, which the learned judge who delivered the opinion does not seem to comprehend. If it even resulted in double taxation, that has never been considered unlawful in this state. On the contrary it is of frequent oc<a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>currence.

Pennsylvania, through her courts, will compel the corporation to pay the tax, whilst the courts of the United States will oblige it to pay its coupons in full; thus throwing the burden of taxation on the debtor instead of the creditor, as intended by law. We do not think that this clashing of jurisdiction can be of long continuance.

The question raised in the court upon the Act of 30th April 1864 seems not to have been suggested in the court below. It was not noticed in the charge, nor was the attention of the court called to it; all reference to it was omitted.</p>
    <p id="b80-9" data-blocks='[["BL_80.9",80,[286,1232,1156,290]]]'>We have often held that an omission to charge on any particular aspect of the law of a case where it does not necessarily present itself, is not error in the absence of a request to notice it: Mullen <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20413" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Wright 413">8 Wright 413</a>; Garrett <em>v. </em>Gonter, Id. 143; Walter <em>v. </em>Humbert, 5 P. F. Smith 407. That is the case here. No point was put to the court on the subject, nor did any plea in the case raise it.</p>
    <p id="b80-10" data-blocks='[["BL_80.10",80,[285,1533,1155,642]]]'>The omission was therefore not the subject of error; nor indeed is there any assignment of error which covers 'it. One rule of court is, “ that the counsel for plaintiff in error shall, on or before the third day of the term to which the writ is returnable, specify in writing the particular errors which he assigns.” That rule has not been followed even if the omission referred to had been the subject of error. It may have been an after-thought which the allowance of an exception to the whole charge as if every word of it were error, so readily allows. An exception to a charge has a twofold purpose to subserve. One to bring directly to the mind of the judge the specific error he is supposed to have committed, so that he may have the opportunity to correct it, if it exist, on the spot before the jury shall have acted. The other is that if no correction be made of the error thus pointed out it may hereafter be brought before the court of review.</p>
    <p id="b80-11" data-blocks='[["BL_80.11",80,[284,2176,1153,256]]]'>It is apparent that there is no chance for the correction by the court of any specific error, where every portion of the charge is excepted to as error. A general exception discloses no specific errors. The practice is a bad one, and the Court of Common Pleas ought to repress it. I do not know that it prevails elsewhere, if it does, it is to a very limited extent in this state.</p>
    <p id="b80-12" data-blocks='[["BL_80.12",80,[1060,2433,331,42]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
