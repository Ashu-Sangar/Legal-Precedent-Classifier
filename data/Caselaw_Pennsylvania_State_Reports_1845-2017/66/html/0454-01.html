The councils authorized the owners of property on I). street, between O. and P. avenues, to fill that street to an uniform gradé under direction of the city regulator, without cost to the city. The defendant filled up D. street opposite his property in accordance with the grade furnished by the regulator and paid the whole expense. Councils afterwards ordained the grading of D. street, between O. and P. avenues, under the Act of 1864, and repealed all ordinances affecting this ordinance. The city officers caused the remainder of D. street to be filled and graded to correspond with the defendant's grading. <em>Held, </em>that the grading by defendant was in accordance with Act of 1864, and he was not liable for the grading done by the city under their last ordinance.</p>

It is clear then that the councils caused to be graded that portion of Dinwiddie street lying between Centre avenue and Rose street, the cost being paid by the person liable by law to pay for the grade.
