Davenport, which was approved by the court, and a statement of the bank’s condition, and an inventory and appraisement of its assets, were afterwards filed. They were referred to three auditors, and in September 1863 a detailed and elaborate report was made by two of the auditors, the other one dissenting from its conclusion, in which they say they are called upon to characterize the management from November 1854 to its suspension as extremely prejudicial to its interests and disastrous to its prospects, and also “ that since the time of its resumption in 1858 it appears to have been carefully managed.”</p>

    <p id="b154-9" data-blocks='[["BL_154.9",154,[274,1631,1154,205]]]'>It rested until September 1864, when without authority of law the court, on the application of the assignee, ordered an issue, in which the assignee and the present named defendants were to be the parties, to try the fraudulent insolvency of the Bank of Commerce.</p>
    <p id="b154-10" data-blocks='[["BL_154.10",154,[273,1846,1154,130]]]'>The. defendants objected to the whole proceeding, but without avail. The docket entry styles it — “ Issue to try the fraudulent insolvency of the Bank of Commerce from the auditors’ report.”</p>
    <p id="b154-11" data-blocks='[["BL_154.11",154,[272,1975,1153,255]]]'>On the trial of the issue, the defendants offered in evidence the report of the auditors, which was rejected by the court, in which we think there was error, and as the issue grew out of the report, it would seem to have been a proper part of the plaintiff’s case, and as he did not choose to produce it, it was the right of the defendants to bring it before the court.</p>
    <p id="b154-12" data-blocks='[["BL_154.12",154,[270,2232,1150,128]]]'>The issue was — was the insolvency fraudulent ? — and not whether any of the defendants were culpable or guilty; and there can be legally no finding implicating all or any of the defendants.</p>

The appointment of the auditors shows this, for they are “ to make a strict investigation of the affairs of such bank,” “and they are to report the result of their investigation,” and they are not to assume the insolvency to be fraudulent, but, on the contrary, they are by strong implication forbidden to do so.</p>
    <p id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.6",155,[191,652,1160,466]]]'>So when the court “ proceeds to the investigation of the matters contained in said report,” and shall determine whether the insolvency of such bank was fraudulent or otherwise,” it does not assume it to be so, but to depend upon the unbiassed judgment of. the court. So when an issue is directed, the report is naturally the subject of investigation by the jury, and the question is to be tried without any primá facie imputation of fraud. There is therefore an error running through the answer of the court to the second and third points of the defendants, in asserting an investigation is only to be in rebuttal, when the investigation must be made to show whether it was fraudulent or otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b155-7" data-blocks='[["BL_155.7",155,[195,1126,1155,126]]]'>Upon the whole we think there was error in directing the issue, and that all the proceedings subsequent to the report of the auditors must be reversed. .</p>
