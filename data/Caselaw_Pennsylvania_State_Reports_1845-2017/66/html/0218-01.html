In 1860 the commissioners of both counties received notice that the bridge was out of repair; they made a joint examination of it, and directed some slight repairs which were done at the joint expense of the two counties. Not long afterwards the bridge broke down whilst John A. Humphrey was crossing with a two-horse wagon and severely injured him. To March Term 1862, he brought an action for negligence against the county of Armstrong. The commissioners of that county gave notice of the bringing of the suit to the commissioners of Clarion, <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>and called on them to assist in its defence, which was not done. A verdict was recovered December 16th 1868 against Armstrong for $1100, which, with the costs amounting in all to $1597.31, Armstrong county paid. The commissioners of Clarion were called on to contribute their proportion to this payment, which they declined to do.</p>

Whilst John A. Humphreys was crossing the bridge it fell and he was severely injured; he brought suit for damages against the county of Armstrong; and on the trial, under the charge of the court, there was a verdict for defendant. This was reversed on writ of error (6 P.. F. Smith 204); and upon a second trial there was a verdict for the plaintiff for $1100 damages, on which judgment was entered. This judgment, with interest and costs, was paid by Armstrong county, and the present suit is to recover contribution from Clarion county. On the trial the learned judge nonsuited the plaintiff on the ground that one of two joint wrongdoers cannot have contribution from the other.</p>

There can be little doubt that morally Clarion county was bound to pay <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>one-half of the sum recovered from and paid by Armstrong county; and the question is, does not the law make the moral obligation a legal one ? Merriweather <em>v. </em>Nixon, 8 Term R. 186, the leading case on the subject, was of a joint injury to real estate, and for the joint conversion of personal property, being machinery in a mill. In Colburn <em>v. </em>Patmore, 1 Cr. M. &amp; R. 73, the proprietor of a newspaper who, for a libel published in it, .was subjected to a criminal information, convicted and fined, sought to recover from his editor who was the author of the libel, the expenses which he had incurred by his misfeasance ; Lord Lyndhurst said: “ I know of no case in which a person who has committed an act declared by the law to be criminal, has been permitted to recover compensation against a person who has acted jointly with him in the commission of the crime.”</p>
    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[261,1042,1159,217]]]'>So in Arnold <em>v. </em>Clifford, 2 Sumner 238, it was held, a promise to indemnify the publisher of a libel is void. “No one,” said Judge Story, “ ever imagined that a promise to pay for the poisoning of another was capable of being enforced in a court of justice.”</p>
    <p id="b220-7" data-blocks='[["BL_220.7",220,[259,1257,1153,596]]]'>In Miller <em>v. </em>Fenton, <a href="/paige-ch/11/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="11 Paige Ch. 18" data-case-ids="11279219" data-case-paths="/paige-ch/11/0018-01">11 Paige 18</a>, the wrongdoers were two of the officers of a bank, who had fraudulently abstracted its funds, and of course there could be no contribution between criminals. In the case of The Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Wilson, 4 Jurist 1174, cited in the above case by the chancellor, and also reported in 1 Craig &amp; Phillips 1, where it was contended that all the persons charged with the breach of trust should be made parties, Lord Cottenham said: “ In cases of this kind where the liability arises from the wrongful act of the parties, each is liable for all the consequences, and there is no contribution between them, and each case is distinct, depending upon the -evidence against each party. It is therefore not necessary to make all parties who may more or-less have joined in the act complained of.” Seddon <em>v. </em>Connell, 10 Simons 81, is to the same effect.</p>
    <p id="b220-8" data-blocks='[["BL_220.8",220,[257,1854,1154,600]],["BL_221.1",221,[220,443,1160,173]]]'>In Story <em>on </em>Partnership, § 220, after speaking of the general rule that there is no contribution between joint wrongdoers, the author says: “ But the rule is to be understood according to its true sense and meaning, which is, where the tort is a known meditated wrong, and not where the party is acting under the supposition of the entire innocence and propriety of the act, and the tort is merely one <em>by </em>construction, or inference of law. In the latter case, although not in the former, there may be and properly is, a contribution allowed by law for such payments and expenses between constructive wrongdoers, whether partners or not:” The case of Adamson <em>v. </em>Jarvis, cited by the learned commentators, is in 4 Bing. 66, in which Lord Chief Justice Best, after noticing Merriweather <em>v. </em>Nixon, says : “ The case of Philips <em>v. </em>Biggs, Hardress 164” (which was on the equity side of the <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>Exchequer), “was never decided; hut the Court of Chancery seemed to consider the case of two sheriffs of Middlesex, where one had paid the damages <em>in an action for an escape, and sued the other for contribution, as like the case of two joint obligors.'”</em>

R. 186, seems to me to have been strained beyond what the decision will bear — the present case is an exception to the general rule. The general rule is, that between wrongdoers there is neither indemnity nor contribution. The exception is where the act is not clearly illegal in itself, and Merriweather <em>v. </em>Nixon, 8 T. R. 186, was only a refusal of a rule nisi.”</p>
