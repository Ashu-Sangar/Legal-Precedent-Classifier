In accordance with the provisions of the contract, Rhodes gave the plaintiff his promissory notes for the principal and interest, payable as the same became due, and his bond with power of attorney to confess judgment against him, in case of his failure to pay any one of the notes for principal or interest at maturity, for the whole amount of the notes then unpaid, whether due or not, and to issue execution therefor, with costs and attorney’s commissions.</p>

This judgment was binding and conclusive on the parties until reversed or set aside. It could not be collaterally impeached or avoided by Rhodes except on the ground of fraud. If it was conclusive upon him, it was equally conclusive upon the defendants in this action. They could not go behind it and inquire into its consideration, or question its validity. It is not pretended that it was fraudulently or collusively confessed by Rhodes to their prejudice. It could not have been, for Carson bought the property with nptice of the plaintiff’s lien and with Rhodes’s covenant to procure its release; and so far as appears, he has never paid any part of the purchase-money. Having the right to withhold its payment, the presumption is that his indebtedness to Rhodes exceeds the amount of the plaintiff’s judgment. But whether this be so or not, the judgment was conclusive of the amount due the plaintiff, and estopped the defendants from claiming a deduction of the two interest notes, or the excess of interest included in the notes previously paid by Rhodes: <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>Hauer’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 473" data-case-ids="478782" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0473-01">5 W. &amp; S. 473</a>; Drexel’s Appeal, 6 Barr 272; Dickerson’s Appeal, 7 Barr 257; Watson <em>v. </em>Willard, 9 Id. 89; Lewis <em>v. </em>Rogers, 4 Harris 21; Buehler <em>v. </em>Buffington, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20278" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Wright 278">7 Wright 278</a>. But if the defendants were not estopped by the judgment, they have no such equity as entitles them to go behind it in order to contest the amount of the plaintiff’s claim. It was not confessed to their prejudice, and it can do them no possible harm. So far as it respects their rights, it is immaterial whether the purchase-money in the hands, of Carson is pajd directly to Rhodes or applied to the satisfaction of the plaintiff’s judgment. If Rhodes does not object to the judgment, it is clear that the defendants have no right in law or equity to make any defence to it whatever.</p>
