On the 8th May 1863 a testatum fi. fa. to September 1863, was issued to the sheriff of Indiana county, who delivered the same to the prothonotary of Indiana county, who forthwith entered the same of record, on the proper dockets, and thereupon re-delivered the said writs to the said sheriff, to be by him executed. The said testatum writ of fieri facias became a lien upon the real estate of the defendant during five years from the date of such entry. By virtue of this writ the sheriff levied upon'the interest of defendant, in a certain tract of land in Indiana county, upon which inquisition was held and property condemned.</p>
