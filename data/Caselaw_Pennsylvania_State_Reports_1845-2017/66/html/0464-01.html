It is therefore established by the verdict, that the plaintiff’s injury was occasioned by negligence in not having the excavation sufficiently guarded, and that he himself was neither a trespasser, nor guilty of any negligence contributing to the injury.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b466-11" data-blocks='[["BL_466.11",466,[297,1453,1160,807]]]'>“ The question then is, what was the duty of the defendant under the admitted facts ? Was it <em>his </em>duty to see that sufficient guards were placed around the excavation, or was this duty devolved on the contractor or either of them ? If it was the defendant’s duty, then under the other facts of the case, as settled by the verdict, he is liable, and the plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the verdict. In this connection it should be observed that there was no direct testimony as to whether the defendant had a license or permit from the borough authorities to excavate the side-walk for the purpose of constructing a coal-vault. It was not made a question on the trial, and it has been assumed, and we think properly, too, that he had their consent. This may be fairly inferred, from the evidence as to the employment of the borough regulator to mark the lines and set in the pins. Of course, if the defendant caused the side-walk to be excavated without permission of the borough authorities, he could not by any contract evade liability to any one injured by falling into the excavation. But we treat the case as though he had permission •and the work was lawful.</p>

F. Smith 374, in which Mr. Justice Agnew says: ‘ The principle to be extracted from the cases is said to be that a person, natural or artificial, is not bound for the negligence of another, unless the relation of master and servant, or principal or agent exist between them; and that when an injury is done by a person exercising an independent employment, the party employing him is not responsible to the person injured. This doctrine,’ he further says, £is applicable only to causes where the purpose of the contract is entirely lawful, and where the owner of the property on which it is to be executed can lawfully commit its execution to others. There are cases where responsibility cannot be thrown off through the employment of another to execute the work by contract; as where a contractor is employed to dig a trench in a public street without any authority in the employer himself to break ground. Nor does the principle extend to cases where the employer of the contractor has not relinquished his control over the work to be done, and still continues liable for his duty to others in respect to it.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b467-6" data-blocks='[["BL_467.6",467,[195,1294,1161,592]]]'>“Does the case before us fall within the principle of these adjudicated cases, or is it distinguishable from them ? In the case of Painter <em>v. </em>The City of Pittsburg, the contract embraced the entire work. The city had nothing whatever to do with it, either in furnishing material or otherwise, except to see that the work was done to the satisfaction of the recording regulator. The contract in Allen <em>v. </em>Willard was similar in terms. In the case before us, different parts of the work were let to different persons; to one the excavation; to another the stone work; and to another the superstructure; while the defendant himself had teams employed in delivering stone, lime and sand on the ground. The fact that these materials were delivered at a stipulated price, would not affect the relation of the parties. The defendant still retained control over them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b467-7" data-blocks='[["BL_467.7",467,[197,1896,1156,127]]]'>“ The question is whether the facts as to the letting of the work by the defendant are sufficient to take it out of his control and cast the responsibility entirely upon the contractors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b467-8" data-blocks='[["BL_467.8",467,[193,2024,1163,430]],["BL_468.1",468,[292,451,1159,644]]]'>“ In populous cities and towns where the lives of many may be endangered by excavations and improvements, it is of the highest importance, and public policy requires that the duty of providing adequate protection to the public should not be lightly cast upon irresponsible or transient persons. In all cases it is primá facie the duty of the owner of property on which improvements are being made to afford this protection, and the responsibility being thus cast upon him, nothing short of clear and satisfactory proof should permit him to transfer it to others. It should be clearly shown that the control of the work was relinquished by the owner, <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>and by contract committed to others. Where, as in the cases cited, the owner contracts for the entire work, in all its details, it is very manifest that this implies a relinquishment of his control over it, and devolves on the contractor the duty which would otherwise attach to himself. But where the work is split up in different contracts, and the owner undertakes, as in the present case, to supply one of the contractors with materials to be used in the execution of his contract, and no provision is made for the supervision of the work or the erection and maintenance of guards around it, we are justified in drawing the inference that the owner retained the supervision; and that his duty to protect the public has not been devolved on others. There is certainly no hardship in holding the owner to this measure of responsibility, and it appears to us that nothing short of it will satisfy the demands of sound public policy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b468-6" data-blocks='[["BL_468.6",468,[292,1094,1158,470]]]'>“ In the present case, nothing appears in the contracts as t.o the supervision of the work, or the duty of placing guards around it, and it is not unfair to the defendant to infer that he reserved these to himself. Under the admitted facts we are of opinion that the duty of erecting and maintaining a sufficient barrier around the excavation was not shifted from the defendant to the contractors, or either of them. He had, to a certain extent at least, a control over the work. He had teams employed delivering materials for the mason work, and on one occasion at least, he claimed and threatened to exercise the right of discharging Homberg and employing another in his stead.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b468-7" data-blocks='[["BL_468.7",468,[292,1563,1156,377]]]'>“ Again, it does not appear how the contractors, Homberg and Brown, were to do the work; whether under the direction and control of the defendant or otherwise. As was said by Agnew, J., in Allen <em>v. </em>Willard, the fact that each had a contract with the defendant for his particular work, did not, in itself, separate defendant from its supervision and control. To pay for stone work by the perch, or to do the whole excavation under a contract, does not necessarily destroy the relation of master and servant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b468-8" data-blocks='[["BL_468.8",468,[291,1950,1175,517]],["BL_469.1",469,[195,449,1158,75]]]'>“ In that case, Allen, who had contracted with the owner for * the erection of the entire building, including excavation, stone work, materials, and everything pertaining to it, sought to evade the responsibility which he had assumed, by showing that he had sub-let the stone work by the perch to one, and the excavation, into which the plaintiff’s husband fell, to another. These subcontracts were very similar in their features to the contracts of Homberg and Brown, in the case before us, and yet the Supreme Court held that the sub-letting of the work was not such as took it out of the control and direction of Allen and cast the responsibility wholly on the sub-contractors. So in this case, we are of opinion that the contracts with Homberg and others did not shift <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>the responsibility from the defendant to the contractors, and that therefore the former is liable.</p>
