Borland took judgment for the balance on the 25th of January, and issued execution. The plaintiffs’ writ and Borland’s came to the sheriff’s hands on the same day. The sheriff levied on the leasehold, together with the fixtures and stock of the defendants; Borland gave notice tc the sheriff that he claimed the goods^held by the defendants on commission; a rule to interplead was entered, when the parties agreed that these 'goods should be sold with the defendants’ other property, and the proceeds of the whole distributed as the court should direct.

Under ordinary circumstances, such a purchase would be equivalent to a declaration, that they considered the lease worth the rent reserved, and a bonus of five dollars besides, and I cannot see that the fact that they were sureties on this lease, and therefore may ultimately become liable to some loss or damage if they failed to purchase it, varies the condition or effect of the purchase. They chose to become the purchasers under all the conditions of the lease, knowing that thereby they became sureties of themselves and liable to the landlord directly for the performance of all the stipulations in the lease contained. It may be, as was proven, that rents on Market street are now going down. It may also be that before this lease expires, they will go much higher. In either event it seems to me that the plaintiffs, by purchasing this lease, have assumed the risks, and the question is not now open for discussion. But it is said this view of the case cannot be maintained, because it is questioning the validity of the judgment under which the fund is de* <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>rived. But I apprehend that where it can he gleaned <em>from the record itself </em>that there is nothing due upon the judgment, and that the parties have, by their own acts, established such relations as will for ever preclude anything from becoming due and payable thereon; it will not be considered an attack upon the judgment to pronounce it virtually satisfied and to award the fund to the unpaid claimants.</p>

B. &amp; C. W. Dyott, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 557" data-case-ids="1853564" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0557-01">2 W. &amp; S. 557</a>. It must be conceded that the judgment entered in favor of Huckenstein and Eisenbeis, upon Alpert &amp; Kohler’s bond conditioned “ that in default of any quarterly payment of rent the said Huckenstein and Eisenbeis may immediately issue execution for the whole amount of the said obligation,” upon the forfeiture of the bond became a security to indemnify them, and that they were entitled to all the indemnity such an instrument could legally afford them. They had no right, however, to take execution for more than was necessary to their indemnity: McCann <em>v. </em>Farley, 2 Casey 175. At the time they sued out execution they may have had a right to collect the full amount of the penalty of the bond and hold it as security to indemnify them from the claim of the landlord for the accruing rents up to the time of the expiration of the lease. No question has been made a-s to that here. But if at the time of the report of the auditor and award of distribution it appears that all liability, as sureties, for the rent is ended — for example,'that the lessor has accepted a surrender of the lease — surely they have no claim upon the fund; they cannot prevent it from going to other creditors of the tenant. Now such is the case here, as it appears from the facts found by the auditor. The arrears of rent up to the day of sale were paid out of the fund. At the sale Huckenstein and Eisenbeis purchased the leasehold, they became assignees of the term, and liable as such assignees for the subsequently accruing rent. They had possession and enjoyment, or what is the same thing, the right to possess and enjoy the demised premises: 4 Kent Com. 96, 97; Woodfall’s Landl. and Ten. 166, 167. It' is true that this liability will continue only so long as they continue assignees. They may get rid of it at any time hereafter by an assignment to another, even to a beggar. It is founded not upon privity of contract but upon privity of estate, and lasts only so long as that lasts: <a href="/watts-serg/2/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 557" data-case-ids="1853564" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0557-01">Ibid.</a> This seems to be the point upon which this controversy hinges. Huckenstein and Eisenbeis maintain that the rental value of the premises may hereafter fall, and they may thus be subjected to a loss ultimately for which they are entitled to indemnity. It must be agreed, however, that there is no legal liability now either <em>in presentí </em>or <em>futuro. </em>As long as things continue as they now are Huckenstein and Eisenbeis can never, call upon Alpert &amp; Kohler to indemnify them for any payment of rent they may be compelled to make. In consideration of the assignment of the lease, they have taken that upon themselves as principals. Waiving the consideration of the question whether upon an assignment of the lease by them hereafter, the only mode in which they can shake off this liability, their claim to indemnity would, revive — which would seem contrary to the maxim that a right to a thing personal once suspended is gone for ever — yet <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>surely it is not equity to put an indefinite amount of money belonging to the debtors, and rightfully to he paid to their other creditors, into the hands of Huckenstein and Eisenbeis to hold as indemnity against so remote a contingency.</p>
