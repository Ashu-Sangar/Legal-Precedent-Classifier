They are certainly embraced within the words of the 32d section of the Act of April 29th 1844; although we might infer that it was the legislative intention to have the tax assessed against the holder of the mortgage or debt, in the ordinary method of assessing taxes, especially as the same obligations were made taxable for county, township and school purposes, by various laws. The Act of May 1st 1854 shows clearly the intention to assess these obligations for state purposes <em>only, </em>and they are exonerated from all other taxes. Although we may fairly infer the -legislative intention to impose this tax for state purposes, yet no method was devised of ascertaining or collecting the amount until the Act of April 30th 1864 was passed, the 3d section of which required a. full return of all corporation indebtedness to be made to the auditor-general, and the tax to be retained for the use of the state, by the corporation officers, who paid the interest.] A similar provision is found in the 4th section in regard to county or muni<a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>cipal indebtedness. This was a public law, of which the respective officers were required to take notice, without their attention being called to its provisions by the state accounting department. [That the tax now in controversy is valid and binding both on the corporation and its creditor is clearly settled in Maltby <em>v. </em>The Columbia and Reading Railroad Company, 2 P. E. Smith 140, and that too whether the creditor resides in Pennsylvania or elsewhere. The non-resident can be taxed for the protection which his debt receives from our laws by granting and securing the franchises of the company to which he has intrusted his money.] * * * [It is also contended that this law impairs the obligation of contracts, by taking off a portion of the creditor’s claimbut that is, in all cases, a consequence of taxation. It does not enable the debtor to discharge his obligation with a less sum, but requires the corporation to become the collector of the tax for the state, and pay the amount into the public treasury, instead of giving it to the creditor, who would not otherwise pay his taxes.] * * * We are therefore of the opinion that this tax could lawfully be assessed on non-residents, as well as residents of the state; [That the officers of this corporation could be and were required to collect the tax, and it was their duty to retain it at the time of paying the interest to their creditors; That the law requiring them to retain and pay it over was a public statute, of which they were bound to take notice, without any warning from the department, and the corporation defendant is now liable for the amount thereof, with interest at the rate of 12 per cent, from the expiration of thirty days from the time of settlement.]</p>

This is an express provision of the Act of 30th March 1811, § 5, Pamph. L. 230. The provision is that any person dissatisfied with any such settlement may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of the county in which the seat of government may then be : u Provided, however, that the appeal be filed in the office of the auditor-general within sixty days after notice of such settlement, accompanied with specifications of objections to the said settlement.” As to this requirement, Gibson, C. J., said in the case referred to: “ As there is no reason to appeal in respect to points that are admitted, it would be flagrantly unjust to permit the accountant to hold in reserve anything that might have been allowed had it been urged at the settlement, and thus subject the Commonwealth to expense, and her officers to vexation without just cause.” In The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Porter (a different party), 9 Harris 385, Lowrie, J., said: “But no appeal is allowed without a specification of objections to the decision complained of. In this case the accountant filed a specification to the principal items of the account as stated by the auditor-general, but none to the item of interest. How then could the question of interest be raised on the appeal ?” and in support of the ruling he cited the case referred to above. Both of these cases show that only so far as the specifications go, are the questions raised in the appellate court.</p>

    <p id="b69-6" data-blocks='[["BL_69.6",69,[166,538,1160,645]]]'>The learned court committed no error, as claimed in the 1st assignment of error, supposing it to contain, in whole or in part, the first objection filed to the settlement in the auditor-general’s office. The Act of May 1st 1854 expressly subjects certificates of loans and bonds of railroad companies to taxation for “ state purposes only.” This relieved them from a portion of the burthens imposed by the Act 29th April 1844. The right of the financial ofiicers of the corporation to retain the three-mill tax, under the Act of 1844, out of the interest payable' to loan or bondholders of the company, under the Act of 30th April 1864, without an assessment by the county commissioners or assessing officers, was maintained to be undoubted in Maltby <em>v. </em>The Reading and Columbia Bailroad Co., 2 P.

That question is also <em>res adjudicata: </em>Maltby <em>v. </em>The Reading and Columbia Railroad Co., <em>supra. </em>As to the third exception that the retention of the tax impairs the obligation of the bond or loanholder’s contract, it has been over and over again overruled. The sovereign right to impose a tax on property to which it gives protection is not to be denied, without in a measure upturning organized society entirely. The Act of 1864 provides a remedy for collecting it out of resources within the legislative jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. See the case last cited, in which this is ruled against the position assumed.</p>

On the contrary, it is expressly admitted to be the duty of the corporation to retain the tax from bondholders by the Act of 1864.

But before the trial of that appeal the mistake, if a mistake, in the Act of 1868 had been corrected by the Act of 24th of April 1869. The trial was held May 6th 1869. I think this would have been a sufficient answer to the plea of a repeal. The Act of 1868 was but a substitute at least for existing laws, and I would incline to the opinion expressed in Wright <em>v. </em>Oakley, 5 Metc. (Mass.), by Shaw, C. J., <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>that the repealing clause took effect only so far as the substitute took effect, and coincidental with it. The act was intended only for a consolidation of previous acts into a general system, and was not designed as relinquishing any claim of the Commonwealth. The claim for the tax in question was not released by the act, and if the increased rate of interest could he claimed to be a penalty on this precise aspect of the case, the point ought to have been made. It was not; but an exception was taken to the direction of the learned judge to the jury to find for the Commonwealth, with interest at the rate of 12 per cent, instead of 6, as allowed by law, when the settlement was made. This was not made an objection to the settlement when the appeal was taken, and on the principles stated in the outset of this opinion, is not now a question for examination.
