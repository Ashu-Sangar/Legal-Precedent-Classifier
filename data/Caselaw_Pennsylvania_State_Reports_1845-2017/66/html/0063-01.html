L. 530, and the 13th section of the Act of March 21st 1806, 4 Sm. L. 332. Nor can a promise by the overseers of one township to another divest the jurisdiction. If the township was not legally liable for the maintenance of the pauper, the promise of the overseers could not impose that responsibility upon it: Berks County <em>v. </em>Pile, 6 Harris 493.
