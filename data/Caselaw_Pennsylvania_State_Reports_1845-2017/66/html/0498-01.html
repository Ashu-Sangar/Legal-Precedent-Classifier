By it he directed, that after the death of his widow and of his son Robert and his wife, his farm should be sold and after giving some small legacies, he ordered the balance of the proceeds to be equally divided amongst his daughters, Ann Miller, Nancy Potter and Elizabeth Scroggs. There was no one named in the will to execute the power of sale. Elizabeth Scroggs and Nancy Potter conveyed their interests in the farm to William Galbreath, the surviving executor.

The executor, in view of the urgency of these letters and of the unproductivenes of the farm, on the 15th of January 1867, without having asked or procured any authority from the Orphans’ Court, contracted to sell it to Matthew Andrews for $6000, of which $2000 were paid in hand, $1000 to be paid on the 1st of April then next, $1500 on the 1st of April 1868, and $1500 on the 1st of April 1869. In the articles he did not state that he sold as executor. On the 15th of March 1867, Andrews by articles contracted to sell to Abraham Bell and James K. Bell, at an advance of $1250, and the executor accepted them as purchasers instead of Andrews. On the 30th of March, the Bells paid the executor $1000, the second instalment of the purchase-money. Mrs. Herriott, and three others of Mrs. Miller’s children, were informed of the sale of the farm and these transactions in connection with it; she came to Pittsburg, and stayed at the house of the executor, was informed of all the circumstances and expressed no dissatisfaction. ' Being about to return home from Pittsburg Mrs. Herriott and the executor went to the office of his counsel, that she might receive her share of the proceeds of the sale of the farm, and there was informed that it could not be paid unless letters testamentary on Mrs. Miller’s estate were taken out in Pennsylvania ; the executor also learned, for the first time, that his sale being without authority from the Orphans’ Court, was invalid. The executor, however, paid Mrs. Herriott $100, for which she gave him her individual receipt, as so much “ on account of her share in the proceeds of the sale of land of the heirs of the late Samuel Galbreath, deceased.”</p>

They also claim that the acts of Nancy Herriott, the executrix of Ann Miller, after the sale to Andrews, and especially the acceptance of the $100 on the 3d of April 1867, and her receipt for it, declaring it to be on account of her share of proceeds of sale of land of the heirs of the late Samuel Galbreath, deceased, amounted to a ratification of the sale to Andrews; a ratification of it by her, as the executrix of her mother, and estopped the legatees or devisees of her mother from claiming anything, except what they are entitled to, out of the sale to Andrews. The Messrs. Bell claim that the Orphans’ Court sale was not made for the benefit of the devisee of Samuel Galbreath, deceased, but was only to perfect the title of them (the Bells) in the property ; that whether the property sold for much or little, at the Orphans’ Court sale, was nothing to those devisees or legatees; that their rights were fixed by the sale to Andrews, and that they can only participate in the proceeds of the sale to him.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Ann Miller’s children expressed a desire to have the property divided, saying they believed it would sell better if it was divided. At least, this is the language of Mrs. Herriott. They urged the executor to sell it, even if it went for less than he had been holding it at. But they did not say one word as to the mode in which he should sell it. They recognised the fact that, being the sur^ viving executor, he was the person to make the sale, and they urge him to make the sale. Is it not a fair, and even a violent presumption that they desired him to make it in the way in which the law required him to make it ? Can it be supposed for a moment that they intended he should make it in a way that would pass no title to the purchaser; in a way in which no prudent man would buy, and, consequently, in a way in which it could not fail to be sacrificed ?</p>

So far as we are informed, she was entirely ignorant as to the value of land in the neighborhood, or as to the value of this land, except as she was informed of it by William Galbreath and Cyrus K. Potter. She was not told, so far as we know, that just two months after Andrews bought it, he sold it at an advance of $1250. There is no proof that she was told the property was sold in a way not authorized by law; in a way that would not pass a good title to the purchaser, and consequently in a way in which it was not to be expected that it would bring a fair price. The trustee was her uncle, and Cyrus K. Potter was her cousin — men in whom she would naturally have confidence— and it is not strange that she took their word, and made no objection to the sale until afterwards, when she found what the true state of the case was. Besides, she was here, far away from her home, without money to take her back to where she lived, and dependent on the friendship and hospitality of those very persons. Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that she did not express any dissatisfaction with the sale, even if she felt it. If she had been told that the sale was made without authority of law, that at such a sale no prudent man would buy at all, and that at it probably no man at all would buy and pay a full price for the property, is it not likely that she would have ex<a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>pressed dissatisfaction with the transaction, and refused to have anything to do with it ?</p>

She was a woman unaccustomed to do business, unacquainted with the legal effect of any act she did, or of any paper she signed, and, it seems to the auditor, ignorant of her rights in the premises.

The appellants’ counsel contend that the 8th section of the Act of 22d April 1856, Pamph. L. 533, repeals the 12th section of the Act of 24th February 1834, Pamph. L. 75, and that now, under the Act of 12th March 1800, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dallas%20593" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Dallas 593">4 Dallas 593</a>, in all cases where the testator has devised or directed his real estate to be sold, without naming or declaring who shall sell the same, the power may be exercised by the surviving executor, without the control and direction of the Orphans’ Court having jurisdiction of his accounts, with the same effect as it might have been exercised by such executor before the Act of 1834, and, therefore, that under the private sale made by the executor in this case a good equitable title to the land, which the testator directed to be sold, vested in the purchaser under whom the appellants claim. But we are of the opinion that the 12th section of the Act of 1834 was not intended to repeal or impair the Act of 1800, giving power to the surviving executors to sell and convey real estate when the direction and authority to sell are not given to any person by name or description, but merely to regulate the mode or form in which the power should be exercised. There is no inconsistency between the two acts, and it would be a strained construction of the Act of 1856 to hold that it was intended to repeal by implication the 12th section of the Act of 1834. If the legislature had intended its repeal, it would have been easy for them to have done it by apt words. Whatever, else may have been their purpose, it is clear' that they did not intend to repeal, by implication, so wholesome a provision of the statute.</p>
