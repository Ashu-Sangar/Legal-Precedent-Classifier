Viewers were appointed to assess damages for the property-holders. On the 22d of April 1867, they assessed to John Orth $3267, and to Jehu Dehaven $1975. The report of the viewers was confirmed nisi May 8th 1867, and absolutely December 6th 1867, exceptions having been filed, it did not appear by whom. In the property returned as John Orth’s he had but a life estate, the remainder being in his children. On these properties were erected frame dwelling-houses, through which the line of the street ran, the buildings therefore would have to be removed. Orth and Dehaven continued in the possession of the houses, and had received the rents and profits since the assessment of damages. By an Act of March 12th 1867 the city of Harrisburg was directed to pay the damages for opening streets. On the 15th of November 1869 Christian Haehnlen, trustee for Orth and his <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>children, with the consent of Orth, received the principal of the damages assessed to him, and Dehaven received the principal of the damages assessed to him, with interest from November 1st. On the 30th of November 1869, Haehnlen and Dehaven obtained a rule to show cause why the city of Harrisburg should be ordered to pay interest from April 22d 1867, when the damages were assessed till November 1st 1869.</p>

L. 195, entitled “An Act to incorporate the city of Harrisburg in the county of Dauphin,” provides that the damages awarded to landholders for the opening of streets shall be paid within six months from and after the same shall have been approved by the Court of Quarter Sessions. According to general principles interest is to be calculated only from the time a demand is payable, unless there are special circumstances. It is to be presumed that the viewers took this delay into consideration. If the owner continued undisturbed in the full receipt of the rents and profits, it would not be right 4hat he should in addition receive full interest on the value of the land. The case of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Dyer, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20463" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Wright 463">5 Wright 463</a>, was under a statute which merely declared that if the damages were not paid within one year from the assessment the claimant could sue the city therefor. In The Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Cooper, 8 P. F. Smith 408, the owner had been delayed by exceptions filed by the company, and all that was decided was, that in such a case the confirmation ought to have been entered <em>nunc fro tuna, </em>and that the party was entitled to interest during the pendency of the exceptions. Had <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>that been the case here, there would be great reason for the same order, and that the six months should be computed accordingly. But it does not appear by which party the exceptions were filed. The paper is said to be lost, and no record was made except of the date of it.</p>
