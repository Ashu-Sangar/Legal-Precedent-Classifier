This is a question of more difficulty than the other. The premium-notes are given so as to form a fund to draw from when necessary for the payment of losses, and can only be used for this purpose and to pay current expenses of the corporation. To attempt to use or collect them for any other <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>would be illegal and wrong. When an assessment is laid it is primá, facie supposed to be right, but the laying of it is not conclusive. [The defendants in this case allege that the company had sufficient assets to pay all its legal and just liabilities without calling for the amounts now in suit, and that these additional ones are laid for the personal profit of the parties managing this corporation. If this be true, it would be an available defence to this action.] As we said before, if there are no losses or debts of the company more than they need funds on hand to meet, they would not be justifiable on assessment. The defendants in order to sustain their allegation have given in evidence a statement of the affairs of the company, made in April 1863 by its officers. This would be evidence to show the situation of the company at that time. This is their own statement, and they have not attempted to show a mistake in it, or that it was not correct. If this paper is correct, you will see how the affairs of this company stood. The plaintiffs say there may have been losses after that. This is true, and if any losses were sustained after that, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover in this suit. The plaintiffs knew who were insured, and if any losses were sustained they could have shown them by their books or otherwise if they had seen fit to do so. We then say to you that if you are satisfied from the evidence that the plaintiffs had sufficient funds on hand to pay all their liabilities and losses without these assessments, then they had no right to lay them, and they cannot recover." But if you are not so satisfied from the testimony in the case, the plaintiffs have a right to your verdict for the amount claimed by them in this action.”</p>

This statement was not offered to be followed, nor was it followed, by any other evidence going to show the condition of the company at the time the assessments in suit were made. It had no tendency by itself to rebut the prima facies of the assessments. Not only was there no such evidence, but the assignment before produced by the defendants, dated February 8th 1864, recites that “ The West Branch Insurance Company, owing to sundry losses and misfortunes, is unable to discharge her just debts.” We think, therefore, that the learned judge below fell into an error in admitting the statement of April 1st 1863, and in charging the jury as complained of in the second assignment — “ The defendant in this case alleges that the company had sufficient assets to pay all its legal and just liabilities without calling for the amounts now in suit, and that these additional ones are laid for the personal profit of the parties managing this., corporation. If this be true, it would be an available defence to this action.” We think there was no evidence in the cause to rebute the prima facies of the secretary’s certificate, and the jury should have been instructed to find a verdict for the plaintiff, for the amount of the assessments sued for.</p>
