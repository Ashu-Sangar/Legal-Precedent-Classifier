        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, January 3d 1871, by\nShaeswood, J.\n\u2014 The Act of Assembly of April 16th 1845, \u00a7 5, Pamph. L. 538, was intended to provide for the case of a special contract, made by a mechanic with the owner for the erection in whole or in part of a building. It was passed to change the law as declared in Hoatz v. Patterson, 5 W. & S. 537, and Haley v. Prosser, 8 W. & S. 133, in which it was held that one who by special contract undertakes to do the work or furnish the materials for a building, was not entitled to file a lien. Under this act it was decided in Young v. Lyman, 9 Barr 449, which has been followed in subsequent cases, that when a claim is filed on such a special contract under the Act of 1845, the mechanic is not required to set out, in such claim, the nature or kind of the work done, and the kind and amount of materials furnished, as provided in other cases by the 12th section of the Act of June 16th 1836, Pamph. L. 688. The reason for requiring these particulars to be furnished does not exist in the case of a special contract for a round sum of money. Oessante ratione cessat etipsa lex. But it is entirely different when the contract of the mechanic, though it may be for a round sum, is not with the owner but with a contractor under him. The contractor cannot bind the building, by any such special contract, for more than the materials furnished and the work done on the credit of the building, at their fair market prices. Hence, in such a ease, it is very important that the owner should be informed by the claim filed as to the particulars of the demand, that he may be enabled to make the necessary inquiries to satisfy himself of its justice as a lien on his property. This was the purpose of the Act of 1836. The decision, therefore, in Young v. Lyman does not apply to the case of a sub-contractor. All this was set at rest by the det\u00e9rmination of this court in Russell v. Bell, 8 Wright 47.\nThe claim on this record was not that of a mechanic contracting with the owner, but with the contractor \u2014 in other words, of a sub-contractor. It was against Francis L. Lee, owner, and Duncan & Waught\u00e9r, contractors, and the body of the claim states that the materials were furnished and the work was done at the instance and request of the contractors. To the scire facias issued on this claim the defendant, Francis L. Lee, the owner, pleaded \u201c no lien, payment and set-off with leave.\u201d It was the issues of fact raised by these pleas that the jury were called and impannelled to try. No question as to the sufficiency of the claim upon its face could properly arise upon the trial. That would be an issue of law. There might arise a question of variance, between the evidence offered, and the claim, as filed and recited in the scire facias \u2014 but not whether that claim was regular and sufficient. The short plea \u201cno lien\u201d cannot be considered as a demurrer, either general or special. It was not so in form, and if it was intended to be so in fact it did not raise an issue triable by the jury. The court should have entered a separate judgment upon it, if it had been a demurrer. The plaintiffs below had a right to accept the issue tendered of \u201cno lien,\u201d as an issue of fact; because it might well be that for some cause dehors the record there was no lien; as, that the claim had not been in fact filed within six months after the work done or materials furnished \u2014 that the work was not done or the materials furnished on the credit of the building \u2014 that the plaintiffs had bound themselves to file no claim, or that the building was not such a one as was within the Acts of Assembly; and there maybe other defences coming under the same category. But, as to defects on the face of the claim filed, they are not raised by such a plea. It is time that some regard to forms and rules of pleading should be observed and enforced in proceedings upon mechanic\u2019s claims. No lawyer ever thought of going to trial before a jury upon a special demurrer to the declaration, or of objecting to evidence offered, on the ground that the count was defective. It was said by Mr. Justice Burnside, in delivering the opinion of tbe court in Shaw v. Barnes, 5 Barr 18 : \u201c Here there was a trial on the merits. As this court has settled in Lehman v. Thomas, 5 W. & S. 262, that the court may .strike from the record an irregular mechanic\u2019s claim on petition and answer or demurrer, I will get over technical objections rather than disturb the merits of a case.\u201d That was really the ground upon which that judgment went, as an attentive examination of the ease will satisfy the student. In Lybrandt v. Eberly, 12 Casey 847, the court say: \u201c We know not how any issue to the jury can be raised on the formal deficiencies of the claim filed \u2014 such as the want of dates, for these are mere questions of law. Such objections in accurate practice ought to be raised by demurrer, or by moving to strike off the lien, and we ought to come to this as soon as we can.\u201d And again, in Howell v. City of Philadelphia, 2 Wright 471: \u201c The objection to the lien for want of dates might have been formidable on demurrer or a motion to strike off, but after pleading to the scire facias it must be considered as waived.\u201d\nIt is unnecessary, therefore, to consider the objections to the validity of the claim filed in this case. As was said by this court in Lewis v. Morgan, 11 S. & R. 234, when such objections were raised under the plea of payment, \u201c the points, on which the defendants required the direction of the court, were not involved by the pleadings, and an error with respect to them in the charge cannot be assigned as a ground for reversing the judgment.\u201d So, also, it could form no objection to the evidence offered, that the claim was defective, if it did not vary from it.\nJudgment affirmed.",

When the mechanic contracts, not with owner but the contractor, the kind of work and materials must be set out.\n3. The contractor cannot bind the building for more than the materials and work at a fair market price.\n4. Where the plea in a scire facias on a Mechanics\u2019 Lien was \u201cno lien,\u201d no question as to the sufficiency of the lien could arise on the trial of issues of fact.\n5.

J., Read, Agnew, Sharswood and Williams, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny county: No. 19, to October and November Term 1869.\nThis was a scire facias on a mechanic\u2019s lien, issued June 18th 1868, by William Burke and David Glass, partners, &e. against Francis L. Lee, owner, and Duncan & Waughter, contractors. The defendant Lee pleaded \u201cNo lien, payment, set-off with leave.\u201d\nThe case was tried November 17th Y868, before Stowe, J.\nThe claim filed was for $296.30, against a building in Pittsburg, \u201cbeing a debt contracted for materials furnished by the said claimant, within six months- last past, and work done in and about the erection and construction of the said building, of which the said Francis L. Lee was and is the owner or reputed owner, and Duncan & Waughter the architects, builders and contractors thereof, at whose instance and request the said materials were furnished and work was done, for painting house aforesaid. * * * And the said claimant hereto annexes a bill of particulars, of the amount of $296.30, said debt showing the nature, kind and amount of materials furnished and work done, and the time when the same were furnished and done.\u201d\n\u201c Francis L.

Duncan, one of the contractors, testified as to the work and its character.\nThe plaintiffs proposed to ask witness what was the amount of work done by them, the material furnished, and the value of the same, both as to labor and material.\nDefendants objected upon the ground that the lien filed does not set forth the kind and amount of material furnished, as is required by Act of Assembly.\nThe court admitted the evidence, and sealed a bill of exceptions. The plaintiff gave evidence of the work done by them to the building under their contract with the contractors, also of glazing and of extra work done by the direction of Lee.\nAmongst other things the court charged:\u2014\n\u201cWe are asked to instruct you that the lien is defective in not being sufficiently specific as to the work done and materials furnished. We hold that the lien is sufficient for the painting, and materials furnished for painting, but not for glass or glazing, as that is not included in the lien filed, as we interpret it.\u201d\nThe verdict was for the plaintiff for $201.43.\nThe defendant, Lee, took out a writ of error, and assigned for error the admission of plaintiffs\u2019 offer of evidence, and the parts of the charge given above.\nT. C. Lazear (with whom were J. M. Kennedy and J. Hopkins), for plaintiff in error.\n\u2014 The Act of June 16th 1836, Pamph.
