        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, January 3d 1871, by\nRead, J.\n\u2014 John Yerner, by his last will dated 14th June 1837 and proved July 6th 1837, devised and bequeathed as follows:\u2014 \u201cFirst, I will and bequeath to my daughters Christiana and Phoebe the house I now live in, together with all my household furniture, and 20 acres of land with the privilege of half the orchard \u2014 the orchard to be divided in quantity and quality; I will to my daughters Christiana and Phoebe all my cattle, hogs, sheep and fowls, and half of the Het mare, and likewise half the clock, half of all the grain in the ground, and half of all the grain in the barn. The remainder of my estate, real and personal, I will and bequeath to my son Thomas Yerner, in addition to what I have already given him, with the privilege of the barn (until he can get one built with the exception of one of the stables). I will to my son Thomas Yerner all my farming utensils, wagon, windmill, &c. The large copper kettle to belong to my daughters Christiana and Phoebe, and my son Thomas Yerner.\u201d \u201cI will to my daughters Christiana and Phoebe, to have privilege of what coal they may want. The 20 acres of land I have willed to my daughters Christiana and. Phoebe, to have during their lifetime; at their death, to have the privilege to will to my daughter Sarah Kerr\u2019s children or my son Thomas Yerner\u2019s children, just .as they see proper.\u201d\nChristiana died in 1850 intestate, and without issue. Phoebe Yerner died in 1863 without issue, having made her last will and testament dated March 18th 1859, which was duly proved.\nBy this will she bequeathed as follows: \u2014 \u201c I will to my nephew Melchor Yerner one feather bed and the necessary bedding. The bed willed to Melchor to be the bed usually known as \u2018 Melchor\u2019s bed.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201c I will the 20 acres of land, bequeathed to me and my sister Christiana by our father, to my nephew Melchor Yerner, son of my brother Thomas Yerner, his heirs and assigns for ever, as a compensation for his services while he resided with my sister Christiana and myself.\u201d\n\u201c I will all my personal property not mentioned above to be equally divided between my brother Thomas Yerner and my nephew Melchor Yerner.\u201d\nShe appointed Melchor Yerner her executor. The plaintiffs are the children of Sarah Kerr, deceased, and the defendant who is in possession is the only child of Thomas Verner.\nThe whole tenor and scope of this will shows in the clearest manner it was the express intent of the testator to confer an estate upon Christiana and Phoebe for their joint lives in such wise, that the share of the one first deceased should enure on her death for the benefit of the survivor. I have quoted nearly the whole will, as this construction necessarily results from an implication pervading the whole will and clearly Reducible from the spirit of its provisions : Arnold v. Jack\u2019s Executors, 12 Harris 57; Jack\u2019s Executors v. Arnold, 1 Grant 405 ; Lentz v. Lentz, 2 Philad. R. 117.\nThis being the nature of the estate, it follows logically that the privilege or power was legally executed by the will of the survivor, Phoebe, and that the court below were right.\nThe court below would be right, even if the power did not survive; for in that event the estate would be vested in Thomas Yerner.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Phoebe died in 1863, having made her will, which contains this clause:\u2014\n\u201cI will the 20 acres of land bequeathed to me and my sister Christiana, by our father, unto my nephew Melchor Verner, son of my brother Thomas Verner, his heirs and assigns, for ever, as a compensation for his services while he resided with my sister Christiana and myself.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs are the children of Sarah Kerr, the defendant is the devisee under Phoebe\u2019s will.\nThe plaintiffs contended that the power, under the will of John Verner, could not be executed by Phoebe alone, and therefore the land passed to them and the defendant in equal shares.\nThe court directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiffs for eight-ninths of the land, reserving the question whether, under all the evidence, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. The jury found in accordance with the instruction of the court. After-wards, August 1st 1868, the court in banc (Hampton, P. J.) directed judgment for the defendant on the reserved point, non obstante veredicto.\nThis was assigned for error by the plaintiffs on the removal of the case to the Supreme Court.\nT. C.
