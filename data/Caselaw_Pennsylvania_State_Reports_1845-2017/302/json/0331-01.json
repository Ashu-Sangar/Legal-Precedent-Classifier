        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe appeal before us is from the discharge by the court below of a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient reply to new matter filed by defendant in addition to its affidavit of defense.\nThe action is assumpsit on a surety bond executed by Fred Steinfeld, principal, and the 2Etna Casualty and Surety Company as surety, guaranteeing the erection of fifty-three dwelling houses, with garages, etc., on which plaintiff claims to hold, for a good and valuable consideration paid by it to Steinfeld, second mortgages aggregating $106,000. Steinfeld defaulted in the erection of the buildings. The surety company in its affidavit of defense and \u201cnew matter\u201d filed supplemental thereto, denies that plaintiff paid good or valuable consideration for tbe mortgages and avers fraud in securing tbe bond.\nAs said in Colonial Security Co. v. Levy et al. (No. 2), tbe preceding case, .filed simultaneously herewith, unless tbe record shows facts \u201cclear and free from doubt,\u201d this court will sustain the refusal of summary judgment. Tbe whole record of this case is one of averments and denials which can only be determined after full development at trial, consequently the court below was correct in so deciding.\nThe order of the court below is affirmed.",
