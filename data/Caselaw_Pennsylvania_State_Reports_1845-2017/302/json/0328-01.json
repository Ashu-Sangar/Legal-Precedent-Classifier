The trial judge entered a compulsory nonsuit because plaintiff\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove negligence on the part of defendants\u2019 agent operating the car, and, after reading and considering the evidence presented in the record, we see no error in that conclusion.\nThe order is affirmed.",
