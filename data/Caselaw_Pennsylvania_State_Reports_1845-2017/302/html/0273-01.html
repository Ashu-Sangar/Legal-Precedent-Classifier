At midday of July 2, 1928, Nora Bailey, the plaintiff, was on the sidewalk at the southeast corner of this intersection, when the motor truck of the defendant, C. Lewis Lavine, Inc. (herein called Lavine), moving south in Forty-seventh Street collided with a Rolls-Royce automobile (herein called the car), moving easterly in Springfield Avenue, so that the truck ran onto the sidewalk and against plaintiff, doing her serious injury. The Rolls-Royce was owned by Paul M. Arnold and Edith G. Arnold. At the time of the accident, the car was being driven by their chauffeur, Howard Collins, but plaintiff, on the contention that while the car was being driven by Collins, he was, in fact, in the employ of the defendant Rolls-Royce of America, Inc. (hereinafter called the <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>Rolls-Royce), who, it is alleged, had the car for purpose of repair. Therefore this suit was brought against La-vine and the Rolls-Royce on the contention that the accident resulted from their concurrent negligence. It was agreed that plaintiff’s damages were |3,500, and for that amount the jury rendered a verdict against both defendants. The court in banc denied Ravine’s motion for judgment n. o. v. and also for a new trial and entered judgment against it on the verdict, but granted the Rolls-Royce a new trial, and Ravine brought this appeal.</p>

A careful study of the record fails to sustain this contention. True, there is testimony of eyewitnesses that the truck came first to the crossing, moving at moderate speed and was run into by the car going at high speed. Much of the proof sustains this contention, but there is also positive testimony of eyewitnesses that the car came first to the crossing and was run into by the truck. This finds some corroboration in the testimony that the car was injured at the side and not in front. There is also the further fact that the car came from the right and, under the Act of June 30, 1919, P. L. 678, had the right of way when both reached the intersection simultaneously. See Davis et ux. v. American Ice Co., <a href="/pa/285/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="285 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1095156" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0177-01">285 Pa. 177</a>; Black v.

We have considered the argument of Ravine that its contention is supported by the physical facts, and while there is some discrepancy as to distances, speed, etc., it cannot be found as matter of law that the physical facts free it from blame. The rule that oral testimony cannot stand in face of physical facts, applies only to clear cases, and this is not of that character. Where the culpability of the respective parties depends upon a controverted question of fact, the case is for the jury: Wiebe v. Powers, <a href="/pa-super/86/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="86 Pa. Super. 389" data-case-ids="570073" data-case-paths="/pa-super/86/0389-01">86 Pa. Superior Ct. 389</a>.

As plaintiff, in the instant case, might have brought her suit against appellant only, so she might have discontinued the action against the Rolls-Royce at any time. She should not be put to the delay, expense and hazard of another trial because of the court’s action as to the co-<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>defendant. The Act of June 29, 1923, P. L. 981, authorizes a plaintiff to proceed against some jointly sued although the court may dismiss the action as to others, with the same effect as if the latter had not been joined. See Cleary v. Quaker City Cab Co. et al., supra. This question is discussed in S. Samuel &amp; Brother v. Superior Court (R. I.), L. R. A. 1918 C, page 967, and note, page 970. And a case in point is Moreland v. Durocher et al., <a href="/mich/121/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="121 Mich. 398" data-case-ids="1550861" data-case-paths="/mich/121/0398-01">121 Mich. 398</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20N.W.%20284" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="80 N.W. 284">80 N. W. 284</a>, which holds: “In this case the plaintiff might have proceeded against the defendants as to whom the judgment now stands, or she might have discontinued the case as to their codefendants at any stage of the proceedings. It is not easy to perceive, therefore, where the action is thus severable as well as joint, and where the right exists to proceed against a portion or all of the defendants, why the plaintiff should be compelled to lose her judgment against a portion because it appears that the others are entitled to a new trial. The case of Albright v. McTighe, <a href="/f/49/0817-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="49 F. 817" data-case-ids="3819618" data-case-paths="/f/49/0817-01">49 Fed. 817</a>, contains a careful review of all the authorities, and the conclusion is reached that, by a clear weight of modern authority, the practice pursued in this case is proper.”</p>

Of course, plaintiff can recover but one satisfaction; but the trial court may so mold the proceedings as to do equity among the defendants. See First Nat. Bank of Pittsburgh v.

At the <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>trial, however, the court held no recovery could be had against them because as to them the matter was res judicata. This, because plaintiff at first brought her suit against Lavine and the Arnolds and recovered a verdict against both, but the trial court thereafter entered judgment in favor of the Arnolds n. o. v. and granted a new trial as to Lavine. While the present action was subsequently brought against Lavine and the Rolls-Royce, no appeal was taken from the judgment entered in favor of the Arnolds. The correctness of this conclusion was not challenged in the trial court and is not here; hence, we need not further consider the Act of 1929.</p>
