Ryback, who was driving from fifty to sixty miles an hour in a very hard rain, attempted to go around an “S” curve. The car slid off the road, broke a telephone pole in half, turned over and killed Perry. Deceased’s widow brought this action, for herself and children, against Ryback and recovered a verdict. On judgment in her favor this appeal followed.</p>

Whether or not the journey was a joint enterprise is immaterial to the determination of this case. That doctrine is applicable only where one of the parties to the enterprise sues a third party. “Where the action is brought against a third party, the rule is that the negligence of one member of the joint enterprise within the scope of that enterprise will be imputed to the other. ...... When the action is brought by one member of the enterprise against another, there is no place to apply the doctrine of imputed negligence...... The situation when the action is brought by one member of the enterprise against the other is entirely different from that when recovery is sought against a third person”: Johnson v. Hetrick, <a href="/pa/300/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="300 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1125925" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0225-01">300 Pa. 225</a>, 233.</p>

The general rule may be stated as follows: When two or more persons are engaged in any pursuit whether it is pleasure, business, mutual convenience or fellowship, each owes to the other the duty to exercise due care in their relation so that no injury shall happen through a neglect of that duty. The care required in such relation is what men of ordinary prudence would use in similar circumstances. The fact that the mutual safety of the persons in the relation depends on the exercise of care by all, does not enlarge or emphasize the duty. It is ordinary care under the circumstances. Where one in that relation fails to perform that duty he is responsible for the resultant injury. The rights of the parties as to each other, with regard to the duty enjoined, are separate and distinct, even though one of the parties in the relation is dependent. What constitutes a failure of duty is a relative term and must depend on the facts of each case. The owner of an automobile is liable to his guest or passenger if he negligently operates his car to <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>the injury of his guest or passenger. We do not here determine liability if the car is driven other than by the owner.</p>
    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[124,536,1153,1078]]]'>While this liability is thus fixed on one of the parties of the enterprise through his negligent acts, there is a duty imposed on the other party, the deceased in this case. It has been stated in many of our cases, that, where the action is against third persons, the duty thus resting on the other party is to caution, warn, remonstrate or protest to the driver as to his fast or careless driving: Curran v. Lehigh Valley R. R., <a href="/pa/299/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="299 Pa. 584" data-case-ids="1122323" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0584-01">299 Pa. 584</a>, 591.

The same rule applies where the action is between the parties of a mutual venture. It was the duty of the deceased, when he noticed Ryback driving at the rate of speed as here testified, to protest or warn him against it. If he failed to perform this duty, he was guilty of contributory negligence ; the law would assume under such circumstances that he was satisfied with the operation of the car, and that he was willing to join Ryback in the hazard or in taking a chance on the result of fast driving.</p>

But there is no such impossibility in the evidence in this case. Appellee’s husband was a lawyer, and also published the Erie County Law Journal. The net income from the law practice and the journal were given, and there was testimony that more than half the income came from the law practice. Appellant had every opportunity to check the reliability of this testimony. The books, with these charges entered, were in court. The witness testified from them, and when appellant was asked if he wished to have the items read,, he specifically declined to have this done. The evidence was only important to show that his earnings were sufficient each year to give to his wife and children what, as was testified to, they received before his death. Such contributions are the basis for the measure of damages as will be seen later. They did not comprise all his earnings and were a few hundred dollars over one half of his net income. The verdict of $8,000 shows that the jury was very considerate in its conclusion. The charge of the court was full and explicit on the question of damages, following closely the opinion of Mr. Justice Walling in Glasco v. Green, <a href="/pa/273/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="273 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="1070804" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0353-01">273 Pa. 353</a>; and the charge was fully supported by the evidence.</p>

The application of the best evidence rule is ordinarily confined to primary and secondary evidence and relates largely to the production of documents, as where one desires to prove the terms of a writing. Production of the original or an exact duplicate must be made unless its absence is satisfactorily explained. Here there is no attempt to prove the contents of a writing but to show the amounts of deceased’s earnings. For .this purpose, written or oral testimony is clearly admissible. Books of original entry are not necessarily the only evidence nor the best evidence of a given state of facts but a party may make out his case as to such facts by the testimony of a witness. See Wigmore on Evidence, supra, also Henry’s Pa. Trial Evidence, section 97, and authorities cited. Books of account are always competent to refresh the memory of a witness who had personal knowledge of a transaction: Nichols v. Haynes, <a href="/pa/78/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="78 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1040358" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0174-01">78 Pa. 174</a>, 176; Hottle v.

Co., supra, but the case does not control the instant one. Plaintiff there, who conducted a detective agency, merely stated he made $10,000 a year. This was an approximation of his earnings. We held that as no effort was made to give any detailed account or description of his business or gross receipts and expenses, or in any manner to depict what he was doing, the evidence was not sufficient, it was merely a guess at earnings, in<a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>sufficient on which to base a claim for damages. The court distinctly held that it was not always necessary to produce books to prove damages in a personal injury case.</p>
    <p id="b595-5" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[135,571,1149,643]]]'>The stenographer, testifying from the ledger, stated that she took the accounts she received from each person and kept them in the ledger and added them up. There were receipts from deceased’s law and publishing business. With the book before her she stated his net income per year was $5,700. All the evidence was admitted without objection. She stated that the receipts from the legal journal were nearly half of the net receipts. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to find deceased’s earning power as it related to the contribution made to his family. Even if an objection had been made we would not regard it as serious.</p>
    <p id="b595-6" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[134,1234,1151,360]]]'>The learned trial judge endeavored to charge the jury on the question of contributory negligence as fully as it was possible for him to do, requesting appellant to point out in what respect his charge was insufficient. As we read the charge it more than protected appellant’s rights. The verdict was reasonable; the case was free from error.</p>
    <p id="b595-7" data-blocks='[["BL_595.6",595,[184,1623,907,42]]]'>The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>
