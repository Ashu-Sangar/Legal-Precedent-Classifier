It contracted with Uhl for the construction of the steel work, Dunn for the concrete piers, and a third party for the roofing. While working on the steel structure, McDonald, an employee of Uhl, was injured due to the breaking of a concrete pier. Compensation was awarded to the employee through Uhl as employer under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. McDonald then brought an action against Levinson for damages resulting from the injury, alleging neglect of duty in providing a defectively constructed pier on which Uhl’s work was to be done: Gallivan v. Wark, <a href="/pa/288/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="288 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="1100765" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0443-01">288 Pa. 443</a>; Kelly v.

The questions submitted to the jury were: (1) was the construction sufficiently strong to stand the stress and strain of the steel work to be erected, (2) was such construction built by Dunn according to Levinson’s plans and specifications, and (3) did Levinson exercise-due care in preparing such plans and specifications.

On the one hand we have persons before us, <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>such as Levinson, endeavoring to escape the effect of the Compensation Act so that they will not be compelled to pay compensation or carry insurance, and, on the other hand, as here, when faced with liability at common law, they strive vigorously to come under the sheltering protection of the act. Appellee is now endeavoring to do the latter as a statutory employer.</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[271,729,1149,693]]]'>A statutory employer is a master who is not a contractual or common law one but is made one by the act. There is no difficulty in determining in most cases whether or not one is a statutory employer. The law has been fairly well settled by this court, and the zones of liability or nonliability rather well defined. There are cases, however, like the one before us, where no clear chart has been laid down, although many of the decisions are helpful. It will be better for the efficient administration of the Compensation Act to construe it literally as to the obligations created, leaving those under the common law that were apparently intended to be so, and under the Compensation Act those intended.</p>

    <p id="b319-3" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[136,623,1149,1395]]]'>The difficulty arises chiefly in determining who the legislature intended should be included within the class of statutory employers, as distinguished from master and servant at common law, which is taken care of elsewhere by the act. It depends on the construction of article I, section 105, article II, section 203, and article III, section 302 (b), of the Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, which will be found in the report of this case. Section 302 (b) merely carries into effect section 203. Section 105 modified “contractor” in section 203 so as to exclude a contractor engaged in an independent business, or an independent contractor, but includes a subcontractor to whom a principal contractor has sublet part of the work. A “contractor” other than an “independent contractor” could mean nothing bfit a dependent or subcontractor. We know of no other classification of contractors in this connection than independent and subcontractors. Though contractors are often referred to as general, original, principal and independent, the sense here used indicates their relation to the work as dependent or independent. “Contractors” as used in section 105 is synonymous with “subcontractors” (Gallivan v. Wark, <a href="/pa/288/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="288 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="1100765" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0443-01">supra,</a> and other cases); though, as stated in Qualp v. Stewart Co., <a href="/pa/266/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="266 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="1056093" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0502-01">266 Pa. 502</a>, subcontractors are still regarded as independent contractors under certain conditions.</p>

Here again section 105 helps out for it describes the person in whom the principal contract is lodged as being the principal <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>contractor. “Employer” is the only other person named in section 203 in connection with “contractor” and the employer must be a party to the principal contract. Employer includes principal contractor, and as most generally used in sections 105 and 203 they must be regarded as synonymous: Qualp v. Stewart Co., supra.</p>
    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.4",320,[279,674,1150,1119]]]'>If the term “employer” in section 203 means the owner or one in the position of owner, and a lessee is none the less in the position of an owner when he builds or erects for himself or for his own use a structure on the property leased, then the section would read: “an owner who permits on his premises employees hired by a subcontractor......shall be as to such employees a statutory employer.” The owner would not be liable to-the employees of an independent contractor since the act specifically excludes an owner from liability to the employees of an independent contractor (section 105 and section 203: Brooks v. Buckley &amp; Banks, <a href="/pa/291/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="291 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1107282" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0001-01">291 Pa. 1</a>; McGrath v.

Such construction not only would create an arbitrary classification but also would lead to an impossible result. By holding that an owner is not a statutory employer and that employer and principal contractor are synonymous, these sections are workable.</p>

We may concede that the regular business of Levinson was constructing similar work for others, and he was an employer to his own employees. Further, the work was done on premises leased by him. However, the work under which the accident took place was that let to an independent contractor by Levinson as lessee-owner. Merely because the work is on his own property and is done in the course of his regular business does not bring him within the act: Brooks v. Buckley &amp; Banks, <a href="/pa/291/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="291 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1107282" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0001-01">supra;</a> McGrath v.

This lease provided that “The lessees are to remove no substantial important addition or improvement made by lessor or lessees, nor to materially alter the premises, nor to assign this lease voluntarily, nor to assign this lease involuntarily by judicial sale or otherwise, without written consent of the lessor, under penalty of instant forfeiture of this lease” and “it is mutually agreed that all important substantial alterations, additions or improvements to the building which may be made by either of the parties <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>hereto......shall be the property of the lessor and shall remain upon......the premises as a part thereof, at the termination of this lease.”</p>

It cannot arise merely from the fact that the building afterwards becomes the property of the owner and is then for his benefit. However, the above is the only authority or semblance of a contract to build which appellee produces to make Levinson a principal contractor with the owner; it did not require Levinson to build. To hold him as a principal contractor within sections 105 and 203, simply because such provisions appear in a lease, would make all lessees of property for a long or short term, who undertake building operations, responsible for injuries to the employees of contractors engaged thereon to do the work. A lessee, as to the work involved, is in the same position as an owner. The test of compensation is not actual ownership of the property. The legislature did not intend to base the rights of workmen on such condition. In short, it specified a principal contract requiring a principal contractor to accomplish a given result, with an “occupancy and/or control” through that contract as a necessary incident. Here there is no such contract to build for the lessor-owner. The lease merely specifies what shall happen in case a building is erected. The owner of premises may contract with his lessee to erect a structure, and in such case the lessee would be acting as an erector, builder or principal contractor and not as a lessee. But the lease in this case is not such a contract and so does not constitute such a relation as to make Levinson a principal contractor. The position of appellee is rather forced.</p>
