Annie died intestate, without issue, on January 28, 1918, and the survivor, Alice, continued to manage the property until her death on November 9, 1927.

The sums received from the other portions of the structure raised the total revenue to $11,760.

The then tenants agreed to make changes for the mutual benefit of all interested, to pay the sum of $10,000 for the benefit of the Conner Estate, and make as well large outlays for alterations and improvements; Smyser &amp; Scott being given the right to make openings between the store occupied by them and the building acquired by the lessee.

Answers were filed raising objections to the granting of the relief prayed for, but no suggestion appears in the pleadings that the court of common pleas was without jurisdiction to settle the controversy. It is contended for the first time in the brief here filed by the appellants that the orphans’ court was given sole control of acts of trustees by the Revised Price Act (June 7, 1917, P. L. 388, section 2), but it will be noted that this grant of authority is limited by section 3, which expressly declares the statute shall not repeal or impair the authority of any act authorizing decrees of court as to real estate (as provided by section 31 "of the Fiduciaries Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447), “nor affect or impair any rights or powers otherwise existing in any person or corporation.” If the surviving trustee here possessed the right to lease for the term in question at the risk of the continuance of the life estate for the period fixed, and could show the transaction fair and conscionable if attacked, as in this case, even though he failed to protect against possibility of error in the manner permitted by the legislation above referred to, then the Revised Price Act clearly has no application.</p>

At common law, however, the right to demise the property existed at the peril of the one so contracting. Judge Gest considered the extent of the trustee’s power in this regard disputable, saying, in Craig’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=24%20Pa.%20D.%20851" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="24 Pa.

The legislation referred to provided that the trustee should be absolved from any personal liability in the event of the trust estate ending prior to the stipulated term of leasing by reason of the ending of the life interest. This statute did not purport to take away from the trustee the right to lease for a greater period than five years at his own risk, but did adopt a plan by which he would be safeguarded when such a contract was made for a longer period and the life estate ended prior to the time fixed in the demise, and the orphans’ court had preliminarily determined the terms to be advantageous.</p>

The section referred to merely provided a method by which a lease for a longer term than five years could be made without the fear of surcharge in case of the death of the beneficiary during the term designated, continuing the tenancy notwithstanding, and gave to the trustee protection in such case, if it should later appear that the terms approved by the court were found to be improvident.

If the section in question had created a power in respect to leases for five years [or longer] not theretofore existing, such power could be exercised only in the manner provided by the statute; but where the power to lease theretofore existed, permissive language used in a statute should not be construed as restricting or limiting the power theretofore existing, where it is perfectly apparent that the purpose of the statute was to accomplish an entirely different end. The question before us is not whether the defendant can lawfully execute a lease [with an option to renew, extending the term beyond five years], which should be binding upon remaindermen in case of the termination of the trust by the death of the life beneficiary, but whether such a lease can be [validly] made, as between the parties, subject only to the contingency of being terminated by the death of the life beneficiary during the term of the lease.” The decision cited has been followed by the courts of the same state in Aimone Mfg.

Section 31 of the Fiduciaries Act recognized the right of the trustee to lease for more than five years, but furnished to him protection in case the trust terminated within the term fixed, or the consideration was found later to. be insufficient, if preliminary sanction of the orphans’ court had been obtained. This was an expansion and not a limitation of the implied power of the trustee to act on his own initiative and at his own peril as theretofore existing. The life tenant of the property in question is now living, and only 57 years of age. Should he die during the term granted to defendants their rights cease, though the lease purported to transfer possession for twenty-five years from 1930. Until this event occurs,'the substituted trustees have no standing to object. Nor can they complain of the reasonableness of the arrangement consummated, if the trustee had the power to enter into it. The relief prayed for cannot be granted on the ground of alleged insufficiency of the consideration contracted for, in view of the express declaration of the court that it is fair to all concerned.
