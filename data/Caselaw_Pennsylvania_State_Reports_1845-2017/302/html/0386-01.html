Warne died leaving a will, with two codicils attached, by which he devised his estate in trust, directing that the net income be paid to his wife, Emma, for life, and thereafter divided in equal parts between his two sons, Theodore and William, Jr., as long as they should live, free from any debts or engagements contracted by them. On the death of either, one-half of the corpus was given to the deceased son’s living children, or the issue of any dead, and, if none such were in esse, then the whole income passed to the remaining brother. The following phrase in the will, to be viewed in the light of the codicils executed shortly thereafter, led to the present controversy: “Should both of my said sons die without issue, then upon the death of the survivor I direct that my estate shall go to such <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>persons as would then be entitled under the laws of this State, if I had died intestate.”</p>

As was said in Wood v. Schoen, <a href="/pa/216/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="216 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="950370" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0425-01">216 Pa. 425</a>, 431: “We cannot agree with the contention of the learned counsel of the appellee that the effect of the disposition of the remainder by the will is the same as if the testator had made no disposition of that part of his estate and had died intestate as to it. In the latter instance, it may be conceded that the intestacy would have taken effect as of the date of the testator’s death, and the persons then competent would have taken the estate subject to the prior life tenancies. But the manifest purpose of the testator was to change the effect of an intestacy occurring at his death, and to give his real estate to persons other than those who would be his heirs at that time, and hence he devised it, on the death of the life tenant, to those ‘who would then be entitled,’ and not to those ‘who are entitled’ under the intestate laws of the State...... The language employed leaves no doubt as to the persons who were intended as his beneficiaries.” We are not impressed with the argument that Warne used the word “then” frequently in his will and codicils, intending thereby at times only to suggest that the thought to be conveyed was the equivalent of the words “in that event.” In the clause mentioned, he clearly employs it to designate a period of time when the distributees should be determined.</p>

The first was added nine days after execution of the will, and reads: “I direct that after my wife’s death, if both of my sons should depart this life without leaving children or issue of deceased children them surviving, then the survivor of my said sons shall have the power to dispose of my estate to such person or persons and for such estates as he, the said survivor, shall by his last will and testament limit and appoint.

The trustee named by the father filed an account, and the orphans’ court awarded to her this proportion of the residuary estate. She died in 1926, and her demise was followed by that of Theodore, the second son, on November 24, 1929, leaving no issue. He also left a will, dated April 9, 1906, giving his share of the estate to his mother for life, and, thereafter, or if shet predeceased him, to William, also dead. As a result, his attempted disposition of one-half the father’s estate was inoperative: Linnard’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.N.C.%20566" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="9 W.N.C. 566">9 W.

Whether these shall be determined as of the date of his death, or of that of Theodore, is the question raised by certain appellants, while others, claiming through the mother, insist that, since the surviving son left no effective will, the property passed, under the will of William, Jr., to her as his devisee. To reach the proper conclusion, as to those entitled to share in the fund for distribution, it is necessary to examine the words of the will, as affected by the two codicils.</p>

He gave a life estate to the wife, and provided, under spendthrift trusts, for the distribution of the income to his two sons on her death. <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>If neither left issue, the estate was to be divided according to the intestate laws among his heirs and next of kin in existence when the surviving child died. He determined subsequently to give the sons the right to name those who should benefit, if it should happen no children were born to either, and therefore prepared the first codicil, conferring, in such contingency, on the survivor, the additional right to dispose of the entire estate, providing, however, that in case of default, his property should pass under the intestate laws to his heirs and next of kin, as originally provided in his will, which he, in express terms, ratified and confirmed, though he failed to expressly designate the time when the distributees should be determined. It is plain that his sole purpose was to grant to the survivor the additional power to dispose of his property, if there were no children, but the provision as to distribution under the intestate laws was to be effective only in case no will, executing the power of appointment, existed.</p>
    <p id="b421-5" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[105,1374,1153,1023]],["BL_422.1",422,[289,343,1149,367]]]'>In any event, the first codicil was completely eliminated by the second, in which the testator disclosed an intent to allow each son to dispose of only one-half, depriving the survivor of the privilege to appoint as to the whole. Here, it is again provided that the estate should pass as if the testator had died intestate, as directed in the original will, without, however, definitely referring to the time when the heirs and next of kin should be determined, but the provision for such a distribution was to take effect only in case of default on the part of either son to exercise by will his privilege to dispose of the portion named. This contingency never arose, since both William, Jr., and Theodore left such instruments. We must therefore look to the testator’s will to find those entitled to share. The testament as first written put it beyond the power of the children to determine the ultimate disposition of any portion of the estate. In the first codicil, the controlling thought was solely to give them jointly through survivorship power <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>to dispose of the whole, and, in the second, to each separately the privilege of dividing a part of the property. The direction as to distribution, according to the intestate laws, was to be effective only in case no wills were written. Such a situation did not arise, and the clauses in the two codicils, referring to the possible intestacy, under such circumstances, never became effective.</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[289,723,1151,1010]]]'>The purpose of the additions to the will was to grant to the children further power over the estate, and the reference to the taking by others, if they failed to exercise the privilege granted, was merely incidental, and dependent on conditions which did not happen. As was said in Line’s Est., <a href="/pa/221/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="221 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="956141" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0374-01">221 Pa. 374</a>, 379: “If any specific change is made [in a codicil] it negatives an intention to make other alterations in the provisions of the will.” We think the principle there stated applicable here, for it is apparent that the intention of testator in making the two supplements to his will was to give to his sons control of the final disposition of his property should they so desire. Neither was written with the thought of altering the provisions as to the parties who would inherit, if the contingencies set forth by testator did not occur. In both cases, he reaffirmed the provisions of the testament first executed, and, under the circumstances, it must control in determining those entitled to share.</p>

The dissenting opinion of Judge Lamorelle rests on the assumption that the codicils provided an entirely new scheme of distribution, and, as a result, the provisions of testator’s will, as to the ultimate disposition of his property, were revoked and cannot therefore be considered in determining those who should inherit, if it became necessary to distribute under the intestate laws. As we have noticed, this change, if it can be said to have been made, <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>was to be effective only on the contingency that the sons left no testaments, bnt both did, and therefore the provisions of the will itself must be applied.</p>

The contention is based on the wording of the second codicil, which uses the phrase: “Should the son so dying without a will leave no children, or issue of deceased children, then I direct the whole estate shall go to such persons as may be directed by the last will and testament of the other son.” It is urged the half share of Theodore therefore passed under the will of his brother William to the mother, or her estate. The court below properly construed the word “other” to mean “surviving,” and the will of the survivor was ineffective to pass any property.</p>

The evident intention was to give both control of an equal part, with the privilege of ultimately naming a distributee of his own choice. This thought, interjected into the second codicil, is to be read in connection with the provisions of the first, which allowed the survivor to dispose of all. The “other” evidently means the son “remaining”; to hold otherwise would allow William, Jr., to dispose of the entire estate, though the clear purpose of the second addition to the will was to limit his appointment to one-half, the portion which he actually devised and the mother received. If the contention of these appellants prevailed, it would give the mother’s estate also the one-half as to which Theodore was alone given the power of appointment, though it could not pass to her by his will, because she predeceased him, and, as before noticed, his attempt to so appoint was abortive. The <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>further suggestion is made that, though the word “other” be considered as the equivalent of “surviving,” then the mother’s estate will share nevertheless in a distribution under the will of testator as one of his heirs at law and next of kin; but such position finds no support in our decisions: Stoler’s Est., supra; Garrett’s App., <a href="/pa/249/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="249 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="1013663" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0249-01">249 Pa. 249</a>.</p>

Careful opinions were filed in the court below expressing the conflicting views of the sitting judges, and the contentions of the respective parties were skillfully presented here in both written and oral arguments. We are convinced that the adjudication as finally adopted by the majority of the court expresses correctly the testator’s purpose, and the distribution was properly made among the heirs at law and next of kin of the father, who were living when the surviving son died in 1929.</p>
