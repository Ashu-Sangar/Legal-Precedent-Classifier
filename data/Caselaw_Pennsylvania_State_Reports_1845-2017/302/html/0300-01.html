Acting in pursuance of the authority granted by the Sproul Highway Act of May 31, 1911 (P. L. 468, section 8), as amended in 1921 (April 6, P. L. 107), a map was prepared, establishing the lines of the land condemned, approved by the governor, and duly recorded. By the certificate it appeared the ultimate width of the right of way was fixed at one hundred feet, the center line being definitely designated and marked. Reference was made in the paper filed to eight sheets showing the character of work presently contemplated throughout the entire taking. One referred to, indicating the construction through plaintiff’s property, showed that at this time but thirty-three feet would be improved and macadamized, though the official certificate fixed one hundred feet as the amount appropriated.

No agreement for compensation was reached, and the title holder of the property presented a petition to the court of quarter sessons for the appointment of viewers to determine the value of the land condemned. Basing their report on the taking of 100 feet, as shown by the map of record, though the new construction occupied but one-third of that width, an award of $10,500 was made. Exceptions were filed by the county raising two questions of fact properly the subject of an appeal, and a third which attacked the legality of the assessment on the ground that the basis of recovery should have been limited to the thirty-three feet built upon. As this objection went to the validity of the entire report, the ques<a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>tion was properly considered preliminarily by he court below: Act of April 18, 1905, P. L. 198. It beld that the right to recover was limited to the strip actually occupied by the new construction, and that the award could not be based on a taking of the width as fixed in the certificate of the secretary of highways and approved by the governor. The report was therefore set aside without prejudice on the part of the petitioner to proceed again to have an assessment of damages based on the amount of land presently paved. From tbe final order so made this appeal was taken.</p>

A like power exists where land is appropriated in effecting a divergence from a fixed route for convenience under the legislation above referred to. By the Sproul Act of 1911, entry for this purpose was allowed upon filing the proper plans, but the compensation was directed <em>to </em>be paid by the State (section 16) ; all loss occurring by the taking under the particular map filed to be assessed in one proceeding: May v.

The Amending Act of 1921, supra, also expressly provided for the fixing of the width by the certified and recorded plan, transferring to the county the liability for the damages recoverable. Having fixed the extent of the appropriation in this case in terms at 100 feet, the landowner could demand compensation, when a part was entered on, as if tbe entire strip marked on the map bad been occupied by tbe new construction; for, having condemned land to that width, the State may in the future use it for highway purposes without further liability. It is immaterial, — unless later legislation hereafter referred to necessarily leads to a different conclusion,— that tbe present actual occupation is of but a portion of tbe whole taken: Lenhart v.

An examination of the title, as well as the body of that statute, shows it can have no application to the present situation, for it is effective only where the apparent purpose is to maintain a present existing highway, and the certificate of the secretary of highways, approved by the governor, indicates merely an intention to plot land adjoining a used road, which additional space may be required in the future, but where no portion designated in the recorded map is at the time occupied: May v.
