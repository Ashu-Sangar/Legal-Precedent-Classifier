Rain and fog had existed throughout their journey. When they reached a point on the Lincoln Highway some twelve miles south of Trenton, about 4:30 o’clock, the automobile ran into the rear of a truck belonging to defendant, which had stopped on the road, and which the testimony in plaintiff’s case establishes had no rear warning light on it, and plaintiff sustained <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>very severe injuries. She was asleep at the time of the collision and knew nothing about the presence of the truck or its condition as to lights.

He said that from the time they left New York at about twenty minutes of one in the morning, they encountered heavy rain storms with fog that was so dense that it necessitated his stopping altogether at times or driving “very, very cautiously and very slowly. This condition existed practically all the way down until the point of the accident. However, just previous to the accident the rain let up considerably, although it was still very foggy.” He had put the dimmers on his lights because if his full lights were on the fog reflected them back “and my vision was almost nil. In fact I could see practically nothing and with my <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>dimmers the vision was a whole lot more clear.” He admitted that at the place of the collision the road is level and straight. Asked as to his speed he declared that at the time of the accident as near as he could estimate “now” he was “running between twenty and twenty-five miles an hour.” In a statement he made and signed on September 13th, four days after the accident, he said he was traveling at from thirty-five to thirty-eight miles per hour. He testified that at the point of the collision he could see with his dimmers on “about fifteen or twenty feet.” He thus detailed the events immediately preceding and connected with the collision: “I was just coming out of a slight patch of fog, and this truck, or trailer, loomed up before me, just like a house on the road. I really didn’t see it until I was almost up on it. I cannot estimate the distance I was when I saw it— possibly sis feet — possibly ten feet. I threw on my brakes and the road was rather slippery, and I imagine my brake bands were wet, also. They did not hold. And automatically I threw my wheel to the left, trying to swerve away from the trailer or the truck. I did my best but I crashed. I ran into the truck — and my hood was caught under the bottom of this trailer. The right-hand side of my car crashed under the left-hand corner of the truck, or left center. My hood ran — the entire hood was crushed — the right-hand part was smashed in —the left-hand — the cowl was smashed in — it broke off the door — tore off the fender on that side — tore off the door on the left-hand side of the car where I was seated, and broke most of the glass. After the crash I found myself lying on the highway with the steering wheel in my hand. My car was mashed in under this truck. Miss Mason was in the car, imprisoned under all this wreckage. The only way we could remove her body from the car was to pull the truck forward, which they did and that released my car.” He said that under ordinary circumstances with the roadbed dry he could stop his automobile going twenty-five miles an hour within ten or <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>fifteen feet, but that under the conditions as they existed “it would make it rather hard for me to answer. There is no saying how quickly the car could have stopped if I had more clear vision and had seen the truck sooner than I did.” The testimony shows and the photographs taken after the accident indicate that the automobile was demolished beyond repair. They carry the conclusion that there had been a most violent collision at high speed. Indeed this is the inescapable conclusion from Segal’s testimony.</p>

We think it cannot be properly so said. Going at twenty miles an hour he would traverse twenty-nine and one-third feet a second, at twenty-five miles thirty-six and two-thirds feet; at either speed he would travel over the space he could see in less than a second’s time. Such celerity of movement under the conditions which he describes could not be determined to be with due care. Furthermore, as his range of vision was from fifteen to twenty feet he was negligent in not seeing the truck until he was within from six to ten feet of it. “A chauffeur......must keep in mind that an obstacle may <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>appear in Ms path and so drive his car as to be able to avoid it, under ordinary circumstances...... What would be safe speed in daylight might be very unsafe in a dark and stormy night. A car should be so driven that it can be stopped within the range of its lights. And that is true even when the range is shortened by storm or darkness or both”: Filer v.

Superior Ct. 1</a>, 3, has complete pertinence when applied to the facts in the case at bar: “The condition of the weather made it more incumbent on the driver to take greater precaution......He traveled with dimmed headlights; when so traveling he should have been more cautious as the diminished rays of light demanded. It is the duty of the driver of a car, driving on a dangerous highway on a dark, stormy night, to have his car under such control that he may stop or turn it away when objects intercepting his passage come within range of the rays of light from his lamps. If he drives so fast that he cannot avoid what ordinary prudence would make a known obstruction, he is guilty of negligence. It is apparent from the impact of the car that the plaintiff was driving at an excessive rate of speed. However this may be, taking his testimony to be correct, he could have stopped his car in perfect safety and avoided the accident, if he had driven in a careful, prudent manner.” This language was quoted with approval in Brink v. City of Scranton, <a href="/pa-super/85/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="85 Pa. Super. 342" data-case-ids="665592" data-case-paths="/pa-super/85/0342-01">85 Pa.

In the light of......the testimony of the plaintiff that he could see twenty-five feet ahead and could have stopped his car within that distance, the only rational conclusion is that he failed to have his car under proper control or drove ahead when he could not see. In either case the contributing negligence is a bar to his recovery.” What Was said in Roberts v. Freihofer Baking Co., <a href="/pa/283/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="283 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1090568" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0573-01">283 Pa. 573</a>, can be repeated as applying to the facts before us as Segal details them, “The conclusion that the driver was negligent is unavoidable; it follows from his own testimony, for he says he was going from twenty to twenty-five miles an hour through darkness so intense that the lights would not penetrate it.”</p>

The release itself, growing out of the same accident, cast on plaintiff the burden of showing that defendant’s negligence alone occasioned the injury (Peterson v. Wiggins, <a href="/pa/230/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="230 Pa. 631" data-case-ids="8846782" data-case-paths="/pa/230/0631-01">230 Pa. 631</a>; Smith v. Roydhouse, Arey &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/244/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="244 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1003513" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0474-01">244 Pa. 474</a>) ; not only did she fail to meet this burden, but her own case disclosed that Segal was a joint tort-feasor and that such joint negligence was the proximate cause of her injuries : Riff v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., <a href="/pa/298/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="298 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1120307" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0256-01">298 Pa. 256</a>.</p>
