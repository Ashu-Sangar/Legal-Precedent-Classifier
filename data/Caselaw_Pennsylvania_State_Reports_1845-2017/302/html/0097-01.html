He performed the duties of his office for three years, neglecting however in 1929 to file a bond and by reason of such failure, his office became vacant by virtue of section 901 of the General Borough Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 519. The borough council, on August 5, 1929, appointed Ruth Matthews, his wife, to fill the vacancy thus created. At the municipal election held in No<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>vember, 1929, Benjamin Lomas was duly elected tax collector in accordance with section 850 of the General Borough Act of 1927, which provides that the voters of every borough shall “at the municipal election in the year 1929, and every four years thereafter, vote for and elect one properly qualified person as tax collector of the borough.” Lomas died December 23, 1929, before qualifying for office, inasmuch as his term would not have begun until the first Monday of January, 1930. No further appointment was made by the borough council, and, on March 3, 1930, the court of quarter sessions appointed Mrs. Sallie Lomas to fill the “unexpired term” of her deceased husband, Benjamin Lomas. Mrs. Matthews and Mrs. Lomas both claimed the right to the office, and duly presented bonds to the borough council as security for the collection of the 1930 assessments. The bond of the former was approved by council, but rejected by the county commissioners because of the appointment of Mrs. Lomas by the court of quarter sessions. The bond of the latter was subsequently approved by both the county commissioners and the court of quarter sessions and she took the oath of office and entered upon her duties. Mrs. Matthews thereupon petitioned for a writ of quo warranto to test the right of Mrs. Lomas to the office, averring that the death of Benjamin Lomas before the commencement of his term did not create a vacancy in the office, but that petitioner’s right to the office continued until a successor should be duly elected at the next municipal election to be held in November, 1933.</p>

If the vacancy to be filled was that of a successor to Lomas, the appointment made by the court below was proper. But if the vacancy, if any, was in the office held by Mrs. Matthews, then the validity of the appointment of Mrs. Lomas must depend upon whether a vacancy in fact existed, which in turn depends upon whether Mrs. Matthews was entitled to hold office until her successor duly qualified.</p>

In that case it was held that an act of assembly extending the term of office beyond the period fixed by the Constitution, was void, and consequently on the death of the newly elected treasurer a vacancy was created which the governor was authorized to fill by appointment. In the course of the opinion of this court, in referring to the right of a county officer to hold until his successor should be duly qualified, it was said, (page 310) : “It necessarily follows that no vacancy can occur in a county office so long as the elected incumbent continues to perform the duties of the office. This rule prevails when the officer elected or appointed has for any cause whatever failed to qualify, and is recognized not only in our own but in other jurisdictions of this country. It is the settled interpretation of such constitutional provisions. Of course, in the absence of a fixed and definite term or other constitutional restriction, it is competent for the legislature to authorize a public officer to hold over until his successor is qualified. In such cases, like those where the right to hold over is expressly authorized by the constitution, the additional period during which the incumbent performs the duties of the office is a part of his official term, and there is no vacancy to be <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>filled by the appointing power.” See also Commonwealth v. Bitner, <a href="/pa/294/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="294 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="1113424" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0549-01">294 Pa. 549</a>, holding that the election of a, tax collector at an election illegally held did not have the effect of terminating the office of an incumbent who had been appointed to fill a vacancy, but the latter continued in office until the next municipal election and the borough council was without authority to make an appointment to fill a supposed vacancy created by the inability of the person illegally elected to take office.</p>
    <p id="b129-3" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[119,838,1158,579]]]'>It would follow from the foregoing cases that if Mrs. Matthews held office until her successor should be elected or appointed and duly qualified, as provided by Act of March 22, 1927, P. L. 53, no vacancy existed in the office of tax collector on the first Monday of January, 1930, because the person elected to that office the preceding November had died unqualified and no vacancy could , arise because of his death. The vacancy, if any existed, must have been because of the disqualification of Mrs. Matthews to continue in office beyond that time.</p>
    <p id="b129-4" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[117,1438,1157,360]]]'>The remaining question, accordingly, is whether the Act of March 22, 1927, P.

York City et al, <a href="/pa/268/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="268 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1061515" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0143-01">268 Pa. 143</a>, 146; Duffy v.

Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/288/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="288 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="1100800" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0152-01">288 Pa. 152</a>, 159); and even where there is an express repeal in the later legislation of all acts inconsistent therewith, such provision is considered as an express recognition that those not inconsistent therewith remain in force: Commonwealth v. Reese, <a href="/pa/293/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="293 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="1111153" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0398-01">293 Pa. 398</a>, 401. A general statute without negative words cannot repeal a previous particular statute even though the provisions in one be different from the other: In re Opening of Parkway, <a href="/pa/249/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="249 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1013631" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0367-01">249 Pa. 367</a>, 373. It should be observed that here both statutes are general, the first being general in the sense that it applies to a specific subject-matter of all municipalities, to wit, the right of all officers to hold over until their successors are duly qualified, and the second in the sense that it is a codification of the law relating to one particular <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>class of municipalities. However, there is nothing to prevent the legislature, if it sees fit, even during the same session, from changing its mind with respect to a particular subject of legislation, and if the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict and cannot stand together, then the earlier must give way to the later: Bourguignon Building Association v.
