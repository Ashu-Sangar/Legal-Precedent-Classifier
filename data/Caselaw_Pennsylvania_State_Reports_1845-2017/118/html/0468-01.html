There were two other companies engaged in the business of piping and supplying gas to customers prior to July, 1884, viz.: The Penn Fuel and the Fuel Gas Company, and had been so for about one year prior to July, 1884. The Philadelphia Company purchased the entire capital stock of these companies, which was paid for partly in cash and partly in stock of the company purchasing. The gas from the wells of the Penn Fuel and Fuel Gas companies is run into the pipe-lines of the Philadelphia Company, along with other gas produced from other wells of the last named company, and from thence furnished to its customers.</p>

From the Murraysville and Lyons Run districts the company has thirteen lines of pipe which, as they near the city of Pittsburgh, branch off so as to occupy the space most convenient for distributing to the streets and manufactories. There is one line of sixteen inches in diameter; others of ten inches, eight, and five and five eighths inches in diameter. The Philadelphia Company supplies directly 361 manufacturing establishments, thirty-four glass-houses in addition, and 5,716 dwellings, and through the Allegheny Heating Company ninety-two manufactories and 3,220 dwellings; at McKeesport 750 dwellings, and through the Tarentum Light and Heat Company 379, making a total of 10,552 manufactories and dwellings.</p>

The International Navigation Company was- incorporated by an act of May 4,1871, P. L. 565, which conferred upon it all the rights, powers and privileges conferred by an act to incorporate the Pennsylvania Company. In the year 1872, this company built a piece of railroad in Philadelphia, but subsequently sold it to another corporation. Afterwards it increased its capital stock and engaged in the running of a line of steamships between Philadelphia and New York and Antwerp, known as the “ Anchor Line.” Under these circumstances the commonwealth brought an action against the company to recover taxes claimed to be due by it as a transportation company. Defence was made upon the ground that it was a rail<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>road company and therefore exempt from the tax claimed. The decision was to the contrary. The court in construing its charter, said: “Usually corporations are created in order to carry on a single, or at least a principal business or enterprise, and in such case they can readily be classified; but this company has survived from the days of special legislation with an ‘ omnibus ’ charter, under which it can do many things, from operating a railroad or constructing a steamship, to lending money to manufacturers or guaranteeing the notes of a firm. No doubt it can build a railroad, but it may build also ‘ any work or works, public or private, which may tend or be designed to improve, increase, facilitate or develop trade, travel, or the transportation and conveyance of freight, live stock, passengers and any other traffic, by land or water.’ ”</p>

The key to the legislative intent is to be found only in the words of the grant, and they are broad enough to cover all that the company is now attempting to do. But even if it were a fact that a pipe-line had never been heard of when the Empire Contract Company was incorporated, still, if a pipe-line be a means of transportation, the construction and operation thereof would be within the express grant of power to the company: Navigation Co. v.

But, if there could be any question as to this, it is set at rest by § 10, act of May 29, 1885, P. L. 29. At the date of this act, the defendant company was “ engaged in the transportation and supply of natural gas.” No other regularly incorporated company was. The existence and business of the defendant company was then well known. The section is general and inclusive in its terms. It says “ any and all corporations that is or are now engaged,” etc. It does not refer, as § 14 does, to corporations without proper incorporation, but to real corporations actually engaged in business.</p>

The transportation and supply of natural gas is a public use, and it matters not that the gas is owned and sold by the transporting company itself.

But it is said that the grant of the eminent domain to the defendant company is unconstitutional: (1) Because no mention is made of it in the title of its act. That is unnecessary, as appears from an examination of the whole course of corporate legislation and an inspection of every railroad charter on our statute books. Besides, the ruling in Johnston’s App., supra, is conclusive against the objection. (2) Because no mode of assessing damages is provided in the act. The argument is, that even if a power is plainly granted, it cannot be exercised because a mode of assessing damages is not provided. By its charter the company’s right to enter upon and occupy lands is coupled with the provision, “ on payment therefor, or giving security according to law,” in which respect the charter comes fully up to the constitutional requirement: Art.

The defendant is a corporation claiming the right of eminent domain and seeking by virtue thereof to enter upon the plaintiff’s land and lay under the soil, pipes for the transportation of natural gas from its wells in Westmoreland county to its customers in and about the city of Pittsburgh. The plaintiff denies that the defendant possesses this right for the purpose for which it is sought to exercise it, and asks the court to restrain its exercise; alleging that the production, transportation, and supply of natural gas is not among the objects which the company has power to enter upon, either under the provisions of the act of 1871, which created it, or those of 1885, which provided for the incorporation and organization of natural ga.s companies.</p>

The act of March 22, 1871, incorporated the Empire Contract Company with power to change its name by the action of its stockholders, and then clothed it with “ all the rights, powers, privileges, <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>franchises, and immunities ” which had been given to the Pennsylvania Company by an act approved on April 7, 1870. Under this authority the Empire Contract Company was organized, began business, changed its name several times, and on March 11,1884, was sold by the sheriff of Dauphin county on a judgment obtained by the commonwealth for unpaid taxes. The purchasers then proceeded in May, 1884, to reorganize the company under the name of the Philadelphia Company, in accordance with the act of 1878, and filed an acceptance of the provisions of the 16th article of the constitution as required by that act.</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[253,937,1179,252]]]'>Upon its reorganization the Philadelphia Company possessed all the powers conferred directly by the act of incorporation, and all those possessed by the Pennsylvania Company under the act of April 7,1870.

If the act of incorporation does not authorize it, then, as to this business, it is a private association, and without the power to enter upon the plaintiff’s lands. The master and the court below held that the company was authorized to enter in its corporate character upon this business, and rested their conclusion upon the proposition that gas is freight, and that conducting it through pipes from the wells to the consumers is the transportation of freight. But a transportation company provides simply the means for transportation of freight for customers at certain prices. This company produces a commodity which it takes to market and sells. The gas is produced at the wells. It is wanted at the mills and dwellings of the city. The pipe-lines laid by this company serve to convey the gas from its wells to its own customers, to whom it is sold and delivered. The transportation is incidental to the production and supply of the gas. The situation is precisely the same as in the case of illuminating gas, which is manufactured, stored, and conveyed by pipes to the places of consumption. The business is that of making and supplying gas for light. The transportation to the customer is incidental. The same is also true of water companies. They produce, store, and supply to customers, water. Transportation by means of pipes is the means of delivery, and is a mere incident of the business. The business of the Philadelphia company is, in our opinion, that of a fuel-gas company, viz.: the production and distribution of natural gas ; and the transportation of the gas is the necessary means of delivery to its customers and nothing more. Had it the power to engage in this business in 1884 ? It will be seen by our analysis of the grant in the act of incorporation that the company had the power to build, etc., any work, public or private, which “ may tend or be designed to improve, increase, facilitate, or develop trade.”</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[168,2173,1180,251]],["BL_506.1",506,[232,366,1184,766]]]'>In the preamble to the act of 1885 the legislature declares that natural gas has become a “ prime necessity for use as a fuel and. otherwise in the development of trade.” It thus applies to this business the very words employed in the act of incorporation to describe the powers of this company. It is, <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>moreover, part of the current history of the commonwealth that the discovery and use of natural gas has facilitated and cheapened and increased the production of manufactured articles of all descriptions, where heat is employed in the generation of steam or in the processes of manufacture. By cheapening and increasing production trade has been stimulated, facilitated, and developed wherever the natural gas has been made available as a fuel. We conclude, therefore, that the works by which the gas is produced from the earth, transported to the factories and dwellings of Pittsburgh, and then delivered to customers, are works that “ tend and are designed to improve, increase, facilitate, and develop trade,” and are therefore within the powers granted to this company. If so, the Philadelphia Company is rightfully engaged as a corporation in this business by virtue of its own charter.</p>
    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[236,1138,1184,868]]]'>The act of 1885 declares the transportation and supply of natural gas to be a public use, and, the days of special charters having gone by, provides by general law for “ the incorporation and regulation of natural gas companies; ” but does not diminish the powers of any corporation in existence by virtue of a special charter. This company having the right to engage in this business had by express words the right of eminent domain and could enter upon lands without the aid of the act of 1885. But it is objected that the act of incorporation did not provide the machinery by which the value of property taken or injured could be ascertained and a judgment obtained therefor; and for that reason it is urged that the grant of eminent domain cannot be sustained. The grant is in these words: “ The company hereby created shall also have power to enter upon and occupy the lands of individuals or companies on making payment therefor, or giving security according to law, for the purpose of erecting,” etc.</p>

That they would have been applicable is very clear from the words of the act of 1849. This act provides that “ whenever a special act of the general assembly shall hereafter be passed, authorizing the incorporation <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>•of a railroad company,” the manner of its organization, its powers, privileges, and obligations shall be as therein set forth, and damages for its entry upon lands shall be assessed in the manner pointed out. It furnished a system of procedure to be followed in all cases arising after its passage not specially provided for, and would have been applicable to this company if its undertaking had been to build a railroad. But the Philadelphia Company did not build a railroad. It entered upon the business of producing and supplying natural gas. The general laws regulating the exercise of the right of eminent domain and assessing damages therefor, did not contemplate an entry of this description and their provisions were not adapted to the assessment of the damages done by it.</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[186,1027,1187,1017]]]'>It may be, therefore, as the plaintiff in error insists, that the landowner had no remedy under the act of incorporation except an action at law. If so, the act of 1885 has supplied what was lacking and given a general system for the assessment of damages applicable to all natural gas companies. In the tenth section, after the declaration that the transportation and supply of natural gas for public consumption is a public use, the legislature declares that “ any and all corporations that is or are now, or shall hereafter be, engaged in such business shall have the right of eminent domain for the laying of pipelines for the transportation and distribution of natural gas.” Then follow provisions regulating the exercise of the right and the proceedings for the assessment of the damages done thereby. These provisions are not limited in their application to corporations created under the act, but are general and apply to all “ corporations that is or are now ” engaged in the business, as well as to those that “shall hereafter be engaged” in it. Thus corporations then supplying gas and those to be so engaged by virtue of incorporation under the act are treated in the same manner.</p>
    <p id="b507-6" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[189,2063,1186,356]],["BL_508.1",508,[222,358,1184,871]]]'>This is in harmony with the circumstances that gave rise to the legislation of 1885, as well as with the general character of its provisions. The business of producing and supplying natural gas had assumed important proportions prior to 1885. Several companies, organized under the general laws providing for the incorporation of illuminating gas companies, were engaged in the business. This court had recently held that <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>such charters conferred no authority to transport or to deal in natural gas as a fuel. The precise point in controversy was the authority of a company so organized to exercise the right of eminent domain. In view of this state of things the legislature, in 1885, declared that the production and distribution of natural gas had become, and then was, a matter of “ prime necessity; ” that the business was so important as to justify declaring it “ a public use ; ” and that it had become essential that corporations for this purpose “ should be provided for by general law.” It then conferred by apt words the right of eminent domain on all corporations then engaged or thereafter to be engaged in the business, and prescribed the manner in which the assessment of damages should be made and the amount thereof finally adjusted. Whatever the situation of the plaintiff may have been under the act of incorporation, he now has an ample remedy for the recovery of his damages under the general system provided by the act of 1885.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[220,1235,1183,867]]]'>This conclusion renders it unnecessary to enter at any length upon a discussion of the constitutional question raised over the title to the act of 1871. If it should be conceded, as the plaintiff in error contends, that the title does not sufficiently indicate a purpose to confer the right of eminent domain, or that it is misleading so far as this subject is concerned, such concession could not affect the decision of this case. Its only result would be to render so much of the act as the title gave no notice of, unconstitutional. This was distinctly ruled in the Union Pass. Railway Co.’s App.; <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%2091" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="81* Pa. 91">81* Pa. 91</a>, and in the Allegheny Co.

The balance of the act would be unaffected. The corporation would remain with the general powers with which it was endowed; and as it was actually engaged in the transportation of natural gas when the act of 1885 became a law, it would acquire under its provisions both the right of eminent domain and the system for adjusting the damages done by its exercise.</p>

One carries packages, another transmits messages, and so on through the numerous manufacturing, mining, commercial, and financial agencies which the business of this age brings into its service. The question which we have is not whether a single corporation organized under an “ omnibus charter ” like that of the Philadelphia Company may be permitted to gather up into one corporate hand all the powers and franchises of the commonwealth, but whether this company may do this particular business in which it has embarked its capital.
