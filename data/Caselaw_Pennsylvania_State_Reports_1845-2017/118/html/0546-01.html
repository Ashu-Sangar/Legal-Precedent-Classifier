Middleton and Wm. H. Branson (bailiff) for a corundum wheel and knife grinder distrained by Middleton as landlord for rent in arrear from his tenants, Bonta &amp; Fredericks, and claimed to be the property of the plaintiff. At the trial of the issue formed, on November 8, 1886, before Mitchell, J., evidence was adduced for the purpose of sustaining the plaintiff’s contention that the. machine had been consigned by him to one T. S. Quay in the planing and saw-mill business, on certain terms; that Quay had afterwards sold his business to Bonta &amp; Fredericks and stored the machine with one Officer, occupying the third story of the same building, who received it as an accommodation to Quay, without pay. The facts appear fully in the opinion of the court.</p>

This rule, however, is subject to a variety of exceptions, and it is contended that the goods replevied are embraced within these exceptions, and were privileged from distress.</p>

At the expiration of said thirty days, a report will be required in every instance: if the goods do not prove as represented they are to be returned to us, but if satisfactory, a sale may then be effected upon terms aforesaid.”</p>

We are relieved however from deciding whether the title of the property was in Page or Quay, as, in either event, we think it was liable to distress for the rent.</p>

This general rule <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>of privilege arises out of the necessities of trade, and hence it is, that a traveler’s baggage at an inn, goods landed at a wharf or deposited in a warehouse on storage, a horse standing in a smith’s shop to be shod, or corn at the mill to be ground etc., etc., have been held to be free from distress for the rent of the premises upon which they are found.” On the same grounds it was held in Howe Sewing Machine Co. v. Sloan, <a href="/pa/87/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="87 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1057845" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0438-01">87 Pa. 438</a>, that goods entrusted to an agent to be sold on commission, are not liable to distress for rent due by the agent.</p>

Officer was not a warehouseman at all; he was not to any extent engaged in the business of keeping goods on storage ; he permitted this knife grinding machine to be placed on his premises purely as matter of favor, and without hope of reward. In such a case, the principle of exemption invoked can have no possible application.</p>
