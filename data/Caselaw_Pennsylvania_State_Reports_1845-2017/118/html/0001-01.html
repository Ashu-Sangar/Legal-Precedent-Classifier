(1867), 1412, the office of director of Rouse hospital is abolished and the duties before imposed on such directors are transferred to the “ commissioners of the Rouse Estate.” The act of March 31,' 1868, P.

    <p class="summary" id="b23-5" data-blocks='[["BL_23.4",23,[179,505,1184,1691]]]'>The act of 1864, supplemented by the act of 1866, made the county of Warren a single poor district, the duties of which were imposed on the commissioners of the county, who by virtue of that office are also commissioners of the Rouse Estate. By this legislation the township and borough poor districts were wiped out, and the question now presented is whether the act of 1868 so restored them as to render the poor district of Eldred township liable to what clearly appears to be a just demand of the plaintiff against one or other of the defendants. That the general obligation to maintain the poor is upon the commissioners of the Rouse Estate is clear. Does the act of 1868 relieve said commissioners and impose the obligation upon Eldred district in a case like the one under consideration ? We think not. The act it appears to us was only intended to relieve the county officials and the poor district of the county from all such care and expenditures on behalf of the poor as can be better, more conveniently and more economically done by the local authorities. We think the act was intended only to meet cases where a person should by proper proceeding be made a charge upon the township or borough district, and where consequently the local authorities had it in their power to deliver such person to the Rouse hospital. But here Lillie Allen never was made a charge as a pauper upon Eldred district. Its officials had no charge of her person, no notice, so far as appears, of her sickness, and had no right in the absence of an order of maintenance to deliver her to the Rouse hospital, even if they did know of her sickness and that her legal settlement was in Eldred township. We are of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover against the commissioners of the Rouse Estate, and we direct judgment to be entered against such commissioners and in favor of the directors of the poor of Crawford county for the sum of sixty-three dollars and forty-two-cents, with costs of suit.</p>

L. 535, was evidently passed to relieve the commissioners from traveling over the county to look after and care for the poor, and that such duties might be performed better and more economically by the local authorities. Our contention is that this act restored the several townships and boroughs to poor districts, and clothed the road commissioners and the burgesses and councils of boroughs, in their respective districts, with all the powers of overseers of the poor, until such poor are committed and delivered to the Rouse hospital. Section 15, act of April 18,1864, P. L. 443, provides the mode of obtaining such commitment.</p>

As soon as they could conveniently do so, they notified the “ commissioners of the Rouse Estate ” and the “road commissioners of Eldred township,” defendants below, of the name, circumstances and condition of the pauper, and demanded, from each respectively, payment of the amount expended for her relief, which was refused.</p>

This is the subject of complaint in the only specification of error before us; and the sole question is, which of the parties named is legally liable.</p>
    <p id="b25-4" data-blocks='[["BL_25.4",25,[191,802,1185,1288]]]'>A portion of the fund bequeathed by Henry W. Rouse to the county of Warren, for the benefit of the poor of that county, was expended in the erection of the Rouse hospital, which was committed to the management of the “ commissioners of the Rouse Estate,” under which name they were incorporated. The income from the charitable bequest being inadequate for the support of the poor of the county, the deficiency is provided for by taxation. By the act of April 8, 1864, P. L. 443, supplemented by the act of April 4, 1866, P. L. (1867) 1412, the care and maintenance of all the poor of the county devolved on the commissioners of the Rouse Estate; but, for reasons deemed sufficient, the law was changed by the act of March 31, 1868, P. L. 535, which provides: “That the burgess and council of the boroughs and .the road commissioners of the townships of the county of Warren, be and they are hereby authorized and required to discharge all the duties of overseers of the poor within their respective districts, so far as the care and maintenance of the poor is concerned, until such poor are committed and delivered to the Rouse hospital of said county; and for this purpose the said burgess and council and the said commissioners are hereby authorized to increase the borough and road taxes within their respective districts to an amount sufficient to enable them to carry out the provisions of this act, or, if they deem the same expedient, may levy a separate poor tax for that purpose.”</p>

The com<a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>missioners of the Rouse Estate were thus relieved, to that extent, of the duties previously devolved on them.

This was never done, and hence no liability attached to plaintiffs in error. The commissioners of Crawford county, having, in obedience to the mandate of the two justices, provided the necessary relief, had a just claim upon the poor district of Eldred township for reimbursement of the amount thus expended. We think, therefore, that the judgment should have been against the road commissioners of Eldred township and not against plaintiffs in error.</p>
