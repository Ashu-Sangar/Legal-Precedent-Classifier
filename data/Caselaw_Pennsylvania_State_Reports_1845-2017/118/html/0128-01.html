N. 496, cited by the learned auditor in support of his action, in the opinion of the court goes only so far as to say that the court may treat the affidavit of defence as a nullity. The utmost that can be drawn from that case is that when a paper is filed purporting to be an affidavit of defence, when it in fact discloses no such character, it may be treated as a nullity. In the case .cited the court might well have sanctioned such procedure. But, certainly, under the affidavit of defence law it was never contemplated, and never can be, that the functions of a court to determine an issue of fact or of law could arbitrarily be assumed by the very part}’ in interest; that he should vest himself with the power of determining the sufficiency or <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>insufficiency of an affidavit of .defence, which in so many instances' approach, either way, so very close to the borderline, and very often present intricate questions for judicial or legal interpretation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b152-5" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[263,575,1180,1177]]]'>In the present case, if the application were made in open court, it was without a rule being asked for and was misleading ; as the application was for a judgment “ for want of an affidavit of defencein effect a false declaration “ that no affidavit of defence had been filed,” and therefore the allowance of judgment would follow as of course. Consequently it should be regarded in no better light than as an extra-judicial or office judgment. In no event, we think, could the paper filed be treated as a nullity. It purported to be an affidavit of defence ; was sworn to as such. It alleged a defence to the whole of plaintiff’s claim, and specified the nature of the defence. The court alone could determine its sufficiency. “ For a judgment cannot be taken for want of an affidavit of defence if there is one: ” Wilson v. Hays, <a href="/pa/18/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="18 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="969091" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0357-01">18 Pa. 357</a>. “ Where an affidavit of defence has been filed judgment cannot be taken for want of one: ” Endlich, Affidavits of Defence, 474, § 625. The principle is also stated in Gannon v. Fritz, <a href="/pa/79/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="79 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="438442" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0303-01">79 Pa. 303</a>, and O’Hara v.

Yet, up to the time of the service of the scire facias to No. 13 March Term 1885, he was guilty of no laches. He had a right to presume upon the sufficiency of the affidavit of defence and to await further action and warning in the case when it was filed. It is true that whilst the judgment entered to No 54 March Term 1880, although wholly irregular, might under certain circumstances <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>be treated as simply voidable and therefore sufficient to support the judgment entered at No. 13 March Term 1885. This view would be tenable in the absence of any application on the part of the defendant himself to avoid the judgment entered at No. 54 March Term 1880. But the record discloses an actual application on the part of the defendant to set aside this judgment and the allowance of a rule. Hence in passing upon the effect of this rule, and bound as a court would be, if the learned auditor found the affidavit of defence <em>in fact </em>an affidavit of defence, although insufficient, he must have pronounced the judgment, as taken, void.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b153-5" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[189,912,1180,1495]],["BL_154.1",154,[243,341,1181,818]]]'>Therefore in this connection we refer to the affidavit of defence again, and find that it alleges, under oath, a defence to the whole of plaintiff’s claim; that it specifies payment of the two first payments, which may or may not have been those entered and acknowledged; an actual payment upon a judgment entered against Campbell that was an incumbrance; the tender of payment of the remaining instalment, which a court would doubtless have determined insufficient; that judgment had been recovered against him as garnishee in an attachment, and that other attachments, aggregating a large sum, had been served upon him. Upon an issue joined would not these facts constitute a defence, both in diminishing the amount and modifying the judgment ? Why should the defendant be precluded in the right to set them up as substantial matters of defence ? Can it be questioned that the attachments, if valid, would bind the interest of Campbell in the land conveyed ? How far the defendant would be precluded from defalcating the amount of such attachments or judgments upon them after an issue joined in the scire facias and judgment thereon if he had failed to plead them; or to what extent he would have been estopped in so doing upon a judgment in default for want of an affidavit of defence, and more particularly after a second judgment of revival, such as this record presents, we do not now determine ; but certainly the suggestion of these facts conclusively shows that the affidavit of defence filed may have been substantial, at least more than a mere nullity. Therefore, we think, since the learned auditor found himself fully empowered to determine the whole question, it was his plain duty to pronounce the judgment entered at No. 54 March Term 1880, whol<a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>ly irregular and to have sustained the rule to set it aside, which is now done. But as the scire facias was issued in the lifetime of the original lien, we think it sustained the lien of the original judgment for five years from the date of issuing: Lichty v. Hochstetler, <a href="/pa/91/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="91 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="487660" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0444-01">91 Pa. 444</a>; Fulton’s Est., <a href="/pa/51/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="51 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="999792" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0204-01">51 Pa. 204</a>; Hunter v.

Hence up to Jan’y 12, 1885, the plaintiff had time and opportunity to perfect his judgment. He failed to do so but treated it as in all respects valid, and on Dec. 8, 1884, issued scire facias to No. 13 March Term 1885, to revive, which was duly served on Dec. 19, 1884, and judgment by default for want of an affidavit of defence taken on Feb’y 21, 1885, in due form. On March 7,1885, the defendant obtained a rule to open this judgment and also judgment entered to No. 54 March Term 1880. Subsequently on June 12, 1885, the rule as to the last named judgment was amended to a rule to strike off, etc.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[239,1167,1179,1020]]]'>It cannot be claimed that the grounds for opening the judgment at No. 13 March Term 1885, so far as they excuse the default, possess any merit whatever. The simple fact that his attorney is dead was certainly insufficient. But in view of the impregnable grounds for setting aside the judgment at No. 54 March Term 1880, and that being done, we cannot see how the subsequent judgment depending upon it can be sustained, notwithstanding the neglect and laches of the defendant. “ The revival of the original judgment is but a continuation of it. In form the proceeding by scire facias is a distinct action, but in fact it is not so. Satisfaction of the original judgment is a satisfaction of the judgment in the scire facias. So a reversal of the former has the same effect upon the latter : ” Thompson, J., Eldred v.

At most, the entry of judgment for want of an affidavit of defence, when there was one, which, however, on its face was insufficient, was but an irregularity; yet the irregularity was waived by the laches of the defendant: 2 Herm.

Whether it was a good one or not was not to be decided then by the officer, in the absence and without the knowledge of the defendant. It could not be treated as a nullity. Huber v. Commonwealth, does not reach the difficulty. Campbell could not recover the balance without a tender of the proper deed. If an issue had gone to a jury, Campbell would have been in the position of a vendor seeking to recover the full amount of purchase-money, without having performed his own covenants : Deitrich’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=107%20Pa.%20179" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="107 Pa. 179">107 Pa. 179</a>; Mellon v.

    <p class="author" id="ABe" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[502,1057,445,33]]]'>Mu. Justice Paxson:</p>
    <p id="b156-6" data-blocks='[["BL_156.6",156,[257,1109,1186,506]]]'>This was an appeal from the decree of the court below in the matter of the distribution of the money in the hands of the sheriff arising from the sale of the real estate of James W. Chambers. The appellant was the holder of a judgment against the said Chambers, which he claimed was a lien upon the real estate in controversy, and entitled to be paid out of the fund. The auditor allowed the claim, and decreed distribution accordingly. The learned court below reversed the-auditor upon exceptions filed, and postponed appellant’s judgment and awarded the fund to subsequent lien creditors.</p>
    <p id="b156-7" data-blocks='[["BL_156.7",156,[256,1620,1185,200]]]'>It is admitted that if the appellant’s judgment was a valid hen it is entitled to payment by reason of its priority. The contention of appellees is that it had lost its lien by reason of its not having been properly revived.</p>
    <p id="b156-8" data-blocks='[["BL_156.8",156,[301,1827,721,44]]]'>The facts briefly stated are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b156-9" data-blocks='[["BL_156.9",156,[249,1879,1190,556]]]'>The original judgment, Robert Campbell v. James W. Chambers, No. 442 Dec. Term 1874, for $2,900, was entered March 4, 1875. On January 12, 1880, a scire facias, No. 54 March Term, 1880, was issued to revive the above judgment, which was duly served. An affidavit of defence was filed bj? Chambers Feb. 16,1880. On June 22,1880, on application of plaintiff’s attorney, a judgment was taken for want of an affidavit of defence for the sum of $1,313.32. The record fails to show how this judgment was taken, whether in open court upon motion, or upon a praecipe for judgment in the usual manlier in the prothonotary’s office.</p>
    <p id="b157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_157.3",157,[162,352,1182,243]]]'>
      <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>This judgment was irregular, and, had an application been made in proper time, the court below would doubtless have stricken it off. At the same time the plaintiff would have been entitled to a judgment for want of a sufficent affidavit of defence.</p>
    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[164,611,1181,502]]]'>The defendant made no motion to strike off or open the judgment. Another scire facias to revive was issued December 8, 1884, to No. 13 March Term 1885, which was duly served, and judgment entered thereon February 21, 1885, for want of an affidavit of defence for the sum of $1,688.98. On March 7, 1885, a rule was granted to show cause why the judgment No. 54 March Term 1880, and No. 13 March Term 1885, should not be opened, and the defendant let into a defence, which, as to one of the judgments, was subsequently changed to a rule to strike off the same.</p>
    <p id="b157-6" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[164,1131,1181,397]]]'>Upon this state of facts it hardly needs an argument to show that the learned judge below fell into error when he set aside the judgment of appellant in the distribution. The last revival was regular upon its face, and a judgment was entered thereon. The prior revival was irregular, from the single fact that a judgment had been taken for want of an affidavit of defence when in point of fact an affidavit of defence had been filed.</p>
    <p id="b157-7" data-blocks='[["BL_157.6",157,[165,1547,1182,870]],["BL_158.1",158,[251,353,1182,406]]]'>This, however, is the merest technicality. The plaintiff was entitled to a judgment at the time, as the affidavit was insufficient : Huber v. Commonwealth, 11 W. N. 496. And if he were not, such technicality cannot be taken advantage of after judgment on the second scire facias. That writ warned the defendant to come in and show cause, if any he had, why the judgment should not be again revived. He is precluded now from taking any defence which he might have taken then. In the recent case of Michaelis v. Brawley, <a href="/pa/109/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="109 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="542265" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0007-01">109 Pa. 7</a>, it is held that “ while it is true that the mortgage of a married woman is invalid unless separately acknowledged by her, and the absence of such acknowledgment may be set up as a defence to a recovery upon the mortgage, yet if judgment be recovered on a scire facias issued on such mortgage the judgment is conclusive that the mortgage was properly executed; and the validity thereof cannot be questioned in a collateral action of ejectment.” The only defence to a scire facias to revive a judg<a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>ment is a denial of its existence or proof of a subsequent satisfaction or discharge: Dowling v. McGregor, <a href="/pa/91/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="91 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="487664" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0410-01">91 Pa. 410</a>. And in such proceeding the merits of the original judgment cannot be inquired into: Ibid.; Cardesa v. Humes, 5 S. &amp; R. 68; Lysle v. Williams, 15 Idem 135; Davidson v. Thornton, <a href="/pa/7/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="7 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="957970" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0128-01">7 Pa. 128</a>; McVeagh v. Little, Idem 279; Stewart v. Colwell, 24 Idem 67. There was no ground laid for either opening or setting aside the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b158-5" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[251,766,1184,718]]]'>We are of opinion that the appellant’s judgment was a valid lien upon the real estate of the appellee, yet under the peculiar circumstances of the case we do not think it would be right to award the money directly to him. The amount now due upon the judgment cannot be paid at present. It was given in payment of purchase-money of certain real estate sales by appellant, Campbell, to the appellee. Appellant’s wife refused to join in the deed. One thousand dollars of this judgment was to remain and the principal not to be paid until appellant’s wife should sign the deed, or the title be perfected. This has not been done. We therefore direct the fund to which appellant’s judgment would be entitled, to be impounded and held until such time as the appellant shall make a good title to the premises referred to.</p>
    <p id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.5",158,[520,1489,915,146]]]'>The decree is reversed at the costs of the appellees; and it is ordered that distribution be made in accordance with this opinion.</p>
