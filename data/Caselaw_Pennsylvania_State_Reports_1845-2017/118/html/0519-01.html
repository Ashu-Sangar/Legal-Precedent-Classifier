The tank was about twelve feet high and perhaps ten feet wide, and had a float suspended in it by a chain. The float was about two feet less in diameter than the diameter of the tank, and, when the tank was in use, floated on the top of the water therein. By direction of the “ man they call the boss painter,” the three men carried with them into the tank several buckets of paint known as Windsor Black, or black varnish, which was made chiefly of asphaltum and contained a large proportion of benzine. McCormick and one of the men were sent into the tank under the float with three buckets, each containing about a gallon of the mixture.</p>

He must bear the loss, because it is a risk of his employment. It is a good rule of law, and applies to all alike ; it makes no difference whether they be manufacturing companies or simply householders, or anybody who hires another. The blacksmith you employ to shoe a horse takes the risk of being kicked; the hostler in the stable takes the risk of being kicked. All those things are the risks of the employment. How often you hear of them during life ! They constantly occur to people who are working to get their daily bread; and yet while they are working to get their daily bread an accident takes away from them their means of earning their daily bread, even their life itself.

Co. v. Bresmer, <a href="/pa/97/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="97 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="444828" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0103-01">97 Pa. 103</a>. An employee assumes the risk of all dangers in his employment, however they may arise, against which he may protect himself by ordinary observation and care. The employer’s liability arises when he subjects the employee to dangers which he ought to foresee and provide against, but not for those dangers to which the employee voluntarily subjects himself, although he does so without carelessness on his part. If the employer furnish appliances which, although not the best that can be obtained, -yet may be' used without danger, he has discharged his duty and is not responsible for accidents : P. &amp; C. R. Co. v. Sentmeyer, <a href="/pa/92/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="92 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="491027" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0276-01">92 Pa. 276</a>. In accepting employment, an employee is assumed to have accepted all risks which are incident thereto, and which are patent, that is, plain, or of which he ought- to inform himself; and the employer does his duty when he provides for his employee in such manner as he fairly and reasonably deems prudent and safe: Sykes v. Packer, <a href="/pa/99/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="99 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="446055" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0465-01">99 Pa. 465</a>. If the risk run is such that neither party can be assumed to have known it, or could reasonably be expected to have foreseen it, neither party has a claim against the other. Each must bear his own loss. Because the injury might possibly have been prevented by some device, it does not impose on the employer an extraordinary liability. If the risk is an ordinary one the employer is not liable, although the employee uses ordinary care, and is therefore without fault: North. Cent. Ry. Co. v. Husson, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20Pa.%207" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="101 Pa. 7">101 Pa. 7</a>.</p>

It would be hard to apply a rule of law in that case which would make him liable to have his house taken away, simply because the man he hired has been hurt while doing the work, and without fault on the employer’s part. Suppose you employ a cook, and the cook is working at the range, and her clothes take fire, and she is hurned. That is a sad case ; but she cannot recover damages <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>which, might take your house away for that.

A discriminating and forcible statement of the rule is found in Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Jackson, L.

    <p id="b546-7" data-blocks='[["BL_546.7",546,[231,1740,1188,240]]]'>The plaintiff below brought suit to recover damages for the loss of her husband, who was killed while in the service of the defendant company. Her case is a sad one, but her right to recover must rest un a legal liability of the employer or her-action must fail.</p>
    <p id="b546-8" data-blocks='[["BL_546.8",546,[231,1999,1176,401]],["BL_547.1",547,[148,345,1188,707]]]'>The evidence shows that the Allison Manufacturing Company is largely engaged in the manufacture of cars, and of tubing, in the city of Philadelphia, employing a large number of men. On the day of the accident a large wooden tank, some twelve feet in height by ten feet in diameter, used for storing water, for testing tubing and other purposes, was emptied of its contents and cleaned. Three men were then sent under the direction of the company’s painter, to cover the inside of the <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>tank with paint. Of these, McCormick and another man were placed on the inside of the tank at the bottom, while the third was suspended on a float or cover above them and about four feet below the top. They were all supplied with paint, and the men at the bottom had also a lamp, described by the witnesses as a “railroad lamp covered with glass.” They had been at work for a quarter of an hour or more when an explosion took place, and the tank was for an instant filled with flame. McCormick was taken out last, and he died soon after from injuries received from the explosion and inhaling the burning vapor. This was the plaintiff’s whole case, except that evidence was given to show that benzine was used in the manufacture of the paint, and that an explosive gas could be obtained from it.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[150,1071,1188,1233]]]'>The only question presented is, whether this case should have been submitted to the jury. In considering this question it must be borne in mind that the paint used was a well-known brand called “ black varnish,” and that it has been manufactured in this city for many years and in large quantities. The evidence shows that the defendant company has used it for ten or twelve years, buying it by the barrel direct from the manufacturers. How, and under what circumstances, the explosion in the tank occurred is not known. The theory of the plaintiff is, that the quantity of benzine used in preparing the paint was so great that upon the opening of the cans and spreading the paint on the interior of the tank, the evaporation of the benzine filled the tank with an explosive gas, and that this gas came in contact with the flame of the lamp and exploded. Assuming this theory to be correct the plaintiff below argued that the employer was bound to know the composition of the paint, the effect of spreading it on the interior of the tank, and the danger to his servant by the explosion of the gas so collected. The defendant on the other hand asked the court to instruct the jury that there could be no recovery upon the evidence before them. The court declined to take the ease from the jury, but, with evident misgivings as to the propriety of so doing, left it to them to determine whether the employer, the defendant company, was guilty of negligence.</p>
    <p id="b547-6" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[153,2310,1183,97]],["BL_548.1",548,[250,341,1184,664]]]'>There was no conflicting testimony. The facts were free from difficulty. There is in tills case no legal presumption to <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>take the place of proof of negligence or to shift the burden of proof. What is there then in the case of the plaintiff to show-want of care or failure of duty on the part of the defendant? The work to be done was the painting of the interior of a water-tank. The material employed was a well-known and commonly used brand of paint. It was purchased from the manufacturer ready for use. The laborers were sent to do the work under the direction of the company’s painter, who went with them, placed the -men, and gave them their directions. The paint had been in use by the public for many years, and by the defendant company for ten or twelve, without accident of any description. It is not easy to see what more could have been expected from an employer.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[251,1013,1181,917]]]'>The general rule requires of the master that he provide materials and implements for the use of his servant, such as are ordinarily used by persons in the same business; but he is not required to secure the best known materials, or to subject such as he does provide to a chemical analysis in order to settle by experiment what remote and possible hazard may be incurred by their use. This rule is recognized in the recent case of Payne v. Reese, <a href="/pa/100/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="100 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="498370" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0301-01">100 Pa. 301</a>, in which the present Chief Justice said that the “ duty of the master is to provide machinery and materials of an ordinary character.” So, also, in Crawford v. Stewart, 19 W. N. 48, which was an action to recover damages for injuries resulting from the falling of scaffolding upon which the men were at work, the master was held not liable. The reason is stated by Justice Paxson with his usual directness, in these words: “ There is no evidence that the men who erected the scaffold were not competent workmen, nor that they were not supplied with suitable materials.” The same rule is also stated in Lewis v. Seifert, <a href="/pa/116/0628-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="116 Pa. 628" data-case-ids="554338" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0628-01">116 Pa. 628</a>.</p>

The place was not one that could be regarded as in any sense dangerous. The materials were those in common use for the purpose for which they were used by the defendant. The work was done under the supervision of a competent painter. The accident, happening under such circumstances was outside the range of ordinary experience, and one, therefore, against which the measure of care due from the employer could not protect the servant. To <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>hold otherwise would be to disregard the well-settled law upon the subject and to make the. employer an insurer of the safety of his employee.</p>
