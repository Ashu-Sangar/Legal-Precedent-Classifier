There was a hot dispute between himself and the trustee on this point, the trustee demanding his full quota in letters of May 13, 19, and June 11,1875. In these letters he criticises the action of the board of directors which had recognized the claim as valid against the company, and ordered it to be paid out of the trust fund of stock. But according to the answer, and his testimony, the trustee finally conceded the point at the request of some of the contributors, much against his- own judgment.</p>

Mr. Lennig says he has no recollection of reporting this payment to a meeting of the contributors to the trust fund, but that he may have done so.

How it happened that he paid or allowed to be paid all the other debts as already detailed, but did not pay his own of #19,000, which was the largest of all, does not appear entirely clear from the- testimony. This much is certain, he was not willing to accept the stock at #50 per share for his debt, which would have given him at once about 380 shares of the trust fund and would have left to be returned to the contributors something like 194 shares in the trustee’s hands. But, having refused to pay himself in this way, for some reason known to himself, he preferred to leave his own debt unpaid and to keep in his hands as trustee the 574 shares out of which he was entitled to pay it. His explanation of this part of the transaction is, to quote his own language: “ I thought it was due (to certain persons) that I stated, if within a reasonable period, by the success of the company, the stock <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>would attain a higher value (the shares placed in my hands) than. they would owe me, with interest accumulating, that I would be willing to return any excess pro rata to them.”</p>

In his own words : “ On October 29, 1879, I credited the company with my claim, by assuming or transferring to myself 574 shares of that stock for the sum of $24,539.11, being equal to $42.71 per share.” He had previously offered the trust stock for sale privately at prices lower than he himself took it for his own debt, but found no purchasers. There had been sales of stock of the company at low prices varying from $2.75 per share to $25, during the years 1877-81. No dividends were paid on the stock from January 16, 1875, until June 14, 1880. ■On that day $5 per share was paid on account of a reduction of capital stock, and a stock dividend of 15J per cent, was made. Since then dividends have been regularly paid every six months, varying in amount from $1.25 to $3 per share, and on June 2, 1883, $15 per share was paid, in further reduction of the capital stock.</p>

Mr. Lennig held the stock for more than four years without paying with it the debt which was justly due to himself. During that period it was repeatedly offered to the directors by Mr. Lennig at from thirty to thirty-three dollars per share, but could find no takers. He frequently offered it to other persons but could find no buyers.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b600-6" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[242,822,1189,1173]]]'>On October 29, 1879, all the other creditors having been long since paid, Mr. Lennig, to close the matter up, transferred the residue of the stock, five hundred and seventy-four shares, to himself in payment of his debt, which then amounted, with the accumulated interest, to $24,589.11, which was at the rate of forty-two dollars and seventy-one cents per share. He had paid the other creditors with stock by virtue of the authority which he had to do so, and he now paid himself in the same manner. The master says, “ for some reason known to himself he preferred to leave his own debt unpaid and keep in his hands as trustee the five hundred and seventy-four shares out of which he was entitled to pay it.” The reason why Mr. Lennig waited so long before paying his own debt with the stock which he held for that purpose, is quite apparent from the evidence. He waited to see if within a reasonable period, by the success of the company, the stock might not attain a higher value and become worth more than the amount of his debt, his declared intention being in that event to return any surplus which might remain to the contributors. It was to carry out in good faith this purpose that Mr. Lennig continued to hold the stock as trustee, hoping that the business of the company would so improve as to cause a rise in the stock, which, when he received it, had no marketable value whatever.</p>

After waiting more than four years for this purpose, he paid his debt of $24,539.11, in October, <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>1879, with, the stock which remained in his hands, and which was thus applied to the purpose for which it was given, at a valuation of $42.71 per share. That this was more than the stock was worth, clearly appears from the testimony of William C. Stevenson, who has been a stockholder, director and manager of the company from February, 1875, to the present time. He was the business manager of the company for ten years.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[167,743,1182,604]]]'>On November 10, 1879, Mr. Stevenson bought of Patterson, one of the complainants, one hundred and eighty-eight shares for fifteen dollars and ninety-six cents per share. About the same time he purchased from other stockholders other lots at about the same figure. In 1880 he bought it at twenty-five dollars per share. On March 24,1881, he bought four hundred and thirty-two shares of Patterson, the chief complainant in this case, at twenty-five dollars per share. This was seventeen months after Mr. Lennig had taken the stock at forty-two dollars and seventy-one cents per share. The stock had no market value, and sales could only be effected at private sale.</p>

No one made any complaint until four years and a half had elapsed after the matter had been settled and closed. In 1884, the stock having improved in value, the complainants filed this bill. The litigation they then commenced was plainly the result of an afterthought resulting from the subsequent improved prospects of the company.</p>

He also seems to have thought that he should have paid his debt at an earlier day, and not have continued to hold as trustee the five hundred and seventy-four shares “ out of which he was entitled to pay it; ” but it must be manifest from what has been already <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>observed, that the delay of Mr. Lennig in settling his own large debt against the company was altogether in the interest of those who had contributed the stock, and was in point of fact greatly beneficial to them and to the company.</p>

Of course if a trustee makes any profit out of a trust estate that profit belongs to the cestui que trust and not to him. But this is not that case. In this case the trustee did exactly what he was employed to do. He was trustee for the payment of debts with the stock transferred. The discretion confided to him was to settle the debts with the stock transferred in the best way and upon the best terms he could. He had no other function to perform than this. He carried into effect the very purpose for which he was constituted a trustee, and the only question is whether he acted in good faith and took no unfair advantage of those who had intrusted the property to him.</p>

There is no rule in law or equity that a trustee shall in no case take a benefit under a deed of trust when such benefit is expressly conferred upon him by that deed. He may even buy from his cestui que trust, provided there is a distinct and clear contract, ascertained to be such after a jealous and scrupulous examination of all the circumstances, and that there was a clear intention that the trustee should buy, and it is apparent that there was no fraud or concealment, nor any unfair advantage taken: Coles v. Trecothick, 9 Ves. 247, and the cases cited in Hill on Trustees, 159, note c. The present case is not, however, the case of a trustee buying from his cestui que trust, but it is the case of a trustee carrying out the trust, and effecting the very object contemplated and enunciated in the express terms of the trust and in the very man<a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>ner intended. Mr. Lennig was employed as a trustee to pay off the debts of the company with the shares of stock transferred to him. He was to pay all the debts with the stock, his own debt as well as the debts of the other three creditors. His own debt was much larger than those of the other three creditors combined. It was perfectly well understood and agreed that he should pay his own debt as well as the others. He had no other office or duty except to liquidate the claims of the four creditors, of whom he was himself the largest, with the stock transferred to him. He was appointed an agent to pay off the debts with the stock contributed. He was the largest creditor and the largest contributor. He had the same right to pay himself which he had to pay the others, and the same authority. He was bound to do that upon fair and equitable terms, and to take no advantage of the contributors in doing so. He was to pay all. It was for that purpose and that purpose alone that he was appointed. It was not stipulated, nor was it contemplated, that in the discharge of this duty he should consult the contributors. His powers and duties were in no degree dependent upon their action or advice, and the evidence shows that it was never intended or contemplated that they should be. If his power to act had been dependent upon the will of the contributors he would have been a mere naked trustee to hold the title, which is not pretended, and which is disproved by the evidence.</p>

The evidence shows to our entire satisfaction that he discharged the duty imposed upon him with entire good faith, with perfect fairness, and with a scrupulous regard for the interests of all concerned.

There was no public market for it whatever. It was “to be used for the liquidation of the company’s indebtedness,” used according to the trustee’s best discretion. It was intended that the stock should be applied to the payment of the debts by settlements made with the only four creditors which the company had, and it was contemplated that Mr. Lennig should pay his own debt, as he did the others, by applying to its liquidation specifically, at a fair and reasonable price, so much of the stock contributed as might be necessary for that purpose.</p>

The price at which he took it in 1879 was, it is clear from the evidence, at least $26 per share more than at that time could be obtained for it from any other person, and $17 per share more than the plaintiff himself, Patterson, sold it for, seventeen months later, in 1881.</p>

    <p id="b607-6" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[156,579,1191,1132]]]'>This case has been so well discussed by the learned judge of the court below that we might well be excused from adding to what he has said. In order that the case may not be misunderstood or misapplied hereafter, we desire to repeat emphatically that we do not propose to interfere with or impair in the least degree the well established rule that a trustee will not be allowed, unless by leave of court first had, to purchase the trust property at his own sale, nor in any manner to make a profit out of the same. This rule is not only established, but it is one of great value, and essential to the proper administration of trust estates. But we are of opinion with the learned judge below that the rule in question does not apply to the facts of this case. As a general rule a trustee who purchases the trust property at his own sale does so in violation of his trust; whereas the appellee in this case, in the application of the stock in question to the payment of the four creditors of the company, including himself, was acting in the direct execution of his trust. He was doing with the stock just what it was given to him for. There is therefore no room for even an allegation of a breach of trust. The only question, therefore, is whether the stock was so applied in good faith, and at a fair price. Upon this point there is no room for a serious dispute.</p>
    <p id="b607-7" data-blocks='[["BL_607.7",607,[162,1719,1187,712]],["BL_608.1",608,[239,380,1184,248]]]'>There were but three creditors to pay besides himself. His own claim exceeded the aggregate of the others as his contribution of stock greatly exceeded theirs.-. 'It is true the stock was not sold at public sale. It was merely transferred in ex-tinguishment of the respective claims. That this mode of its application was the mode, and the only mode ever contemplated by the parties to the trust, is self-evident. The stock had no market value ; it could not have been sold at any time at any price that would have paid'the debts. Had the appellee paid his own claim at the time he paid the others, I presume no dispute about it would ever have arisen. He delayed for some years, and then took it at 142.71 per share. This was greatly above any price that could have been obtained for it at any sale, public or private. After the appellee had taken <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>the stock at $42.71 per share, Mr. Patterson, one of the complainants, on November 10, 1879, sold 188 shares at $15.96 per share. On March 24, 1881, he sold 432 shares at $25.00 per share. This was seventeen months after the appellee had taken the stock at $42.71 per share.</p>
    <p id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[236,634,1188,922]]]'>Much stress was laid upon the delay of the appellee in appropriating the stock to the payment of his debt. Upon this point the learned judge below found the facts as follows: “ The reason why Mr. Lennig waited so long before paying his own debt with the stock which he held for that purpose, is quite apparent from the evidence. He waited to see if within a reasonable period, by the success of the company the stock might not attain a higher value and become worth more than the amount of his debt, his declared intention being in that event to return any surplus which might remain to the contributors. It was to carry out in good faith this purpose that Mr. Lennig continued to hold the stock as trustee, hoping that the business of the company would so improve as to cause a rise in the stock, which, when he received it, had no marketable value whatever.” This finding of the court is not contradictory of any finding by the master, and, if it were, is based upon sufficient evidence. It leaves nothing whatever to sustain the appellants’ charge of bad faith.</p>

Some of the appellants had knowledge if not notice of the transaction, and as the transfer appeared upon the books of their own company to which they had access, they might have known it, had they cared to inquire. This is a question of good faith, and in such cases knowledge is regarded as equivalent to notice of the highest degree: 2 Leading Cases in Equity, 4th Amer. ed., 148. “ When a party having knowledge of such facts as would lead any honest man using ordinary caution to make further inquiries, does not make, but on the contrary studiously avoids making such inquiries, he must be taken to have notice of those facts, which, if he had used ordinary diligence, he would readily have ascertained:” Wade on Notice, § 11, and cases there cited.</p>

They had no right to suppose that Mr. Lennig would settle his own claim in any different manner than he settled with the other creditors, and if they had given him notice of any objection he could have sold the stock under an order of court. It is true it would not have brought half the money at which he took it, but it would have left no room for subsequent complaint.</p>
