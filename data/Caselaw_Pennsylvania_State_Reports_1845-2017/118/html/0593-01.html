On the filing of the report, certain facts — inter alia that the public plan for the widening of Chestnut street five feet on the north line over the properties between the Delaware river and Twenty-second street, and five feet on the south side of said street, and fixing the plotted width at sixty feet, was duly confirmed by the board of surveyors on March 2,1885, and that the Mifflin estate and McFadden properties were acquired before that date — were by agreement of council incorporated with the report of the viewers, with the same effect as if found by them. The same dajr various exceptions were filed by the city of Philadelphia, which on July 2, 1887, were disposed of by the court, Biddle, J., by the following opinion and decree:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[156,1288,1182,922]]]'>We hold that whenever the citizen is required to recede from the old building line in erecting his new building, his right to damages accrues. The real question raised by the exceptions, is as to the amount of damages given by the jury. Some of the witnesses endeavored to establish them by taking the annual gross profit which could possibly be made from the storage of goods on four or five floors, five feet wide each, and capitalizing it at the rate of six per cent., thus giving to the owner of the land an annual income forever equivalent to the storage charges which would be received if the building was always filled at remunerative rates.' Such a rule is utterly inadmissible, and if there was any evidence that the jury had adopted it, their verdict would at once be set aside. The damages estimated by that rule would be about $17,000 for McFadden’s property and $9,500 for the Mifflin property. As the jury, however, awarded $6,000 to McFadden and $4,000 to the Mifflin property, we can scarcely put upon them the reproach of having* adopted that standard.</p>

' It is then that he is injured, if injured at all, and it is then that his land is taken for public use and he is entitled to have a jury to assess the damages. It would be a disastrous event were we to hold that councils must proceed to widen the entire street at once by an ordinance giving three months’ notice to property owners to recede*. Such a proceeding would take buildings as well as land, and would cost many millions of dollars, if it did not bankrupt the treasury. The city is proceeding cautiously and in the' only practical way by which such a street can be widened. The process will probably occupy nearly a hundred years.

Linnard, <a href="/pa/97/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="97 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="444807" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0242-01">97 Pa. 242</a>, the defendant, being about to erect a new building on the south side of the street, petitioned for a jury to assess the damages which she sustained by reason of being compelled to recede. It was claimed that she was not entitled to any damages, because the injury of which she complained was due entirely to her own action. This court held otherwise, saying: “ By force of law the instant the old buildings were torn down, the city took part of the land for public use and is liable to make compensation to the owner the same as if it had been taken in any other mode.”</p>

    <p id="b620-6" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[811,1195,557,43]]]'>The proceedings are affirmed.</p>
