Adam-son, proved that in 1881 he was operating a planing mill in Waynesburgh, and the defendant, George Wisecarver, owning a farm in Franklin township, became indebted to him for dressing oak flooring and poplar siding to the amount of $31.93. The defendant, George Wisecarver, introduced evidence tending to support his claim, that in February, 1881, he had made a contract with one Martin Windell, who was then operating the planing mill, by which Windell was to dress lumber for him at 50 cents per 100 feet, to be paid in lumber at $2.00 per 100 feet, the lumber to be delivered to Windell on Wisecarver’s farm; that under this contract Wisecarver in March, 1881, delivered 2675 feet of oak flooring at the mill to be dressed, and soon afterwards, Windell, having sold the planing mill to Adamson, the latter engaged to carry out the contract as made with Windell; that in September or October, 1881, Wisecarver sent to the planing mill a lot of oak flooring and poplar siding to be dressed, which he afterwards received; that he never received any part of the 2675 feet of lumber delivered at the mill before the sale to Adamson, which lumber was turned over to and used by Adamson, and Wisecarver <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>was entitled to credit therefor. The plaintiff denied that he had ever undertaken the performance of Windell’s contract with Wisecarver.</p>

He does not deny that there was that amount of lumber there, and that he used it or sold it, but he claims to have given the defendant credit Avith all the lumber he sold or converted to his own use; that he gave him credit with it at such price as lumber of that kind was selling for at his mill, and that for such saAving as was done afterwards, he did the work he has charged for and that the prices are just such prices as he charged other people at that time for such work; and that giving the plaintiff, or defendant, credit for the amount of lumber that he used or sold belonging to the defendant, there is still due him from the defendant the sum of thirty-one dollars and ninety-three cents; and he denies that there was any such contract between him and the defendant as claimed by the defendant after the purchase of the mill, that he was to take his pay for the work performed in dressing the defendant’s lumber, in lumber at two dollars a hundred at the farm of the defendant in Franklin township. If you should find from the evidence that there was no such contract between Adamson and Wisecarver as claimed by Mr. Wise-carver, then it will be your duty to ascertain from the evidence how much work Adamson did at his planing mill for Wisecarver and whether the prices charged were reasonable or not, and whether he has been paid for that work...... But if you find that there was a contract between Wisecarver and Windell, and Adamson afterwards agreed to carry out that contract, or that there was a contract between Wisecarver and Adamson such as is claimed by Mr. Wisecarver, then has that contract been carried out ? Has Adamson accounted for all the lumber received by him from the defendant ? Has he <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>■charged him what he agreed to charge him for dressing his lumber, and has the lumber been delivered over? If it has been and Adamson has been paid the full amount of his claim as against Wisecarver for the labor performed, then he would not have a right to recover in tins action and your verdict should be for the defendant. It will be altogether a question of fact for you under the evidence in the case as you may find it to be one way or the other. [Something has been said in your hearing as to the manner of payment. As we view the matter now, that is a question about which the jury need have no concern. It may come before the court hereafter for determination, but for the present it is not a matter for the jury to consider.] 4</p>

H. Adamson, the plaintiff, agreed with the said George Wisecarver to fulfill said contract between said Windell and said Wisecarver, and that the planing and dressing of flooring and siding, for which this suit is brought, was done under and upon the terms of the said contract, and that the said George Wisecarver had then, and has always had, and still has, the lumber so agreed by him to be delivered to the said Windell and Adamson in payment for the planing and dressing of said lumber, and has always been ready and willing to deliver the same to the said J.

The plaintiff is entitled to recover a verdict in this case-for the full amount that the jury may find to be due him from the defendant under the evidence, and this, notwithstanding the fact that they may believe that J. H. Adamson had agreed to take lumber in payment for the work, and may further believe that George Wisecarver had and has lumber upon his. farm sufficient to pay the amount due the plaintiff.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b76-8" data-blocks='[["BL_76.7",76,[251,1010,1186,342]]]'>Answer: The second point is correct and is affirmed. If you should find that there is anything due from Adamson toWisecarver, you will so state in your verdict. As we stated before, as to the manner of payment, if Adamson was to take lumber, if you find that he was, you need not give yourselves any concern about that. That is a question that will arise, hereafter.3</p>

The fact that George Wisecarver has lumber upon his-farm sufficient to pay the claim of the plaintiff, is not such a. tender of payment as would prevent the plaintiff from recovering a judgment in this suit for the full amount found to be due him.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b76-10" data-blocks='[["BL_76.9",76,[252,1627,1186,549]]]'>Answer: If it is intended by that point to convey the idea, that it was necessary for Wisecarver to make a tender of this, lumber, it is not correct. If there was a contract between Adamson and Wisecarver by which Adamson was to take lumber, it was Adamson’s duty to demand it, not Wisecarver’s to tender it. If that be the meaning of the point it is not correct. But if it be only meant that there is lumber there, that need not be a bar to a recovery at your hands of a verdict for the plaintiff, if you should find that there is anything due to the plaintiff in this case, and with that qualification the point is correct and is affirmed.3</p>
