An inspection of the plan shows plainly that the locus in question is a street of the plan, as does a sale by the owner in 1833 of a lot calling for this street, giving it a name.

There was evidence from which the jury might find either way. It was a question of whose recollections the jury would find to be that of the facts. The court did not intimate any opinion on that question. It was essentially for the jury, and we are not disposed to disturb their finding. The court directed the form of the verdict in case the jury did not find a verdict of not guilty, i. e. to find a verdict of guilty and find the facts of the verdict, to be subject to the opinion of the court as to' the law on the facts. This is in accordance with what we understand to be the best practice in civil cases. On examination of the precedents, we would now direct a different form of verdict, namely, the finding of the facts with direction for the court to find the defendant guilty or not guilty, as the law might require. But the form of verdict could not, under the instructions, prejudice either side. If the law is with_ the commonwealth, judgment can be entered on the verdict. If found to be with the defendant, judgment can be arrested, so that practically the same result will be reached as if the verdict had been in different form' and in strict accordance with old precedents.</p>

In 1833 they placed the plan on the records of Allegheny county, showing the lots and streets in the .plan, and proceeded to sell lots in and described by the plan, and as early as 1833 described a lot or lots sold by the street in question. Most all of the lots in the plan have been sold and to a great extent built upon. There is no question that this constituted a dedication of all the streets in that plan to public use. As said in Rowan’s Exrs. v. Town of Portland, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20B.%20Mon.%20237" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 B. Mon. 237">8 B.

    <p class="summary" id="b368-5" data-blocks='[["BL_368.4",368,[239,713,1183,1690]]]'>The borough of Tarentum, occupying the territory of this town plot, was duly chartered soon after the plan was put on record. And no act of the municipality, or its officers, until near the time of the institution of this prosecution, had treated this as a public street. But the jury have found that “ prior to the erection of the house complained of on this street in 1848, the said street was habitually traveled by the public as they wished to, and that, since the building of the house, that portion of the street, not occupied by the building, has been constantly used by the public in traveling on foot and by vehicles, until within about one year last past.” The authorities cannot all be reconciled on the subject. But it seems to us, that the weight of authority both in this state and in other states, as well as in England, is that a road or street may become a public highway, so that the obstruction thereof may become a nuisance, by mere user of the public, without any formal act by the municipal authorities, or by the owner of the soil; the difference being, that when there has been a dedication to the public by the owner, a shorter period of use (less than twenty-one years) will suffice, than where the original grant has to be presumed from the long continued user: 2 Dill. Corp. 640; Thompson, Highways, 65, 63; Angell, Highways, 190; Commonwealth v. McDonald, 16 S. &amp; R. 390. In this last case the dedication was by a plot, and the acceptance by user by the public. The opinion of the court is an able discussion of the question, and seems to rule this point in the present case. In P. McKeesport &amp; Y. R. Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20Pa.%20586" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="104 Pa. 586">104 Pa. 586</a>, an indictment for nuisance, the municipal authorities never accepted the road, which was held to be a public highway by user.

It was built as a warehouse for the canal business, and it extended out into the street as marked on the plan, leaving, however, room for wagons to pass between it and the canal bank. With this building thereon he sold it in 1854, and his grantee and intermediate owners down to the defendant have been in the undisputed occupancy of the house ever since, adverse to the rights of the public to use that part of the street so occupied, over-forty years without objection from either borough authorities or private prosecutor. Can this adverse occupancy be pleaded by the defendant against the public right ? At common law the doctrine of the earlier cases is that there can be no loss of the public right by mere non-user. A highway once established must always remain such, until changed or discontinued by process of law: Angelí, Highways, § 821. But the doctrine of the ancient authorities has, however, been to some extent departed from in modern decisions.</p>

Mon. 237</a>, is a well and elaborately considered ease on several of the points involved in our case. On the question of dedication to the public by the making of the town plot, and selling of lots and the acceptance by use, it is very strongly against the contention of the defendant in the present case. But on the question of the adverse occupation of a part of the land thus once made public, the learned judge says, p. -259: “ That the public right as growing out of the dedication in this case was subject to be divested and defeated by such possession admits as we think of no doubt. The dedication was'not to the use of the commonwealth, as a corporate being, and it invested no title or interest therein; the maxim', Nullum tempus occurrit regi, is therefore inapplicable, and there is nothing to exempt the right which really vested in the town and its citizens to be upheld by them for the public, from the operation of the statute of limitations, or from the presumptions arising from adverse claim and possession, as they would apply in ordinary cases of private rights or public easements.” Rulings to ,the same general result are found in City of Pella v.

He sold and his vendees and their representatives have been occupying adversely ever since, for over forty years. There has been a clear adverse possession. It seems to me that this should, under the circumstances found in the special verdict, be conclusive evidence of abandonment by the town authorities, and a case in which the maxim, Nullum tempus occurrit regi, does not apply.</p>

    <p id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[170,380,1182,253]]]'>The defendant was indicted in the court below for maintaining a common nuisance. The jury rendered a verdict of guilty, accompanied with a finding of' facts in the nature of a special verdict, upon which the court below subsequently entered a judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto. •</p>
    <p id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.6",373,[172,640,1177,148]]]'>The nuisance complained of consisted of the erection of a large wooden building partly on and upon a public street in the borough of Tarentum.</p>
    <p id="b373-6" data-blocks='[["BL_373.7",373,[170,796,1181,663]]]'>The special verdict sufficiently finds that the street referred to was a public street. It was laid out and dedicated to public use by the owners of the land who laid out the town, and was placed upon the plan thereof. The said plan was recorded in the recorder’s office of Allegheny county. It was adopted by the owners on October 11, 1882, and was recorded in March, 1833. From that time to the present the street has been used by the public, excepting that portion occupied by the house since its erection. The further finding that “ the township or borough authorities of Tarentum have never formally adopted said street or treated it as a public street by working upon it or taking charge thereof ” does not deprive it of its character as a public street.</p>
    <p id="b373-7" data-blocks='[["BL_373.8",373,[172,1466,1179,864]]]'>It is true, as was said in Beatty’s Alley, <a href="/pa/104/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="104 Pa. 622" data-case-ids="452134" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0622-01">104 Pa. 622</a>, that the dedication of a private alley to public use by the owners of the land will not make it a public alley unless it is accepted as such by the municipal authorities. This is because the owners of land in a township or borough cannot, for their own convenience, compel the municipality to accept a street or alley which is not demanded by the public. But the street in question is a part of the original plot or plan of the town; is as old as the town itself, and has been used by the public for over fifty years. This is evidence of its acceptance by the borough, and the fact' that no work has been done upon it by the borough has but little significance. It may not have needed repairs, and if it had, the authorities may have neglected their duty. ' When 'a'street has been dedicated to public use by the owners, and used by the public, it requires a much less time to presume an acceptance by the public, than where there has been a mere user without such dedication.</p>

But we cannot agree to Ills conclusion that the public have lost their right to the use of this road by non-user or abandonment. Upon this point we have the finding of the jury that “ prior to the building of said house the said street was habitually traveled by the public as they wished to, and that since the building of the house the part of the street not occupied by the house has been continuously used by the public in traveling on foot and by vehicles, until within about one year last past, since which time it has been obstructed for vehicles.”</p>
    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[225,847,1181,1178]]]'>This in terms negatives the abandonment of the street. It was used as a public highway prior to the erection of the house; so much of the street as was left has been used ever since. The portion occupied by the house has not been used because it could not be. It was obstructed. The defendant was occupying it adversely, and if adverse possession for twenty-one years of a public highway would bar the public, she would have acquired the right.
