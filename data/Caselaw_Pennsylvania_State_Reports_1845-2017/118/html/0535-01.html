Certainly, city councils, under the laws and ordinances set out, could not lay two sewers on a street, if one was sufficient, and compel the property owners to pay for both, any more than in the re-laying of pavements, as in Wistar v. Philadelphia, supra. There must be some inferential benefit at least to warrant a private assessment; and, where not only is that denied but harm from the improvement is alleged, it is submitted that the court must leave it to a jury to say whether any benefit is conferred, and whether it is not for the general public benefit as in the cases cited.</p>

    <p id="b558-6" data-blocks='[["BL_558.6",558,[233,674,1181,1023]]]'>The plaintiff in error is the owner of a lot situate at the corner of Broad and Oxford streets, in the city of Philadelphia. It has a front of fifty feet on Broad street, and runs through of that width, two hundred feet to Carlisle street. It has therefore three fronts. For building purposes, however, the Broad and Carlisle street fronts only are available, the lot on Oxford Street not being of sufficient depth. In 1877 the city authorities constructed a public sewer along the Broad street front, and in 1885 they constructed another sewer along the Carlisle street front. The plaintiff paid his proportion of the cost of both these sewers. He avers in his affidavit of defence that they were both well constructed and of proper size, and in every way adequate for the present and future needs of his property. The present claim was filed for the construction of a sewer along Oxford street; he resists the payment of this upon the ground that it confers no benefit upon his property, but is for general public benefit in connection with other sewers, all of which is averred in his affidavit of defence. The court below held that the facts so set forth were insufficient, and gave judgment for the city.</p>

    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[160,627,1187,1492]]]'>Hammett v. The City appears to have been misunderstood to some extent. At least it is frequently cited as covering a much broader view than its facts and the decision thereon warrant. That was a case of re-paving Broad street. It was held that the original paving of a street is a local improvement and is within the principle of assessing the cost on the lots lying on it. But Broad street had been paved before, and the cost thereof assessed upon and paid by the property owners. A subsequent act of assembly required the city to occupy the street “ for its entire length for the uses and purposes of a public drive, carriage way, street, or avenue, or portions thereof, in whole or in part.....with such mode of pavement,” etc., as might in the judgment of the city councils be best adapted for the uses aforesaid, and ordained that the “ cost of said improvements be paid for by the owners of property abutting on said street.” In other words, the owners of property on Broad street were directed by an act of assembly and by city councils acting in pursuance thereof, to take up the pavement which they had paid for, and lay down a new and expensive one, not for the benefit of their property, but to provide a grand drive or boulevard for the public generally. This sufficiently appears by the following extract from the opinion of our late brother Sharswood : “ The object of this improvement is not to bring or keep Broad street, as all the other streets within the built-up portions of the city are kept, for the advantage and comfort of those who live upon it, and for ordinary business and travel, but to make a great public drive —a pleasure ground — along which elegant equipages may disport of an afternoon.”</p>

The City and the case in hand is very broad. We have here the mere question of the construction of a sewer under the recognized powers of city councils.

Laid as taxes are, under general laws, there will always be cases of apparent individual hardship. The childless man may claim that the taxes which- he is compelled to pay for the education of the children of other persons confers no benefit upon him. The law does not so regard it. Education produces a higher degree of intelligence, the fruits of which are seen in increased good order and diminished crime. When a man comes to pay his general taxes he cannot be permitted to allege that he derives no benefit therefrom. And it would be intolerable if in every instance of special taxation the question of benefits could be thrown into the jury-box. It would introduce into municipal government a novel and dangerous feature. It would substitute for the responsibility of councils, limited though it be, the wholly irresponsible and uncertain action of jurors.
