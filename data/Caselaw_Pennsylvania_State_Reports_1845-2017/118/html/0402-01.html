The iron foundry and leadworks were at the corner of Fifth avenue and Price street, in a well settled part of the city. The building constituting the leadworks was what was known as an ironclad, 30 feet in width by about 120 in depth, and, fronting on Price street, was separated from the foundry by an alley. The shot-tower, which was of brick and about 175 feet high, stood in the rear of the leadworks, and running from it was a warehouse for lead goods fronting on Fifth avenue. On the west side of this warehouse and in the angle of the warehouse and lead factory, was the residence of Mrs. Lane, one of the defendants, and on the east side of it was the property of the plaintiff, on which was a brick building occupied by him as a dwelling. In September, 1884, the plaintiff’s wife was prostrated with sickness which her physician diagnosed as lead-poisoning. The plaintiff complained to the city board of health that the defendants were maintaining a nuisance dangerous to the health of the neighborhood, but the board did not interfere, and this suit was brought.</p>

I am not giving it as anything that is proven, but simply what is stated as the ground of his complaint. To this declaration the defendants plead not guilty, a general denial of their liability in this action. It is a well settled principle in law that the owner of land may make use of it according to his own pleasure, and for any purpose, provided that in the use thereof he does not injure his neighbor or the public. Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas ; so use thine as not to injure another, is a maxim which the law requires shall be observed by every one, and is the only limit to unqualified and unrestricted liberty in the use to be made of property by the owner. It is the right, therefore, for any one to carry on any lawful business on his own land if the operations and results be entirely confined to his own premises and do not affect, endanger or injure any person outside. The manufacture of lead pipe and shot is not an unlawful business in itself, and therefore can be carried on if conducted so as not to injure individuals or the public. If the manufacture, however, becomes a nui<a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>sanee, it can be controlled; if a common nuisance, by indictment; if a private nuisance, by an action for the damage sustained by the individual, and in some cases, of an aggravated character at least, by abatement through the instrumentality of a bill in equity at the instance of the private sufferer. The injuries complained of here are such that, if caused by the defendants in the use of their property and in the transaction of their business, the plaintiff would be in law entitled to ask for redress. To use one’s own property in such a way as to create poisonoug odors and the like whereby his neighbor’s health and comfort are endangered or destroyed, and his premises rendered uninhabitable, or dangerous to be occupied, could not be regarded as the use of “ thine so as not to injure another.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[211,1065,1185,661]]]'>The plaintiff does not allege that he has sustained any injury or damage by reason of negligence on the part of the defendants. Negligence, therefore, is not an issue in this controversy. The allegation is that the defendants unlawfully erected works in which large quantities of arsenic and lead and other poisonous minerals were used, and that the atoms, particles, dust and poisonous odors therefrom were cast into and upon the premises of the plaintiff, to his great damage, and to the creation and maintenance of a common nuisance. A nuisance is defined to be “ anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the land, tenements or hereditaments of another.” A common or public nuisance becomes a private nuisance also when it especially annoys or injures an individual.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[209,1735,1182,661]],["BL_429.1",429,[168,342,1185,1389]]]'>An actionable nuisance is anything wrongfully done or permitted which injures or annoys another in the enjoyment of his legal rights. It is not meant by this that every annoyance is actionable. There are annoyances without fault, and such as in the reasonable use of property must be borne with by others. [But I need not discuss the subject further than to cite from the Pennsylvania Lead Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/96/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="96 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="494645" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0116-01">96 Pa. 116</a>. In that case, Justice Gordon, quoting from Blackstone, says: “ If one erect a smelting house for lead so near the land of another that the vapor and smoke kill his corn and grass and damage his cattle therein, this is held to be a nuisance.” He also adds: “All intelligent persons are aware that lead vapors are poisonous, and this the more so, as they are often, as in this case in <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>hand, accompanied with arsenic.” The Pennsylvania Lead Co. was engaged in smelting ores, while the present defendants are not so engaged, but in both cases the product of the works is obtained by the use of lead and arsenic in its manufacture. Under the authority of this decision I am of the opinion that it is a nuisance to erect and conduct works which produce like effects to that of the Pennsylvania Lead Co., although not engaged in the same business.]5 If the use of lead and arsenic produce the deleterious and poisonous effects indicated in the case, no matter what the business conducted may be, it would be regarded as a nuisance, and one which could be abated by an injunction. You will therefore determine from the evidence produced in your hearing in court and from your inspection of the premises made by consent of the parties, first, whether the defendants in the prosecution of their business created and cast upon the plaintiff’s premises the poisonous vapors, atoms, particles, dust and odors complained of; and second, if you find such to be the fact, to ascertain the amount of the damage and the extent of the injury which the plaintiff has sustained therefrom. If you find that no nuisance was created and maintained, your verdict will be for the defendants. If, however, you should find otherwise, it will be necessary that you should know the measure of damages as prescribed by law for the injuries which have been sustained. The damages claimed by the plaintiff are of three kinds: 1. For injuries to his person and health. 2. For injuries resulting to his real estate. 3. For injuries to his wife and children......</p>

The declaration against the defendants was for maintaining a public or common nuisance, out of which he sustained special damage.

But, there was <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>testimony which, would have warranted the finding as a fact that if Mrs. Grantz suffered from lead poisoning from these emissions, it was because she was peculiarly susceptible to such influences. The rule of law is, that one cannot be held as a tort-feasor for acts which are ordinarily harmless: Greenland v. Chaplin, 5 Exch. 248.

In answer to the first assignment we have only to state that the court below was not asked to charge the jury that if Mrs. Grantz suffered from lead poisoning caused by matter escaping from defendants’ works and shot-tower, on account of her peculiar susceptibility to lead poisoning, and no one else so suffered, defendants could not be held liable for maintaining a nuisance. The point which is the subject of this assignment of error is a mere abstract proposition, entirely ignoring the facts of the case, and was properly refused. The testimony, as already referred to, shows that the remaining four members of plaintiff’s family were affected in same manner as his wife; not so seriously, as she almost died, but to such an extent as to cause vomiting, sores, boils, ulcers, swelling of the limbs and extreme pain. Whether Mrs. Grantz was more susceptible to lead poisoning than the others, or whether her greater and graver illness was due, as her husband explained, to the proximity of the rear part of the house, where she usually was, to the shot-tower, we think immaterial, as in neither case would it relieve defendants, and plaintiffs in error cite no cases which hold otherwise. According to the expert evidence, great numbers of people are more susceptible to lead poisoning than others; but are they not entitled to protection from these deadly works, operated, as defendants’ works were, in the residence portion of the city ?</p>

    <p id="b431-9" data-blocks='[["BL_431.9",431,[166,2261,1182,140]]]'>The learned court below declined to affirm the defendants’ tenth point, for the reason that it was only a naked proposition, unconnected with the facts of the case.</p>
    <p id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.3",432,[257,343,1178,454]]]'>
      <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>I assume the learned judge would not have denied the point, had he considered that there was evidence from which the jury might have found the facts of which it is predicated. An injury to a single individual from lead poisoning, because of a peculiar and exceptional susceptibility of such person to such influence, when the trace of arsenic or lead was so slight as not in any degree to affect other persons, would not be sufficient to make the leadworks a common or public nuisance. So plain a proposition does not need elaboration.</p>
    <p id="b432-5" data-blocks='[["BL_432.4",432,[247,806,1186,916]]]'>We turn then to the question whether the court was correct in assuming that the point was a mere abstract proposition, unconnected with the facts of the case. Here we think the learned judge inadvertently fell into error. It is true there is no direct testimony as to the alleged peculiarity and susceptibility of the wife of the plaintiff below to the influence of lead and arsenic, and it was, doubtless, this circumstance, which, in the hurry of the trial, misled the court below. The fact was overlooked that there was testimony from which the jury might have drawn such an inference. Thus, if we have the proof that one person has sustained injury from the fumes thrown out by the leadworks, while one hundred other persons equally exposed to its influence are not affected by it in any degree, the jury would have a right to infer that the one person had “ a peculiar and very exceptional idiosyncrasy or susceptibility ” to the influence of lead and arsenic. We think there was enough evidence to submit upon this question, and that the point should have been affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b432-6" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[242,1731,1181,611]]]'>We also sustain the second assignment of error. The plaintiff declared as for a common and public nuisance, with an averment of special damage. The plea was the general issue. By the defendants’ first point the court was asked to instruct the jury that, “ under the pleadings in this case, the plaintiff must show that the defendants, in operating the lead-works and shot-tower, or one of them, were guilty of maintaining a common nuisance, which was inconvenient and troublesome to the whole neighboring community in general, and that from the same the plaintiff suffered a special or peculiar injury.” This point the court refused, and the jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $700.</p>
    <p id="b432-7" data-blocks='[["BL_432.6",432,[286,2349,1133,43]],["BL_433.1",433,[156,363,1182,718]]]'>As between the parties, as the record now stands, the effect <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>of the verdict is to establish the fact conclusively that the works of the defendants are a common nuisance. With the facts thus established by a verdict at law, it might be a question whether a court of equity could refuse to enjoin the further operation of the works as a continuing nuisance. Yet if the jury had been instructed that, under the pleadings, they must find the works were a common nuisance, to entitle the plaintiff to recover, they might well have hesitated to do so under the evidence. The weight of the evidence was the other way. An error is sometimes rendered more palpable by a consideration of the results which logically follow it. Were there nothing else in the case we would hesitate to reverse for this reason, as the narr. might have been amended below, but as the case must go back it is proper to refer to it.</p>
    <p id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[159,1088,1180,138]]]'>. The defendants’ second point if affirmed would have withdrawn the question of nuisance from the jury, and it was not error to decline it.</p>
    <p id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[158,1243,1185,1179]],["BL_434.1",434,[273,366,1182,609]]]'>By the defendants’ fifth point the court was asked to instruct the jury, that “ the plaintiff to recover must show an actual and substantial interference with, and annoyance to him or his property in the use and occupation of his property, and a slight and rare damage would not entitle him to recover.” This point was answered as follows: “ This point as an entire proposition is refused. While it is true that an actual and substantial interference must exist, the plaintiff may still recover for a slight and rare damage if that damage be actual and substantial, and the result or effect of a nuisance created and maintained by the defendants.” I do not regard this answer as clear or as consistent with itself. As the case must go back for a re-trial, it is proper to say that, in our opinion, the plaintiff can only recover for a substantial injury. The defendants were engaged in a lawful business. Whether they made a judicious selection of a site therefor, in view of its character and the nature of its surroundings, is a question as to which I express no opinion. But they are entitled to a reasonable enjoyment of their property, and mere trifling annoyances or injuries necessarily incident thereto would not move a chancellor to restrain their operations: Rhodes v. Dunbar, <a href="/pa/57/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="57 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1010465" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0274-01">57 Pa. 274</a>; Huckenstine’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/70/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="70 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1028218" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0102-01">70 Pa. 102</a>; Rex v. Tindall, 6 Ad. &amp; E. 143; Tipping v. St. Helen’s Smelting Co., <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>116 E. C. L. R. 608. So I apprehend a rare and trifling injury necessarily resulting from a lawful business would not sustain an action at law. It must be a real, substantial injury. Were it otherwise, many occupations could not be carried on at all in large cities. There are some injuries too slight and exceptional to be recognized as a bar to the active industries of the country. Every lawful enterprise contributes to the public good. It furnishes employment to the idle, promotes every other branch of industry, and in this way indirectly benefits the whole community. It is not unreasonable that the individual members of the community thus benefited should make some slight sacrifices for the public welfare.</p>
    <p id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[266,983,1188,1320]]]'>The fifth and last assignment alleges that the court erred in that portion of its charge in which reference was made to the Penn. Lead Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/96/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="96 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="494645" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0116-01">96 Pa. 116</a>. We think it was an unfortunate reference for the defendants, and, under the circumstances, could not have failed to influence the jury. The cases are widely different, and, although the learned judge told the jury that “ The Pennsylvania Lead Company was engaged in smelting ore, while the present defendants are not so engaged, but in both cases the product of the works is o1&gt; tained by the use of lead and arsenic in its manufacture,” yet the court failed to point out the essential difference between them. This is apparent from the next sentence of the charge: “ Under the authority of this decision I am of the opinion that it is a nuisance to erect and conduct works which produce like effects to that of the Pennsylvania Lead Company, although not engaged in the same business.” From this language the jury could hardly fail to draw the inference that, inasmuch as the Pennsylvania Lead Works had been declared to be a nuisance, if the defendants’ plant produced like results, it must also be a nuisance. The difference in degree was wholly overlooked. Whereas it is claimed by the defendants that if their works do throw off the noxious substances referred to in the case of the Pennsylvania Lead Company, it is in such small quantity as not to affect the general health and comfort of the neighborhood. It would be better in the next trial of this case to omit all reference to the case in 96 Pa.</p>
