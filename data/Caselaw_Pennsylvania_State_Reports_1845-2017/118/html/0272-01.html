On April 27, 1884, a child was killed by the fall of a part of a wall of the building occupied by the plaintiff and on May 15,1884, a notice was served upon Thomas Liggett, the agent of the owner in the renting and management of her, buildings, by J. C. Brown, the city inspector of buildings, to the effect that, at the request of two citizens, he had examined said building and found it in a dangerous condition, and directing him to “ forthwith remove or repair,” the same, etc. A like notice was served on January 16, 1885; another on March 25, 1885; and on April 3, 1885, a peremptory notice to remove the building in five days, was served upon said agent. On April 13, 1885, P. J. Devlin, under contract with the city authorities, proceeded, after notice to the plaintiff, to tear the building down compelling the plaintiff to move out, who thereupon brought this suit.

Then, we find, as part of the history of the case in evidence, that Kaufmann Bros, made an arrangement with the Hitchcocks to lease this property, and they were to have possession on April 1, 1885. Bacon was in possession with the right to stay until April 1, 1886, one year later than the time agreed upon for the Kaufmanns to take possession. While that was the existing state of facts, we find the defendants putting this provision in their lease with the Kaufmanns: “ The parties of the first part covenant and agree to give the said J. Kaufmann &amp; Bros, absolute, quiet and full possession on April 1,1885, of all the property hereby demised, or if any person refuses to quit the same, then the parties of the first part are to have said tenant ejected as soon as possible, and if the possession is not given before May 1, 1885, then this lease, at the election of J.

Bacon had a right to remain there after April 1, 1885, for a year. [The owners of this property were interested, of course, in getting him out, for as we see, they had covenanted and obligated themselves to give possession of the property to the Kaufmanns. The question then was, how are we going to get Bacon out ? And I suggest the matter of the lease to the Kaufmanns as bearing on the fact we submit to you, whether or not in these proceedings, particularly that portion which involved the ejectment, the Hitchcocks and their agents are to be held responsible, or whether these facts throw any light upon the question of whether or not these were the acts, legal or illegal, of the city officials and those acting under them; because if the ejecting was done by the city officials alone, without connivance or unknown to the owners of the property, they standing back, not interfering-<a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>when they might have interfered, the city authorities are responsible, and not the defendants. But if this thing was done by an arrangement, done by connivance of the defendants, if the thing was allowed to go on in bad faith, was put in that shape by them, or, if not concocted, even acquiesced in by them, so as to bring about that which otherwise would not have happened, they are as much responsible as if they had stood on the curbstone and given general orders to “ tear away, boys, and throw him out.”] 4</p>

He was there in violation of law, he was a trespasser, and the law gives the right to a man to get possession of his property, if he can do it peaceably, not doing any injury or producing a breach of the peace, even without legal proceedings. It is not controverted in this case that if this contract was made by Bacon your verdict should be for the defendants. The counsel for the defendants so allege, and the counsel for plaintiff do not controvert the position, and certainly it is incontrovertible.</p>

If that were all, and if it were the real fact, that these defendants did not interfere with or connive at the tearing down in such a way as to make them personally participants in the act, for their own purposes, they cannot be held personally liable, whether they got the benefit of it or not. Had then the defendants anything to do with the plaintiff’s eviction ? Did they or some one of them participate in or connive at the removal of the plaintiff from the premises in question?] 6 You have heard what has been said by the counsel. [You have for your <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>consideration the fact that Bacon was there with the right to stay for another year; that his staying there might seriously interfere, and probably would, with the execution or carrying out of this contract, which would probably be, it may be assumed it was, a benefit to the defendants; that Devlin had previously done work for the defendants; that the inception of this thing, as far as he, Devlin, was concerned, seems to have been with Liggett, the agent for the other defendants; that after the work was done Devlin’s bill was approved by the street commissioner, and the money paid by Liggett, as the agent of the defendants. Whether these facts are sufficient to satisfy you fairly that the Hitchcocks were conniving at this thing, that it was not merely a collateral proceeding in which they were taking no part, but that they were actually the parties who were bringing it about, is for you to say.] 5 If they are not sufficient to satisfy you, fairly lead you to that conclusion, your verdict must be for the defendants on that point.....</p>

If you cannot conclude that they had, then you must necessarily find a verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiff must find his remedy for his injury, if he has been injured, somewhere else. But if you should find, if the evidence leads you fairly to conclude, that the defendants are responsible, that they were conniving at or bringing about this eviction, whatever means may have been used, then you have to go to another question; because as I have said, if there was an agreement , he should go out, they had a right to put him out, and it will not make the right any less because the defendants may have recurred or resorted to a subterfuge or circumlocution. If they had a right to go and throw him out bodily, it don’t make them liable because-they may have resorted to this other means. It don’t change the aspect of the case at all. It stands just precisely as if they had gone there themselves, and makes it no better or worse that they used the city officials to accomplish a proper purpose. Was the arrangement made, as claimed by the defendants, that the <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>plaintiff was to go out on the 1st of April, and was to have $150 for going? If you believe it was, that ends the plaintiff’s case, and Avould, even if the defendants stood in court avoAving the eviction was at their request and expense, or if they had been personally concerned in it. If you find that the defendants are liable by reason of their participation in this eviction, has the plaintiff a right to complain of their turning him out contrary to law, and that depends on whether or not he agreed for the consideration that has been mentioned, or for any consideration, to go on the 1st of April and refused to take it. If you should find he did, he cannot recover against anybody; or if you should find that he did not make that arrangement, and that he was turned out without the interference or participation of the defendants, your verdict should be for them, because although the plaintiff has been wronged, there is no evidence to show that the wrong was done by the defendants, and you cannot hold one party, who has not been a participant, responsible for the wrong done by another.</p>

[In the first place he would be entitled to recover the direct injury done to his stock by reason of the removal, the damage done by the snow or rain, if there was any, or any other injury done that would decrease the money value of it as it stood previous to the removal, and as it stood in the new store after it was removed, assuming that it was removed with due care. At all events, we can say that he is entitled to recover the actual damage done by the proper removal of the stock, whatever that may have been. He is then entitled to recover the difference be<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>tween what he had to pay in rent in the place that he was, and the rent that he had tó pay, not what he agreed to pay, in the new place.

Then, there is another, and one a little more difficult to determine, and which, under our view of the law, we must submit; that is, the actual loss of profits or to his business arising from this removal.]8 It appears he was making a certain amount of money before. Of course, the jury cannot tell what he would have made the ensuing year, but what he made the year before is some basis to go on, and we have got to judge of the future by the past. That would give you some data as to what he probably would have made, but you see we get into, probabilities here and then you have the testimony as to what he did make.</p>

Of course, where a man has an established business and moves, it takes him some time to get it back. In a city like'this where there is so much competition even a short distance sometimes makes considerable difference. All that is to be considered by the jury. He would have had a right to stay to April 1, 1886, and no longer.

Granting that the eviction was desirable to the defendants; that it accomplished their wishes and gave them an important advantage over the plaintiff in the matter of getting rid of him as a tenant, still it was not their act. On the contrary, it was the undoubted act of the city officials. If wrongfully done they were responsible, and if rightfully done, of course there could be no recovery and the court so charged the jury. ' The city officials assumed all the responsibility for the destruction of the building, and the proof upon this subject was so conclusive that it cannot be questioned, and in truth was not questioned by the court in the charge. The person who tore- down the building was. one <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>Devlin, who testified that he took it down under a contract to do so, made with Bigelow the city engineer and Linderman the street commissioner. Bigelow being examined testified: “ Q. Did you make any contract with Mr. Devlin with relation to that house? A. Yes sir; I did through Mr. Linderman. I sent Mr. Devlin to Mr. Linderman; had Mr. Linderman to make the contract. Q. The contract in relation to what ? A. Taking down the building occupied by Mr. Bacon on Smithfield street.” Repeated notices were given by the city authorities that the building was in a dangerous condition, and in the first of these dated May 15, 1884, the defendants were directed, by the building inspector either to remove or repair the building forthwith. In January, 1885, another notice was given. On March 25,1885, another notice was given of which the following is a copy:—</p>

The dangerous condition of the building was fully proved, and, indeed, is not questioned. The removal was effected after most ample notice to the plaintiff, who was given <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>all the time he needed to remove his stock, and did remove it to another building, which he had previously rented for the purpose. It is of no consequence, if it be true, that there was not an inspection of the building, and an arbitration upon the question whether the building was dangerous. Those are rights of the owners of which they may avail themselves if they desire. But in view of the very positive testimony as to the condition of the building, an arbitration would have been of no service in preventing an order for its removal; and in any event the- right to contest the granting of the order was personal to the owners and was no concern of the plaintiff. The order was made by the proper official, and was literally carried out under his direction; and if the removal was an illegal act, the plaintiff has his remedy against those who were guilty of it. We are not referred to any testimony showing that either of the Hitchcocks had anything whatever to do with the removal of the buildihg by the city authorities, nor have we been able to discover any such testimony in the case. Nor can we discover any evidence connecting Liggett, their agent, with the removal in any such manner as to render him or them liable therefor. The first and second points of the defendants should have been affirmed. The first six assignments of error are sustained. The consideration of the last two is not necessary.</p>
