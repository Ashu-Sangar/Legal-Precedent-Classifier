Phila. &amp; R. R. Co. v. Stichter, 11 W. N. 325, is of weakened authority by reason of the dissenting opinion of three out of four of the justices. Moreover it was not ordered to be officially reported. Further, in the case at bar the usury was complete by the actual payment of the entire debt and interest. And the payment of interest never depended on any contingency, but was regularly paid or deducted when the notes were given or renewed.</p>

The time for the payment of the money was when the United Pipe Lines certificates were worth in open market $1.15 per barrel, and was thus indefinite and uncertain. The transaction was a speculation, in which Brown stipulated for a profit as uncertain in one respect as <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>any profit Ralston expected. The recovery of usury is a personal right which no one but the debtor can enforce, and the consent of Ralston to the application of the money was an end to any claim by his assignee : Miners’ Trust Co.

R. Co. v. Stichter, 11 W. N. 325, in which it was held that when the promise to pay a sum above legal interest depends upon a contingency and not upon the happening of a certain event, the loan is not usurious. The same principle is stated in Philip v. Kirkpatrick, Add., 124. Ralston was to pay all storage, shrinkage and fire assessments on the collateral oil, and to repay to Brown the money advanced, with seven per cent thereon, in case oil should reach $1.15. It happened that oil did advance to that price, and the proceeds were applied as agreed upon. In view of the risk of loss incurred, to allow a recovery by the plaintiff would be unwarranted.</p>

In this there was no error. The contract between Brown and Ralston, while resembling somewhat a contract for the loan of money, was not so in substance. It was practically a venture or speculation in oil, with capital to be furnished by Brown. If unsuccessful — that is, if oil never reached $1.15 per barrel, the loss fell on Brown; if successful, Brown was to get his money back, with seven per cent, interest. In other words, he risked the capital with the chance of getting one per cent, above legal interest as profit. We do not see any taint of usury in this. It is settled law that when the promise to pay a sum above legal interest depends upon a contingency and not upon the happening of a certain event, the loan is not usurious. This was decided in Phila. &amp; R. R. Co. v. Stichter, 11 W. N. 325. And see also Spain v. Hamilton, <a href="/us/68/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Wall. 604" data-case-ids="3471074" data-case-paths="/us/68/0604-01">1 Wall. 604</a> ; Corcoran’s Case, Idem 604. In Philip v. Kirkpatrick, Add. 124, the principle is thus stated: “ If money be lent, payable on a contingency which may never happen, as the arrival of a <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>ship, more than legal interest may be reserved on the payment, and it is not usury, for the lender risks the loss of the whole.”’</p>
