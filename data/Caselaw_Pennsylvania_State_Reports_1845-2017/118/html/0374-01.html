The exception applies to the whole share coming to them, and there is nothing in the language to prevent its application to real estate as well as to personal property. Cd) The testator’s explanation as to the meaning of this condition or limitation is to be found in the directions for investment, the receipt of interest on the same, “ and at their death to revert to their children after they have arrived at the age of twenty-one years.” This explanation applies to whatever was coming to Lizzie and Lulu out of the residuary estate.</p>

The word “money” will be construed to include both real and personal property- if required by the context. “ Money,” especially “ moneys,” has a popular sense, meaning what a man is worth; and is frequently held to include every kind of property: Miller’s Est., <a href="/cal/48/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="48 Cal. 165" data-case-ids="1953883" data-case-paths="/cal/48/0165-01">48 Cal. 165</a>; Dawson v.

In only two classes of causes, we believe, has the word “ moneys ” been held applicable to real estate : (1) Where the testator has expressly so used it, as in a devise of “ White-acre and all my other moneys; ” (2) in certain cases to avoid an alleged intestacy, where an intention to dispose of the whole estate is manifest from the whole will. Here, the testator has not used the word to designate a devise, and there is no threatened intestacy, as the whole estate has been previously disposed of.</p>

    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.6",398,[240,960,1181,456]]]'>The will of Joseph Dilworth is inartificially drawn. The portion of it involved in this case is as follows: “ The balance of my estate shall be divided between my children, share and share alike, except what may be coming to my daughters, Lizzie and Lulu Beggs. Their moneys to be invested by my executors in bonds, mortgages, or other good securities, they receiving the interest on same, and at their death to revert to their children after they have arrived at the age of twenty-one years.”</p>
    <p id="b398-7" data-blocks='[["BL_398.7",398,[237,1426,1180,137]]]'>The precise question for our determination is, What estate did the two daughters referred to take in the real estate of the testator ? Was it a fee or a lesser estate ?</p>

We need not stop to inquire how far he succeeded in impressing a trust upon the “ moneys ” as no such question is before us. But conceding that the “ moneys ” of the daughters was to be held in trust, does such trust extend to their shares of the real estate ? The court below held that it did not, and that the daughters took a fee simple therein. In this we think the court was correct. The words “ except what may be coming to my daughters, Lizzie and Lulu Beggs ” might seem to cover both real and personal estate, but this general expression is qualified by the words immediately following: “ Their moneys to be invested,” etc. The testator may have thought that money is more fleeting in its character than real estate, <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>and therefore desired to place some restriction upon his daughters’ use and enjoyment of their “ moneys.”</p>
    <p id="b399-4" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[176,461,1186,719]]]'>The word “ moneys ” used in wills has but seldom been held to apply to real estate, and the cases in which it has been so held have no application to the facts of the one under consideration. The clause of the will in question is awkwardly expressed. In our opinion the proper reading and meaning of it is this: “ The balance of my estate, real and personal, shall be divided between my children, share and share alike, except what moneys may be coming to my daughters, Lizzie and Lulu Beggs; their moneys to be invested,” etc. This appears very plain to us; so plain as hardly to require argument. We cannot assume that the testator intended to die intestate as to this portion of his real estate; and to hold that he had created a trust thereof and limited the daughters to a life estate, would be making a will for him. Finding no error in this record,</p>
    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.5",399,[818,1187,494,45]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
