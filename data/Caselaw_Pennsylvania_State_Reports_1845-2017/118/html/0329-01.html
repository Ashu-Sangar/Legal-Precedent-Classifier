John Spieler to the receipt. The grounds upon which plaintiff relies to recover in this action is that she is the administratrix of John Roth, deceased, by letters of administration issued to her on October 4,1871, and as such is entitled to demand, and receive any personal property belonging to the estate of John Roth, deceased; that the amount due upon the policy in suit has never been paid to either the administratrix or to John Spieler, to whom the policy had been assigned; that the money to pay the policy was committed to the hands of Adam Becker, the agent here of the company, and was by him appropriated to his own use, and that the company is not relieved of liability by such act; that the assignment, though genuine, was not intended to make the money the property of Spieler, but for other purposes than that of. ownership, and that, although assigned, it was, notwithstanding, the money of John Roth; that the receipt for the three thousand dollars is a genuine paper, but that it is simply prima facie evidence of payment and the subject of proof that the money was not paid, although the receipt was delivered. It is further contended by the plaintiff that before the payment made, as alleged, to Spieler, the defendants had notice not to pay the money to him, as it <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>was claimed by tbe administratrix of John Roth, deceased.

[I take it, also, to be the law that if the company placed in the hands of Adam Becker, the local agent for this county, the money to settle this policy and Becker appropriated the fund to his own use, without authority to so appropriate from Spieler, the company will not be discharged from liability.]18</p>

If fraud is once established it affects the rights of all involved in the fraud; and I may say, in addition that, as I understand it, the transactions of the parties have not been assailed on the ground of fraud. The controversy has apparently resolved itself more into the question of the rights of the parties to the fund assigned, rather than an attack upon the validity of the assignment, except in so far as the evidence may show that the assignment is void from want of delivery and like allegations, ánd the further contention that the company has never made a lawful payment in satisfaction of the policy to either John Spieler or the estate of John Roth. In fact, it seems to me that the' assignment cannot be safely attacked by the plaintiff as a fraudulent act, because in that event John Roth would be connected with Becker in the perpetration of a fraud that would defeat the right of the plaintiff to a policy committed in fraud to Becker for purposes'of collection of money'improperly from the defendant company......</p>

The assignment and receipt being in evidence, and their authenticity unquestioned, it was error to admit testimony of statements and declarations made by Becker after payment and surrender of the policy. The controversy was not as to matters that led to the making of the contract, in which Becker’s knowledge might well be the knowledge of the company, but to matters between the assured and Becker personally. The instructions made the company liable to Roth’s administratrix even if it ha.d paid the policy to Becker on the faith of the assignment to Spieler and of Spieler’s order to Becker, provided Becker never paid over the money to Spieler. The fraud of Becker and Spieler would not affect the company if the company paid in ignorance of the fraud.</p>

From the evidence, there is no possibility of question that Becker was, legally, the general agent of the defendant company at Pittsburgh. Persons assured in companies of a distant state, and largely from among an humble class, cannot reasonably be expected to deal in any respect with the corporation except through its resident agent. When Becker received the money to pay the loss he was still the company’s agent. And, having the money in his hands, his principal was bound by his acts, declarations and admissions, as part of the res gestae: 1 Greenl. Ev., § 118; Story Agency, § 451; Insurance Co. v.

The court below could not say that the signing of the assignment, without any consideration and never delivered or accepted, nor known of, till after his death, but kept in the agent’s possession and control, so put it in the agent’s power as to enable him to defraud the company that the plaintiff’s rights were thereby forfeited.</p>

The plaintiff, suspecting a fraud, did all an ignorant woman could be expected to do. After sixteen years, the contents of the letter could not be accurately remembered, but it is a fair presumption that it embodied the substance of Mrs. Roth’s claims and that it was received.</p>
    <p id="b360-8" data-blocks='[["BL_360.6",360,[253,1897,1178,353]]]'>4. Spieler’s testimony was most relevant. He did not know of the assignment to him till after Roth’s death. The assignment was without consideration and there was no delivery. He signed papers generally at Becker’s request, including ordinary and judgment notes, upon which he received and owed nothing. The assignment and receipt upon the policy were valueless against the plaintiff.</p>

In view of these and other facts, clearly established by uncontradicted evidence, the court was requested in defendant’s third and ninth points to instruct the jury as follows : “ 3. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the assignment on back of the policy was signed by John Roth in blank, and the policy in that condition was left in the hands of Adam Becker, Roth thereby <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>constituting Becker his agent to fill up the assignment; and if Becker did subsequently fill in the name of John Spieler as assignee, and upon this assignment, thus regular on its face, the company acted, believing it to be a valid assignment, both Roth and the plaintiff are estopped to deny the validity of the assignment.” “ 9. If the jury find from the evidence that the defendant company, through their general agent, George Dart, on September 5,1871, in good faith, relying on the assignment of the policy in suit, made by John Roth, the assured, to John Spieler, and on the proofs of death furnished by said Spieler, and on his surrender of the policy, with his receipt of satisfaction in full indorsed thereon and signed by him, paid the amount due on said policy to said John Spieler, through Adam Becker, who then and there produced and surrendered to said general agent, Dart, the said policy so assigned and satisfied, then the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant. Nor, if the jury find, as above stated, will the alleged statement, made by Becker or Spieler, after such,.payment, avail to deprive defendants of their right in such case, to have the verdict of the jury in their favor.”</p>

The declarations and conduct of Becker, as affecting the liability of the company, were considered in the opinion, above referred to, and it is unnecessary to repeat what was then said on that subject.

It may be conceded the jury would have been warranted in finding the alleged fraud, <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>but we fail to discover any evidence to justify a finding that the company had any notice or knowledge of such facts as should have put it on inquiry.
