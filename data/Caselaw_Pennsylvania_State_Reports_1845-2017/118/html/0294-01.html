Ordinarily if you have no account in a bank and go there to collect a check you hand it over the counter. If it is all right, and the banker recognizes you as the proper party, he gives you the money and you go avyay with it. That of course ends the transaction as far as you are concerned. If you are doing business in the same bank and don’t want the money, they take the check and do something with it, you don’t know what exactly, but they give you a credit, and the ordinary practice is, as the evidence shows here, to put it on a file. I presume they generally have a triangular cutter as shown in this case. That cuts the check but it don’t pay it, because even in a case of that kind, if the drawer of the check would go in and countermand the payment of it I presume he would have a right to do so, because the check has not been actually paid. [But it indicates upon the face of it the fact, if nothing else appears, that the check has been paid; it is a mutilation of it; it is doing that which, if the party didn’t intend to pay the check at the time he had no right to do. You own the check and he has cut or mutilated it. He may have done it by mistake, and that, of course, is susceptible of correction, but the mere fact that the check is cut in that way, I think under the testimony in this case and under the general practice, indicates that it has been pp/id.]7 I say indicates,' because there are certain reasons which would account for it being done, without showing payment. That being the case, if a check is presented at a bank and it bears upon its face that which indicates it has been paid, the party who redeems it has to do so at his own risk, and if it turns out it has been paid before, and either he or somebody else is to lose the <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>money, the law would cast the loss on him, and the reason is that he is bound to take reasonable and proper care in examining checks before paying them.</p>

He may pay that check if he chooses, but if he pays it I am not necessarily responsible if it should turn out that I had torn the check up to destroy it, and he paid it without making proper inquiry. I have no doubt as a mere matter of law, without more, he would be guilty of negligence, and although he had paid the check he could not charge me with it from the fact he had paid it when he had no right to do so. The case would be much stronger if a check were presented with the word “paid” written across it. I might give a man a check, and the next day meet him on the street and pay him the money, take the check back and write the word “ paid ” across the face of it and afterwards lose it, and if it were found and presented to a banker and he would pay it, common sense would indicate that he did it at his own risk, and he could not recover the amount of it off me, because it was through his own carelessness and negligence that it was paid.</p>

I must say that I have been, if not instructed, considerably surprised, with the views the different gentlemen connected with banking operations in this city expressed with reference to the signification of that peculiar term. If it were plain English we would have to instruct you as a matter of law what the words meant, and the expression of opinion of anybody else would amount to nothing. Taken by themselves the words do not mean anything, or at least nobody can tell what they mean. These gentlemen, or some of them, don’t seem to understand what they mean, or if they do, they seem to understand it so well that they cannot explain it. They all have one idea, it seems to me, running through the whole testimony, and that is that putting these words on the check makes the bank that puts them there responsible as though the cut had never been made; that the bank means to say that that cut was made and it don’t mean what it seems to have meant when put there; that it seems to mean payment, and yet don’t mean payment. It seems to me there is very little difference of opinion, and when the idea is stated closely and tersely it is that the bank that wrote those words on the check meant to say that that check was to be as if the cut had not been made, and if it turns out that by reason of the cut a. responsibility arises to the party who takes the check back the-bank cutting it will make it good. The word “ guarantee ” means something. The act of cutting means something, and this talk about the words guaranteeing the fact that somebody made a hole in the check, which is obvious, and if the bank holding it came around they would show how they made it, or who made it, is simply an absurdity. That the words involve some sort of liability is beyond peradventure. What it is, while I have a very clear and distinct idea of my owñ, I must, of course, refer to the jury. It is a question for you to determine under <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>all the evidence. [If you think, in view of the testimony, that the words mean a liability which required the German Bank to make good any loss that might arise to the plaintiff by reason of that check having been paid, when it represented it had not been paid, the plaintiff has made out a case that will justify a recovery. ]14 If it had been paid at that time, actually and in fact, by the German Bank, the plaintiff has a right to recover the full amount of it.</p>

Upon that the chief argument has been made by counsel. You have heard the testimony as to the manner in which business was done by the clearing house, that all these banks, under the rules of the clearing house have until one o’clock to see whether they will accept a check or not. [You have it in evidence that where a banker receives a check, puts it upon the file, makes no objection to it, it is prima facie evidence of payment. Without the jury would say there was a mistake, they are bound to presume that it was received as actual payment, and that, too, whether the banker had a right, as he might have had, to delay the acceptance of it or not. ] 9 If I go into a bank with a check they are not bound to accept it. They may say they don’t know about it, want to inquire about the standing of the bank it is drawn upon, or the standing of the drawer. If they give me the money the act is consummated, and if anybody should then come in and try to stop payment it would be too late, although 1 might have stolen the check. The party from whom I got it would have to look to me, and the bank would be protected. Where money has been paid there can be no equivocation or qualification of the act. You may call it what you please, but it is payment, and no theory and no testimony under the sun would make it anything else. It might be payment under mistake, might be payment of a fraudulent check, but it is payment, and it is a payment which, if the drawer has money in the bank, and the check is genuine, cannot be gone behind <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>so far as the maker of it is concerned and the banker. But sometimes the act is more equivocal, even where you hand the check over the counter. There is no money immediately paid. You go in, lay your check down, and walk out. You don’t even stop to see what the banker does, but he puts the check on the file and gives you a credit in the books. After you have gone out if the drawer should go in and stop, or undertake to stop the payment of the check, and the banker, for certain reasons, should feel disposed to assume it had not been paid, it is too late; he has paid it.</p>

But if it accepts the check as valid and pays out the money, or what as some authorities hold, is the same thing, credits it to the holder’s account, it cannot at any time thereafter, even on the same day, return the check on discovering that there were no funds to meet it, and cancel the transaction, for the collection is then treated as accomplished: Daniels, Neg.

Germania Bank, they <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>had a right to say they would not pay it and return it to the Farmers’ Deposit Bank and demand restitution, but that right depends on one thing, and that is on the fact of the actual acceptance of this check previously. [The defendant had until one o’clock to accept it, and did it absolutely and unconditionally accept the check before that time ? The mark on the face of it, the entries on the books, would indicate it did.] 10 The testimony of the officers as to their actual intent at the time, so far as they had any intent, and as to the ordinary practice of the bank, is that they did not intend to, and did not in fact pay it; that because this was a check coming from the clearing house they in this case, as in all others, whatever they may have done with the check in the meantime, received it merely conditionally and accepted it conditionally; that it became necessary to make certain entries with reference to it because of the necessity of doing their bookkeeping in banking hours, for if they put off making them until after one o’clock, with the large amount of checks that came from the clearinghouse, they could not possibly get their business crowded into the business hours of the day ; that therefore they commenced treating checks as though they had accepted them, at the same time the acceptance being merely on the condition that nothing would occur before the hour that they could return them, and, keeping them in that shape, they always reserved and intended to reserve the right to return checks in case it turned out they were not good, up to the hour limited. If you find that to be the fact I instruct you your verdict must be for the defendant. Tf you find in reference to the guarantee that the defendant simply guaranteed there was a hole in the check, or that the guarantee meant something else, nobody could tell what, you find for the defendant. But if you think it meant something, and that something was a responsibility on the part of the defendant bank to make good this check that had been paid, when it was represented not to be paid, the question is was it paid — paid to all intents and purposes by the understanding and acts of the defendant.</p>

They are substantially as. follows: On May 24, 1884, the Germania Savings Bank drew and delivered to the Penn Bank a check on the German National Bank for $20,000. The Farmers’ Deposit National Bank and the German National Bank were members of the clearing house. The Perm Bank was not, but was represented'therein by the Farmers’ Deposit National Bank as its agent. For- the purpose of collecting said check through the clearing house, the Penn Bank indorsed it: “ For deposit, Clearing House, May 26, 1884; Penn Bank, Pittsburgh, C. F. M’Combs, A. Teller,” and deposited -it with the Farmers’ Deposit National Bank. The <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>check was sent through the clearing house on May 26th in the usual manner, and the Farmers’ Deposit National received credit at the clearing house for the amount thereof. The check was then sent in the usual course of business to the German National Bank upon which it was drawn, where the envelope containing it was opened by C. Van Burén, Jr., for the teller, who examined it, and placed it upon file. Shortly after this, John E. Wessler, the assistant teller, took it off the file, and entered it in the journal, but it was not then, nor has it ever been, posted in the ledger. This was on May 26th. On the same day the Penn Bank failed, and closed its doors a little after twelve o’clock. The Germania Savings Bank hearing of this, and having, it is alleged, a defence to the check as against the Penn Bank, immediately notified the German National Bank to stop payment. On receipt of this notice, the German National Bank cancelled the entry on its journal, and handed the check to its messenger, with instructions to return it to the Farmers’ Deposit National Bank, where it was presented before one o’clock, with the information that payment had been stopped, and a demand was made upon the latter bank for the money. The messenger was requested by the teller of the latter bank to guarantee the cut (made' by the file), whereupon the messenger wrote on the back of the check the words: “Cut guaranteed, O. C. Bergdorf, messenger.” Whereupon the check was accepted, charged back to the account of the Penn Bank, and a teller’s check for the amount given to the German National Bank, which was duly paid through the clearing house next day. The Farmers’ Deposit National Bank held the check, as already stated, for the mere purpose of collection, as agent of the Penn Bank. There is nothing in the case to show if it ever asked the German National Bank whether it had accepted it, or would accept it; that it had any knowledge that the check had been on file (except what the cut would imply), or entered upon any book of the German National Bank; nor that it was induced to give credit or change its position in any way by any action taken by said bank. The Penn Bank never resumed business, and, on May 28th, made an assignment to Henry Warner, who sometime afterward notified the Farmers’ Deposit National Bank that he held it responsible for the amount of the check.</p>

    <p id="b331-3" data-blocks='[["BL_331.4",331,[177,839,1179,92]]]'>Thé course of business in the clearing house, as I gather it from the uncontradicted evidence, is as follows:</p>
    <p id="b331-4" data-blocks='[["BL_331.5",331,[175,944,1182,1491]],["BL_332.1",332,[247,360,1179,909]]]'>The association is composed of nineteen different banks. At half-past nine each morning, each bank sends a clerk and a messenger to the clearing house with all the checks received by it on the previous day on the other banks, the checks on each particular bank being placed in a separate envelope. The checks are then examined, and a balance struck. If a bank is a debtor bank, it is required to pay the amount of its indebtedness to the clearing house before 11:80 of the same day in money. If a creditor bank, it receives its balance from the clearing house from half-past eleven to twelve o’clock. When the checks are assorted, all the checks on any one bank are placed in an envelope and handed to the clerk or messenger of that bank, with a memorandum, stating whether it is a creditor or a debtor bank, and the amount of such debit or credit. If a debtor, this bank then makes up a package of money, corresponding with the amount it owes, and sends it to the clearing house before 11:30 A. m. as before stated. If a creditor, it sends to the same place before 12 o’clock and gets its money. When the checks are returned by the clearing house to the banks upon which they are respectively drawn, the latter have until one o’clock in which to correct mistakes. If there are no funds to meet a particular check; if payment has been stopped, or if from any reason the bank (Jeclines to pay it, the rule of the clearing house above cited, and the practice under it allows the bank until one o’clock to return it to the bank from whence it came. If not returned before that hour, the bank is fixed absolutely for the check. There appears to be no uniform practice on the part of the banks composing the Clearing House Association as to the time of entering <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>on their books the checks received from said association. Some defer entering them until after one o’clock, when the time for the correction of errors has passed. Others place them on file, and enter them immediately. This was done by the German National Bank, defendant, with the check in question. It was put on the file, a spear-shaped instrument, which makes a cut in the check, and was then entered in the journal, but it was not carried forward to the ledger. The officers of the, bank, however, testified that this was done for the convenient transaction of its business; that to defer all such entries until after one o’clock would prevent the bank getting through its business during banking hours ; that the placing it on file, and entering it on the journal was only a conditional acceptance, subject to be revoked for cause at' any time before one o’clock. As to the right of a bank to return a check before one o’clock received from the clearing house, there can be no ’ question. The evidence upon this point was overwhelming, and I believe uncontradicted.</p>
    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[244,1286,1181,1120]],["BL_333.1",333,[173,360,1176,94]]]'>Under these circumstances what are the legal rights of the parties to this suit? As before observed, the Farmers’ Deposit National Bank, plaintiff below, had no interest in this check. It was merely the agent for collection of the Penn Bank. When the check was returned to it from the defendant bank, and it was notified that payment had been stopped, it received said check, and gave that bank a teller’s check for the amount. It gave the latter check for the reason, I presume, that it had received a credit therefor that morning at the clearing house. It then charged the check in question back to the Penn Bank, and sent the check itself to that bank. The surrender of the check was voluntary, and there is no evidence that it was procured by any fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the German National Bank. Under these circumstances I am unable to see what claim the plaintiff bank has upon the latter. It has no interest in the check or the money which it represents. It is not a dollar out of pocket, and a recovery in this suit would add $20,000 to its assets, for which it paid nothing, unless, as I assume to be the case, this suit is for the benefit of the Penn Bank. This would enable the latter to do indirectly what it could not do directly, viz.: to avoid a contest with the drawer of the check and recover, <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>or at least attempt to recover, from the drawee. It is the voice of Jacob, but it is the hand of Esau.</p>
    <p id="b333-3" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[172,464,1181,294]]]'>As I understand the case there are but two principles involved, viz.: <em>(a) </em>had the Germania Savings Bank the right to stop payment on the check, and (5) if so, was the right exercised in time, that is to say, before actual payment ? All other material questions in the case are but subdivisions of these.</p>
    <p id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[173,775,1180,404]]]'>I presume no one at this day questions the right of the drawer of a check to stop the payment thereof. This is usually done by notice to the bank upon which the check is drawn. If the bank pay after such notice it does so at its peril. The holder of a check has no remedy against a bank upon which a check is drawn for its refusal to pay it. He must look to the drawer. The right to stop payment ceases of course with actual payment.</p>
    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.6",333,[173,1188,1183,1229]],["BL_334.1",334,[261,367,1180,301]]]'>The case then narrows itself down to the single point, was the check paid when notice was given the German National Bank not to pay it ? The plaintiff contends that it was, and points to the “cut” on the check and the entry in the journal of the German National Bank as evidence of that fact. We may say just here that a vast amount of time was wasted on the trial in the court below over the meaning of the words “ Cut guaranteed.” They are of little importance in our view of the case. This is not a suit upon the guaranty, and its meaning is only indirectly involved. The existence of the “cut” was a circumstance that had some bearing, as it showed in connection with other testimony that the check had been on a file where paid checks are usually placed. But there is no magic in a file-cut or in an entry in a journal. Both required explanation and that was fully given. The “ cut ” and the entry on the journal, if the uncontradicted evidence is to be believed, were made for the convenience of the defendant bank. Together they perhaps constituted a conditional acceptance of the check, subject to the right of the bank under the rules of the clearing house to revoke it and return the check before one o’clock. It cannot be seriously questioned that had the defendant bank pigeon-holed the check instead of placing it on file, it would have had the right to return it before one o’clock. And can it make any difference that for its <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>uwn convenience and to expedite business it entered the check from the clearing house as soon as received ? It had until one o’clock to correct any errors, and I am unable to see upon what principle or what reason the plaintiff bank could have refused to receive the check, with the “ Cut guaranteed,” when offered at any time before that hour.</p>
    <p id="b334-4" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[253,676,1185,858]]]'>It may be that had the check been passed over the counter, or received by the defendant bank outside of the clearing house, the rulings of the- court below would have been ade■quaté. But we do. not think sufficient weight was given to the regulations of the clearing house. As between it and its ^associated banks its rules have the force of law. It is a law to them because they have made it so. One plain object of the rule in question was to give the banks until one o’clock to corTect any mistakes, and return checks that for any reason they declined to pay. The clearing house could not exist for a week without some such regulation. And in the face of this rule, the placing of a check on file and even entering it on the journal is not per se payment. It becomes so after one o’clock, if the check is not returned to the bank depositing it before that liour. This is the plain construction of the rule, and the court helow would have been justified in nonsuiting the plaintiff at the close of its case.</p>
