H. iron instead of flange iron: “I said, if the boiler we had at our place was as good as the one described in the Heathcote proposition, I would take it; if it was as good as the boiler we were to have. He said it was as good a boiler. .... He said it would carry 120 lbs. of steam.....He said he would guarantee tins boiler equal in every respect to the one I was to have.” Mr. Selden, in behalf of defendants, testified, inter alia: “ Q. When did you first know of the Heathcote proposition? A. I never heard of it until after the explosion occurred.” Afterwards, the defendant company put in evidence a letter from their agent, Mr. Shearman, written before the boiler was ordered, stating to Selden that they must get below Heathcote’s proposition to sell the boiler at all. Mr. Selden, referring to the interview with Mr. Barber, further testified: “ I furthermore said to him that I considered C. H. No. 1 iron fully as good in the shell of a boiler of that kind as flange iron and in some respects better..... I said materially that it was as good for the purpose as flange iron.” On cross-examination: “Q. Have you no reason why C. H. No. 1 should be more suitable in boilers fired the other way, fire in contact with shell? A. Yes, I do know one reason — I know C. H. iron is a lower grade of iron; it should be a stronger boiler, fired as P. M. Barber &amp; Co.’s was.....Q. I ask you whether, in your judgment, C. H. No. 1 iron is the proper iron to use in the construction of a boiler to be used next the fire ? A. I can only answer that by saying that there is a great difference of opinion. I did not say it. I do not think it ought to be used ordinarily.” In the reports of this cause hereinbefore referred to, the facts are more fully stated.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b31-4" data-blocks='[["BL_31.4",31,[160,514,1181,458]]]'>This boiler was sent to the plaintiffs, and they heard that it was not what they ordered and refused to receive it. Mr. Selden, the president of the Erie City Iron Works, who made the boiler, then had an interview with Mr. Barber, one of the plaintiffs, and admitted that it was not made in accordance with the order sent to them, yet he made certain representations to Mr. Barber which induced his firm to accept the boiler. These representations it is contended were untrue, and it is for this deceit that this action is brought.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b31-5" data-blocks='[["BL_31.5",31,[160,979,1182,861]]]'>In order to make the president liable for a false representar tion it is not absolutely necessary to show that he knew as a fact what he stated was false; if he made a representation not knowing it to be true or without reasonable or probable grounds on which to suppose it .to be true, he acted fraudulently. When a man having no knowledge whatever on a subject, takes it upon himself to represent' a certain state of facts as existing, he does so at his peril; and if it be done either to secure some benefit to himself or to deceive another he is guilty of fraud. By assuming to have knowledge of a material fact when he is conscious he has not, and representing it as of his own knowledge when he has,no knowledge, he commits a moral wrong similar in character as if he knew the representation to be untrue. The fraudulent purpose is essential in an action for deceit and it cannot be maintained on a false representation believed to be true which is based on adequate information.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b31-6" data-blocks='[["BL_31.6",31,[162,1858,1182,599]]]'>That Mr. Selden, the president of the company, represented that C. H. No. 1 iron was fully equal to flange for the purpose for which it was intended, to be put in the shell of a boiler, is not denied. On the contrary it is contended by the company that the .statement is true. The testimony, however, is conflicting as to that, and you must decide- whether it is true or not. If it was true the plaintiff has no cause to complain on that point. If you find it was not true, then if Mr. Selden knew it was false, or if he asserted it recklessly not knowing it to be true and without reasonable ground to suppose it was, in order to induce the plaintiff to accept it, he would be guilty of fraud.</p>

      <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>The plaintiffs also contend that Mr. Barber required of Mr. Selden, at the time Mr. Selden made the representation to him, that the boiler was to be as good as that described in the Heath-cote contract, which called for three eighths inch iron, and that he said to Mr. Selden if it was as good as described in the Heathcote contract I shall be satisfied. Mr. Selden’s representation, the plaintiffs therefore contend, applied to the thickness of the iron as well as to the question of flange and C. H. No. 1 iron. This Mr. Selden denies. He says he referred only to the stub order, which it appears does not refer to the thickness of the iron. You will therefore have to determine whether the representation of Mr. Selden referred to that point, the thickness of the iron, or not. If he did refer to that point and knew it was false, or recklessly asserted it not knowing it to be true, and without reasonable ground, he would be guilty of fraud.</p>

In the height of special pleading, when justice was. frequently a secondary consideration, there was a conflict in the rulings as to what constituted misjoinder.

The defendants’ contention is, that the amendment should not have been allowed as, in so doing, there was a misjoinder of counts and a change in the cause of action. Both of the objections were- considered by this court when the case was here before: <a href="/pa/102/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="102 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="502668" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0156-01">102 Pa. 156</a>, and as the question is in no respect differently presented now, it may be considered as having been fully decided in our former rulings. It is proper, how<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>ever, in view of the very learned, and. able argument now made, to state more fully the grounds upon which these rulings were made.</p>
    <p id="b37-4" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[174,504,1183,1119]]]'>The action was in case. In the third count of the declaration it is charged that the defendants undertook for a certain consideration to construct for the plaintiffs, of flange iron, a boiler of certain quality and dimensions; that they did construct a boiler of different iron,which they “ falsely and maliciously represented ” to the plaintiffs was in every respect as strong and as -good as the boiler they contracted to make; that it would carry 120 pounds of steam, etc.; that the plaintiffs relying on these representations accepted the said boiler and set it up in their mill, but that the boiler being of worthless iron was not of the quality represented, -and in consequence thereof afterwards, exploded, thereby-causing the loss for which this suit is brought. The plaintiffs’ purpose in this case without doubt was to declare in tort for the- damages sustained through the defendants’ “false and malicious ” representations as to the quality and capacity of the boiler. The declaration was doubtless defective ; it may -be that it set forth no sufficient cause of action, in any of the counts, but as an action in tort was certainly in contemplation, and the plea of not guilty was entered by the defendants, it_was the duty of the court, if the cause of action was not changed, to entertain a motion to amend.</p>
    <p id="b37-5" data-blocks='[["BL_37.5",37,[174,1641,1183,762]],["BL_38.1",38,[277,360,1182,1373]]]'>The cause of action is the particular matter for which the suit is brought, and when the object of an amendment is not to forsake this, but to adhere to it, and effect a recovery upon it, it is the duty of the court, when the merits of the case cannot otherwise be reached, to permit the amendment: Rodrigue v. Curcier, 15 S. &amp; R. 81. “For example,” said this court in the case cited, “ the plaintiff declares on an indebitatus assumpsit for goods sold and delivered; but finding on the trial he is disappointed on the evidence, he asks permission to add a count on a quantum meruit. The amendment should be allowed, because the substance of the action was the value of the goods sold and delivered. It may be said that this is introducing a different contract from that set out in the declaration ; and true, in form, it is; but the injury done to the plaintiff is-the non-payment for goods sold by them to the de<a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>fendant, and the additional count is only for the purpose of recovering damages for that injury. So in an action on a policy of insurance, when the plaintiff declared on losses by capture by an enemy and perils of the sea, the court permitted an amendment, by adding a count for loss by barratry. This might be called a new cause of action, but it adhered to the policy by which the defendants engaged to indemnify the plaintiff from loss by barratry, as well as by capture and perils at sea. The object of the action was to recover for a loss covered by the policy, and this amendment, not going out of the policy, was admitted.” Therefore, it was held, in an action of slander, where the words spoken were so defectively set forth as not to be actionable, that the declaration might be amended by setting out a good cause of action, provided the words substituted import a charge generally the same: Proper v. Luce, <a href="/pen-w/3/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 65" data-case-ids="1827659" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0065-01">3 P. &amp; W. 65</a>. The cardinal rule, adhered to in all cases, is that the amendment must not introduce a cause of action substantially different: Knapp v.

Smith, <a href="/pa/45/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="45 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="9503267" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0403-01">45 Pa. 403</a>. See also Trego v.

The action, as we have said, was in deceit ; the express warranty set forth in the new counts, as we said when the case was here before, was averred by way of inducement merely, or rather as one of the means by which the fraud was made effective. If it had been declared upon as the subject matter of the suit, such an amendment would have been rightly refused, but it was proper to aver it, as one of the acts or declarations of the defendants in connection with the <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>alleged, fraud. At the special request of the defendants’ counsel, the jurors were plainly instructed there could be no recovery on any warranty or contract between the parties, express or implied; that the only ground of recovery was the fraud of Selden, in his interview with Barber. They were further instructed in substance, that the evidence must satisfy them, that the statements made by Selden were false, and that he knew them to be false, or that he asserted them to be true, Avithout any reasonable or probable grounds for believing them to be so, in either case, intending to deceive and defraud tbe plaintiff.

His testimony on this subject was inconsistent and to some extent contradictory, and, apart from all the other evidence in the cause, the inference stated might well be deduced therefrom. The eighth assignment of error is based upon the refusal of a point which was not stated in accordance with the facts. Selden’s statements, as proved, contained much more that was material than a comparison between flange iron and C. H. No. 1. If Mr. Barber is believed, Selden knew of the Heathcote proposition at the time these statements were made, and in view of all the evidence on the subject, we think there was a question of fact for the jury as to what order he referred.</p>
