Among the conditions of the policy were the following: “ This company will not be liable by virtue of this policy or any renewal thereof until the premium therefor be actually paid.” . . . “ It is further understood and made part of this contract that the agent of this company has no authority to waive, modify or strike from this policy any of its printed conditions.”</p>

Shortly, afterwards, these companies canceled the policies. Mr. Con<a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>way, who surrendered them for the plaintiff, received the unearned portion of the premiums thereon, amounting to $105, and was to replace insurance in other companies. He then negotiated with John D. Biggert, at this time the general agent in this state of the Western Assurance Co. of Toronto, Canada, as well as its local agent in Pittsburgh, representing also the Phoenix Insurance Co., of London, who placed $1,500 of the insurance with the defendant company and $1,500 with the Phoenix company at 6 per cent, premium. When the two policies were received by Mr. Biggert he handed them over to Mr. Conway for the plaintiff. At that time Mr. Conway offered to pay the $90 premium upon one of the policies out of the plaintiff’s money still in his hands, but it was arranged that Mr. Biggert would wait a short time so as to receive the premiums on both policies at once. In a few days the Phoenix company canceled its policy and returned it to Mr. Biggert, thus leaving only the policy of the defendant company.</p>

His report for October, 1883, embraced the plaintiff’s policy, and in November following he transmitted to defendant company about $2,800, representing the premiums upon the policies in his October report, which sum included $90 for the premium on plaintiff’s policy. On November 6, 1883, a few days before the sending of this remittance, the property insured was destroyed by fire. Mr. Biggert did not notify the company of the fire when he sent the remittance. He testified that it was by an oversight that he had included the $90 premium on the plaintiff’s policy in his October report and November remittance, and that the premium had never been paid to him. In December, 1883, Mr. Conway tendered the premium to Mr. Biggert who refused it.</p>

On or about November 21,1883, proofs of loss were made out and submitted to a Dr. Thorn, appointed by Mr. Biggert to investigate the circumstances and to adjust the loss. Exceptions were made to the proofs furnished; one was that the certificate of the nearest magistrate was not attached, the other called the attention of the plaintiff to the fact that the adjuster had been informed the premium had never been paid, asking an explanation why it was not paid and on what ground a waiver was asked for. A new set of proofs was supplied meeting the objections suggested, but containing no explanation or reference to the nonpayment of the premium.</p>

The defence was the non-payment of the premium. The important question raised by the assignments of error is, whether there was evidence upon this subject that should go to the jury. The facts were not involved in controversy and are as follows: Speer, acting for the plaintiff, applied to Conway, an insurance broker and solicitor of risks, for insurance upon the plaintiff’s property. Conway took the risks to Biggert, who was an insurance agent and the general agent in Pennsylvania for the defendant company, to be placed in suitable companies. As general agent he placed $1,500 of the amount desired in the defendant company and countersigned and delivered a policy therefor. Conway had $105 of the plaintiff’s money in his hands, with instructions to use it for paying premiums on policies of insurance. He communicated this fact to Biggert, and offered to pay the premium on this policy amounting to $90, but Biggert, who was negotiating for another policy of like amount upon the same property, said it might just as well remain in the hands of Conway until the other policy was obtained, when both could be paid for at the same time. The premium was then charged on Biggert’s books to Conway, in whose hands he knew the money to be, and the <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>company defendant was credited with it. In due course of business he remitted it to the company, in whose hands it remained until after this suit was brought.</p>
    <p id="b440-5" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[250,519,1180,764]]]'>This is not therefore the case of one who attempts to secure the benefit of insurance without the payment of the premium; for the money with which to pay it had left the hands of the assured and been placed in those of the broker before the policy was obtained. The real question is whether the assured, notwithstanding the payment of the money by and the delivering of the policy to him, is to lose the benefit of his contract by reason of the course of dealing between the intermediate agents. Speer had paid to Conway the broker; Conway had offered the money to Biggert, the general agent of the defendant; Biggert had charged it up to Conway and paid his principal in the ordinary course of his business ; the policy had been delivered. What remained to be done except for Biggert and Conway to settle the transaction between themselves, which each had in effect settled with his principal ?</p>
    <p id="b440-6" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[249,1291,1180,908]]]'>We are decidedly of opinion that upon this state of facts the question of payment was for the jury. It was not a question whether the adjuster had waived or could waive a condition in the policy, nor whether Biggert, the general agent, had power to change the terms or conditions of insurance; but whether there was actual payment. As to the assured, there was no doubt, for it was admitted, that the money had left Speer’s hands for this very purpose. As to the insurer, there was the fact that the money had been actually paid in the usual way by Biggert and received without objection. The open question was over the credit given by Biggert to Conway. If this had been given in the usual manner, making Conway his debtor for the amount which he paid for him to defendant, the jury would have been fully justified in finding the fact that the premium was paid. This was for the jury. The giving of a binding instruction to find for the defendant was therefore error, and for this the case must go back for another trial.</p>
