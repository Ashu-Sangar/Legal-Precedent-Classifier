Where there is an antecedent'absolute gift independent of the direction and time of payment, the legacy is vested; but where there is no substantive gift and it is only implied from the direction to pay, the legacy is contingent, unless from partic<a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>ular circumstances or the whole face of the will a contrary intention is to be collected.” In general where a legacy is given for an object which fails the legacy will be lapsed; as where a sum of money is given to an infant for the purpose of binding him apprentice, and he dies before the proper age.

And it is to be noted that there is not in this will the faintest trace of an intent in case of the death of any of the grandchildren before the expiration of the twelve years, to give the shares of those so dying to the survivors. The share of a grandchild that shall “have died” is to go to his “heirs.” It is contended that the words “have died” refer to the period of distribution.

In Mull v. Mull, <a href="/pa/81/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="81 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="1044104" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0393-01">81 Pa. 393</a>, where the testator directed a sum of money to be “ equally divided <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>among all my children or their legal heirs,” this court held that the words. “ or their legal heirs ” were used not to individuate grandchildren, but to supply a legal succession in the event of the death of any one, and meant simply legal representatives.</p>
    <p id="b242-6" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[257,550,1181,507]]]'>The gift of a legacy under the form of a direction to pay at a future time, or upon a future event, is not less favorable to vesting than a simple and direct bequest of a legacy at a like future time or upon a like event. The question is one of substance and not of form, and in all cases it is whether the testator intended it as a condition precedent that the legatees should survive the time appointed by him for the payment of their legacies; and the answer to this question must be sought for out of the whole will, and not in the particular expressions in which the gift is made: Leeming v. Sherratt, 2 Hare 14.</p>
    <p id="b242-7" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[257,1065,1177,303]]]'>It was urged, however, that the words in the Avill — “ but neither principal nor interest shall be liable to attachment ”— coupled with the trust, indicate that the postponement of the gift was on account of the character of the donees, and an indication of an intent that the legacies should not vest until the expiration of the twelve years.</p>
    <p id="b242-8" data-blocks='[["BL_242.6",242,[248,1376,1184,1021]],["BL_243.1",243,[175,348,1178,93]]]'>There is some force in this, but we do not think it sufficient to prevent the vesting of the legacies. It is at least doubtful, from a reading of the entire will, whether the testator had not in his mind the convenience of his estate rather than the character of the donees when he directed the postponement of the payment of the principal. And while it is true as a general rule, as before observed, that where the time or other condition is annexed to the substance of the gift and not merely to the payment, the legacy is contingent, yet it is equally true that a well-recognized exception to the rule is, that when interest, whether by way of maintenance or otherwise, is given to the legatee in the meantime, the legacy shall, notwithstanding the gift appears to be postponed, vest immediately on the death of the testator. This circumstance indicates an intention that the beneficial enjoyment shall begin at once, and payment only of the principal or capital be postponed. When a legacy is given by a direction to pay when the legatee attains a certain age, the direction to pay may import either a gift at the specified age or a present gift with a postponed payment; and if the interest is ,given in the meantime, it shows that a present gift <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>was intended: Provenchere’s App., <a href="/pa/67/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="67 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="1022478" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0463-01">67 Pa. 463</a>; In re Hart’s Trusts, 3 DeG. <em>&amp; </em>Jones, 195.</p>
    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[174,452,1178,355]]]'>While this is a close case, and not by any means free from doubt, we are of opinion that the testator intended to giye each of his grandchildren a vested interest in the one ninth share referred to, and that distribution must be made to the personal representatives of such as are deceased. And were it even more doubtful than it is, we would be constrained, by the rule above referred to, to resolve the doubt in favor of vesting.</p>
    <p id="b243-6" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[438,815,914,145]]]'>The decree is reversed at the costs of. the appellees, and distribution ordered in accordance with this opinion.</p>
