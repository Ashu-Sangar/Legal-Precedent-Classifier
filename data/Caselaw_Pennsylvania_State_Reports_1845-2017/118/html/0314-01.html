If it had occurred afterward, and was simply a promise on the part of <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>the defendant company, not to permit liquor to be sold there, •and without any consideration to support it, it would not be binding; but if agreed to before the lease was signed, and if the plaintiff was induced to sign this lease because of this verbal, contemporary arrangement, then it would. Upon that point we have the testimony of the plaintiff himself, with that of two or three other witnesses, and if that evidence is believed by you, it indicates that after the agreement was drawn up in the office of the counsel, with these two or three representatives of the defendant company present, the plaintiff called attention to it and the agents then and there promised that they would not permit liquor to be sold in this adjoining room, and that after the arrangement was made, then the lease was signed, and the general agent of the company, according to the testimony of one witness, said to the agent who resided here “we must protect McCann in the business under the lease.” If you believe that testimony it shows a cotemporary verbal agreement in connection with the written agreement, made at the time and before the lease was signed, as a part of the arrangement between the parties, and which, as I have said, would be binding upon the defendant company. Now, was that agreement broken by the defendant company ?</p>

At first it was rented to a Mr. Brown from whom Mrs. Reineman bought the lease about the middle of March, 1885. Then it was simply an eating house, as I understand, without the sale of any liquor, although the plaintiff testified that shortly after he commenced he went in there to see Mr. Brown, having heard that he had been selling liquor, and that he promised to give it up, and, so far as the evidence goes, there is nothing to show that he did sell it after that time, and no evidence that Mrs. Reineman sold it until after she obtained her license, May 1, 1885, when she got possession of the adjoining room and then began to sell it in the little bar room which she rented, and also in the room that she rented from defendant company, which room was used more particularly as a dining-room; that she sold liquors there, not only in connection with meals, but <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>apart from them, and the evidence is that the plaintiff called upon the defendant’s agents here and also wrote to the company remonstrating against it, and that no attention was paid to it. If you believe that testimony, and believe that liquors were sold there regularly, it is a violation of this verbal agreement.</p>

The burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to establish his damage. He gave a statement of his receipts during the first sixty-four weeks he was in business there, which would extend from some time in September, 1883, until about January 1, 1885. He stated that his receipts during that time were some fifteen thousand dollars. He then showed his receipts for the next sixty-five weeks, which would be from January 1,1885, to April 1,1886, a year and three months; and during that period, which was one week longer than the other, his sales were some ten thousand dollars* or a difference of some five thousand dollars. That estimate I do not think is entitled to much consideration by the jury, for this reason: There is no specific statement as to what his decrease of business was between January and May, 1885. During that time, according to the testimony, he could not have been injured by sales in this adjoining room, because there were none, but his business was decreased according to the evidence given by himself, and as to the amount of that decrease we have no evidence, nor have we evidence as to the subsequent months compared with the prior months. He said that for some months in 1885 the receipts were less than in 1884, and in some months more; but aggregating the receipts for the whole period of time, some fifteen months, embracing four months before Mrs. Reineman took possession, his losses were so much in business; but it does not follow, by any means, that that decrease in business was the resnlt to that extent of sales in this adjoining room; especially it does not follow as to his losses for the four months prior to the time that Mrs. Reineman began to sell. There must have been some other cause for it. He testifies that, comparing May, 1885, with May, 1884, his losses in sales were about three hundred dollars. How much of that resulted from sales taking place in this room we do not know because there appears to have been a decrease in-his business from some <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>other cause. But you have other evidence; you have evidence that from the time Mrs. Reineman commenced selling in May, 1885, until March, 1886, a period of ten months, she was selling liquor, not only in the bar-room (an extra room that she rented from another party), but that was used in connection with her saloon — the room she rented from the defendant company — and that liquors were sold there, as well as in the barroom ; parties would come in there for liquors, sit down at a table in that room, and be waited upon there just the same as in the bar-room, and the waiter said he supposed that every day or nearly every day during that ten months, liquors were sold there. Now, to what extent they were sold, we have no further evidence than the testimony of various witnesses that they drank liquor there. How much was sold we do not know; how much it interfered with the plaintiff’s business is a matter of uncertainty. It is very natural to infer that if there was a saloon open next door to the plaintiff’s saloon, and one door nearer to the “show” as they call it — the- Academy of Music — that it would draw off some custom from the saloon of the plaintiff; that people would naturally drop into the first door they came to, and as many of the persons who go to those musical entertainments want to drink every time they come to a stop in the performance, they would naturally get their drink quickly and hurry back to the hall, and it may be inferred that the plaintiff lost money in Ms trade and business in consequence of there being a saloon one door nearer than his own to the entrance of the Academy. To what extent that injured his business you must ascertain in the best way you can from the evidence. This is a violation of the agreement made by the defendant company, if you find the agreement as I have indicated, and even if there was no damage shown, the plamtiff would be entitled to nominal damages for that violation; [but there is evidence to go beyond nominal damages].1 We have this testimony on the part of the plaintiff, that about one half of all the money realized from the sale of beer is clear profit. The brewer gets the big profit, and then the saloon keeper gets a clear profit of one half the money he takes in. [It is for the jury to make an estimate as best you can under the evidence, as to what damage the plaintiff sustained through the violation of that arrangement.]a</p>

If we inquire, then, where is the evidence to warrant a recovery for more than nominal damages, it must be found, if at all, in the testimony of plaintiff and four other witnesses. Yet, the court said: “ To what extent liquors were sold [in the adjoining saloon], we have no further evidence than the testimony of the various witnesses that they drank liquor there.

In many contracts the parties fix the measure; in others, the contract furnishes no standard. No general rule can be prescribed. While speculative damages may not be allowed, yet there are many cases in which a plaintiff has been held entitled to the reasonable profits he would have made had the contract been fulfilled, because such profits are considered as in the immediate contemplation of the parties when the contract is made: Hoy v.

    <p id="b340-6" data-blocks='[["BL_340.7",340,[239,1054,1180,1125]]]'>McCann leased a room for the sale of liquors from the plaintiff company with the agreement that he should purchase his beer from the company, and that the company should not permit the sale of liquors in the adjoining store controlled by them and situated between his store and the entrance to the Academy of Music. During most of the last year of his lease liquors were sold openly and regularly in the adjoining store occupied by Mrs. Reineman, a tenant of the Brewing Company. The plaintiff alleged that his business was sensibly diminished by the sales made by Mrs. Reineman, and this action was brought to recover damages for the breach in this particular of the contract between himself and the Brewing Company. He testified that his business during the last fifteen. months of his lease fell below that of the preceding fifteen months by 14,041.85, and that his profits after deducting all expenses would be one half his gross sales. He says that he noticed a material decrease in his sales of liquors after the sale began in the store of Mrs. Reineman.

While it is true that this testimony does not furnish the data for an exact calculation of the damages sustained by McCann, it is also true that the court would not have been justified in withdrawing it from the jury by an instruction that the plaintiff was entitled only to nominal damages. He had suffered a very considerable loss, as his books clearly showed. The continuous sale of drink in the room between his own and the entrance to tiie theatre afforded one reason and an adequate reason for -the falling off in his own business.
