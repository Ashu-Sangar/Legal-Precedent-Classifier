I have declined to so decide. It ought to be a very plain case that would justify a lower court in such a decision as that. In any case of doubt it is our duty rather to sustain the acts of the legislature and allow the Supreme Court to pass upon them. Another position taken by the defendant is that there never was any subscription made; that there is not sufficient evidence to show that Mr. Sutton ever made any subscription at all. I think if the jury believe the evidence in the case, it is sufficient to justify them in finding that Mr. Sutton did agree to take twenty shares of the stock. Then it is urged that there is no evidence that the stock was ever transferred to the firm, no transfer on the books of the company, and counsel contends that there could be no transfer whatever of the stock until it was fully paid up, and that even then it could only be transferred on the books of the company. I decline to sustain those positions. [If the defendant, Jacob Weinman, knew that there was a subscription of twenty shares of stock made by his partner, and if the partner requested it to be placed in the name of the firm, and Jacob Weinman was present when that request was made in the meeting of the board of directors, and assented to it and agreed to act as a director in place of his partner, and did so act, and afterwards paid the first call; participated as a director for some time; recognized his liability for these calls as they were made, it is sufficient to show that there was an equitable transfer of the stock to the firm and the firm became liable to pay the calls when made properly.]5 Another position taken is that the <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>transferee of the stock is not liable for the payment of future calls upon the stock. Counsel has read some decisions of the Supreme Court to the effect that a stockholder in an incorporated company who transfers his stock is still liable himself for the unpaid subscriptions; that the transferee is not liable unless there is some statute making him so, or unless he promises to pay. Perhaps that may be true when there is the naked transfer of the stock and nothing done by the transferee in the way of making himself liable or accepting the' position of taking the stock subject to future calls. Where, however, he takes the transfer with that understanding and agreement, that he is to pay the future calls, and acts upon that and so holds himself out to the company, unquestionably he would be liable, even without an express promise to pay. If in pursuance of that transfer the company accept him as the owner of the stock and he participates in the management of the company, especially if he act as a director and assists in making calls he would become liable to future assessments and especially if he promise to pay the calls. [Defendant’s counsel also claims that these calls were never legally made according to the act of the assembly under which the company was incorporated. It is evident that they were not made in strict compliance with the law. The law says that assessments shall be made not exceeding five dollars per share in any period of thirty days. It is not clear whether that means that no assessment at any time should be made exceeding five dollars a share, or whether it simply means that taking the average the assessments shall not exceed five dollars in thirty days ; but in either view of the case some of these assessments were not in strict conformity to the law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[227,1908,1182,508]],["BL_218.1",218,[225,346,1180,610]]]'>The assessment for 15 per cent, was made on July 16th, when Mr. Weinman was present; that would be $7.50 per share, which would exceed that limit, and the previous assessment of 10 per cent, had been made thirty days before that; but at all events he would be estopped from denying the validity of that act, for he was present at that time. The next assessment, on October 15th, was for 25 per cent., which was $12.50 per share, which, I think, would come within the construction of the act. The next assessment, however, was made a month after that, and that was for 50 per cent. That, I think, could <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>not be construed as a proper assessment, or one strictly in accordance with the act. But the point is whether the defendant can raise that question, if he was a director of the company from April, 1884, until April, 1886, and knew of the action of the board authorizing the president to make these calls; if he received notice of them and never objected to it, never resigned his position as a director, but retained it until the new election in April, 1886, and when called upon to pay, not only did not deny his liability for these calls, but expressly promised to pay — I say if these are the facts, he is now es-topped from raising a question as to the validity of these calls.] 6</p>

The attention of the court has been called to the fact that at the October meeting, when this authority was given to the president, there was no <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>quorum present.

It was impossible that the defendant should be a member for the purpose of participating at business meetings and acting as director, and not be a member for the purpose of paying for his stock. The argument as to the alleged irregularity of the assignment can have no weight. The defendant was estopped by his conduct from averring that the transfer had not been made as prescribed in the act: Bavington v.

The ownership of shares of stock carries with it the legal duty of paying all legitimate calls made during the continuance of the ownership.

    <p id="b221-7" data-blocks='[["BL_221.7",221,[168,1296,1184,301]]]'>The assignments of error raise two questions for consideration. The first of these relates to the constitutionality of the act of assembly under which the defendant claims to exercise the powers of a corporation. The second is over the sufficiency of the alleged undertaking to pay, upon which the suit is brought.</p>
    <p id="b221-8" data-blocks='[["BL_221.8",221,[165,1605,1188,818]],["BL_222.1",222,[250,358,1184,149]]]'>The- title of the act of 1879, under which the defendant company was organized, is as follows : “ An act to provide for the incorporation and for the government and regulation of street railway companies now incorporated, or which may hereafter be incorporated in cities of the second and third class in this commonwealth.” Its provisions follow the title, and relate only to the incorporation, government and regulation of street railway companies in cities of the second and third class. The-subject of this statute is therefore street railway companies, which is a subject for general legislation; while the statute professes to deal only with a limited number of these railways, and these are selected by reference to their location in certain cities. Under the guise of a general law we have here one winch is special, because it relates to a few members of the general class of corporations known as street railway companies ; and local because its operations are confined to particu<a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>lar localities, viz., cities of the second and third class. The provisions of the constitution which forbid local and special legislation cannot be brushed aside so easily.</p>
    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[246,515,1187,756]]]'>It is urged that this statute is sustainable under the decisions of this court, recognizing the power of the legislature to classify the cities of the commonwealth for purposes of municipal government; but those cases rest upon a very different principle from that involved in the present case. For purposes of local government the state is subdivided into counties, townships, and other municipal and quasi municipal corporations. Each class of these subdivisions has purposes to subserve that are peculiar to it, and needs to be invested with the powers necessary to that end. Generally speaking, all the members ■of each class have the same local functions to perform. Classification therefore upon this basis has been recognized, and a statute relating to all the townships, all the school districts, or all the members of any particular class of the municipal divisions of the state has been held to be constitutional.</p>
    <p id="b222-6" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[245,1286,1185,608]]]'>It has been found desirable to divide cities into classes upon the basis of their population. The needs of a great city with •a half million or more of people are somewhat different in many respects from the needs of a city with ten thousand. The organization of their local governments and the management of their municipal affairs will be quite unlike. Each ■of these classes requires legislation peculiar to itself; but such legislation must be applicable to all the members of the class to which it relates, and must be directed to the existence and regulation of municipal powers and to matters of local government. The supposed classification in the act of 1879 is of a very different character.</p>
    <p id="b222-7" data-blocks='[["BL_222.6",222,[243,1903,1185,493]],["BL_223.1",223,[140,357,1183,304]]]'>The act provides for the incorporation and government of •■street railway companies, but it does not affect all such companies. It selects such companies as may be located in cities •of the second and third class, and makes special provision for them, while all other street railway companies remain under the operation of the general law. This is just what the constitution declares shall not be done; and this court has had occasion to enforce the constitutional prohibition in several cases. In Davis v. Clark, <a href="/pa/106/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="106 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="455702" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0377-01">106 Pa. 377</a>, a statute came up for examination which undertook to deal with mechanics’ liens in <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>counties whose population was less than two hundred thousand. This was held to be a local law. It was not an attempt at the classification of counties for any purpose of local government, but an effort to provide a lien in one part of the state under circumstances which would not entitle the mechanic to one under the general law.</p>
    <p id="b223-5" data-blocks='[["BL_223.4",223,[140,667,1185,552]]]'>Again, in Morrison v. Bachert, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20Pa.%20328" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="112 Pa. 328">112 Pa. 328</a>, a similar question arose, and Justice Paxson, delivering the opinion of the court, made this distinct declaration: “ It is our purpose to adhere rigidly to that instrument (the constitution) that the people may not be deprived of its benefits. It ought to be unnecessary for this court to make this judicial announcement, but it is proper to do so in view of the amount of legislation which is periodically placed on the statute book in entire disregard of the fundamental law.” Neither the rule nor the purpose of this court to apply it in any proper ease is therefore in doubt.</p>
    <p id="b223-6" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[141,1238,1184,547]]]'>But we do not see how the defendant in this case can raise this question. He is a stockholder in the defendant company. He has been, if he is not still a director. He is not dealing with it as a stranger, but as a member who has participated in its organization and claimed and exercised authority under and by virtue thereof. It will not do for him now to deny the rightful existence of this company as to himself and his own stock subscription, which he has affirmed as to all others. As to him we must treat this corporation as having a legal organization and a right to call upon him to fulfil his engagement as a subscriber to its stock.</p>
    <p id="b223-7" data-blocks='[["BL_223.6",223,[141,1804,1186,611]],["BL_224.1",224,[280,362,1184,1227]]]'>This brings us to the only other question raised. The evidence shows that one Sutton was a member of the firm of Weinman &amp; Co., and that he was a promoter of this street railway company and a subscriber for twenty shares of its capital stock. He was also a member of the first board of directors. Soon after the organization of the company Sutton, being about to remove from the city, took his partner, Weinman, with him to a meeting of the board of directors, and desired that his firm should be accepted in lieu ’ of himself as a subscriber for the twenty shares of stock standing in his name; and that his partner, Weinman, should be permitted to take his place in the board. The resignation of Sutton and the election of <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>Weinman as a director in Iris stead then took place, and were duly entered upon the minutes. Thereafter Weinman took upon himself the duties of a director, attended and took part in the meetings of the board, and among other things favored the collection of the subscriptions to the capital stock of the company. When called upon to pay on the shares by virtue of the ownership of which he was made a director, he objects that no formal written undertaking has ever been made by Weinman &amp; Co. for the payment of Sutton’s subscription, and because no transfer of the shares was made by Sutton to the firm upon the books of the company. But the transaction was not a sale of stock by Sutton to the firm, for he had not paid for it. What was alleged by the plaintiff below was that there had been a substitution of one subscriber to the stock in the place of another, by an arrangement to which the plaintiff Sutton and Weinman &amp; Co. were parties. The question for the jury was whether Sutton had been released from his subscription and Weinman &amp; Co. accepted as subscribers for the twenty shares of stock in his stead by the agreement of all the parties to be affected. There was evidence from which such an agreement could be properly found by the jury. It was submitted to them by the learned judge of the court below Avith fairness, and they have found the fact in favor of the plaintiff. We find no error in the rulings at the trial, and the</p>
