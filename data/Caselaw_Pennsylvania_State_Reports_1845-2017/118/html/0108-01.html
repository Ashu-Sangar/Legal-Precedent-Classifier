    <p class="summary" id="b130-7" data-blocks='[["BL_130.6",130,[266,1226,1186,919]]]'>This is a joint action brought by Samuel P. Mclntire and Jane Mclntire. All we can look at is the record, which informs us that the action is in case, that the narr. contains numerous counts, some of which are for trespass, and that Jane Mclntire has not only exclusive possession, but the right of possession, while Samuel P. Mclntire has neither the possession nor the right of possession, but the remainder in fee. Therefore, they are not tenants in common 'and have not a community of interest. Apart from this, the declaration discloses the fact that one injury was done to Jane Mclntire by interfering with her possession, or rather the enjoyment of the same, and that another injury was done to S. P. Mclntire by a destruction of the freehold. The coal mine underlying the land was unopened, and therefore the tenant for life could not disturb or move it and had she attempted to do so the remainderman could have prevented her; so that in this respect at least the rights of the parties plaintiff are not only not in common but antagonistic.</p>

This Samuel P. Mclntire had not, but Jane Me<a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>Intire had both, and how could these plaintiffs be joined. If the possession of Jane Mclntire was directly disturbed, she could bring her action of trespass, whether done by the coal company or their employees, Samuel P. Mclntire, or any one else. On the other hand Samuel P. Mclntire, as remainder-man, could only complain of waste, and his remedy would be by an action on the case. In a word, if the possession of Jane Mclntire was disturbed she had her remedy. If waste was committed, Samuel P. Mclntire had his remedy, and these rights are separate and distinct. We need not cite authorities in this regard. The rule is an elementary one and does not need the citation of authorities. But it is contended by plaintiffs’ counsel that this application comes too late inasmuch as that it is in the nature of a plea of abatement, and that a plea in bar having been heretofore entered, it is now too late to raise the question. In reply to this we may say that the declaration was amended, and while the defendants might have gone to trial on their plea as entered, yet they clearly had the right to amend or withdraw the plea so as to meet the amended declaration, and thus to plead over. We need not, however, rule the question on this technicality, because our Supreme Court have held in McDonald v. Simcox, <a href="/pa/98/0619-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="98 Pa. 619" data-case-ids="496956" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0619-01">98 Pa. 619</a>, that in action ex delicto, if too many persons are made co-plaintiffs, advantage may be taken of it at any time.</p>

    <p id="b133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_133.6",133,[151,608,1185,977]]]'>This was a joint action on the case brought in the court below by Samuel P. Mclntire and Jane Mclntire against the Westmoreland Coal Company. The plaintiffs were the owners •of a piece of land, of about half an acre, in Westmoreland county, upon which were erected a hotel and other buildings. The surface of said land was underlaid with a valuable vein of coal. It is alleged that the defendant company owned all the land surrounding the lot of the plaintiffs, and, in the course of its mining operations, had mined and taken away all the coal beneath the surface; that they had so negligently mined the same as to leave insufficient props, by means of which the .surface had cracked in many places, and that by reason thereof a valuable well of water on the premises had been destroyed. It appeared that Jane Mclntire, one of the plaintiffs, had a life estate in said premises, and that Samuel P. Mclntire, the other plaintiff, was the remainderman. As before stated, the action was joint, and they counted for the entire damages done to the property by reason of the alleged unlawful acts of the defendant company.</p>
    <p id="b133-7" data-blocks='[["BL_133.7",133,[154,1592,1183,493]]]'>The narr. as originally filed was in case. An amended narr. was subsequently filed containing several counts in trespass vi et armis. Subsequently a motion was made to quash the writ and narr. We do not know the precise ground upon which this motion was made, as we are not furnished with a copy of it. It was treated in the argument and the paper-books, however, as in the nature of a special demurrer, and the ground of it a misjoinder of parties. The court below quashed both writ and narr. and turned the plaintiffs out of court.</p>

That is not the question, however.

We may observe here that we are unable to see how such joinder could possibly injure the defendant. A recovery in such suit would be a bar to any subsequent action by either for the same cause. Aside from this, the defendant Avill have to incur the risk of having to pay more money with two actions than Avith one, besides additional costs. The only inconvenience in the case, Avhich we can see, would be the difficulty of apportioning the damages, in case of a recovery, between the life-tenant and the remainderman. But this is a difficulty -with which the defendant has no concern. He would be protected in any event.</p>

In the somewhat analogous case of the assessment of damages for land taken by a railroad company by virtue of the right of eminent domain, the law permits all the damages to be assessed upon one petition, Avhether such damages be sustained by tenant for years, tenant for life, or remainderman. It is true this is a statutory proceeding, and we are not embarrassed in such cases by the refined distinctions of the common law in regard to pleading and forms of actions.</p>

If it be true, as assumed by the court below, that the mine was unopened Avhen the life-estate commenced, and that the life-tenant had therefore no interest in it, the fact remains that she had an interest in the surface and the well of water, and to the extent these were injured, she had a right of action. That action might have been trespass, in which she would be entitled to recover for the actual injury, and also damages for the force employed according to the circumstances; or she might have waived the force and sued in case, when her damages would be limited to the actual injury. A recovery in either form of action Avould be a bar to an action for the same cause in another <em>form; </em>as, when the trespass is waived and assumpsit or trover is brought, either would bar an action of trespass.
