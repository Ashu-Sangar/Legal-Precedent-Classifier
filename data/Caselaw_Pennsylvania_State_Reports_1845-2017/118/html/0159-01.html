On April 1, 1876, upon the petition of E. G.

The order did not specify to whom the mortgage was to be executed. On June 3, 1876, the bond of the guardian in $1,200 was filed and approved, and on the same day a mortgage of the lot in dispute was executed and delivered by E. G. Krehan, guardian of Frederick, Priscilla, Jane and Laura Mary Weigle, and Daniel Haphey and Catharine, his wife (formerly Catharine Weigle, afterwards Catharine Stevenson), to Robert Robb, for $600, real debt, payable in three years. No report of said mortgage was made to the Orphans’ Court.

That this is the general rule as to the effect of such return, and of a judgment on the scire facias is well settled by authority. The judgment is conclusive between the parties to the mortgage as to the amount of the mortgage, and that the interest of the mortgagor <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>at' th¿ date of the mortgage should be taken in execution for the payment thereof: Dorris v.

If the defendant stops with the mortgage and judgment then he has no title to anything except the mother’s three fifths for life. When we go to the record of the Orphans’ Court we find no approval of any such mortgage, which is necessary to its validity, as held in the case of Morgan’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/110/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="110 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="543750" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0271-01">110 Pa. 271</a>. The mortgage authorized to be negotiated was the guardian’s mortgage for money to be borrowed for the wards. The mortgage executed, but never reported or approved, was a joint mortgage with others to secure another’s debt. As to the wards’ interest the mortgage was and is on its face void, and no judgment' against the guardian can validate it.</p>

We doubt it. Neither is it necessary in this case to decide on the contention of defendant’s attorneys that, the acknowledgment by a part of the mortgagors and a record of the mortgage is good against all, and that a certified copy of the record is good evidence against all who purport to have signed.</p>
