The wharf in question was maintained by the defendant, and tolls were charged and collected from the plaintiffs and others who used it. There was evidence that the rise in the river was not an unusual one for that time of the year, in height at least; but there was evidence that it was attended with an unusually swift current explained, as was claimed, by the fact that encroachments upon the river within the limits of the two cities had narrowed the waterway. It appeared that the wharf, shortly before the time of the loss, had been occupied by the Pittsb. &amp; West. R. Co., which had its tracks in operation down along the wharf nearly to Anderson street, occupying that part where the larger raft lay, and was engaged in building a trestle-track immediately below the Suspension bridge where the smaller raft was. By this occupation, the wharf-posts, ring-bolts, etc., which had been available before for tying to, had been removed, the tracks of the railroad being between them and the river.</p>

You must not understand that in such cases cities are to be held as insurers, or liable simply by reason that a loss has occurredbut where a wharf is rented or paid for, as in this case, the city is bound to give him sufficient means of attaching and fastening his boats or floats or rafts or whatever he may have properly moored at the wharf, so that in stress of weather of ordinary character, or <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>such as could be reasonably foreseen or anticipated, or by a rise or flood in the river of a similar character, even though it may be a high rise or flood, provided it was not of an extraordinary character, and not to have been reasonably anticipated. These ideas cover the whole duty of a party in the position that the defendant is. The city must keep the wharf in ordinarily reasonable good condition, good repair. There must be ordinarily reasonable attaching places so as to securely moor and tie any float or raft or anything else that may be moored at the wharf in any ordinary emergency, any ordinary flood, any ordinary stress of weather or flood and storm together, or anything that would be likely to occur that the city had reason to anticipate. It does not involve the city in responsibility for floods that could not have been foreseen; that were of such an unusual character as to be called extraordinary; but, although it may be quite a high flood, if it is one they were bound to anticipate, such as was occurring from time to time substantially, although it might have been a very little or some higher, yet not amounting to an extraordinary emergency, the city is bound to provide the reasonable appliances for parties to attach their floats to that they may protect themselves from loss.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[238,1491,1186,714]]]'>Now the great question in this case is, were there sufficient tying places furnished by defendant or remaining on the ground within reach of boats, etc., moored at the wharf; such as could have been safely and properly used by the plaintiff in the emergency which arose at the time of this accident. This involves a consideration of the condition of the wharf at that time. Then if you conclude from the evidence that there were reasonably sufficient hitching places to answer any ordinary or reasonably anticipated floods in the Allegheny river, your verdict should be for defendant. But if you conclude otherwise, then you must consider further whether or not plaintiff did all that was reasonably prudent and proper in making use of the means within his reach to prevent his floats from being carried away by the stress of waters.</p>

Upon this question you must look at all the evidence tending to show whether posts were there that could have been used that were not used, whether there were proper head lines, whether breast lines were proper and usual in such emergency and would have tended to prevent the float from being carried away, and in short everything done or undone, which in the exercise of reasonable care and prudence under the circumstances, should have been done to guard against the loss on part of plaintiff or those in his employ.....</p>

It is not for us to say whether or not sufficient were left. We only say if there were sufficient left. The fact that one was cut away would not make the city liable,, if those left were sufficient. The presumption would seem to be, if they had a certain number there before, which they thought reasonably proper, and one was cut or taken away, that perhaps there was one less than there ought to be. It-does not follow. It is for the jury to say, under the testimony, whether they were there, and if not there whether there were sufficient left to answer the purpose of the parties in this particular transaction. It might be there were not half enough posts on the wharf, as a wharf,- yet if there were enough within reach of the plaintiff to secure his property, and he neglected to use them as he ought to have used them,, exercising reasonable care and prudence in doing what was his duty to do, .he cannot complain that somebody else might have-been put in a dangerous condition, because the wharf itself' was in a bad condition.

The owner has the exclusive control over the property and its management. The public are invited to use it upon the payment of the established rates of toll or wharfage, and must trust to the security and sufficiency of the appliances afforded them. The wharf of the defendant is upon the bank of the Allegheny river, which is subject to great changes in the volume of its waters and the force of the current, by reason of floods. The navigation is almost entirely descending and is by rafts and heavily loaded boats that come down the river upon the high water. The advantages and the perils of floods enter into the calculations of both the navigator of the stream and the owner of the wharf upon its banks. The craft comes to the market which the city of Allegheny affords, upon the floods, and must depend upon the wharf for security against the swollen current while seeking a purchaser. It is the duty of the owner of the wharf to make suitable preparations for the safety of those who moor their rafts and boats along its side.

The violence of the winds and the floods are among these dangers. The raftman and the boatman seek security against these at the wharf. The perils are not ordinary, but they are great; and ordinary care, or “reasonable care under ordinary circumstances” is not enough. It is not proportioned to the dangers of the navigation or to the extent of the calamity in case of failure in the undertaking to hold securely. In the case of the City of Pittsburgh v. Grier, <a href="/pa/22/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="22 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="413749" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0054-01">22 Pa. 54</a>, a similar question was raised and this court said: “ The interests of commerce imperatively require that the place to which vessels are invited to come should be in a safe condition; ” but no more exact definition of the measure of care required was attempted. In the recent case of the City of Allegheny v. Campbell, <a href="/pa/107/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="107 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="8858505" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0530-01">107 Pa. 530</a>, the court below affirmed a point asking an instruction to the jury that “ the city was bound to the utmost care ” in maintaining its wharf in a safe condition for public use. This instruction was assigned for error as a too rigorous statement of the rule, but it was affirmed by this court. Justice Paxson said, in delivering the opinion of the court: “ The plaintiffs certainly have a right to look to the city for redress; for it was upon the city the duty was devolved of keeping the wharf in a safe condition; ” but the expression “ utmost care ” was not commented on.</p>

Gibbs, decided in the House of Lords in 1865, the plaintiff’s ship was injured.on a bank of mud at the mouth of the docks. The trustees denied their liability, as the obstruction was not known to them, and asserted that they were liable only for the failure to exercise ordinary care. But it was held the company was liable for the injury caused by the accumulation of mud at the docks whether they knew of the accumulation or not, if, by their servants, they had the means of knowing, and were negligently ignorant of it. An analogous principle is asserted in the cases in which the duty of a ship or dock company, to provide safe access to their ships for passengers, has come under examination; and such companies have been held to very strict liability for any defect or insufficiency in the appliances used for this purpose: Wh. Neg., par. 828; John v. Bacon, L. R. 5 C. P. 437; Wendell v. Baxter, <a href="/mass/78/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="12 Gray 494" data-case-ids="2086085" data-case-paths="/mass/78/0494-01">12 Gray, 494</a>. The docks and <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>gangways are held to be highways so far as to give to the public an unobstructed use of them as a means of access to the ship ; but as the danger attending their use is much greater than that attending the use of the public highways, so the measure of care required is correspondingly greater. In the case of railroad companies the rule has been held with great steadiness that the duty of the company is to exercise the utmost degree of care consistent with the continuance of the business. In our own leading case upon the subject, Laing v. Colder, <a href="/pa/8/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="959596" data-case-paths="/pa/8/0479-01">8 Pa. 479</a>, Justice Bell, who delivered the opinion of the court, uses this language: “But, though, in legal contemplation, they (the railroad companies) do not warrant the absolute safety of passengers, they are yet bound to the utmost care. The slightest neglect against which human prudence and foresight may guard, and by which hurt or loss is occasioned, will render them liable to answer in damages.”</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[255,1201,1181,197]]]'>. The foundation on which the rule in all these cases rests, is the character of the danger to which the property or person is exposed, and the absolute dependence of the public upon the care and fidelity of those who serve it.</p>
    <p id="b520-6" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[256,1405,1191,1025]],["BL_521.1",521,[189,370,1184,293]]]'>The same words “ utmost care” have been used to define the degree of care due from the owner of a public wharf to the navigator of boats and rafts; from a ship company to the public passing over its gangways; from a railroad company to passengers being transported in its cars. In each case, however, they are to be understood in connection with the subject to which they are applied. In the case of the Penn. R. Co. v. Fries, <a href="/pa/87/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="87 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="1057829" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0234-01">87 Pa. 234</a>, negligence is defined as the absence of care according to the circumstances. Drawn out at length, this is a statement that the nature and extent of the peril to be guarded against and the extent of the calamity to be suffered in case of failure, are always to be considered in determining the degree of care to be exercised in any given case. Whatever a diligent man would deem necessary under any given circumstances for the preservation of his own property, must be done by the individual, or corporation, or city, that undertakes, for hire, the preservation of property for the public. The “ utmost care” therefore, which was due from the city of Allegheny, required the use of all the appliances and precautions that a diligent man owning the rafts and owning the wharf <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>would deem it proper to employ in the preservation of his own property from the perils of the river. This definition or statement of the care due from the defendant city is in harmony with the cases cited above, and is-that by which the question of its negligence in the management of its wharf is to be determined.</p>
