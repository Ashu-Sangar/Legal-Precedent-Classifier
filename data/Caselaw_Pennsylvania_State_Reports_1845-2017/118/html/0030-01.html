Subsequently the plaintiff agreed to extend the time of payment of the balance to the 17th of December, 1886, but before the expiration of that time he brought this suit of ejectment.</p>

The evidence of the defendants having been thus rejected, nothing remained but to instruct the jury to find for the plaintiff, which was accordingly done. Assuming the defendants’ statement to be correct, as we have done, nothing need be said concerning the equities of the case, for they are all with them; and, previously to the act above mentioned, the plaintiff’s recovery must have been limited to a conditional verdict for the balance of the money due him. Nevertheless, under that act we cannot see how the judgment can be impeached.</p>

But should we follow these decisions to this extent we must go still farther and hold.that those having notice are not within the protection of the statute. For, as we said in Britton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/45/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="45 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="9502540" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0172-01">45 Pa. 172</a>, per Mr. Justice Strong, the recording acts have been regarded throughout their whole history, as designed only to furnish protection against those frauds which, Avithout them, would easily be perpetrated by secret conveyances. In other words, they are statutes for the prevention of frauds; hence they furnish no protection to one who purchases land knowing that another has acquired a prior right in that same land. Applying a doctrine of this kind to the act of 1881, and it is effective neither as to parties nor <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>privies, nor to others having notice. In other words we would thus repeal the act in its very .spirit, and continue to give effect to that which the legislature intended to abolish utterly, the oral defeasance.</p>
    <p id="b56-5" data-blocks='[["BL_56.4",56,[264,544,1180,920]]]'>We cannot agree thus to defeat the intention of the act. That intention is not at all obscure, and is not like that found in the act of 1715. It is true, the design is to prevent frauds, but it also definitely prescribes the process by which this is to be accomplished; not by recording alone, for that is but one of the prescriptions, but by directing how, and how only, a deed absolute shall be reformed. The question thus becomes one of evidence: It is proposed to impeach a deed; it is not what it purports to be, a conveyance in fee, but only a mortgage. Now the question is, how shall this be proved? The statute answers this by saying you can do this in no other way than by the exhibition of a written defeasance, signed, sealed, acknowledged, delivered and recorded. In similar cases the courts have always insisted that evidence to impeach a deed shall be clear and indubitable, and as the legislature has seen proper to require, for that purpose, a still higher type of evidence, we cannot take it upon ourselves to destroy the enactment for the purpose only of saving a case supposed to he a hard one.</p>
