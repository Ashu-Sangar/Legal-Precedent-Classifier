Allis &amp; Co., of Milwaukee, for machinery for the introduction of the “ Roller Process ” into his mills at Jenkintown, was endeavoring to place a mortgage for $10,000 upon his properly, with the proceeds of which to pay off his existing and prospective indebtedness; that, fearing a mechanics’ lien would be entered by Allis &amp; Co., if he purchased from them, which would interfere with the mortgage loan desired, Fulmer had the defendant and others of his friends indorse several of his notes which were to be turned over to Allis &amp; Co. to hold until the mortgage loan could be obtained, and that such a note for $1,000, at three months, was made by Fulmer, indorsed by the defendant for that purpose, and left with Fulmer, on January 22, 1874; that in April following, when this note was about to mature, Fulmer came to the defendant, and, saying that his dealings with Allis &amp; Co. had not been consummated, surrendered the said note and had the defendant indorse a second one, for the same amount and for the same time, to be used for no other purpose than that for which the other note was to be used, and that the note then given was the note in suit: Further, that just before this second note matured, the defendant discovered that a mortgage loan had been obtained by Fulmer, that Allis &amp; Co. were not paid and had filed a mechanics’ lien, and that Fulmer had turned the note over to the plaintiff Middleton; that in an interview with the plaintiff the latter had admitted to the defendant that when he received the note Fulmer had told him for what purpose it was to be used when the defendant <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>indorsed it.

One is because the plaintiff had knowledge of that circumstance. Another is that Mr. Middleton, the plaintiff in this suit, when he received this note, accepted it as a collateral security, and not in payment of his claim, and that therefore, in consideration of this note, he gave no actual value, and for that reason he took it subject to the equities existing between the original parties. If Mr. Middleton, when he received this note from Lloyd Fulmer, was told by Lloyd Fulmer, as he testifies, that this note was given only for the purpose of a settlement which was in contemplation between Fulmer and E. P. Allis &amp; Co., and that he was to make no other use of it, then Mr. Middleton took it subject to the defence which is set up in this case, that it was to be returned to Cozens in case it was not used in the settlement between Fulmer and E. P. Allis &amp; Co.; and in that case, if you believe that that agreement existed between Fulmer and Cozens when the note was given, that it should be used only for that purpose, and that was communicated to Middleton, there is an end of the plaintiff’s case. He could not, under those circumstances, recover against the defendant in this action. But you <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>will scrutinize the testimony upon this point with careful consideration. You will inquire as to the credibility of Mr. Fulmer’s testimony upon this point. You will bear in mind that if Fulmer testifies to the truth, he testifies that he committed a fraud, as against Cozens. His object in passing the note off upon Middleton was to gain time, and to satisfy Middleton for the time, who was pursuing him upon his claim. Is it natural that Fulmer would have volunteered to tell Middleton a circumstance which would affect the validity of the note in his hands ? Or, if Fulmer was ready, in fraud of Cozens, to make use of this note for a different purpose than that for which it was given, was it natural that he should be so scrupulous as to communicate to Mr. Middleton circumstances which were likely to induce Middleton not to accept the note ? Middleton denies upon oath that he received from Fulmer any information of the kind. If you believe the testimony of Lloyd Fulmer, as I said before, there is an end to the plaintiff’s case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b645-5" data-blocks='[["BL_645.4",645,[167,1254,1187,1185]],["BL_646.1",646,[254,369,1186,1748]]]'>But if you reject the testimony of Fulmer in regard to the notice he alleges to have given to Middleton, the next question for your consideration will be, as to whether this note was received by Middleton in payment of Ms claim. If it was received by him in payment of his claim, and' he did not know of the circumstances under which it was given, he is entitled to recover in this action. Now, what amounts to the payment of a claim ? For we must take care not to be confused by the loose use of language. The payment of a claim is its extinguishment. Mr. Middleton testifies, that he took this note in payment of the first note which Fulmer had given Mm, and that he surrendered that note by mailing it to Fulmer. Fulmer does not recollect, as he testifies, whether he received it or not; and, taking the testimony of Mr. Middleton as it stands, this note, if you believe him, was accepted in payment of Mr. Fulmer’s first note. But was that a payment of Mr. Middleton’s claim ? You will recollect that the debt was contracted upon a contract between Middleton and Fulmer, under which Middleton sold and delivered to Fulmer certain macMnery. The payment was to be cash. The cash was not paid, and Fulmer gave a note to Middleton for $1,025, payable in fifteen days. It was not paid when it became due, but when Middleton went to claim the money, Fulmer said he had not <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>the money to pay the note, but he would give him this note in suit with the name of Cozens upon it, which, he said, made it as good as wheat. Middleton took the note. [Now the presumption of law is, in the absence of other evidence, that when a creditor under such circumstances receives a security,, that he receives it as collateral to the antecedent debt; and therefore, unless evidence can be found in this case that Middleton agreed to take this note in satisfaction of his claim, it is but a collateral in his <em>hands; </em>and if it be a collateral in his hands, then, supposing it to have been given by Fulmer to Middleton in fraud of Cozens, in consequence of the special use for which it was given, then Cozens can defend against this action; provided he has shown to your satisfaction that the agreement as to the special use to which the note was to be restricted existed at the time the note was given between him and Fulmer.] <em>7 </em>It would not be natural that Middleton should accept this note in full payment of his claim, because the original contract still existed, unless it was expressly given up ; and Mr. Middleton had a right, and exercised it, to file a mechanics’ lien for the whole amount. This note, therefore, under the circumstances, was but a substitute for the note which had previously been given. If Mr. Middleton had surrendered a valuable security in consideration of this note, the case might stand otherwise ; but when he received this note he only gave up the note which had been previously given, and upon which Lloyd Fulmer’s name stood alone. He received this note, upon which were the names of Mr. Fulmer and Mr. Cozens, and if there can be no recovery in this case, the note is still good as against Fulmer. Therefore, in this transaction, when Mr. Middleton accepted this note, he put himself in no worse position than before, even should he fail to recover in this action. For that reason I charge you that it is to be considered as a collateral to Mr. Middleton’s claim upon the contract for the ■ sale and delivery of the machinery.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b646-4" data-blocks='[["BL_646.4",646,[252,2124,1179,300]],["BL_647.1",647,[168,364,1188,1444]]]'>[The vital question in this case, as I view it, is the question whether the contract which is alleged between Fulmer and Cozens when the note was given, really existed. If the contemplated settlement with E. P. Allis &amp; Co. was simply the occasion of giving the note, and when the note was given its use was not restricted to that purpose alone, then Mr. Fulmer <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>received the note primarily for that purpose, but without restriction as to its use for another. You must be satisfied that this alleged agreement was not an afterthought, and in the consideration of that question you will recall the testimony in relation to the conduct of the parties. It was the duty of Fulmer, according to that agreement, if it existed, to have returned the note to Cozens when the contemplated settlement with E. P. Allis &amp; Co. failed. It was not returned. You will take into consideration what passed when Mr. Middleton called upon Mr. Cozens to arrange for the payment of that note. Upon this subject the testimony varies. Mr. Middleton swears that Mr. Cozens said that he had been at expense lately in erecting certain buildings, and that he was short of money, and gave that as an excuse for not paying anything upon the note. Mr. Cozens swears on the contrary, that he reminded Mr. Middleton of the circumstances under which the note was originally given, not by detailing the circumstances, but by making an allusion to the terms upon which the note had been given, and swears that Mr. Middleton replied that he knew of that fact. Upon this point it is important to consider when this knowledge came to Mr. Middleton, because if it came to him after his acceptance of the note, it would make no difference so far as the notice is concerned; but I call your attention to these circumstances in order that you may scrutinize, by the light of all the facts in the case, whether or not there was an original agreement when the note was given, restricting Fulmer to the use of the note solely for the purpose of settling with E. P. Allis &amp; Co.]3</p>

If the jury find that the note in suit was not accepted as payment of the debt then owed by Fulmer to Middleton, but merely as a collateral or additional security to cover such indebtedness, then the defendant in this action can set up any defence he might set up against Fulmer if he were suing on the note.</p>

[It is true, as this point is intended to state, that unless Middleton became the possessor of the note in question by accepting it in payment of so much of the debt owing by Fulmer to Middleton, he took it subject to the equities existing between Fulmer and Cozens, and cannot recover, provided you find that the note was given to Fulmer by Cozens with the express understanding that it was to be used only in a transaction between Fulmer and E.

But Cozens denies that he knew that Fulmer had given Middleton the $500 notes for that purpose, and FuLmer denies it likewise.

Donaldson, <a href="/pa/3/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="3 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="400599" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0381-01">3 Pa. 381</a>; Lord v.

The doctrine of these and other cases is, that an accommodation indorser of negotiable paper pledged by the maker for an antecedent debt cannot defend on the ground that his indorsement was without consideration, because that would defeat the purpose for which he loaned his credit; but he may successfully defend by proving to the satisfaction of the jury that his indorsement was fraudulently procured, or, that instead of being a general and unrestricted loan of credit, the indorsement was made for a specific purpose, and that without his knowledge or consent, the note was fraudulently used for another and entirely different purpose and the like; but as against a bona fide holder for value, without notice, no such defence is available. In Lord v. Ocean Bank, supra, which was the case of an accommodation maker, it is said: “ He who chooses to put himself in the front of a negotiable instrument, for the benefit of his friend, must abide the consequence, and has no more right to complain if his friend accommodates himself by pledging it for an old debt than if he had used it any other way.”</p>

In this case defendant below denied that the indorsement in question was <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>an unrestricted loan of his credit, and undertook to prove by his own testimony and that of the maker that the note was indorsed for the specific purpose of being used by the latter in the settlement of a certain claim, and for no other purpose whatever; that after it ceased to be available for that purpose, the maker wrongfully and without defendant’s knowledge and consent transferred it to plaintiff below as collateral security for an antecedent debt, etc. In view of this evidence, the court was requested to charge: “ If the jury find that the defendant loaned the note in suit to Fulmer for the specific purpose to use it in settlement of E. P. Allis &amp; Co.’s claim, and for no other purpose, then when that purpose failed it was dead in law and belonged absolutely to defendant, and any subsequent use by Fulmer of said note without the knowledge, consent, and concurrence of the defendant, was a fraud upon the rights of the defendant.” The answer of the learned judge was as follows: “ This is true, if the jury find that when the defendant gave the note to Fulmer it was expressly restricted to the settlement with E. P. Allis &amp; Co.”</p>
    <p id="b653-5" data-blocks='[["BL_653.4",653,[166,1349,1189,1068]]]'>It is contended that this answer, with the exception of the ■first three words, is erroneous; but we are unable to see wherein it is so. It is a mistake to call it a qualification of the affirmance or to claim that it was prejudicial to defendant below. The legal conclusion, stated in the point, necessarily depended on the facts the jury was asked to find, and it was certainly not improper, in affirming the point, to call their attention to the principal question of fact upon which it was necessary for them to pass. That question, as well as others presented by the evidence, was exclusively for their consideration and determination under all the evidence in. the case, including the rebutting testimony offered for the purpose of showing a different state of facts. If the jury made a mistake in not finding according to the weight of the evidence before them, the error is one which we are powerless to correct. The only remedy was an appeal to the discretionary power of the court to set aside the verdict and order a new trial. The court refused to exercise that discretion, presumably for the reason that, on all the questions of fact involved in the case, the verdict was fully warranted by the evidence. The first specification of error is not sustained.</p>
