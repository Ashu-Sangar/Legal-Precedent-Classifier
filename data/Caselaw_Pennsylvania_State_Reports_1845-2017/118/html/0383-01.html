He then entered into a contract with A. T. Millen, for the construction of the improvements mentioned in the bill and answer. The house was commenced in the fall of 1874 and completed about the first of June, 1875 ; before its completion however, on about the middle of March, 1875, the respondent, with his wife and children, removed into this house, where they continued to live until about the first of March, 1887. The house and other improvements put upon said lot of ground cost about $2,500. The deed for the said premises purports to have been executed by Thomas Mellon and wife to Wm. D. Gleghorne, the respondent, on September 17, 1877, but was not delivered until October 4, 1882, and recorded on February 4, 1887, in deed book, vol. 558, page 324.

The complainant “ broke up housekeeping ” and went to live with her sister, Mrs. Perry, on the first of March, 1887, which, she contends, she was justified in doing, by reason of the respondent’s excessive use of liquor, his ill treatment of her and his cross, violent temper. Upon this ground, in connection with the neglect upon his part to support her, it is claimed that the complainant has the right to maintain an action for the recovery of her separate property from her husband, under § 3, act of April 11,1856, P. L. 315. There is abundant evidence of the respondent’s habit of drunkenness for a considerable time prior to filing the bill in this case. This seems to have been the cause of him having been discharged from his employment in July, 1886. And the cause, also, of the harsh and severe treatment of his wife......</p>

Samuel Perry testified to the fact that in conversation in the presence of the respondent, this money was often spoken of as having been used for paying the contractor for building the house. This is nowhere denied, and may therefore be taken as an admission, at the time, by the respondent, as being true. The complainant stated clearly and positively that she paid the sum of $1,200 in May, 1875, to her husband, and $300 before that time, also, which was used to pay for the improvements. The bank account of the respondent shows that, during the same month of May when it is claimed that the $1,200 was paid to him, there was deposited to his credit $1,010, and that during the same year, 1875, from January 9th to Sept. 27th, his deposits amounted to $2,050. During this time and for five years prior to 1876, he was general clerk for T. C. Jenkens at a salary from $3 to $12 per week. For the year preceding 1875 his deposits were $800, and for the year following 1875 they were $125. There is no evidence of him having received money during this time from any other source than his salary and from the complainant. The master, however, does not regard this bank account, which was put in evidence by the respondent, as throwing any light upon the case, except inferentially, in connection with the testimony upon the part of the complainant, relating to the question, as to how much money she paid her husband. And the fact that about the same time the respondent admits having received about $800, and the complainant contends she paid him $1,200, his bank account showing deposits largely in excess of those at any other time, does seem a circumstance to predominate in favor of the complainant. Tins taken in connection with the direct and positive statement of the complainant, and the statement of Samuel Perry, as against the testimony of the respondent, is, in the opinion of <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>the master, of sufficient weight to overcome the respondent’s denial, and turn the balance in favor of the complainant.

The bill avers “that the complainant expended $1,500 in paying for said lot and erecting a dwelling house thereon.” The answer to this averment is “ that the complainant gave the respondent $800 with which he paid a judgment against him for a portion of the costs of the house. But at the time the money was given to him, there was no agreement, contract or understanding, that he was to repay, return, or secure said money in any way.

But if the defendant alleges new matter not stated or inquired of in the bill, and introduces it by way of avoidance in his defence, the answer is not responsive, and therefore requires proof. Under the light of these well-settled rules and principles, is the answer, as to the question of a gift in this case, responsive ? The bill charges a liability in the payment of a sum of money to the defendant. The defendant set np, by way of defence, that it was a gift.to him from the complainant. The receipt of a portion of the money is admitted; the original liability is therefore confessed. But the answer is that the defendant received it in such a way as not to make him accountable for it. The allegation that it was a gift is clearly introduced by way of avoidance.

In the opinion of the master, it is not so. The matter of a gift was not stated or inquired of in the bill, but the defendant introduced it in his answer affirmatively against the demand in the bill.

The direct evidence bearing upon this point is very brief, and the parties agree as to the manner in which the money was transmitted, namely, without any agreement or understanding. It is conceded that the money was applied toward the payment of a debt against the respondent, contracted by him on account of the improvements made on his lot of ground. It was well understood at the time that the complainant gave her money for that purpose. She said: “ I told him to pay it on our home.” The respondent stated that “ there was nothing said.” There is not the slightest evidence of a gift ever having been mentioned until by way of defence in the answer. There being no direct evidence that it was, at the time of delivery, intended as a gift, the only question remaining to be determined is, whether the inference of a gift arises from the manner in which the complainant paid her money to her husband ? If he cannot show that it was a gift, either directly or by inference, he will be compelled to account to his wife for it as her trustee.</p>

At that timé the husband had bought property, and at his wife’s instance, he repaired and fitted up one of the houses with the money received from her estate.

The improvements here, were not made on the faith of any promise from the wife, nor were they made by her direction for the purpose of an investment, which should inure to her benefit and comfort. The circumstances do not warrant the inference that it was intended as an investment. The respondent, with his wife, moved into this house within five months from their marriage, before it had been completed, and before the contractor had been paid. About this time the complainant received upwards of $1,500 from her mother’s estate, and the condition of her husband’s affairs seemed to be such as to require financial aid, from other than his own resources. Under these circumstances, it was very natural and consistent for the complainant to let her husband have the use of her money to relieve him from financial embarrassment, and in their anxiety to acquire a home, to request him to apply it properly, and that was, toward the payment of the debts he had contracted in the improvement of his property. It is not unreasonable to suppose that she gave him her money with the expectation and confidence, that he would account to her for it; and that when she told him to pay it on their home, she only expressed her judgment and desire as to the use he should make of it, and not that she intended to part <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>entirely with the ownership thereof, in the character of a gift, nor in a manner that would preclude her from reclaiming it.</p>

There are, however, authorities which hold that as concerns her separate estate a wife may file a bill against her husband: Brightly’s Equity, § 521; 1 Dan. <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>Ch.

    <p id="b415-6" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[144,720,1186,667]]]'>The defendant in his answer admits that he received about $800 from the plaintiff, but alle'ges that it was á gift. His precise language is: “ The respondent avers that the said sum of $800 was given him, the respondent, by the complainant.” He had previously averred that “there was no agreement, contract, or understanding between the complainant and respondent that he was to repay or return said money, or secure the same in any way.” This makes a distinct averment of a gift of the money as opposed to a loan. As it is responsive to the bill, the case comes within the familiar rule in equity that the answer must have more than the oath of the plaintiff to overcome it. There must be two witnesses, or the oath of one and corroborating circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b415-7" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[145,1394,1187,707]]]'>The learned master evidently felt the strain of this, and he avoided it by holding that the answer was not responsive, but set up new matter by way of avoidance. He says: “ The matter of a gift was not stated or inquired of in the bill, but the defendant introduces it in his answer affirmatively against the demand in the bill.” The case was disposed of upon the theory of a loan to the defendant. Yet there is not a word in the bill, or in the testimony, to indicate that it was a loan. There is merely averment and proof that plaintiff gave defendant a certain sum of money to aid him “ to pay on our home.” The answer is not only responsive, but it is in entire harmony with the averments of the bill. There being no sufficient proof to overcome the answer, the bill should have been dismissed for that reason.</p>
    <p id="b415-8" data-blocks='[["BL_415.7",415,[149,2119,1185,299]],["BL_416.1",416,[272,357,1186,968]]]'>Even if we are mistaken in this, we think the case is ruled by Johnston v.

There the wife’s money was received by the husband under circumstances very similar to those existing in this case, and was appropriated by him at her request towards the fitting up of a house for her own comfort, and that of her family, and the court held that she could <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>not recover it back in an action against her husband’s administrator. I am unable to see any material distinction between fitting up a house as a home, and assisting in building a house for a home. In each case the wife expected to use and enjoy the fruits of her money in a home which she would occupy in common with her husband. In the case in hand the money may have been unwisely employed. But the law cannot supply wisdom to those who lack it, nor can it remedy all the mistakes which a man or a tornan may make in the course of a lifetime. In the present case, the wife evidently contributed this money for the completion of a house which was to be her home without a word or a thought about repayment. The husband cannot be treated as her trustee because he appropriated the money as she directed. The plaintiff says in her testimony : “ When I gave him the money, I told him to pay it on our home.....He took .the money and paid it <em>out; </em>it went into the house ; it was for the purpose of paying the contractor.” This is entirely inconsistent with a loan, or with a trust on the part of the husband.</p>
