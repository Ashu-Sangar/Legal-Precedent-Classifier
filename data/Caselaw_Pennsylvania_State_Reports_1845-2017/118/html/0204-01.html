Railroad is crossed by a private coke railroad owned and operated by Robert Hogsett, at two points about 600 feet distant from each other, the latter road running upon a semicircular line. On October 13, 1883, Mr. and Mrs. Bunting were passengers on a train of defendant company proceeding upon the South West Penn. Railroad towards Uniontown, when the passenger train was struck by the engine of a train upon the coke railroad and the plaintiffs received severe injuries. Evidence was introduced from which it was claimed by the plaintiffs that when the passenger train approached the first crossing of the coke railroad it was doubtful whether the passenger train whistled the signal for its approach, or whether the coke train whistled its own approach; that the engineer of the passenger train did not see the coke train until his train was upon the first crossing; that though he then pulled out rapidly, a coke car of the other train, pushed by the engine of the coke road, struck the platform of the rear coach of the passenger train so that the rear truck of that coach was derailed; that immediately the brakeman of the passenger train pulled the cord of the airbrakes letting on the air, and the engineer did the same from the cab, the result of which was to bring the passenger train to a stop when on the second crossing; that the effect of letting on the air from one of the cars was to render the release of the train from the brakes a matter of greater difficulty and more time than if the engineer had been left in full control; that when the col<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>lision at the first crossing occurred the engine of the coke train was reversed, and as it started back around the semicircle the engineer and fireman jumped from the cab, allowing* the coke train to run wild; that from the second crossing where the passenger train was stopped the engineer of that train had an unobstructed view of the coke train when approaching about half the length of the semicircle, but found it impossible to release the air and move his train from the crossing, until it was struck by the engine of the coke train, in which collision the plaintiffs were injured; and that there was no evidence that a watchman Avas stationed at either of the crossings or of any precautions taken to avoid a collision, except that defendant’s engineers had been instructed to approach Lemont Furnace crossing Avith their trains well in hand.</p>

Co., because this was a private track belonging to Mr. Hog-sett, the owner of the furnace, that ran across their track and was there before theirs, had the right to proceed under the law to make regulations as they saw proper as to that private track, or, as they allege, remove it altogether, and that the company was liable for what everybody did on that road, ím matter how recklessly it was done. That part of the plaintiff’s claim, we are compelled to say, under the view we take of the law, is not sustained, and we charge you as matter of law, that the defendant company was not liable for the proper and correct running and management of that furnace road, except so far as it affects their own acts.]8 Now gentlemen, what was the duty of the company as to this crossing? And I will say to you the law is very strict as to the duties of railroad companies at crossings. It is the duty of a railroad company, or its servants, where there is a cross track upon their road, upon which there are steam cars, to observe great care, not the highest degree of care, not an impossibility, but they must use all proper precautions; they must have their train well in hand, and must be on the lookout, and if whistling and ringing the bell would be effective in preventing accidents they ought to do that. It is alleged here that they did not blow the whistle at the first' crossing. The evidence upon that you have heard. The evidence on the part of the defendant is that they did blow the whistle, not only the long whistle, but in addition to that it is alleged they blew four blasts. I will say that at that point a whistle ought to have been blown, and if it were one of the company’s rules to blow it there, it would be evidence of negligence not to blow it. It is alleged they rang the bell; and one of the witnesses says he kept the bell ringing, and that they went slowly and reasonably carefully. Ou the other hand, the plaintiffs say they did not do that; and it is alleged that after the car was struck they stopped the train by the automatic brake, which was perfectly proper of course; that was their duty. When the car was derailed it was their duty to stop the train at once, otherwise the people in the car might have been killed. It was their duty to stop, but it is alleged that the engineer, knowing the train had been stopped by the conductor, by means of the brake, and that it would take some <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>little time to start, uselessly started and pulled up and could not get any further, and that that, with the other alleged negligence, caused this accident. The plaintiffs also alleged that there was not the proper precaution used; that that is all they did, and that was not enough. I believe that is the plaintiffs’ claim.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[251,654,1183,405]]]'>The law is as I have stated it to you. You are the judges of the facts.

The theory of the defendant is that they did take all the precautions they could, that they had the train under control; that they whistled the proper signal for crossing; that they were watching this verjr crossing; that they rung the bell, and were looking out and that all at once (you can hardly call him anything but a crazy man) the engineer of the dinkey engine ran his engine into the rear coach of the train and knocked it off the rails; that as soon as that happened, finding the rear coach was off the tracks, and that the passengers might be killed, they tried to stop the train. The duty of the agents of the defendant company was to stop the train instantly, if possible. They allege they did that; but that this engineer of the din-key engine, contrary to any human expectations, reversed his engine and, without any necessity, left it. There is nothing to show it might have fallen over on him. He alleges he was afraid it would fall on him. There is nothing to show that there was the least danger of it being upset because it struck the rear end of the coach. He left his engine, and the grade being downward toward the place where the passenger tram had stopped, the dinkey engine with nobody on it, ran around the circular track, and while the servants of the defendant company were struggling to get out of its way, but not having time to take off the air, but doing all they could, the din-<a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>key engine struck the coach in which were the plaintiffs and injured them. Now that is the explanation of the accident on the part of the company, and I say to you, if you believe that theory, it would be a great outrage on justice to hold the company liable.....</p>

But if on the •other hand you should think the company negligent, that the accident was caused by their not giving the proper whistle, not taking the proper care, and after the train was struck, although the engineer jumped off the “ dinkey ” engine, and although they could not have expected him to do that; yet, if that was a natural consequence of the original act, and you think there was negligence afterwards upon the track, in the manner in which they took off the air and put on steam, and there was negligence in that, and that was the cause of the accident, then you should find for both plaintiffs, and the next question would be as to the measure of damages.

The jury have found upon abundant evidence that the plaintiff was not injured by the negligence of the defendant company, but by that of a third party. Unless that result was produced by the admission of improper evidence, or by erroneous instructions to the jury upon the law, the plaintiff has no case.</p>

The defendant’s road at the point where the accident occurred is crossed at grade by another road belonging to the Lemont Furnace. The track of the latter crosses defendant’s road, makes a semicircle and recrosses it at a distance of about 600 feet. The jury have found that the accident was the result of the negligence of the engineer and fireman of the furnace road. This finding was the only one reasonably possible from the evidence. But the plaintiff alleges that under the admitted facts of the construction and location of the defendant’s road and the furnace track, the defendant is responsible for the careful and safe management of the furnace road: See second assignment. I hardly know how to treat a proposition of this kind. I can only say that I know of no reason, and have been furnished with none, why it should be so. And if it be correct I see no reason why the converse of it should not be true, and the furnace company be held responsible for the careful and safe management of the defendant’s road.
