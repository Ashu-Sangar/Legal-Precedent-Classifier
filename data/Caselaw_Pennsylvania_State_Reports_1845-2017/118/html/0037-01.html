The language of the act of April 8, 1833, is almost identical with the statute of 1 Viet. c. 26, upon which lengthy comment is made in 1 Jarman, 260-267. On the latter page it is said: “ Thus' a reference to the will does not set up an.....unattested writing as part of the will, though on the same paper.” So again, in 1 Williams Ex., 69, n. c., having reference to the statute of 1 Viet., supra, and the supplement of 15 Viet. c. 24, it is said: “In order to get rid of the objection that the will was not signed at the foot or end thereof, the court in some cases has thought itself justified in regarding a portion running below the signature as forming no part of the will, and granting probate exclusive of that portion.” The same thought in our own Supreme Court is given in Hays v. Harden, <a href="/pa/6/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="954613" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0409-01">6 Pa. 409</a>.

Said assignment is as follows: The court erred in affirming the decree of the register, and in overruling and dismissing the first exception filed before the register, upon the appeal from the decree of the register, which said exception is in the words following, to wit: “ The said alleged last will and testament is not signed at the end thereof by the alleged testator, as required by the act of assembly in such case made and provided.”</p>

The learned judge of the Orphans’ Court makes no reference in his opinion to the question we are now considering. It deals with other questions in the case which would be important if the will were properly executed.</p>
    <p id="b61-6" data-blocks='[["BL_61.5",61,[159,874,1182,1431]]]'>We think it is not. It cannot be said that the clause appointing the executors is no part of a will. It is an important part though not always essential. It cannot be brushed aside as mere idle words to which no meaning is to be attached. Nor can they be rejected and so much of the will be probated as stands above the signature. As was said by Chief Justice Gibson in Hays v. Harden, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Pa.%20413" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Pa. 413">6 Pa. 413</a>: “ It is better, therefore, that an informal addition should operate as a statutory revocation of the whole than that a plain injunction should be frittered away by exceptions.” I am aware that our act of 1833 closely resembles the statute of 1 Yict. c. 26, and that some English authorities seem to sanction the doctrine contended for by the appellees. It is said in 1 Williams Executors, 69, in commenting upon the above statute of Viet, and its supplement of 15 Yict. c. 24, that <em>“ </em>in order to get rid of the objection that the will was not signed at the foot or end thereof, the court in some cases has thought itself justified in regarding a portion running below the signature as forming no part of the will, and granting probate exclusive of that portion. Our act of 1833 as well as the statute of Viet, are in part borrowed from the British statute of frauds, two sections of which have been so evaded by judicial construction as to be practically repealed. We do not propose that the act of 1833 shall meet with the same fate. The legislature have laid down a rule so plain that it cannot be evaded without a clear violation of its terms. No room is left for judicial construction or interpretation. It says a will must be signed at the end thereof, and that’s the end of it.</p>
