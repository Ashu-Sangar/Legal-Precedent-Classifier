The point on the east side, viz.: the township road, was used for a landing until 1855, when the road was abandoned and a new one made about forty feet above; the new road running under the trestle wort .used in connection with the plaintiff’s saw-mill. In 1860 the public road was again changed to its present location, the terminus of the road being used as a landing. The plaintiff owns the land along the shore of the east side of the river for about four hundred yards, both .above and below the public road on the east side. On the west side of the river the landings used by .the plaintiff, or those under him, depended somewhat on the stage of the water. The two most used, however, were at the Elizabeth road, and at a flat rock about four hundred feet above, known as the upper landing. The upper landing was used only for skiff purposes until some time in 1881 or 1882, at which time a road was made by the plaintiff down to this landing, after which teams could be landed at this point. Prior to this the flat landing was at the Elizabeth road. The plaintiff never acquired any land, for landing purposes, on the west side,.by lease or otherwise, the land belonging to John J. Douglass and his brother William as tenants in common, from some time prior to 1850 up to 1866, when partition thereof was made; William Douglass taking the land upon which plaintiff’s boats landed. He held it for some time thereafter when it was sold at sheriff’s sale to A. M. McClure, the present owner. The plaintiff kept the landings at the township road, on each side, in reasonable condition and repair. He did not at all times have boats for the transportation of “ men and horses and other animals, and carriages^ of all description.” From 1873 to 1880 there seems to have been no boats for the transportation of wagons. The travel across the river at that point was very light, prior to the construction of the railroad on the west side; not sufficient to justify the keeping of a regular ferryman.</p>

There is no private act of assembly authorizing defendant to maintain a public ferry. Under the act of 1874, and its supplements, a charter must be procured, thereby giving an express grant from the state to establish a public ferry. No such grant has been shown. But the learned counsel for defendant say, “ That the right to keep and maintain a public ferry belongs to every riparian owner, so long as it does not conflict with any exclusive grant.” To winch we answer, that the defendant is not a riparian owner, but even if he were, we do not think “that a party, even though he be a riparian proprietor, and own the lands on both sides of the stream, can set up and operate a public ferry, and levy ferriage or tolls, without the consent of the state: ” Young v.

Therefore, having found that the defendant has no public ferry rights under any private act of assembly, nor under a charter, and that he has no right to maintain a public ferry as a riparian owner, we will proceed to inquire if the plaintiff has such a franchise as entitles him to enjoin the defendants from operating the ferry complained of.</p>

      <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>The complainant, it is admitted, has a charter under an act of assembly approved March 14, 1850, P. L. 202, authorizing him, his heirs and assigns, to maintain a public ferry between the east and west sides of the Youghiogheny river at Suter’s sawmill, and to collect tolls; and there is imposed the corresponding duty of maintaining the ferry in good order, for the accommodation of the public, and subject to such rules and regulations as the Court of Quarter Sessions may direct. Referring to this grant, we find it belongs to the class referred to elsewhere, as not exclusive in terms. The defendant contends that plaintiff has no exclusive right conferred upon him within certain or any limits of territory, as against any other person who is otherwise qualified to land on the shores of the Youghiogheny river. This proposition is, we believe, correct. A second, or other ferry company, may be granted a franchise to •establish a ferry within a reasonable distance of the location of the plaintiff’s ferry, possibly between substantially the same points; but we have not that , question before us. This contest is not between two grantees of the state, but against ■one having no grant from the state and no right to operate a public ferry, and who is operating- such a ferry to the injury of the franchise duly granted by the state. That the grant of the ferry franchises, without it being exclusive in terms, is the grant of the exclusive privilege as against one having no such grant, is, we think, a proposition abundantly established by the authorities heretofore cited.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b91-5" data-blocks='[["BL_91.4",91,[180,1689,1185,660]]]'>It is also clear in respect of franchises granted by the legislature, -that the state may waive all questions of nonperformance of certain conditions, and accept of any performance. It is, therefore, a wise principle of law, that no individual can be permitted hi a collateral proceeding to claim •or to establish a forfeiture in any such case. This right belongs to the king, alone in England, and here to the state alone, , and this is to be- accomplished only by a direct proceeding for the direct purpose, as by scire facias, or quo warranto. In Angelí &amp; Ames on Corporations, 507, it is said: “ It cannot be shown in defence to a suit of a corporation.....that the plaintiffs have forfeited their corporate rights by misuser or nonuser.” See also 2 Kent Com., 313.</p>

But the plaintiff never owned or in any way acquired the lawful use of a landing on the west bank of the river, the land belonging to A. M. McClure, from Avhom the plaintiff never acquired the right of landing; and it is clear that a ferry license to one, other than the riparian owner, will not authorize him, against the consent of the owner, to land or receive freights on another’s freehold; and, as one of the landings on the west side is a public road, constructed and laid out over McClure’s land, it is equally clear that the plaintiff could not use the public road for ferry landings against the consent of the owner. In Chambers v. Furry, <a href="/yeates/1/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="1 Yeates 167" data-case-ids="6772651" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0166-01">1 Y. 167</a>, it was decided that the dedication or laying out of grounds as a public road gave no right to the defendants to land upon or receive freights from the plaintiff’s freehold on the banks of a navigable river without his consent. See also Cooper v. Smith, 9 S. &amp; R. 31; not even, it was held in Chess v. Manown, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.%20219" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="3 W. 219">3 W. 219</a>, at the terminus of a highway, between high and low water mark. But the OAvner of the soil does not complain, and the defendant is not in a position to do so. But on the east side, the defendant uses the highway for a landing, the road being constructed and laid out on land belonging to plaintiff. Casting aside plaintiff’s charter, can defendant do this against plaintiff’s protest? Assuredly not. He might transport himself and property, and use the highway as a landing without Suter’s consent, but it does not follow that he can convert the <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>personal right into a source of emolument, and, at his own pleasure, use the road as a ferry landing. Therefore, from the evidence submitted, and under the law as we understand it, we have determined, that the plaintiff has a right to maintain and operate a ferry at “ Suter’s saw-mill,” and that the defendant is a trespasser without authority, and without charter privileges, and the acts of trespass being frequent and continuous, we are of the opinion that a perpetual injunction should issue as prayed for in the bill.</p>

A perusal of the testimony will convince this court that there was a continuous disregard for many years by the plaintiff of the requirements of the grant that he should keep good and substantial boats, and competent and careful ferrymen who should constantly as occasion might require attend for the transporting travelers with all reasonable diligence and attention. The plaintiff failed in essential particulars to “ commence business in good faith,” and therefore he is under the ban of § 1, article XVI. of the constitution. The complainant having failed to commence business — to perform his part of the contract, we urge that the constitutional provision referred to is equivalent to, and greater than, “ any future legislation,” in resuming the grant contained in the act: Penn.

We have the further fact, found by the master, and not denied, that the appellants have no grant of ferry rights from the legislature, there or elsewhere. We have the additional fact that the appellee has for about thirty-five years maintained and operated a ferry at the place designated. For the earlier portion of the time he kept a skiff for conveying passengers merely. The master finds: “From 1873 to 1880 there seems to have been no boats for the transportation of wagons. The travel across the river at this point was very light prior to the construction of the railroad on the west side; not sufficient to justify the keeping of a regular ferryman.” In the early part of the year 1885, when from various causes the business of the ferry had increased to an extent that promised some return to the appellee for his outlay, James E. Douglass, one of the appel<a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>lants, established a ferry between the same termini, and practically over the same route. He has no license from the state, nor does he show any authority whatever for establishing a public ferry. He justifies dividing the scanty toll with the appellee by alleging that the latter has not acquired a landing-place on the west side of the river, from which we are asked to decree that the appellee has not complied with the act of 1850, and is not entitled to be protected in the use of his ferry as against the appellant.</p>
    <p id="b96-4" data-blocks='[["BL_96.4",96,[288,817,1181,556]]]'>We do not take this view of the matter. The act of 1850 does not in terms impose upon the appellee the duty of acquiring landings in fee. It authorizes him “to make good and convenient landings on the east and west side of the Youghiogheny river,” and “ for keeping up and maintaining the said landings and ferry,” he is “ authorized to charge customary tolls,” etc. On the east side of the river the appellee lands upon his own ground; on the west side he has been landing all these years without complaint of any one, property owner or passenger, and the master finds that he has kept the landings “ in reasonable condition and repair.”</p>
    <p id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[287,1382,1180,391]]]'>We are of opinion that the appellants, who show no right to set up a ferry, have not any standing to allege that the appellee has not complied with the act of assembly. The commonwealth may, if she thinks appellee has not complied with the law, and is maintaining an illegal ferry, call him to an account, and forfeit his rights under the act. So far as developed by this case, however, we think he has substantially complied with the act of 1850.</p>
    <p id="b96-6" data-blocks='[["BL_96.6",96,[287,1793,1180,609]],["BL_97.1",97,[126,340,1183,563]]]'>The appellants contend further that the grant is a dead letter for the further reason that there never having been a reasonable compliance therewith, it fell with the adoption of the present constitution, article XVI., section 1, of which provides: “ All existing charters, or grants of special or exclusive privileges, under which a bona fide organization shall not have taken place and business been commenced in good faith, at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall thereafter have no validity,” and Cliincleclamouche Lumber and Boom Company v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/100/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="100 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="498426" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0488-01">100 Pa. 488</a>, and some other cases were cited in support of this view. No fault is found with these cases; they are good law, but they have no application to the <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>facts of the case in hand. Here business was commenced in good faith and has been continued to the present time. The fact that until a few years ago a skiff only was used for passengers, and that there was no flat-boat for wagons and other vehicles, is not, under the circumstances, evidence of bad faith to the state or the public, and no complaint has ever been made by either. It is very evident that until recently there was no demand for a flat; at least not enough to justify placing one on the ferry. There is nothing in this point, and we would not have noticed it but for the fact that it might otherwise have given the impression that it had been overlooked.</p>
