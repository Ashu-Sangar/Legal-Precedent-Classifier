At a meeting of the board of managers on the morning of that day, Mr. Emil Winter being chairman of said board, the price was fixed at 6| cents. Immediately after the meeting, the chairman verbally contracted to sell the entire lot on hand to Thomas H. Reese at that price. The purchaser at once prepared to receive it and sent his check for $13,260 in full payment, but, on account of some misunderstanding among the members of the board as to the quantity to be sold, delivery was refused. A proper tender of purchase <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>money was made before suit brought.

If he did sell it to Reese without Reese having any knowledge or information, or reason to believe that any such restriction had been put on his powers, and Reese bought it in good faith, the contract is binding not only upon Winter, but on the defendant, and a breach of that contract either by him or the defendant makes the company liable for any damages sustained by reason of the breach.</p>

[You take the markets in New York and Chicago if there was no local market here, and add the price of getting the oil to those points where there was a market.

But if the association refuse to perform, then the contract, as is claimed, must be in writing and so signed. Thus-would the association be free and the purchaser bound, according to the caprice or advantage of the latter. Herein is the distinction between contracts of purchase and contracts of sale by such an association. A contract of purchase defines the liability and fixes its amount. A purchaser from it can tell whether the contract must be in writing. The liability meant by the law cannot mean a liability which may or may not exist. The law owes an equal or even greater duty to protect persons contracting with such associations, because if their contract rights are to be subject to contingencies largely controlled by the other party, they would not deal with them and the act would defeat its own purposes.

In a general way this was conceded by the learned court below; but, in describing the authority of Mr. Winter, who was chairman of the company, we think the court erred in attributing to him an authority he did not possess. . Thus, in the charge the learned judge said: “ As we instruct you, Mr. Winter had a right to sell this oil. He was-chairman of the concern and — to put it clearly and without question apart from the evidence — we instruct you as matter of law, the very position he had as a member of this firm, and as the executive head of it gave him a right to sell any oil they had, whether the whole stock in hand or not, even if there was an agreement between him and the other members of the firm that he should not sell for the price he did sell.” In answering the third point of the defendant the same idea was still more strongly expressed. The judge then said: “ I instruct <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>you that under the act of assembly and the articles of association, Winter being chairman of the board of managers, had authority to do business for the defendant, to sell its products in the market without any specific authority to that effect.” The point requested an instruction that the sale made by Winter was not binding upon the association unless he had express authority from the managers, or implied authority from the fact that he had been making similar sales without <em>objection; </em>that there was no evidence of express .authority, and as to the implied authority there was no evidence but his own, and that was contradicted by the other managers. The answer simply ignored every other consideration than that of a general authority, which it declared to exist without any specific authority, and without regard to the action of the managers. Practically this amounts to an ascription to one of the several partners, of all the power which may be exercised by an ordinary general partner.</p>
    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[169,1232,1183,1079]]]'>The validity of the limited partnership in the present case has not been impeached or even questioned. We assume it to be entirely legitimate and therefore subject to the operation of the law relating to limited partnerships. Under that law the individual members do not have the authority of general partners. The powers of the association are to be exercised by a board of managers and not by each of the members. Other limitations are imposed not necessary to be now considered, but it is perfectly certain that the general authority of an ordinary partnership does not exist in the individual members. Strangers dealing with a limited partnership, being supposed to know the law, are bound by the limitations imposed upon the members, and cannot have the benefit of those inferences which flow from a relation of general partnership merely. We think the third point of the defendant should have been affirmed as it stood, and if it was true that the board of managers had on the 12th of July, 1886, refused to make the sale to the plaintiff at 6J cents, the jury should have been instructed that the sale made by'Winter was not binding upon the defendant. These views require a reversal of the judgment upon the third assignment of error.</p>
    <p id="b381-6" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[175,2318,1177,94]],["BL_382.1",382,[270,356,1180,916]]]'>We are also of opinion that both the plaintiff and the defendant are bound by the restriction of liability in any case <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>for more than, five hundred dollars unless reduced to writing and signed by at least two managers. The term “ liability ” expresses in the broadest and most comprehensive manner any form of legal obligation, certainly all such as are measured by money values. A purchase for more than five hundred dollars would undoubtedly be a liability prohibited. Why not a sale ? The purchase imposes an obligation to receive a commodity and pay for it, and if this obligation is not discharged by performance, a liability to pay damages for its breach ensues. A sale imposes an obligation to deliver a commodity and receive money for it, and if not discharged a liability to respond in damages for its breach results. We can see no essential difference between these two different species of liabilities, in construing a legislative enactment such as this, the manifest purpose of which is to protect the association and its members from all obligations not sanctioned in the manner especially directed. This view requires a reversal on the first and second assignments.</p>
