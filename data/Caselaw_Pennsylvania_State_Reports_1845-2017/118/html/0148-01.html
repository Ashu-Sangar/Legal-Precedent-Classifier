Courts have ■adopted rules of practice to facilitate the dispatch of business, and to limit and define the issue to be tried in cases brought before them. We have a rule on the subject of ejectment ■actions, and the object of the rule is to make certain and definite what issue is to be tried, thus saving a vast amount of useless testimony and waste of time. This rule provides that the party who brings the action to recover possession of land must define its location so that it can be clearly known. He must also file an abstract of the title, showing his chain of title, which abstract is notice to the other side.</p>

And the rule of the court provides that no evidence shall be received at the trial except in reference to the matters directly in controversy, so that whatever is not specifically denied shall be deemed admitted. Now in this case the abstracts of title are admitted in evidence for the purpose of showing what admissions are made, and it is for the court to say what these admissions are. The abstract furnished by the defendant does not controvert any one of the deeds set forth in plaintiff’s abstract. That is an admission of the chain of title under which the plaintiff claims. It does not controvert that the land in dispute is covered by the plaintiff’s deed and within the chain of his title, and thus that iact is admitted. Hence I have in this case deemed it improper <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>to go into the controversy as to where the lines between these tracts are. The defendant referred in his abstract to two or three deeds, one made in 1835, and claims that he was in possession of the property from 1835 down. Now, if that was true he would have a good title; but I understand that that abstract is simply claiming by the adverse possession, and simply denying the possession of the plaintiff; not controverting the plaintiff’s record title, nor that this property is in the plaintiff’s deed and covered by the deed that he received. I have so ruled, and I have said that the only question for the jury to pass upon is, Has the defendant been in adverse possession of this property for twenty-one years before this suit was brought ? . . . The defendant, I believe, has admitted in this case that this piece of property is in the plaintiff’s deed, and that the plaintiff would have a good title, except that he (the defendant) has held possession of it for twenty-one years and more under the chain of title that he claims.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b175-5" data-blocks='[["BL_175.4",175,[166,1250,1186,1220]]]'>Now, what is the evidence on that point as to the possession of this property ?. Mr. Dickson testifies that in 1858 he, and those with whom he was co-operating, purchased two acres in extent there; that this land in dispute was a part of the two acres ; that they were operating coal works and that they built a coal tipple on this property. They got their deed for it in 1859 and operated the coal works until about 1864, if I remember correctly, when they sold out to Kier, Foster &amp; Kier, and that that firm continued to use it as a coal tipple for three or four years after that, until the coal was exhausted. Then Mr. Arthurs testifies that about 1872 he became interested in the adjoining property, and afterwards, I believe, became interested in this; but in 1872, when he first became acquainted with it, this identical lot had on it the remains of the old coal tipple, and he says that he and Mr. Bagaley, I believe, used or occupied this property for some time, or at least that he saw it frequently until about 1882, when he became the purchaser, and that down to 1880 it was vacant, except as occupied by the coal tipple and perhaps fenced in, or- part of it fenced in, there being a large rock there which I think he said they had to build their fence around. That in 1882 he saw this house on the property. The rock had been excavated and the house put where part of the rock stood. The defendant admits that he built the house in 1880.</p>

The deeds they refer to may embrace it. That may be true. But the defendant admits that the lines of plaintiff’s deed embraced it, as I think from the abstract of title.

To entitle him to recover he must show not only a title by deed but also an adverse possession for twenty-one years. A deed or will cannot be given in evidence unless some paper title is first shown in the grantor or testator, or in the absence of this, an actual possession of the land: Murphy v.

The defendant offered to show where the lines of the Ireland tract and of the May tract were, for the purpose of proving that the parcel in dispute was within the Ireland tract claimed by the defendant and not within the May. tract held by the plaintiff. The rejection of this évidence was error. It is a. well settled rule in ejectment cases that any and all testimony tending to show the actual lines on the ground of tracts in dispute, whether the title is claimed under conveyance or by adverse possession, is always competent for either party.</p>

Who Sutton was or is, or through or under whom he claimed, or how he got title if he had any, does not appear; nor does it appear that either Sutton or Pedan were ever seized or at any time in possession. These deeds even if they include in their lines the land in dispute, would not confer the right of possession upon Ireland. The case is left under both abstracts to be fought out where the court put it, on the ground of possession. The averment of a deed from one not shown to claim under the commonwealth or from a common source, amounts to nothing as against an admitted title from the commonwealth: Lehman v.

The action was brought to recover a small piece of land on the line of the Allegheny Valley Railroad. The plaintiff filed his abstract of title showing a regular chain of conveyances from the commonwealth down to himself, and called upon the defendant under a rule of court to <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>file an abstract of tbe title under which he claimed. In conformity with the rule the defendant filed an abstract in which he alleged title in one Edward Pedan as early as 1825, a conveyance by him to James Ireland in 1835, and possession by Ireland and his heirs (of whom defendant was one) from 1835 to the bringing of this suit.</p>
    <p id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[253,656,1181,917]]]'>On the trial the defendant made several offers, the purpose of which was to fix definitely the lines of the tract to which plaintiff’s written title related and of which he had been in actual possession; and also to locate the lines of the land which he, the defendant, claimed under his written title; and of which he alleged he and his ancestor had been in actual adverse possession for fifty years. The court refused these offers under a construction of the rule of court under which the abstract of defendant had been filed. The court said: “ By the abstract of title under our rule of court the defendant admits that the piece of land in dispute is embraced within the deeds set forth in the plaintiff’s brief of title, and that the plaintiff has a paper title to the same. Therefore, any evidence disputing the fact that the piece of land is within the plaintiff’s abstract is not proper under our rule of court. The defendant’s abstract of title sets forth his title as against the plaintiff by adverse possession, and the evidence must be limited to that question.”</p>

Without definite boundaries, his possession was rambling, uncertain and of no avail as a defence to the plaintiff’s action. If, as' the court held, “ the evidence must be limited to the question of adverse possession,” it was nevertheless absolutely necessary to show within whose inclosure the premises in dispute were. The defendant offered to show that whatever the plaintiff’s paper title might cover, the lines on the ground by which his possession was bounded did not include this land. The evidence was not offered to show the general location of the lands covered by plaintiff’s deeds, but to limit Ms actual possession. For tMs purpose it was both competent and important evidence. The admission of the defendant under Ms abstract and the rule of court did not cover the possession of the small piece of land in controversy, for he set out distinctly his title by virtue of the statute of limita<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>tions. The court below so held, yet refused the offer to show that the lines of the defendant’s inclosure actually embraced the land in controversy, while those of the plaintiff did not. This offer should have been admitted. If the proof proposed had been made and it had appeared that the lines of the plaintiff’s inclosure did not include the land in controversy, but that the actual inclosure of the defendant did include it, and that the defendant had been in the actual, visible, hostile possession up to the lines of his inclosure for more than twenty-one years before suit brought, it will not be doubted that his defence was sufficient to defeat the plaintiff’s paper title. This is in substance what the defendant proposed to prove but which was excluded.</p>
    <p id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.4",179,[150,1022,1181,500]]]'>As the case stood it was narrowed by the abstracts and the rule of court to the single question of title by possession. The exact limits of the possession of the parties, so far as those limits affected the land in controversy, were important. If the lines to which the plaintiff claimed did not include this land, so as to give him the actual, exclusive, hostile possession of it, and the lines of the defendant’s possession did include it, the defendant had a right to make the proof, and his offer to do so should have been admitted. The other assignments of error are not sustained.</p>
