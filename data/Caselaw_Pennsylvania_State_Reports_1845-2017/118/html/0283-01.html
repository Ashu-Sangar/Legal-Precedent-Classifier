They contend the evidence in this case shows a course of dealing, between defendants in error and themselves, in which Penn Bank cashier’s checks were recognized as cash in payment of drafts; and, if the question had been submitted to the jury, they would have been, warranted in finding the payment in controversy was absolute and not conditional. In support of this position they refer to the evidence of J. G-. Holmes, who testified in substance that the draft in suit was received and lifted, May 24, 1884, by cashier’s check; that his firm had been collecting drafts on Briggs &amp; Drum for several years, and payment had always been made in same manner. Also, to the evidence of W. H. Drum, to the effect that he had been previously instructed by N. Holmes &amp; Sons to pay drafts with cashier’s checks; that the cheeks of Briggs &amp; Drum would not be acceptable, etc. On cross-examination, same witness, referring to a conversation had at N. Holmes &amp; Sons’ bank, says : “ I was told that they would not accept our check for the payment of drafts, and that they would accept the cashier’s check of the Penn Bank.” It is further contended that the conduct of N. Holmes &amp; Sons, in not notifying Briggs &amp; Drum of the non-payment of the check, and not making any demand on them for six months after the bank failed, is corroborative of the alleged understanding that cashier’s checks would be received as cash in payment of drafts.</p>
