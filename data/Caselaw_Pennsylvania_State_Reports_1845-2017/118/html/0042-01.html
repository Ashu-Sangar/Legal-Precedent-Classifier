      <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>In 1885 the lessees began operating for oil under this lease. The plaintiff lived in New York and the defendants were oil operators and had charge of the drilling. About the middle of March, 1885, an oil bearing sand rock was found and oil in paying quantities and the prospects were favorable for a good well. The defendants ordered the well shut down and drilling stopped, and the well was reported to those inquiring to be a failure. About six weeks after this, one of the drillers named Nolan, at the suggestion of the defendants, went to New York to purchase plaintiff’s one third interest, and reported to him that the well was a failure and the prospects for oil were poor. Nolan succeeded in getting the plaintiff’s interest for $500, which was less than the plaintiff had paid out, and a conveyance was made to him dated May 11, 1885. In a few days Nolan conveyed the same interest to the defendants for $6.00. The purchase by Nolan was in reality for defendants, who obtained other lands and leases adjoining by purchase and by lease, and in the early part of June began pumping oil from the well already drilled, which proved to be a good well. During this year and after they had acquired plaintiff’s inter-, est, the defendants drilled another well on this lease, which also proved to be a good well.</p>

During the year following, the defendants drilled other wells, which proved even more productive. Some efforts were made by the plaintiff and defendants to come to some agreement. The defendants offered to reconvey to plaintiff and pay his share of oil if he would pay his share of all the expenses of operating, and also one third of the balance due on a leasehold mortgage they had given on this and other leases of defendants, the plaintiff’s share of which would amount to about $200. This the plaintiff refused to do, and in April, 1887, he had the defendants and Nolan arrested for conspiracy and was about to bring an action of ejectment or suit in equity, when it' was finally agreed that the plaintiff should pay defendants what they had paid Nolan and they should reconvey to him his one third inter<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>est; and the right of defendants to deduct one third of the expenses and costs of production from the proceeds of plaintiff’s one third of the oil already produced was left unsettled and to be determined according to the rights and equities of the parties in some form of action, the same as if the plaintiff had recovered possession by adversary proceedings.</p>

The proceeds of the one third of the oil up to June 4, 1887, was $4,596.41, and the one third of the costs and expenses of operating, including carpenters, rigs, boilers, engines, casing, tubing, tanks, torpedoes, expenses pumping, superintending, etc., amounted to $4,874.92; the expenses exceeding the receipts from oil.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b66-6" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[246,855,1185,968]]]'>As relevant to this case the first question in brief, is this: Is the plaintiff entitled to recover the value of the oil in tank without deduction for expenses of production? The most direct authority upon the first question which relates to the measure of damages is Lyon v. Gormley, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20Pa.%20261" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="58 Pa. 261">58 Pa. 261</a>. In that case the defendant, in constructing a railroad through plaintiff’s land, excavated coal which, supposing it to be his, he sold. In an action of trover the jury found for plaintiff the value of the coal in place $171.70, and also at the pit’s mouth $961.12 ; and the court below, reserving the question as to defendant’s liability, afterwards entered judgment in favor of the defendant on the reserved question. In the Supreme Court this judgment was reversed and judgment directed to be entered for plaintiff for the enhanced value of the coal as a chattel. There are cases in which trespassers have been allowed the expenses of mining in actions of trespass for mesne profits, after a recovery of ejectment, but in each and all of them it is only a bona fide occupant under color of title or an innocent or inadvertent trespasser who is so favored.</p>

Robinson, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20Pa.%20456" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="32 Pa. 456">32 Pa. 456</a>, in which both in the court below and in the Supreme Court, especial care seems to have been taken to limit the right of defendant to recoup the improvements, expenses, etc., to a bona fide occupant, who is defined to be “ one who supposes that he has a good title and knows of no adverse claim.” “ But,” says Lowree, J., in that case, “ one who forcibly dis-seizes another and makes such improvements or who makes them after action is brought to try title can have no claim to have his improvements estimated.” Ege v. Kille, <a href="/pa/84/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="84 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1053526" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0333-01">84 Pa. 333</a>, is among the latest cases. It was an action of trespass for mesne <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>profits. The defendants had mined ore in plaintiff’s land and were allowed to deduct their reasonable expenses of mining the ore from market value of ore. But this right was based entirely upon the fact that defendants were bona fide purchasers and occupants in good faith under color of title. Mercur, J., makes good faith the grounds for so deciding. He says, “ having acted in good faith in working the mines and in removal of the ore they should be chargeable for it only with its value in place.” Morrison v. Robinson was followed in this case. A case more nearly resembling this one is Noble v. Biddle, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20430" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="81* Pa. 430">81* Pa. 430</a>. This was an oil case tried in Warren county before Justice Trunkey. Noble, the defendant, held a tax title under which he had recovered in the first ejectment in the action for mesne profits; after judgment against him in the second ejectment lie was allowed for improvements, etc., but only on the ground that nis possession was bona fide and under color of title and then only to the extent that his improvements were permanent additions to the value of the property. No expenses for drilling dry wells, were allowed. This is the same rule observed in other courts: Green v. Biddle, <a href="/us/21/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Wheat. 1" data-case-ids="6136159" data-case-paths="/us/21/0001-01">8 Wheat. 1</a>; New Orleans v.

The English cases leave no doubt as to the rule. In Bainbridge on Mines, 1 Am. ed. 448, that learned author says: “In cases of actual fraud a court of equity will probably follow the cases decided at law which give compensation without any deduction for cost of working.” In Livingston v. Rawyards Coal Co. L. R., 5 App. C. 24, Lord Chancellor Hatherly says: “ There is no doubt that if a man furtively and in bad faith robs his neighbor of his property, and because it is under ground is probably for some little time not detected, the court of equity in this country will assert its authority to punish the fraud by fixing the person with the value of the whole of the property which he has so furtively taken, making him no allowance in respect of what he has so done as would have been justly made to him if the parties had been working by agreement. But when we once arrive at the fact that an inadvertance has been the cause of the misfortune, then the simple course is to make every just allowance for outlay on the part <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>of the person who has so acquired the property, and to give back to the owner so far as possible the full value of that which cannot be restored in specie.” This doctrine of the Lord Chancellor is the same as that adopted in the courts of law: Addison on Torts, 3 ed., 300; Martin v. Porter, 5 M. &amp; W. 351; Wild v. Holt, 9 M. &amp; W. 672; Morgan v. Powell, 3 Ad. &amp; E. 278. These last cases are approved in Lyons v.

They both lived in the same village, but were not on speaking terms. The defendant contended that plaintiff should reimburse him for his proportion of the expenses of the building, but this claim was not allowed, and, in the opinion of the Supreme Court affirming the judgment of the court, Sabgent, J., says: “ If a stranger enter on the land of another and make improvements by erecting buildings-, they become the property of the owner of the land. Were it not so, a person might gain a title by the commission of a trespass, and strip his neighbor of his estate or subject him to compulsory expenses under the pretext of improving his property; and this doctrine holds as well with respect to joint owners as to strangers. One joint tenant or tenant in common cannot erect buildings or make improvements on the common property without the consent of the rest, and then claim to hold until reimbursed a proportion of the moneys expended.” This case is cited with approval in the latest cases on this subject found in our reports: Dech’s App., <a href="/pa/57/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="57 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1010460" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0467-01">57 Pa. 467</a>; Beaty v.

    <p id="b71-7" data-blocks='[["BL_71.6",71,[177,981,1180,1076]]]'>There is no question as to the correctness of the learned referee’s findings of fact. The sole contention is as to the law applicable to the undisputed facts clearly and concisely stated in his report. The most important of these is, that defendants below, being tenants in common with plaintiff of an oil lease, conspired with one of their employees to obtain his interest in the lease at an undervalue, and by gross deception and fraud accomplished their object. As soon as he discovered the fraud that had been practiced upon him by his co-tenants, he tendered them the consideration he had received and demanded a reconveyance of his interest. Efforts to compromise resulted in an agreement that they would reconvey the same and reinstate him in possession upon his paying the amount they had expended in fraudulently procuring his interest in the lease. The right of defendants below “ to deduct one third of the expenses and costs of production from the proceeds of plaintiff’s one third of the oil already produced was left unsettled and to be determined according to the rights and equities of the parties, in some form of action, the same as if plaintiff below had recovered possession by adversary proceedings.”</p>
    <p id="b71-8" data-blocks='[["BL_71.7",71,[177,2065,1188,355]],["BL_72.1",72,[256,351,1181,407]]]'>This action of trespass was brought to determine the disputed matter thus excepted and reserved for future determination. The real question therefore before the referee was whether defendants below were entitled to deduct from the proceeds of plaintiff’s share of the oil produced, while he was-fraudulently dispossessed, a proportionate part of the expenses; incurred by them in producing the oil during that period. <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>According to their agreement, as found by the referee, that question is to be determined “ as if plaintiff below had recovered possession by adversary proceedings.” As to the measure of damages, therefore, the compromise under which the reconveyance of his interest in the lease was made, cannot operate as a condonation of the fraud, because the effect of that fraud on the question of damages is expressly excepted by the terms of the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b72-5" data-blocks='[["BL_72.4",72,[253,764,1182,663]]]'>As well stated by the referee, the question is this : “ When the owner of land has been deprived of the same tortiously or by fraud, and after recovery brings suit for mineral taken from the land by the trespasser, while in wrongful possession, and converted to his own use, is the plaintiff entitled as damages to the value of the mineral so taken, in place, or the value in its changed and improved condition as a chattel?” In other words, is the wrongdoer entitled in such suit to recoup from the value of the mineral as a chattel, the expense of mining or producing it ? The mere statement of the proposition in this form suggests the only answer that can be given unless it is the policy of the law to make the way of the transgressor easy and secure.</p>
    <p id="b72-6" data-blocks='[["BL_72.5",72,[252,1433,1180,404]]]'>The relation of the parties to each other, as co-tenants of the lease, and the fact that two of them after fraudulently dispossessing the other may have continued to use the property as it probably would have been used if they had all remained in possession, does not mitigate the tort, nor qualify the ordinary rule of damages. Co-tenants are bound to respect the rights of each other quite as much as if they were strangers in title.</p>
    <p id="b72-7" data-blocks='[["BL_72.6",72,[297,1844,1111,35]]]'>We find no error in the conclusions of the learned referee.</p>
    <p id="b72-8" data-blocks='[["BL_72.7",72,[1018,1896,367,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
