This is by virtue of the act of assembly, and the principle is too well settled to require argument or the citation of authority. I will refer, however, to Trimmer v. Heagy, <a href="/pa/16/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="16 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="410226" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0484-01">16 Pa. 484</a>; Peck v.

    <p id="b84-7" data-blocks='[["BL_84.7",84,[254,1532,1178,754]]]'>A number of cases were cited by the plaintiff in error, however, to show that a married woman who has made a parol gift of lands may by her acts be estopped from denying such gifts, as where she has encouraged her grantee to make improvements and do such acts as would amount to a fraud in case she were afterwards to repudiate them. We may dismiss this branch of the case with the remark that it was not tried below upon the theory of estoppel, and the learned court was not asked to instruct the jury upon it. Nor does the evidence furnish any sufficient grounds to apply such a principle, even though the cases cited sustained it. We may further remark that most of the cases refer to the transfer of personal property, which do not come within either the act of 1770 or the act of 1848, regulating the transfer by married women of their interest in real estate.</p>
