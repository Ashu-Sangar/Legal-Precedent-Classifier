The mode of assessment may be fair enough, liberal, indeed, so far as his particular property is concerned. His property may have been enhanced in value beyond the assessment, but that is not a good answer to his application to strike off the lien. The assessment must stand or fall together as a whole. The principle on which they are made, if false and vicious, must overthrow them as to all except those who are estopped by their own acts from deliying the validity of proceedings which they were active in presenting, though it may appear in many instances substantial justice would be done to individuals by enforcing the assessment as made.</p>

The Supreme Court has declared that “ farm land and suburban property cannot be assessed by the foot-front rule; ” that said rule “ as a practical adjustment of proportional benefits can apply only to cities and large towns where the density of population along the street and the small size of the lots make it a reasonably certain mode of arriving at a true result.” This, however, must, the master thinks, be taken in connection with what had been previously announced that the foot-front rule of equal valuation per foot-front is a convenient approximation where the property fronting on the street improved is of a kind and does not differ much in value, and that a law which faithfully and reasonably provides for a just assessment according to the benefits conferred, and does not impose unfair and unequal burdens, cannot be said to exceed legislative power of taxation when exercised for proper objects. If, then, it can be made to appear, in any case, that the property assessed by the foot-front rule for the paving, etc., of a street, though situate in the suburbs of a city, is of a like kind and character and occupied for like purposes, of about the same value and so equally affected by the improvements that the foot-front rule of assessments for the benefits done under the circumstances reach a just and equal apportionment of such benefits, that mode of assessment can be sustained, though the property may be, in the popular sense, both rural and suburban.</p>

It is certainly very strange that only the power to compromise and accept less than the assessment, and to refund the excess, when a greater sum than the compromise would give had been already paid, was conferred on the city, and that no provision was made to collect a just proportion of the benefits from those who might refuse to compromise and yet were not estopped by their own acts from denying the validity of the liens against their properties; that the city was given only the olive branch to extend and no sword to induce its acceptance. The compromise acts were for the benefit of those who had already paid, or who were estopped from denying the validity of the assessment. To others the city was placed in the position of a suppliant, having no power, as the law stands, to enforce the collection of a dollar, if the assessments already made are invalid.</p>

No suggestion of hardship, injustice or wrong is made by the plaintiffs, other than that which'arises from their present inconvenience, to wit: their inability to make a perfect title without getting rid of this lien. On the other hand, the direct and immediate benefit to the plaintiffs by the improvements on Forbes street, is unquestionably large. For this benefit, and towards paying the cost thereof, they have never paid or offered to pay a farthing. The testimony is conclusive on the point of benefit. Indeed, the fact that part of this very property was sold at the rate disclosed indicates how complete the change and how valuable the property has become. We do not contend that this is the result wholly of these improvements, but we do contend that, had all other things combined, and these streets not been made, we should have had no such condition as now attaches. And what the city asks, and all it asks, is that for whatever benefit is immediately dependent upon and springs from these improvements, payment shall be made. Is this unreasonable ?

The ‘ground of relief set up in the bill is, that when the ordinance was passed, and the work done for which the lien was filed, the lands of the plaintiffs fronting on Forbes street were rural in their character; and that for this reason the act of 1870, so far as it authorized the collection of the cost of the improvement by the foot-front rule, was unconstitutional under the rule laid down in Seely v.

The City of Pittsburgh, supra, could have been properly invoked, and that it would have been an answer to the city which it might not have been able to overcome. The plaintiffs, however, are not defending against an attempt to enforce the lien in a court of law, but they have come into a court of equity asking relief upon equitable principles ; and it becomes important to see in what position they stand, and what there is in the case to move the conscience of a chancellor. An examination of the bill and answer, and the testimony taken before the master, show that the work charged for in the statement on which the lien was entered was actually done by the city in front of the plaintiffs’ property, and was part of an extensive improvement on Forbes street. It also shows that the property of the plaintiffs has been greatly increased in value in consequence of the work so done. Another fact is equally evident, viz.: that the plaintiffs have strenuously resisted all efforts to collect the cost of this improvement or any part of it, and have neither contributed nor offered to contribute their equitable proportion towards it. They have waited until their lands have become practically urban, and are in demand for building purposes in consequence of the work done by the city, and now they come into a court of equity, and ask the court to enjoin the city against making any further effort to enforce its lien for the work which has brought their lands into market at greatly increased prices, and that the lien be canceled so that they may make a title to purchasers free from all future liability therefor. It is incumbent on one who seeks equity to do equity. The plaintiffs have derived great benefit from the expenditures of the city on Forbes street, for which they have paid nothing. If they have made any effort to do equity, to settle upon any fair and conscionable basis with the city, the evidence fails to disclose it. They stand, so far as the bill or the report of the master informs us, upon their strict legal rights.</p>

It is not denied that the work was done in good faith and in a proper manner, nor that the lien entered against the land owners was in accordance with both the statute and the ordinance. It is not denied that the plaintiffs have been greatly benefited by the work done, nor that they have refused to pay its cost. They now come to a chancellor and ask that their lands may be relieved of lien, because the remedy which the legislature provided for securing the city for its outlay has. been held inapplicable to rural property, and cannot be enforced. Standing on this legal proposition, without the payment or offer to pay for the benefit they have received, they ask the chancellor to lay his hands on the records of a court of law and cancel a lien regularly entered therein. It may be that the rule they invoke will prevent the enforcement of the lien in the court in which it is entered. If so, a court of law will apply the rule; but we must leave them to such relief as a court of law can give, until they can present some equitable ground for our interference. It is neither against law nor good conscience for the city of Pittsburgh to seek compensation for its expenditures in grading, paving and curbing Forbes street. If it adopt an inapt or an improper method, the court in which the proceeding is undertaken will administer the law and the city must bear the consequences of its mistake. The advantages to be derived from the delay, and the possible escape from payment, which may result from the adoption of a mistaken remedy by the city, will come to the landowners.
