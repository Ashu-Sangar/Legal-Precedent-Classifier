They accordingly executed two separate agreements of sale for their particular farms, both drawn by John J. Corson, a real estate agent and conveyancer of Norristown. Neither agreement refers in any way to the other. Both agreements are of the same date, March 11, 1884; contain covenants for the sale of the respective farms for the same consideration, except that the Wunderlich property is valued at $4,500, including a $2,700 mortgage thereon, and the Alexander property at $1,800, clear of incumbrances ; $250 of the consideration money to be paid upon the execution of the respective agreements, the balance on October 1, 1884, when deeds are to be executed at the office of John J. Corson ; and upon the payment of said sum, i. e. the balance of the purchase money over and above $250, the grantors shall execute proper deeds to the grantees at the expense of the latter, in fee simple, free of incumbrances and right of dower, etc. The grantors covenant to convey at the price fixed, in one contract $1,800, in the other $4,500, “in the manner and at the time,” not “ all ” times as printed in the bill, “ herein above provided.” Possession was to be given on April 1, 1884.

He paid no interest upon the $2,7.00 mortgage mentioned in the contract of sale. The property remained unoccupied until March, 1885, when Isaac S. Borneman took possession by consent of Wunderlich’s counsel, who gave written notice to Mrs. Alexander and Mr. Fellows on December 17,1884, that in accepting the keys by express or in taking possession of the Franconia farm, he did not intend in any way to release them from a specific performance of the Upper Salford premises.

If this were the whole case, surely a chancellor would be- constrained to grant specific performance to plaintiff. But the defendant proved as her defence that she was ready and willing at the time fixed for the completion of the respective titles, to wit: October 1, 1885, to fully comply by executing a deed to plaintiff.

    <p class="summary" id="b635-4" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[162,486,1182,1646]]]'>This was to be an exchange of properties. A conveyance by Wunderlich of his property represented the purchase money for that purchased by him from Mrs. Alexander. He was not ready with this deed on the day mentioned in the contract for its delivery. Can he afterwards tender it and come into a court of equity to compel what would have been ready to his hand on October 1, 1884, had he then been ready with the deed for his property ? Yes, if he has shown himself ready, desirous, prompt and eager. No, if he has been guilty of gross laches or inexcusably negligent in performing his contract, or there has been a material change of circumstances affecting the rights and interests of the parties: Tiernan v. Roland, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Pa.%20438" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="15 Pa. 438">15 Pa. 438</a>. The facts must answer: Possession is taken, by the two parties, of the' exchanged properties. Wunderlich sells the one he receives to Schultz, agreeing to give a deed therefor on the very day he is to receive title from Mrs. Alexander. Some time before October 1st, he sends messengers to Fellows notifying him and his mother-in-law to be ready at the time fixed. On September 26th, he signs and acknowledges a deed for his former property to Edward Fellows. All tipis shows that he was desirous, prompt and eager, and guilty of no laches. He then goes to Philadelphia to obtain his wife’s signature and fails. He does not accomplish it until October 24, 1884. Is his inability to perfect his title excusable ? In the case of Townsend v. Lewis, <a href="/pa/35/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="35 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="990472" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0125-01">35 Pa. 125</a>, where specific performance was decreed, the delay was due to the want of the wife’s signature at proper time. It is sufficient if the party has a good title at the time of the decree: Langford v. Pitt, 2 P. Wms. 630; 3 Lead. Cases in Equity, 445, 79. The delay is only from October 1st to November 8th, the time of tender of the deed. This could not be regarded as gross laches on the part of the old man.</p>

No, for both parties were in possession of the exchanged properties, just as they were on April 1st, before. <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>Fellows gathered the crops on the late Wunderlich farm and remained thereon until November 30th, when, without having given any notice of his intended removal, he sent the keys of the house, by express, to Wunderlich. It is true that about the middle of October, Fellows’ counsel addressed a letter to Wunderlich giving him a week to comply, and on October 23d, Fellows brought suit for damages. As he was then still in possession, the only effect of such a notice would be that he claimed damages, not that he rescinded the contract. The tenor of the letter has not been proved. It would seem doubtful whether any length of default will give a right to determine the contract in the absence of notice and where the presumption of abandonment is repelled by actual possession: 3 Lead.

    <p id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.6",640,[260,666,1179,301]]]'>Neither of the contracts in question contains any reference to the other, and thus upon their face they appear to be separate and independent: but, upon the evidence before him, the learned master has rightly found they are, in effect, interdependent parts of a single contract for an exchange of the properties therein described.</p>
    <p id="b640-6" data-blocks='[["BL_640.7",640,[254,976,1184,1431]]]'>According to the terms of their agreement, the parties respectively took possession of the property each was to receive, having first receipted to each other for $250 on account. Nothing more remained to be done until October 1, 1884, when appellant was to have conveyed her farm to appellee “ in fee simple free from all incumbrance, dower and right of dower,” and appellee was to have conveyed his farm to Edward R. Fellows, the son-in-law and appointee of appellant, subject to a mortgage of $2,700. That sum is the exact difference between the valuations of the respective properties, agreed upon by the parties as a basis of exchange, the one being valued at $1,800 and the other at $4,500. If the conveyances had been executed and delivered, as contemplated by the parties, the contract would have been fully executed, but that was not done. At the time and place appointed for exchange of conveyances, etc., appellant was present and ready to perform her part of the contract, but appellee failed to appear. The result was delay; but, inasmuch as time was not of the essence of the contract, he might have offered to perform his part of the agreement within a reasonable time thereafter, and thus put himself in a position to have demanded a deed from appellant. Subsequently, on November 15, 1884, he did tender a conveyance, but instead of being subject to a mortgage of $2,700, as required by the agreement, it was subject to an incumbrance of $2,754, and accrued interest, amounting in all to about $2,836. In the mean time, October 23,1884, Fellows, to whom the land was to have been conveyed, brought suit to recover damages for appellee’s failure to convey.</p>

      <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>The deed, tendered by appellee as above stated, was refused by both Fellows and appellant. Neither of them was bound to accept it, for the obvious reason that it was subject to a greater incumbrance than either of them had agreed to assume. Without further offer to comply with his part of the contract, appellee afterwards filed his bill against appellant for specific performance of her contract. While the case was pending before the master, a scire facias on the mortgage was issued and on the judgment obtained for $3,053.27, debt, past due interest, etc., the land was sold and conveyed by the sheriff to plaintiff in the writ. To these foreclosure proceedings, neither appellant nor her son-in-law, Fellows, was made a party.</p>
    <p id="b641-5" data-blocks='[["BL_641.4",641,[153,978,1183,559]]]'>The question is whether upon the facts, of which the foregoing is an outline, the decree of the court below can be sustained. We are of opinion that it cannot, for the reason that appellee never performed or offered to perform his part of the contract, according to its true intent and meaning, and for the further reason that in the mean time and without appellant’s fault, the circumstances of the parties have so changed that it is no longer in the power of appellee to convey the land as he agreed to do, and hence it would be inequitable to require appellant to convey her land and accept in return therefor such a deed as the decree contemplates.</p>
    <p id="b641-6" data-blocks='[["BL_641.5",641,[153,1545,1184,561]]]'>Specific performance of contracts for 'sale or exchange and conveyance of land is never a matter of right, but always of grace; but whether of right or of grace, it would certainly be most unjust and inequitable to decree specific performance of a contract for exchange of lands against the party, who at the appointed time was ready and willing to perform, and in favor of the other party, who was not only in default but has never offered to perform, according to the terms of his contract, and whose laches have rendered performance on his part impossible. Such a party should be remitted to his rights at law, if he has any.</p>

It is the business of courts, both of law and equity, to enforce, not to make contracts. If any provision of the agreement under consideration is clear and explicit it is that the farm was to be conveyed to Fellows on October 1st, subject to a mortgage incumbrance of 12,700, and no more. It is not alleged there was any mistake as to the amount. As we have seen, that was the difference in the values of the respective properties agreed upon as the basis of the exchange. The mode of adjusting that difference was by conveying, on the 1st of October ensuing the date of agreement, subject to that exact sum. Whether the excess over the sum named be much or little the court has no right to impose the payment thereof on a party who never agreed to assume it. The principles of equity applicable to the facts of this case are elementary, and hence citations of authority are unnecessary.</p>
