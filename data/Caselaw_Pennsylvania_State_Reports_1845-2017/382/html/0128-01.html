Herrick, a partner in a drive-in theater business located in Butler Township, Pennsylvania, brought an action in equity against the appellees, Aven B. Caldwell, Jr. and William L. Schultz, his copartners, praying for a decree of dissolution, an accounting and distribution of the assets, and the appointment of a receiver. After the appellees by answer joined in the prayer, the court by an order dated May 7, 1952 appointed a receiver and directed him to wind up the business of the partnership and subject to the court’s order to distribute the partnership assets after payment of the firm’s debts. On June 6, 1952 the court confirmed a sale of the partnership property for the sum of $45,500 and on July 22, 1952 the receiver filed a report of all receipts and disbursements of the partnership showing a balance on hand of $42,254.25 together with a proposed schedule of distribution. Exceptions filed to this report by appellant, and to a subsequent order of court by both parties to the controversy were ultimately resolved in appellees’ favor and a final decree was entered by the court on November 24, 1954<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> approving the schedule of distribution filed by the receiver.

The agreement provided, inter alia, that each of the appellees would contribute $5,000 to the joint venture and appellant all the remaining funds that should prove necessary to operate the business in excess of the $10,000 to be contributed by the appellees. The appellees were each to receive a salary of $50.00 per week for handling the managerial details of the theater.

On August 20, 1949 the appellees filed a bill in equity praying that the parties be adjudicated a partnership, each owning an undivided one-third interest and that the appellant account for the receipts and disbursements of the partnership.

The court below (Shumaker, J.) was of the opinion that this clause set forth the interest of the parties upon dissolution and therefore the agreement governed irrespective of the amount of capital which any partner may have contributed to the undertaking. It is appellant’s contention that this language of the agreement does not eliminate the operation of the Uniform Partnership Act and consequently his capital contribution of $11,682.30 should be allowed as a preferred claim.</p>

The provision would then appear to be sufficiently broad to embrace any accounting between the partners, not only as to the division of profits but capital as well, including the dissolution of the common venture. However, as worded, the question arises whether the parties intended the proportionate amounts to control in all instances. To ascertain the true meaning of the language, resort must be had to the entire agreement. The three preceding paragraphs of the agreement concern the respective amounts which each partner is to contribute to the business and then designate the interest Df the partners as outlined in paragraph 4 as their <em>share in the profits upon each monthly accounting. </em>The succeeding paragraphs speak of the partners sharing <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>“. . . in the profits at the end of each month in accordance with the share of the profits above mentioned.”, reference obviously being made to paragraph 4. When the clause in question is construed in the light of the whole agreement, the chancellor’s conclusion cannot be sustained. For all that appears, the parties intended the formula specified to be controlling solely in determining each partner’s share in the profits on the basis of monthly accountings. The agreement is wholly silent as to the distribution of partnership assets upon dissolution and relates only to the division of profits, not capital; consequently the statutory preference with respect to order of payment must prevail: <em>Lyman v.
