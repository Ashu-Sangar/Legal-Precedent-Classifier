The appellant asserted that we have discriminated against him in the matter of the filing and publication of dissenting opinions, — that there is one rule for him and a different rule for the other members of the court. Never once have we withheld, nor have we any intention of ever withholding, from publication in the official State Reports a dissenting opinion of any member of the court if in accord with established rules and practices. In the little more than three years that the appellant has been a member of this court he has filed and has <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>had published in the official State Reports, with this court’s full approval, more dissenting opinions than all the other members of the court combined.</p>

    <p id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.6",191,[180,1087,1154,975]]]'>It should at once be evident that the opinion which appellant sought by mandamus to have published in the official State Reports was not, in reality, a proper dissent. The order of this court in the <em>Tribune </em>case did not discuss, much less decide, the merits of the very important legal question involved. It merely held that there was nothing justiciable before us for decision, dismissed the petition without prejudice, and suggested that a proper test case might be presented. The appellant’s opinion, instead of confining itself to the subject-matter of the order, went on to discuss and decide the merits of the controversy which the petitioner had endeavored to litigate prematurely and as to which this court had expressed no views whatever. It is, to say the least, unfortunate that appellant saw fit to write and hand out for publication an opinion prejudging a question which has yet to come before this court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Furthermore, the value, importance and influence of dissenting opinions in the historical development and improvement of the law have been so tremendous<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a> and so well known to Bench, <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>Bar and legislative bodies that to arbitrarily deny the right to publish them in the official Reports' would be utterly repugnant to the spirit of the times, to our fundamental ideas of fair play and justice, to our lifetime practice, and to sound public policy.</p>
