    <p id="b237-3" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[196,668,1156,1539]]]'>The circumstances under which the question arose are as follows. The defendant corporation acquired title to premises at 156-162 North 20th Street, Philadelphia, by four separate conveyances during the period 1926 to 1928. On June 8, 1931, Paul J. Henon, Jr., and Daniel T. Henon, respectively president and secretary of the corporation, made a written application in their individual names to the executors and trustees of the Price Estate for a mortgage loan in the amount of $40,000 on the premises above mentioned, reciting in their application that they would become “bondsmen and future owners in fee” of the property. By deed dated June 17, 1931, the corporation conveyed its realty to the Henons, in fee simple. The corporate acknowledgment of the deed recited that it was executed and delivered “in pursuance of a resolution of said corporation made June 17, 1931.” On the same day the Henons executed a bond to the Price Estate in the sum of $40,000 secured by their mortgage of the premises in question. The Henons at once transferred the proceeds of the loan to the corporation. Approximately three weeks later, viz., on July 11, 1931, the Henons reconveyed the property to the company subject to the mortgage to the Price Estate. Between August 25, 1932, and September 22, 1936, the Commonwealth settled against the defendant corporation the capital stock and corporation loan taxes here involved.</p>

At the request of the Secretary of Revenue, one of the executors and trustees of the Price Estate executed an affidavit on May 1, 1935, reciting the giving of the mortgage by the Henons to the Price Estate, the subsequent conveyance of the premises by the Henons to the corporation under and subject to the mortgage, the foreclosure and sheriff’s sale of the mortgaged property and the execution and recording of the sheriff’s deed to the Price Estate. On May 7, 1935, the Secretary of Revenue notified the sheriff of Philadelphia County by letter that, since the amount bid at the sheriff’s sale was not sufficient to cover the amount of the mortgage debt, the Commonwealth had no claim against the real estate for the unpaid corporation taxes. The letter closed with instructions to the sheriff to disregard the Commonwealth’s claim for taxes due by the defendant corporation insofar as it related to the particular execution.

Indisputably, they were bona fide holders of the legal title to the property by virtue of the corporation’s deed of June 17, 1931. If they were not, then the mortgage security which they executed and delivered to the Price Estate for full value was a nullity. But, if the title was validly in the Henons, as it undoubtedly was, from June 17, 1931, to the time of their reconveyance of the property to the corpora<a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>tion <em>on </em>July 11, 1931, they were, <em>ipso </em>facto, predecessors in title to the corporation when they gave their mortgage to the Price Estate. To hold otherwise would require reading something into the amendment of 1933 that is not there. Incidentally, it was more than a year after the lien of the Henons’ mortgage had attached before the State <em>tax </em>was settled against the corporation.

The learned justice then went on to say, “The important question is, is there a mortgage of real estate, a real security? Ulrich’s [the straw man’s] mortgage exists. The terms of the mortgage, as well as the obligation in his bonds, are enforcible, the one against the land, the other against him.” Plainly enough, that was so because the straw man was the valid holder of the legal title at the time of the execution and delivery of his mortgage.</p>

The straw man paid the judg<a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>ment against himself and then sued his grantee to recover the amount of his loss. The facts being undisputed, the court below gave judgment for the plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed, holding that the straw mortgagor had a right to indemnity from his grantee (the real party in interest) for his loss on the principle that a grantor who conveys under and subject to a mortgage is entitled to indemnity from his grantee against loss suffered by reason of the grantor’s personal liability on his bond. The effect of the Superior Court’s ruling was to confirm that the straw grantee had valid legal title to the property when he mortgaged it and, consequently, he was entitled to the protection given any other titleholder who conveys subject to a mortgage. Here, again, the actuality of a straw man’s title to realty, with all of its legal implications, was recognized and fully respected.</p>

Such arrangements are by no means infrequent. In the instant case, it is conceded that there was neither fraudulent intent nor design on the part of anyone to the transaction. The loan applied for by the Henons, if made, was to be made by Pennsylvania fiduciaries from trust funds in their keeping. At the time of this transaction (1931), Article III, Section 22, of the Pennsylvania Constitution prohibited legislative authorization of investments by fiduciaries in the bonds or stock of any private corporation. According to then current opinion, a corporate bond secured by a mortgage to a trustee for the benefit of the bondholders was not considered a legal investment for Pennsylvania trust funds.

    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[268,461,1154,1647]]]'>For support of its ruling in the instant case, the learned court below relied on the opinion of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County in <em>Commonwealth v. Corner Realty Co., </em>41 D. &amp; C. 236, from which it quoted approvingly as had also the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County in <em>Commonwealth v. City Realty Co., </em>56 D. &amp; C. 156. The <em>Corner Realty Co. </em>case, supra, was the genesis of the idea that a straw grantee of a corporation for the purpose of mortgaging the property for a proper corporate use is not a predecessor in title to the corporation in relation to its reacquisition of the property from the straw. Certain it is that the rationale of that decision did not stem from anything contained in the 1933 amendment of Section 1401 of The Fiscal Code of 1929. A reading of the opinion in the <em>Corner Realty Co. </em>case impresses that it was chiefly an expression of moral indignation that a lien of the Commonwealth for subsequently settled State taxes could be junior to the lien of a prior encumbrance placed by a straw grantee. Thus, the court spoke of the corporation’s conveyance to the straw man as a “device [capable] of evading liability for corporate taxes imposed upon the real and corporate owner.” But, this is not a case of either tax collection or tax evasion. True enough, behind the lien here involved is the Commonwealth’s claim for some unpaid taxes; but, the question with which this case is concerned is the construction of a statute providing for the priority of the Commonwealth’s liens <em>under certain circumstances.</em>

      <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>The salutary purpose of the 1933 amendment of Section 1401 of The Fiscal Code of 1929 was to vouchsafe the security interest of a mortgagee who, for value, held a first lien upon real estate later conveyed to a corporation. Without the 1933 proviso, there existed the possibility that a tax lien of the Commonwealth, although junior in time, would, nevertheless, be senior in right to a first mortgage lien if and when the mortgaged property should be sold at judicial sale. The possible hardship in such a situation was palpaable; hence the 1933 amendment. Of course, if a mortgagee’s conduct, in circumstances such as are present in the instant case, is motivated by a desire to aid the grantor in evading payment of corporate taxes to become due the Commonwealth, then the transaction could be set aside or at least held ineffectual, as to the Commonwealth’s rights, because of the vitiating fraud. But, where the corporate conveyance of realty and the giving of a mortgage thereof are parts of a bona fide arrangement for the corporation’s benefit, the lien of the mortgage should be secured to the mortgagee unimpaired, as the 1933 amendment plainly allows. No just purpose will be served by fictitiously denying, subsequently, to the straw holder of the legal title status as a predecessor in title. And, that is especially so where, as here, there were no State taxes settled against the corporation at the time the mortgage lien attached and the full proceeds produced by the encumbrance went into the corporation’s treasury forthwith for proper business uses.</p>

This was patently unfair to a mortgagee who had loaned money in good faith to a predecessor in title of the corporation, with no knowledge or foreseeability that his mortgagor was not really borrowing for his own benefit but obtaining the loan for a corporation. This was recognized by the Superior Court in <em>Sweeney v. Arrowsmith, </em><a href="/pa-super/43/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="43 Pa.

The reasoning underlying this holding is found at p. 270 of the Court’s opinion: “. . . It cannot be reasonably supposed, therefore, that one selling land to an individual and taking a mortgage upon it from him for part of the price should foresee or actually contemplates the eventuality of its passing at some future time into the hands of a corporation— a failure of that corporation to pay its state tax upon capital stock — and the impairment, possibly the wiping out, of the security for the unpaid purchase money by the enforcement of a lien filed therefor by the commonwealth and taking precedence of the mortgage.”.</p>

We must assume in construing that part of Section 1401 in which we are particularly interested that the Legislature had in mind the decisions of the appellate courts and that the purpose of the 1933 amendment was to eliminate the hardship that resulted under a situation similar to that presented in the <em>Sweeney </em>case.

Assuming for purposes of this dissenting opinion, as the majority opinion does, that the terre-tenants had reason to believe that the Henons were straws for the corporation, the answer to the question posed by the majority, viz., “Why, then, was the mortgage of the Henons to the Price Estate not the mortgage of a predecessor in title to the corporation?” is, in my opinion, perfectly obvious.</p>
    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[284,1132,1155,1163]]]'>That legal title was in the Henons at the time the loan was given and that they therefore come within the literal meaning of the term “predecessor in title” cannot be questioned. However, the amendment must be construed with reference to the object intended to be accomplished by it in connection with the avowed purpose of the Code, and this is so even to the extent of restraining the meaning of general terms in order to clearly interpret the spirit and reason of the enactment: <em>Null v. Staiger, </em><a href="/pa/333/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="333 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1187943" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0370-01">333 Pa. 370</a>, 376, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20A.2d%20883" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="4 A.2d 883">4 A. 2d 883</a>. Since the 1933 amendment had as its purpose the prevention of an injustice, where the loan is made with notice that the corporation is the real mortgagor, the concept of injustice or possible hardship readily disappears, for the party taking the mortgage does so with full knowledge that the property will eventually pass into the hands of the corporation, and that the Commonwealth could in the future settle State taxes against the corporation and thereby completely wipe out the mortgagee’s security if the corporation were unable to pay.</p>

The terretenants in the instant case would have no standing to complain on this ground for, in my view of the amendment, they are in the same position as the mortgagee in the <em>Harper </em>case, knowing full well that by the express language of the Act of 1929 their security was postponed to State taxes which might be assessed against the corporation in the future. In the <em>Scranton c</em>ase there was no statute then in effect according precedence to the Commonwealth’s tax lien and in the <em>Davis </em>case the original mortgagor had no connection with the corporation either before or after the execution of the mortgage. In the <em>Harper </em>case, <em>Schover et al. v. Comet Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em><a href="/pa/284/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="284 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1092089" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0189-01">284 Pa. 189</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.%20413" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="130 A. 413">130 A. 413</a>, was cited with approval and quoted therefrom as follows: “. . . ‘Our first thought must always be the preservation of government [and the] enforcing of lawful means necessary to successfully carry it forward; the means should always be available for its continued security, not hindered or prevented by lesser rights which may suffer because of such enforcement. The common good is superior to individual or private rights; [the State] therefore has a <em>natural equity </em>[and is] fairly entitled to first rank in the list of claims that may be had against any or all property.

This case, which involved local taxes, stands for the proposition that where a public official charged with the duty of collecting delinquent taxes, is obliged to furnish the owner of the real estate with a correct and complete statement of taxes certified to him for collection, the payment of all taxes contained in such a statement is a discharge of the real estate from liability for taxes due and payable.</p>

In the instant case the Secretary of Rev-ea ue did not certify that the taxes were paid, but on the contrary the letter clearly disclosed that taxes were due. The statement in the letter that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania would have no claim against the real estate for corporate taxes since the amount bid at the sale was not sufficient to cover the amount of the judgment, was a misapprehension of the law by the Secretary of Revenue which in no way binds the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth’s lien for capital stock taxes against the real estate of a corporation is not divested by a sheriff’s sale, which realizes a sum insufficient to pay any part of, the taxes: <em>Commonwealth v.
