Each of them also suffered serious personal injury. They instituted the instant action in trespass against the City of Pittsburgh to recover damages for their personal injuries and property loss, alleging that the explosion, which caused the damage, was due to negligence of the City. The City impleaded two additional defendants as to whom compulsory non-suits were entered at trial and the case went to the jury against the City alone. The trial resulted in a disagreement of the jury. After the City’s motion for judgment on the whole record was denied, the case came on for retrial at which the jury returned a verdict for the defendant generally. The court en banc, being of the opinion that the question of the plaintiffs’ contributory negligence had erroneously been submitted to the jury, granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial and, from that order, the City took this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b279-7" data-blocks='[["BL_279.10",279,[171,1944,1152,261]]]'>The appellant’s contention is that the matter of the plaintiffs’ contributory negligence was properly left to the jury and that the action of the court en banc, based on the opposite view, was a mistake of law remediable by this court on review.</p>

A main gas line runs longitudinally under the surface of the street between the tracks. There was connected to the main gas line, opposite the plaintiffs’ property, a feeder or service line which lay three and one-half feet below the surface of the street and ran to the plaintiffs’ house which it entered through the front cellar wall. The earth surrounding the feeder line was firmly packed and the cellar wall was tight around the pipe. Immediately inside the wall there was fitted to the feeder line, in an upright position, a right-angle elbow from the top of which a gas line was run to the cellar ceiling and, thence, horizontally along the ceiling. As the learned trial judge correctly related the facts in his opinion for the court en banc, — • “For about a year before the explosion, and during intermittent periods for several years before that, there was a hole in the surface of Lowrie Street between the two sets of car tracks in front of plaintiffs’ house. It was about as wide as the ‘dummy’ [the space between the tracks], several feet long and as deep as eight inches at one point. Its contour and dimensions were such that trucks were violently jolted when their wheels traversed the hole. The contact of wheels and hole caused vibrations in plaintiffs’ house. These could be felt by the occupants; at times the electric lights ‘blinked’, windows rattled and the victrola needle ‘jumped the groove’. . . . Vibrations caused by truck wheels and the hole were carried by the firm earth beneath the street surface causing vibratory stress upon the ‘elbow’ in the service line just inside plaintiffs’ cellar wall. This long continued stress caused a ‘metal fatigue crack’ in the ‘elbow’. Gas escaped, through this crack, accumulated in the cellar and caused the ex<a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>plosion.” Although the plaintiffs had averred in their complaint that they had notified the City of the unusual nature and extent of the vibrations, they offered no evidence whatsoever at trial to support the averment.</p>
    <p id="b281-4" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[174,610,1158,1718]]]'>The trial court instructed the jury, inter alia, that the City, even if it had negligently failed to repair the street, was not negligent as to the plaintiffs in respect of their property, and therefore not liable to them, unless the resultant harm was such that it could or should have reasonably been foreseen by the City. The court then observed to the jury, “I don’t see any evidence in this case to warrant a finding that the plaintiffs were contributorily negligent. ... on the evidence in this case you could not make a finding to support the conclusion that the plaintiffs were contributorily negligent.” However, at the conclusion of the charge, counsel for the City requested the court to instruct the jury with respect to the matter of the plaintiffs’ contributory negligence. To this, the court acceded and thereupon charged the jury that the plaintiffs were aware of the unusual vibrations for some five years prior to the explosion and that, if the crack in the elbow of the gas line inside the cellar resulted from the transmittal of vibrations caused by vehicles hitting the hole in the street, it was for the jury to say whether the plaintiffs “used the care of a person of ordinary prudence with reference to the risk of damaging this pipe and causing a gas explosion due to those vibrations. If you feel that they did not use the care of a person of ordinary prudence to protect themselves against injury, then you could conclude that they were guilty of contributory negligence. If they are guilty of contributory negligence, then they could not recover in this case whether the City was negligent or not.”</p>

      <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>In awarding the plaintiffs a new trial, the court en banc stated in its opinion that “The charge as to contributory negligence, however, was in error. Evidence binding on plaintiffs revealed that they had knowledge of the vibrations caused by the hole and traffic for a number of years. In effect, the charge permitted the jury to find contributory negligence from this knowledge and the explosion. The decisive matter was whether plaintiffs, with knowledge of the vibrations, acted as persons of ordinary prudence would have acted to protect themselves from the risk involved. The burden was upon defendant to show what this conduct was, plaintiffs’ testimony not having disclosed it. So far as the testimony goes, plaintiffs may have taken all the precautions that the man of ordinary prudence would have taken. The issue of contributory negligence should not have been submitted at all.”</p>
    <p id="b282-4" data-blocks='[["BL_282.5",282,[268,1288,1152,1042]],["BL_283.1",283,[178,327,1150,210]]]'>The plaintiff in a negligence action, of course, has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the fault of the defendant as the proximate cause of the injury in suit. On the other hand, the burden of proving the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence falls squarely on the defendant. But, while the plaintiff has no duty to show affirmatively his freedom from fault, still he may not recover if the evidence in his own case convicts him of contributory negligence. As already indicated, the court en banc recognized that evidence binding on the plaintiffs revealed that for several years prior to the explosion they had knowledge of the nature and intensity of the vibrations and, further, that there was no evidence whatever to show whether the plaintiffs had or had not taken any precautions to insure their own safety. So far as the evidence discloses, the plaintiffs, with knowledge of the character of the vibrations, did nothing to guard against possible injury and loss. The real issue, <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>then, is whether the jury should have been permitted to consider whether the plaintiffs’ failure to take proper action with respect to the alleged vibrations constituted contributory negligence.</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[171,550,1157,1590]]]'>As the verdict for the defendant could have resulted, under the instruction of the trial judge, from the jury’s finding the plaintiffs guilty of contributory negligence, we shall for present purposes assume that the jury could have reasonably concluded that the explosion in the plaintiffs’ house from the gas leakage in the cellar was a consequence within the foreseeable risk created by the City’s long-continued neglect of the hole in the middle of Lowrie Street. If that were not so, then the case should not have been submitted to the jury at all since the plaintiffs would have failed to prove the City guilty of causative negligence. But, recurring to the question of contributory negligence, awareness of the possibility of harm inside the plaintiffs’ house from the vibrations due to the hole in Lowrie Street is as imputable to the plaintiffs as to the City. Indeed, the plaintiffs were, if anything, in a much better position to appraise the possibility of consequent harm from the vibrations than was the City. The City was, of course, chargeable with constructive knowledge of the existence of the hole in Lowrie Street. But, the plaintiffs, on the other hand, had actual knowledge of the unusual nature and intensity of the vibrations caused by vehicles striking the hole in Lowrie Street. Yet, despite the manifestations inside the house, from the outside jolting, to which the plaintiffs testified, they stood idly by for at least a year prior to the explosion without notifying the City of the condition known to them.</p>

Smith, </em><a href="/pa/357/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="357 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="472057" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0219-01">357 Pa. 219</a>, 222, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20534" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="53 A.2d 534">53 A. 2d 534</a>. Contributory fault may stem either from a person’s careless exposure of himself to danger or, as here, from his failure to exercise reasonable diligence for his own protection: see Restatement, Torts, §466. From the general verdict for the defendant in the instant case, it is not possible to say whether the jury, in denying the plaintiffs recovery, concluded that the injuries were not within the scope of a foreseeable risk or whether the plaintiffs neglected to take the precautions for their own safety which a person of ordinary prudence would have taken. But, in any event, whether the jury’s verdict was based on the one reason or the other, the learned trial judge did not err in permitting the jury to pass upon the reasonableness of the plaintiffs’ conduct in the circumstances.</p>

At about the same time her father and mother both detected the same odor and Mr. Good descended into the cellar to investigate. Mildred called the Equitable Gas Company to report the alarming symptom and, while still engaged at the telephone, a blast of explosion tore the instrument from her hand, lifted her from the sofa on which she was sitting, blew her father through a hole in the cellar <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>wall, and drove her mother halfway through the floor, breaking both her legs.

In the bed of this wide and busy thoroughfare, which accommodates two street car tracks, there had existed for many years a large hole estimated to be 6 feet long, 4 feet wide and from 8 to 10 inches deep. Some ten years prior to the accident a large water main had broken under Lowrie Street near the intersection of Lowrie and De-IIaven Streets. In. repairing this water main the City had dug a hole deep enough for a man to stand in, but in refilling the hole the work was done in such a fashion that a depression resulted which sank deeper as the years passed by. Although occasionally something was done to fill up the hole, the City for one vear prior to the explosion of February 2, 1948, had bestowed no attention on this threat to the well-being of the entire neighborhood and the travelling public.</p>

However, when later the Court, at the end of its charge, did put contributory negligence into the case, it was too late for the plaintiffs’ attorney to argue that proposition.

The law does not require anyone to do a vain and useless thing, and nothing could be more superfluous than the plaintiffs’ notifying the City of the continuing miniature earthquake which unceasingly affected the inhabitants as well as the inanimate contents of the houses in the neighborhood of Lowrie and DeHaven Streets.

But the Majority goes on to say that the plaintiffs were “in a much better position to appraise the possibility of consequent harm from the vibrations than was the City.” There is not the slightest intimation in the entire record that the plaintiffs knew or could have known that the vibrations were boring into the walls of the iron pipe. The City employs engineers, scientists and chemists; it maintains laboratories and testing stations. Certainly the City was in a superior position to know and ascertain the scientific effect of vibrations on an iron pipe buried in the ground than two old people living out the declining years of their lives in the seclusion of their home. To charge these people with contributing to the destruction of their home because they stayed home and minded their own affairs is to me <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>the most illogical and cruelest application of the doctrine of contributory negligence that I have encountered in all my years at the law. The plaintiffs had as much right to assume that they would have the vigilance of the City’s servants in protecting them from an invasion by gas resulting from City negligence as that they ivould be protected from an invasion by burglars and robbers. When a citizen pays taxes for street maintenance he has the right to expect compensatory damages for losses due to injuries resulting from a badly maintained street. If, because of the depression on Lowrie Street, a truck had lost direction and crashed into the plaintiffs’ home there would be no doubt of the City’s responsibility for the damage done. How does that rule change because the invasion comes through gas in the cellar rather than by a truck in the parlor when it is obvious that the hole in the street is the proximate cause of the eventual smashup ?</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[188,1396,1151,491]]]'>If a truck had broken the pipe directly beneath the crater and an explosion had followed, no one could question that the City would be liable for the resulting damage. How does the responsibility evaporate merely because the pipe broke at a point several feet and several months distant from the original negligent act, especially when the negligence was a continuing one, each day adding its straw to the camel back of the eventual explosion?</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.6",291,[187,1898,1150,434]],["BL_292.1",292,[245,342,1154,1424]]]'>As above indicated, the City argues that had it known of the vibrations, it would have repaired the hole, but the City’s responsibility to repair the hole did not depend only on preventing a gas explosion in die plaintiff’s house. It owed as well a duty to the travelling public to repair the hole. Once it is admitted, as it must be, that the non-repair of the hole constituted a tortious act, the City was responsible <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>for <em>all </em>untoward events flowing from that tort. To me it is inconceivable that a tortfeasor can escape responsibility simply because his tortious act takes a slightly different (but thoroughly natural) turn from that which usually follows the commission of such a tort. To carry out the reasoning of the Majority in this case would mean that so long as the tort-feasor can show that the damage done was something unusual, it then must be regarded as unexpected, therefore unforeseeable and consequently not compensable. The law, however, is not so illogical, unreasonable or unfair. Mr. Justice Mestrezat, one of the great jurists in the history of this Court, stated the law of proximate cause as follows in the case of Wallace <em>v. Keystone Automobile Company, </em><a href="/pa/239/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="239 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="996008" data-case-paths="/pa/239/0110-01">239 Pa. 110</a>, 117: “The proximate cause of an accident imposing liability is the dominant and efficient cause which acts directly or necessarily sets in motion other causes, not created by an independent agency, and which naturally and reasonably results in injury which as a consequence of the primary act, under the circumstances, might and ought to have been anticipated in the nature of things by a man of ordinary intelligence and prudence, although, in advance, <em>it might have seemed improbable </em>and the precise form in which the injury actually resulted could not have been foreseen.”</p>
    <p id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[244,1787,1149,268]]]'>Thus, even though it might have seemed improbable that the vibrations could have weakened the gas pipe, this improbability did not save the City from responsibility when it is clear that the vibrations were causing other obvious damage.</p>

Bailroad employees negligently permitted the perforation of a railroad car containing 7,000 gallons of naphtha, most of which ran out on to the ground and found its way to a catch basin. The car, still running naphtha, was now moved on the tracks and past a switch light which ignited the dripping naphtha. The resulting flame followed the course of the naphtha baek to the catch basin and from the catch basin into a sewer which terminated at the mouth of a culvert near a bridge on which the plaintiff was standing. An explosion from the naphtha occurred close to this point and the plaintiff was injured. The defendant company argued that the plaintiff’s misfortune was too far removed from the negligent act of the railroad to hold it responsible. This Court held to the contrary. Justice Mestrbzat, writing for the Court, said: “We must assume, as the jury has found, that the naphtha was ignited by the negligent act of the defendant’s employees in drawing the punctured car near the burning switch light when the naphtha was flowing from it. The natural and inevitable consequence of that act would be apparent to the dullest intellect and must be presumed to have been foreseen by any employee who possessed the requisite intelligence to perform the duties required of him in operating a car containing such a dangerous substance as naptha. . . . Possessed of a knowledge of these facts and knowing generally the highly combustible character of naphtha, the defendant’s employees in removing the car, under the circumstances, must have foreseen the fact that if the naphtha was once lighted the fire would be uncontrollable and would naturally follow the naphtha in its course and so far as it flowed. Nothing could be more reasonable or probable, and hence to be anticipated by the defendant’s servants who were bound <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>to foresee the ordinary and natural consequences of their conduct.”</p>

To say, as the Majority says, that the plaintiffs here should have known of the results of the vibrations is not the controlling feature in this case at all. If the City was charged with knowledge of the reasonable and probable consequences resulting from the non-repair of the Lowrie Street hole, it did not matter whether the plaintiff knew or did not know of those possible consequences. A motorman running down a prostrate man on the tracks cannot escape responsibility by saying that the prostrate man did not shout to tell the motorman of his danger.</p>

In tbe <em>Paulscak </em>case tbe defendant placed a large- electric signboard and motor on top of a 60-year old building. In time tbe vibrations from tbe motors weakened a wall of tbe building causing it to fall and injuring tbe plaintiff.

The Trial Court charged the jury that the defendant was not bound to anticipate the action of the air currents, and, if the fire was so conveyed, this would constitute an intervening agency which would relieve liability. This Court held the instruction to be in error: “This overlooked the fact that the presence of such a condition might have been, or the jury could say ‘should have been’ observed, and that, in view of the atmospheric conditions, it might have been obvious that the fire would cause the injury which did result. ‘No doubt a hurricane or a gale may be such as to be plainly out of the usual course of nature, and therefore to be pronounced by the court as the intervention of a new cause. . .

The decision of the Majority, as I view it, can only throw consternation into the ranks of precedent and authority, confusing principle and practice until the legal profession is left in a quandary as to what advice to impart to injured citizens seeking their services and intervention in behalf of justice. The rule of law that there is no wrong without a remedy seems to have suffered a serious setback in this case. After a meticulous reading of the 352-page record, I can only conclude that the plaintiffs lost what was their most prized possession, their own home, through some outside fault.
