The lower court said that testatrix’s son Benny and daughter Sophie could rent the house; testatrix said in the clearest possible language that they could not rent or sell the house — is that carrying-out testatrix’s intention? The effect of the lower court’s decision is that the husband of testatrix could not occupy property 3008 N. 7th Street in spite of the fact that testatrix specifically said that her husband was to be allowed to occupy the property as long as he lives. In other words testatrix’s children could figuratively throw their father into the street. Is that carrying out the intent of testatrix? The lower court frankly discards all the rest of testatrix’s language after the words “for life”, as if they had never been written, and makes meaningless and nugatory testatrix’s clear language and intent.</p>
