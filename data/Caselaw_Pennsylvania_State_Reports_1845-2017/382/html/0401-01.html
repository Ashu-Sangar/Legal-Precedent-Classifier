Michener, prior to his recent death, was the owner of four lots of land having a combined frontage of 215 feet on the north side of Township Line Road and a depth of 169 feet on the east side of Bewley Road, in Haverford Township, Delaware County. A dwelling house on the property was occupied by Michener and his family for more than 30 years, but he moved away in 1952, having entered into an agreement to sell the property to E. C. Bierkamp. The agreement was conditioned on the purchaser being able to obtain the right under the zoning law to build a store on one of the lots.</p>

Michener, as owner, and Bierkamp, as equitable owner, applied to the Township Building Inspector for a permit to erect a one-story brick store building, 30 feet by 60 feet, on one of the lots, for the purpose of conducting therein a retail establishment for the sale of linoleum, tile, and other flooring. The Building Inspector refused the permit. The Township Board of Adjustment, on appeal, refused a variance on the ground that the applicants had not shown the existence of any hardship by reason of the zoning regulations that was different from that of the other property owners in the district.</p>
    <p id="b425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[133,1133,1154,1160]],["BL_426.1",426,[259,347,1147,99]]]'>Michener and Bierkamp appealed from the order of the Board to the Court of Common Pleas. While the proceedings were there pending Michener died and his widow, Hazel S. Michener, who succeeded to the ownership of the property as surviving tenant by the entire-ties, was allowed to intervene. The court at first decided that the Board should have granted a variance but subsequently, in its final decree, affirmed the Board’s order and dismissed the appeal. This was because its attention had been called to the fact that each of the three deeds by which Michener acquired title to the lots contained a covenant whereby he agreed for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, with the grantor, his heirs and assigns, never to erect upon any part of the ground certain enumerated kinds of buildings, among them a store, and not to convert any building thereon into a store. The court held that therefore the hardship complained of by the applicants did not grow out of the zoning ordinance but out of these restrictions in the deeds of title, and since the court could not remove the restrictions, <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>a variance permitting the erection of a store should not be granted.</p>
    <p id="b426-4" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[258,458,1151,1878]]]'>The reason thus assigned for the court’s decision was not a valid one. Zoning laws are enacted under the police power in the interest of public health, safety and welfare; they have no concern whatever with building or use restrictions contained in instruments of title and which are created merely by private contracts. If these applicants were to succeed in obtaining a variance relieving them from the restrictions of the zoning ordinance they would still be subject to the restrictions contained in their deeds, but the enforcement of those restrictions could be sought only in proceedings in equity in which the grantors, their representatives, heirs and assigns, would be the moving parties. As is well said in Bassett on “Zoning,” (ch. 9, pp. 184-187): “Contracts have no place in a zoning plan. Zoning, if accomplished at all, must be accomplished under the police power. It is a form of regulation for community welfare. Contracts between property owners or between a municipality and a property owner should not enter into the enforcement of zoning regulations. . . . The municipal authorities enforcing the zoning regulations have nothing whatever to do with private restrictions. Zoning regulations and private restrictions do not affect each other. . . . It is obvious that the zoning and the private restrictions are unrelated. One is based on the police power, the other on a contract. The municipality enforces the former by refusing a building permit or ousting a nonconforming use. A neighbor having privity of title enforces the latter by injunction or an action for damages. . . . Courts in trying a zoning case will ordinarily exclude evidence of private restrictions, and in trying a private restriction case will exclude evidence of the zoning. This is done on the grounds of immateriality.”</p>

      <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>The fact that there were building restrictions in the deeds was wholly irrelevant in the appeal before the court on the question whether a variance should have been granted by the Board under the zoning ordinance. The private parties who alone possessed the right to enforce those restrictions were not before the court. It might be that they would never seek such enforcement, or that for some reason they had waived or lost their right so to do, or that, because of neighborhood changes or because the restriction had ceased to be of advantage to the covenantees,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> the restriction would no longer have been enforceable. Accordingly it has been uniformly held that any consideration of building restrictions placed upon the property by private contract has no place in proceedings under the zoning laws for a building permit or a variance: <em>Pumo v.

Michener attempted to prove such hardship by testimony that Township Line Boad had been widened since he originally moved to the property and had <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>become a main artery of travel; that there were high-speed trolley lines on West . Chester'Pike which intersects with Township Line Road some 400 feet to the west of his property; that thousands of vehicles pass the intersection of these two highways daily and some of them occasionally block the entrance to the property while waiting to proceed across the intersection; that there is a gas station at the intersection on the same side as his property and another one at the opposite corner. There was also testimony to the effect that across Township Line Road, which separates Haverford Township from Upper Darby Township, there are some business establishments and an alleged general commercial trend. A real estate agent testified that he had attempted for over seven months to sell Miehener’s property as a residence but had not received any offers. Michener’s chief complaint was that across Township Line Road was a diner which was open 24 hours a day, that it catered to the trade of truckers who indulged in loud and boisterous talk which, added to the clatter of dishes and the music from a juke box, caused such disagreeable noise that finally, because of this and the other conditions referred to, he was obliged to move to another location.</p>

The operation of the trolley cars, the increase in vehicular traffic, the fact that perhaps the district was no longer exclusively residential, — all these conditions did not constitute any hardship which especially affected the Michener property; on the contrary they applied to the entire area. The law is well established that a variance may be granted only where a property is subjected to a hardship unique or peculiar to itself as distinguished from one arising from the impact of the zon<a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>ing regulations on the entire district.

As a matter of fact, the court below, in its final opinion, said that “to apply this law to the instant case would suppose that the tract covered by the restriction against stores has changed in its character and that the restriction has not been enforced. Such is not the case; from the testimony, we find no evidence which would indicate that this tract is not wholly residential, with the exception of the gas station at the comer of County Line Road and West Chester Pike.

    <p id="b432-9" data-blocks='[["BL_432.12",432,[248,1323,1148,654]]]'>The net result of the majority opinion is this: A Judge sitting in the Court of Common Pleas can grant a variance to a property owner in defiance and in violation of the building restriction on his lot or any other covenant running with the land. One day later the same Judge, sitting in the same chair and in the same courtroom will be compelled to grant an injunction sur a complaint by the owner of the dominant tenement to restrain the servient property owner from doing exactly what he authorized him to do one day before.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> The feelings of the property owner in such eventuality can be easily imagined!</p>
