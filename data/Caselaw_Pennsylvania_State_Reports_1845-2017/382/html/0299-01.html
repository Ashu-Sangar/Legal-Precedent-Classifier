The enforcement of the Act is lodged with the Department of Agriculture, and provides that the secretary shall appoint special agents to enforce the provisions of the Act, as well as such additional agents as may be necessary to maintain supervision over the industry. Section 19 of the Act provides for payment of license and registration fees to the Secretary of Agriculture, who in turn is to pay these moneys into the State Treasury. It further provides that “such moneys shall constitute a special fund and are hereby <em>permanently appropriated to the Department of Agriculture for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this act.”</em>

In each of those cases the statute made no mention as to the disposition to be made of the funds collected, or provided that they should go into the general fund. Contrary to the city’s contention, the inquiry is not directed to the question whether the cost of enforcement against one person might exceed $50.00 per year, but whether the aggregate fees collected from the industry would be sufficient to pay the probable cost of regulating the bottlers as a whole. See <em>Honorbilt Products, Inc. v.

No such application was made. Nor do we consider the fee a nominal one. The uncontradicted evidence shows that the fees collected under Section 19 were sufficient during the thirty odd years during which the Commonwealth has enforced the Act, with balances left over each year, and therefore the fees were true license fees. Using the same argument as the city uses, — that inspection of the Act shows that the fees would not produce sufficient sums to enforce it, — an inspection of the Act also reveals that the fee of $50.00 per plant aggregates a sum far greater than the mere clerical expense involved in the enforcement.</p>
