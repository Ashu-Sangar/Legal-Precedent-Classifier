      <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>The Commonwealth contends that it is an “heir” entitled under the laws of the decedent’s domicile, to his.personal property, by virtue of the Intestate Act of 1947. The Federal Government gave the money in question to the deceased veteran and furnished him with free hospitalization and care with the obvious intention of benefiting him and if he left no will, his wife, next of kin or heirs, meaning his relatives. Whether viewed as a practical matter or from the language of the Act or both, there was no intent to benefit the States of the Union. The intent, we repeat, was to benefit the veterans and, if they left no will, their respective wives, next of kin or heirs, using that word according to its common meaning or usage, viz., relatives in various degrees of consanguinity. Congress obviously had no intention of giving to another sovereign this personal property which it generously granted to a veteran on certain specified conditions. A state could take under the language, objective and clear meaning of this Act only if it was a legatee under the veteran’s will, since it obviously was not a next of kin or heir in the customary meaning of those words. The Intestate Act never calls or refers to or terms or describes the Commonwealth as a next of kin or heir. The Act does use the word “descend” — it would be just as logical to claim that the Commonwealth was a “descendant” as to claim it was “a next of kin or an heir.” Only in the loosest imaginable sense has a “State” ever been referred to or could be referred to as a next of kin or heir. Cf. Dictum in <em>Davis Estate, </em><a href="/pa/365/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="365 Pa. 605" data-case-ids="1225607" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0605-01">365 Pa. 605</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20643" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="76 A.2d 643">76 A. 2d 643</a>; and <em>Hannebauer Estate, </em>71 D. &amp; C. 330. Those cases are further distinguishable by the fact that they were not attempting to define the word “heir”, and more particularly they did not involve and were not attempting to interpret the Congressional Act. The words “next of kin” or “heirs” of personal property <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>considered in conjunction ejusdem generis with the prior word “spouse”, as well as the origin of the fund, and the reason for the Act — all of these make clear that the Commonwealth is not a next of kin or heir within the meaning of the Act.</p>
