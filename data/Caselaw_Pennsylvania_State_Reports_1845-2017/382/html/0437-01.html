The evidence in this ease is unfortunately not clear with respect to a number of im<a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>portant facts. However, viewing the testimony in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the jury could have found as follows.</p>
    <p id="b461-5" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[147,506,1148,1103]]]'>On the westerly side of the road is <em>a berm of approximately 1¡. feet in width </em>which falls off rather sharply a distance of approximately 3 feet into a 10 inch deep (wide?) drainage ditch (for the highway). Defendant owns a naptha plant which is located between 200 and 300 feet west of the place where the accident occurred. A 2 inch gas line runs from the plant down toward the road. The line is made up of various joints of pipe through which natural gas is transported from the plant in an easterly direction. A wooded area begins approximately 25 feet west of the road. As the gas line emerges from the wooded area into a brush-cleared area, the pipe line becomes visible because half of it is buried and half is above ground. About 5 to 6 feet from the edge of the road, the 2 inch gas line emerges from the ground and passes over the ditch about 2 feet above the bottom of the ditch and then follows the incline of the bank toward the road; as it nears the road it enters and passes through the ground under the road.</p>

Plaintiff testified that the right wheel of the truck was in the ditch and its left wheel was on the berm of the highway. A mechanic, who went to repair the gas line, testified that the gas line had been broken off at the elbow or swing, bent in a sort of a semi-circle, and again broken off, <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>pulled out of the union, which was approximately 11 feet from a connection back to the union, and the pipe was bent in a sort of semi-circle shape which would break it out of the cast iron elbow above. The evidence was so contradictory and confusing that it is very difficult, if not impossible to ascertain <em>exactly </em>where the break in the pipe was in proximity to the ditch or to the highway.</p>

Helm lighted several flares and as he walked with one of them near the vicinity of the broken gas pipe there was an explosion and he was “engulfed in a ball of fire.” His clothing caught on fire, and he suffered burns of the hands, right arm, back, legs, hips, face and ears. The jury returned an unusual verdict, to wit, a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against the gas oil company in the sum of $17,500, but not against Ewing. However, the jury made a special or specific finding: “Doyou find that Frank Ewing, (additional defendant), is liable over to defendant, South Penn Oil Company, for any damage that may be suffered by the latter as a result of your verdict?” The jury answered “Yes.”</p>

A high degree of care must be exercised by those who erect or operate dangerous instrumentalities. Whether a failure to run the gas pipe line underground amounts to negligence is sometimes a question for the jury and sometimes a question for the Court. The narrow question in this case boils down to whether we can say as a matter of law that the gas oil company could not have reasonably foreseen the likelihood of harm to the plaintiff (or one of his class) resulting from the erection of its pipe line above the ground in an area so close to the highway.</p>

M. A. Sauter, official caretaker of Route No. 666 in Sheffield Township, testified that the exposed gas pipe rested within the 50 foot right of way, and that it was part of his official du<a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>ties to maintain the ditch involved in the accident: “Q. Is it a part of your duties as caretaker of roads in Sheffield Township to take care of not only the paved portion but the drainage ditches on either side and the full right of way that you make use of? A. That is right.”</p>
    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[158,674,1147,269]]]'>In the <em>Blassotti </em>case, the Court made it very clear that: “The ditches alongside and draining the road, when worked on by the supervisors as part of the road, are just as much included in the public road as the beaten track, (Ide v. Lake Twp., <a href="/pa/191/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="191 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="907088" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0182-01">191 Pa. 182</a>.)”</p>
    <p id="b469-6" data-blocks='[["BL_469.6",469,[154,954,1151,1272]]]'>I cannot grasp from the Majority’s Opinion on what theory this Court reverses the jury’s decision. The Majority says that “there is no evidence that the truck ever ran into or ran across or struck the gas pipe.” There was testimony that less than an hour and a half before the accident, the pipe was intact and after the accident the pipe was severed. At the point of the accident the horizontal pipe entered an elbow which guided it vertically into the ground. After the accident the elbow was broken and the pipe bent into semi-circular shape. The presence of the truck at this very point spells out conclusively the cause of the breakage. However, if the truck did not break the pipe the defendant company would be liable on even a more serious and impelling charge of negligence for allowing a 2 inch gas pipe to remain open to the world. The quantity and force of the gas emerging from the pipe after the ignition was such that it shot flames unceasingly to a height of ten feet. To allow an open gas pipe discharging gas which, upon contact with any spark, shoots death, mutilation and destruction for at least a radius of ten feet is obviously negligence per se.</p>
    <p id="b469-7" data-blocks='[["BL_469.7",469,[156,2239,1144,98]],["BL_470.1",470,[261,335,1147,771]]]'>The only question in this case is foreseeability. Could the defendant company reasonably foresee that <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>a wheel or wheels of a passing vehicle could momentarily slip off the paved portion of the road and strike the pipe? The pipe was only 3 or 4 feet away from the road which was bordered by a berm. It is a matter of common knowledge that vehicles and especially trucks often allow their lateral wheels to slip fleetingly on to the berm and even on to the soft earth next to the berm. The company here may not defend on the basis that no perfect driver would allow any part of his vehicle to touch the drainage ditch in which the exposed pipe lurked. One protects not against perfection but against what may likely happen. The drainage ditch was so shallow and bevelled that it could well at night seem to be part of the berm.</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[256,1127,1150,654]]]'>The lower Court in sustaining the verdict well said: “Surely the jury gave its verdict because it believed that defendant was negligent in permitting the gas line to be at the edge of the ditch, thereby rendering the explosion possible, which, as above indicated, evidently occurred on account of the breaking of the pipe by Ewing’s car. <em>If the portion of the gas line which was sticking out above the ground had been burned, or if the protruding portion had been a short distance from the right of wag, the accident would, in all probabilitg, not have occurred” </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.6",470,[254,1803,1150,479]]]'>Allowing the pipe line to extend above the surface constituted sheer indifference to the safety of the general public. This exposed state served no useful purpose to the company and offered a hazard to anyone who happened to be in its vicinity. It imperilled not only vehicles but pedestrians lawfully in the area. A venomous snake in the grass- could not have been more dangerous to the unwary traveller than this pipe line hiding in the bushes and weeds.</p>

      <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>The cases cited by the Majority cannot justify a reversal of the verdict here. The Majority cites <em>Dahlstrom v. Shrum, </em><a href="/pa/368/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="368 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="1230341" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0423-01">368 Pa. 423</a>, in which Justice Allen Stearns said: “The test of negligence is whether the wrongdoer could have anticipated and foreseen the likelihood of harm to the injured person, resulting from his act.”</p>
    <p id="b471-3" data-blocks='[["BL_471.4",471,[152,733,1153,325]]]'>But that is exactly what the plaintiff maintains here, namely, that the South Penn Oil Company could have anticipated and foreseen the likelihood of harm to himself and others; and the jury, being given that very question to resolve, decided that the company should have anticipated the resulting harm.</p>

But in that case signs had been posted warning travellers of “soft and dangerous shoulders” where a trench was being excavated. But there was no warning in the case at bar. At most a rod some 5 feet high with no indication as to what it meant stood up above the bushes but it was located some 3 feet beyond the exposed pipe. A lighthouse that throws its beams on the distant side of treacherous rocks cannot be of much aid to ships seeking its guidance and protection.</p>
