Preliminary objections were sustained as to the real estate which contained coal and fire-clay, and the bill as to said land was dismissed, on the theory that the will created a trust with respect to such real estate, and that an absolute gift to named children of testator had been cut down by subsequent testamentary language to a lesser estate.

On the basis of this assumption, it is clear that testator gave his residuary estate in fee simple to his named children; and that after this gift he expressed his will and desire that the coal and fire-clay (in the real estate which he had already devised to his children and which was then or in the future covered by leases) should not be sold unless the sale was approved by all of his children or their heirs; and in the event of the sale of the coal and fire-clay, a small part of the proceeds, namely, a sum equivalent to <em>Q% </em>of the proceeds of such sale, should be invested and the income paid to his wife for her life and at her death the sum be divided among testator’s named children, share and share alike.</p>

He then directed, not by precatory words but by mandatory words [namely “will” and “direct”], that the coal and fire-clay should not be sold unless the sale was approved by all of his children <em>or their heirs. </em>It will be instantly noted that testator did not expressly create a trust as to the coal and fire-clay included in his residuary estate, although <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>in other portions of his will he had demonstrated that he knew how to create an express trust if he so desired. It is also important to note that there was no gift over to third parties in the event of sale or failure to sell; and the prohibition against sale contained no period of duration and no time limit. The nearest approach to a time limit was that a sale had to be approved by all of his children or their heirs. Such an indefinite provision might violate the rule against perpetuities; or if it was intended to terminate in the event of a sale, it terminated at testator’s death because the (some of the) proceeds of sale were to be paid to testator’s children upon the death of testator’s wife, and she predeceased him.</p>
