Lenore Cesarone Lloyd was employed for many years by Seligman &amp; Latz, which was originally a partnership but subsequently incorporated. On November 18, 1949 she signed a contract as employee, party of the third part, with Seligman &amp; Latz, Incorporated, party of the first part, and the plaintiff, Seligman &amp; Latz of Pittsburgh, Inc., their subsidiary, party of the second part. This contract signed in triplicate recited the highly distinctive Antoine methods, technique and styles which parties of the first and second part wished to be preserved for themselves; and in consideration of plaintiff training defendant without expense to her, <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>and giving her employment at a weekly salary plus the commission specifically set forth therein, defendant agreed to the following pertinent restrictions:</p>
