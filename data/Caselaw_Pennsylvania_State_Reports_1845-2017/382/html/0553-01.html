It also there developed that such modification of the order was the only matter seriously <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>pressed by the appellant. Following the appeal taken from the order, the hearing judge filed an opinion of some length in support of the order as entered.

The defendant was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under the Nonprofit Corporation Law of May 5, 1933, P. L. 289. It obtained its charter from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County on May 22, 1944. The application for the charter stated that the purposes for which the corporation was formed were to encourage the study of Jewish literature, arts and cultural pursuits, together with a number of similar objectives. About nine years later Harry Alan Sherman, as attorney for Samuel Louis Sherman and Paul Ginsburg, presented a petition in the court below as of the original term and number at which the charter was granted, praying that the petitioners be permitted to intervene specially as parties. They alleged that the incorporators perpetrated a fraud upon the court by misrepresenting the purposes of the corporation, that “its true and clandestine purpose being the establishment of a Communist formed, controlled and directed ‘front’ for unlawful purposes,” that the existence of the corporation constituted a continuing fraud and that the corporate charter should be revoked. The petition was granted by Judge Ellenbogen. Preliminary objections filed by the Association were overruled but on appeal to this Court (<a href="/pa/375/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="375 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1244387" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0108-01">375 Pa. 108</a>) wé sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the intervenors’ petition, holding that since they were not members of the Association and had no peculiar interest of their own, they <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>possessed no status as interested parties and it was for the Commonwealth and for it alone, acting through the Attorney General, to apply for the issuance of a writ of quo warranto. On December 9, 1953 the Honorable Frank F. Truscott, Attorney General, filed an action in quo warranto against the defendant corporation. Preliminary objections filed thereto raising a question of jurisdiction were overruled and on appeal to this Court the order of the court below was affirmed (<a href="/pa/378/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="378 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1250898" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0383-01">378 Pa. 383</a>). The defendant filed an answer denying all of the material allegations of the complaint which in summary averred that defendant’s charter was obtained through perpetration of a fraud upon the court by misrepresentation of the purposes of incorporation, in that the actual purposes were to foster and promote unlawful Communist activities, and that the corporation had continuously engaged in such activities since its incorporation. After two pretrial conferences the case came to trial before Judge Ellenbogen and a jury on January 17, 1955. The defendant was represented in the proceeding by Hymen Schlesinger, and the Commonwealth by Deputy Attorneys General and Harry Alan Sherman, who was appointed as assistant counsel because of his connection with the earlier case.</p>
    <p id="b579-3" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[159,1747,1146,599]],["BL_580.1",580,[260,340,1147,1662]]]'>At the pretrial conference held on January 3, 1955, counsel for the defendant stated that the corporation would surrender its charter if it were allowed time, suggesting ninety days, in whieh to dispose of its assets and wind up its affairs, and presented a proposed written stipulation in the form of a consent decree to this effect. After considerable discussion, Deputy Attorney General Friedman stated he would submit the stipulation to the Attorney General. During the interval between this pretrial conference and the trial, the Attorney General submitted to counsel for defendant three <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>alternative forms of consent decrees. At the outset of the trial the Deputy Attorney General then in attendance announced that an agreement had been reached with counsel for defendant that the following consent decree be entered: “And now, this day of January, 1955, upon motion of Hymen Schlesinger, attorney for defendant, the parties consenting to this order and upon representation by said attorney for defendant that a resolution authorizing him to proffer the Charter of the above named corporation for revocation was adopted, and said attorney for defendant making such proffer in open court, It is Ordered and Decreed as Follows: 1. That the Charter of the defendant be revoked, effective as hereinafter provided. 2. The corporation is directed to liquidate and to dispose of its assets, real or personal, without liability on the part of any purchaser to see to the application of the purchase money, and to distribute the proceeds of any sale of real or personal property to the persons entitled thereto. 3. The Charter is hereby revoked said revocation to be effective for all purposes forthwith, except ¿or the purpose of disposition of real and personal property held by the corporation, which said disposition shall be completed on or before March 17, 1955, at which time all corporate powers, franchises, rights, privileges and other powers and the rights, privileges and powers of the members and officers thereof which remain after the date of this order solely for the purpose of dissolution in connection with such corporation, shall cease and determine.”</p>

The record reveals that throughout the proceedings Mr. Sherman was primarily interested in conducting an inquisition and desired that the trial continue, his ultimate aim being to ob<a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>tain the identity of all the members of the Association in order to subject them to criminal prosecution. Needless to say, such an objective was entirely foreign to the quo warranto proceeding. As the Attorney General states in his brief: “There is no doubt that knowledge as to the identity of the members of this organization might be of aid in tracking them down and discovering their activities. However, a quo warranto proceeding is not a police investigation, nor is it calculated to furnish the basis for such investigations.”.</p>
    <p id="b581-3" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[148,911,1153,1164]],["BL_582.1",582,[270,344,1144,322]]]'>Mr. Sherman also, on his own initiative, opposed the consent decree unless a provision was contained therein that a trustee be appointed by the court for the disposition of the corporation’s assets. Apparently in sympathy with Mr. Sherman’s position, the court refused to enter the agreed upon consent decree and ordered counsel for defendant either to surrender the charter unconditionally or to proceed with the trial. In justification of this order the court, upon the preface “If the charges here made under oath by the Attorney General are true . . .”, stated in effect (1) that the organization was a danger to the peace and safety of the Commonwealth and the nation; (2) that the officers of the corporation have perpetrated a gross fraud upon the court; (3) that instead of encouraging the study of Jewish culture, the organization was serving the Communist party; (4) that the judge could not be certain that the officers, whose identity was unknown,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> would properly administer the assets, but on the contrary there was reason to believe that they would use them to serve the aims and purposes of the <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>Communist party. Following the court’s alternative order, counsel for the defendant requested permission to consult his client concerning this order. The court denied the request and directed that counsel proceed to try the case without further delay. The Deputy Attorney General excepted to the action of the court.</p>
    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.5",582,[268,677,1148,1660]],["BL_583.1",583,[147,333,1147,92]]]'>After the case, marked by continuous colloquies between counsel for the defendant and the hearing judge, had been in progress for over a week, counsel fearing that the court’s threat of disciplinary action toward him would militate against his client’s cause, asked for leave to withdraw from the case. Before any action was taken by the court on this motion, counsel requested permission to consult with his client. This request was denied. The motion to withdraw was granted and counsel advised that he was out of the case. When counsel subsequently renewed his request to consult with his client, the court replied, “You have no more client, you are out of the case.”. The court thereupon called the president of the corporation into his chambers, informed him that he had 24 hours within which to secure a lawyer and suggested that it might be to the best interests of the corporation to surrender its charter. After the luncheon recess the president was called to the bar of the court and “reluctantly” agreed to surrender the charter unconditionally as the court insisted, for the reason that he was physically unable to secure counsel and thereby continue with the defense of the case. The surrender was accepted by the court, the jury discharged and shortly thereafter an order was entered, dated January 25, 1955, under the terms of which the court revoked the charter, appointed a liquidating trustee to take charge of the real and personal property and all personal effects of the corporation and to proceed to liquidate and wind up its assets. Thereafter the court informed the <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>trustee that Mr. Sherman and another named attorney would act as his counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b583-3" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[146,453,1149,551]]]'>The court below held that its right to appoint a liquidating trustee was clear for any one of four reasons: (1) if the surrender of the charter be considered voluntary, power was granted by the Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 289, §1001 as amended, 15 PS §2851-1001; (2) the authority was necessary and inherent in the judicial power; (3) if the surrender be considered involuntary, the court was given power under the Act of April 4, 1872, P. L. 46, §1, 15 PS §503, or (4) the Act of April 26, 1893, P. L. 26, §1, 15 PS §521.</p>

The Act provides for the voluntary dissolution of a nonprofit corporation and outlines with particularity the procedure to be followed thereunder. Section 1001 of the Act provides that a petition, signed and verified by at least two duly authorized officers of the corporation, under seal, shall be filed with the court setting forth, inter alia, the time and place of the meeting at which the resolution authorizing the institution of voluntary proceedings was adopted and the vote thereon; an inventory of all the real and personal property of the corporation; a statement of all the liens and encumbrances upon the corporate property and the names and addresses of all existing members. The record does not show and the court made no attempt to ascertain whether any of these statutory prerequisites were complied with by the defendant corporation. Counsel for defendant had set forth in his proposed consent decree and in the <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>agreed upon decree which, the court refused, that a resolution had been passed authorizing him to thus proffer the charter of the corporation. Despite this representation, the surrender ultimately acquiesced in by' the president of the corporation differed substantially and materially from what was purportedly resolved by the members, and for all that appears it was accepted by the court on the president’s authority alone. It is significant that prior to the selection of a jury, counsel for defendant requested the Court to allow him time to have a meeting called of the officers and members so that they might consider the court’s order of unconditional surrender. As previously indicated, this request was denied and counsel was directed to try the case without further delay. When the Deputy Attorney General questioned the manner in which the charter was being surrendered, the court replied, “I’m not worried about that.”. In <em>Sherman v. Yiddisher Kultur Farband, </em><a href="/pa/375/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="375 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1244387" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0108-01">375 Pa. 108</a>, 111, <a href="/citations/?q=99%20A.2d%20868" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="99 A.2d 868">99 A. 2d 868</a>, this Court said: “All corporations, whether for profit or nonprofit, are creatures of statute, which prescribes not only how they shall be formed but how they shall be dissolved: . . .”. Moreover, the action of quo warranto being an adversary proceeding, it was not converted into a voluntary dissolution by the surrender of the charter under the circumstances here present. The record discloses that the charter was surrendered reluctantly by Mr. Gordon, the president of the corporation, at the court’s insistence, for the reason that he was physically unable to procure counsel within the 24-hour period allotted to him by the court.</p>

We there held in affirming the lower court’s action appointing a receiver pendente lite that a court of equity has power to appoint a receiver in order to prevent corporate assets from being wasted or used for unlawful purposes. The above principle, which is universally recognized in a proper case in equity, must be distinguished from the present proceeding which is an action of quo warranto. This Court has held that since the functions of a receiver have no relation to the exercise of a franchise which is the sole question raised upon a quo warranto, no authority exists for his appointment in such proceedings unless it is found in express statutory provision: <em>Commonwealth v.

This Court, construing the above Act in <em>Commonwealth v.

I wrote to him November 27, 1953, and concluded with this paragraph — that is one of the concluding paragraphs: ‘In this situation mere quo warranto proceedings instituted in the name of the Attorney General would doubtless result in judgment by default, declaring the charter forfeit. I am certain, therefore, that a broader aspect would justify presentment to a grand jury, with undoubted beneficial consequences to the city and the nation.’ ”.</p>

Unfortunately the court seemed to be of the same opinion. Although the trial judge on several occasions stated to Mr. Sherman that remarks made by him were irrelevant, in the long run he permitted him to indulge in violent diatribes accusing members of the defendant Association of subversive activities, which unquestionably would have required the grant of a new trial if the case had gone to the jury and resulted in a verdict against the defendant.

Mr. Sherman is president of ‘Americans Battling Communism.’ The avowed objective of Americans Battling Communism is exactly what the title says.” Communism is the scourge of the world today. It has taken civilization to the brink of disaster and threatens to push it over into the abyss of absolute annihilation unless its despotic and terroristic demands are met.

Watching the trial through the window of the record, one observes in Mr. Schlesinger a resourceful and agile practitioner, ready for any tactic, maneuver, or strategy to defend his client and harass the opposition. He made seven different motions to disqualify the Judge, he employed caustic and disrespectful language toward the Court for which he sometimes apologized and at other times compounded the insult.

It is quite revealing that immediately after the Court suggested that Gordon might consider a voluntary yielding up of the charter, Gordon said: “Judge, could we ponder for <em>five minutes; </em>since we are not in Court, the possibility of the question of surrender?” It is here obvious that Gordon must already have formed an intention to give up the charter or he would not have allowed himself a mere five minutes to reach so vital a conclusion. His request for the five minute deliberation occurred at the morning session of the Court on January 25, 1955. That very afternoon at 1:30 o’clock, Gordon surrendered the charter. The explanation he later made that he was unable to get counsel was offensive subterfuge. Even of the time allotted him he still had over 20 hours to go, before the 24-hour period expired. Moreover, the Trial Judge stated in his Opinion: “We gave the defendant twenty-four hours to engage other counsel, offered to assist in obtaining counsel for the defendant, and fully intended that, if defendant was not able in a twenty-four hour period to obtain counsel, to allow additional time.

How can a trial having for a main issue the subject of ■ Communism, Communist Party and subversive activities exclude evidence on Communism, Communist Party and subversive activities?</p>

To even suggest that the proceedings in this case were “arbitrary and unjudicial” can only mean one of two things: either a dogmatic appraisement of the record unrelated to its contents or a deliberate determination to censure regardless. My study of the record brings me to the conclusion that Judge Ellenbogen was respectful of precedent, obedient of both substantive and procedural law, patient, forbearing, reflective and guided only by the determination to see that justice was done. Contrary to what the Majority has said by its quotation from the <em>Sehlesinger </em>case, su<a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>pra, Judge Ellenbogen did in fact uphold “all our cherished traditions of law and legal procedure.” If fault were to be found it would have to be that the Trial Judge was too tolerant of Mr. Selilesinger’s outrageous conduct throughout the trial. It is to be noted also that since the Court found that the Farband was engaged in illegal activities, Judge Ellenbogen would have been justified in holding the officers of the Far-band in contempt of court for operating an illegal enterprise under the supposed authorization of the Court which had been fraudulently obtained. He did not, however, take any punitive action.</p>

At the termination of any trial in a lower Court, the invariable procedure for the losing party is to file exceptions to the jury’s verdict or Court rulings and argue those exceptions before a Court en banc. That was not done here. Although Mr. Schlesinger had withdrawn from the case, he then appealed <em>directly </em>to this Court. He did not ask that the defendant corporation be permitted to withdraw its surrender of the charter, he did not request the lower Court to vacate its order of revocation, he did not seek a new trial. Ignoring every stairway of accepted approach to this Court, he leaped the barriers of intermediate procedure and appeared here, without this Court even inquiring as to how he managed his unorthodox ascent.</p>
