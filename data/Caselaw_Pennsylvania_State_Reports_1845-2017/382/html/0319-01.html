Defendant, the wife, was charged with constructive desertion. The master recommended a divorce. The Court of Common Pleas rejected this recommendation and dismissed the complaint. The Superior Court reversed.</p>

Plaintiff’s witness, who had known both parties for-years and who liad lived in their home, testified that in 1951 and again in 1952 the defendant told him that plaintiff offered to return to her but she didn’t want him back.”</p>
