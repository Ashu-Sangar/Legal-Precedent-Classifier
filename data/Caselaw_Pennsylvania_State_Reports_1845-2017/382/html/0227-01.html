They window-shopped, stopped at several stores, looked over the offerings at a couple of movies and finally decided to take in the show at the Granada theatre on Seventh Avenue. Seventh Avenue is a wide thoroughfare, measuring 66 feet from curb to curb and accommodating not only 4 lanes of traffic but supplying space on either side for diagonal parking. Arriving about 7:30 at a point on Seventh Avenue between 12th and 13th Streets, the plaintiffs proceeded to cross from the east to the west side. The street was clear of traffic .with the exception of a car about 400 feet away to their left on Seventh Avenue in the vicinity of the intersecting 11th Street. To the Karceskys’ right the traffic was stopped by a red light at 13th Street. They crossed the first two lanes of Seventh Avenue (northbound), and were just about at the center of the street when the traffic from the right (which had been stopped at 13th Street about 250 feet away) now began to move southwardly. The car to the left which had been first seen 400 feet away (and later identified as a Cadillac driven by Sam Laria) was now slowly <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>moving np Seventh Avenue northwardly toward 12th Street, but still 140 feet away. While standing in the center of the highway waiting for the traffic in front of them (that is, moving southwardly from 13th Street to 12th Street on Seventh Avenue) to pass, both the Karceskys were struck by the Laria car from the rear. One of the cars moving from 13th Street, a Ford driven by Arvid R. Werner, arrived at the scene of the accident just as the plaintiffs were being struck by the Laria car.</p>

This Court has now rendered a judgment n.o.v. in favor of Werner. I believe that, aside from the brush mark on Werner’s car, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to show that his car arrived on the scene in time to contribute to the vehicular battering to which both plaintiffs were subjected. The proof of Laria’s negligence was direct and unequivocal. There was no reason for Laria not to have seen the Karceskys long before he reached them. Seventh Avenue at this point is a veritable river of concrete on which any person must stand out as conspicuously as a black object on a white sheet. Had Laria displayed the slightest concern about the Karceskys on the street the accident would not have occurred because with the plaintiffs admittedly in the very center of the highway, Laria would not have been where, given the width of the highway, he had no need to be. Laria’s testimony factually convicts him of a high degree of negligence: “Q. Now, while you were crossing Twelfth Street on Seventh Avenue, did you become aware of anybody on the street ahead of you — any persons or people: A. I seen two people standing there as I drive along, around the center of the block — I imagine right outside the Rio. Q. I don’t get that answer. What <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>is that? A. Right in the center of the block, I seen two people standing.

You mean, you judged that they were about halfway between Twelfth and Thirteenth, is that it? A. Before that- — before I reached to that, I seen, the way I was driving, this way— Q. Yes? A. <em>Out of the corner of my eye, I seen the people standing in the center of the street. </em>. . Q. As you approached them, go ahead and tell us what happened. A. I just go along the way I was driving. I look <em>the corner of my eye, this left eye. </em>I seen something fell, but I stopped immediately, just dead, so I get off the car, and I seen two people was laying there, one alongside — ” (Italics supplied)</p>

There is no possible explanation for the accident except on the basis of Laria’s negligence.

When liability is admitted by the defendant, or when the evidence is clearly preponderant in favor of the plaintiff, it is likewise possible to say, with some fair measure of certainty, whether the verdict properly covered the items of damage for which recovery should have been allowed or whether it was <em>inadequate. </em>But when the evidence is equally divided in weight, or, a fortiori, when the preponderance of testimony is clearly with the defendant and the verdict rendered for the plaintiff, while small, is substantial, the problem becomes one of an entirely different nature, for in such event it can no more reasonably be said that the plaintiff recovered too little than that he should not have recovered at all; therefore, in such a case, it is just as likely, or more likely, that the granting of a new trial would constitute an act of injustice to the defendant rather than one of justice to the plaintiff.”</p>

But in the <em>Garpenelli </em>case the Majority, did not say that the defendant was without negligence, nor did it say that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.

But if the jury has returned a verdict for the plaintiff, why should the determination as to whether it is inadequate be any more difficult than the ascertainment as to whether it is excessive? Assuming that in a given case a reasonable verdict should be $10,000, why would it be easy to say that a verdict of $13,000 would be too much, but it would be a problem to say that $7,000 is not enough? Why is it that when the verdict is less than it might reasonably be, according to the proof of injuries and losses, the Court must then weigh the evidence as to the negligence when the jury has already passed on the issue of negligence? Of course, where the verdict is clearly against the weight of the evidence, the remedy of a new trial is quickly available. But if the verdict is not against the weight of the evidence, on what authority of law may an appellate court take out an apothecary scale to determine whether, in the words of Chief Justice Stern, “the evidence is equally divided” or that “the preponderance of testimony is clearly with the defendant,” and on that basis decree that the verdict should be less than what the proof of damages shows?</p>
