Stanger], now a man of 70 years, a retired railroad employee living on a pension, moved into the home of the defendant [Marie Callahan Epler] as a boarder in 1933. After a short time the parties discussed marriage between them. The defendant at the time was incapable of marriage because she had a living husband. The plaintiff and defendant on July 3, 1947, opened a joint account in the Beneficial Saving Society with the funds of the plaintiff. The Saving Society had them sign a signature card reading, ‘Stanley T. Stanger or Marie E. Callahan-Friend.’ The funds of the plaintiff so deposited was in the sum. of $5,899.62. The Chancellor found that such funds were deposited by plaintiff in contemplation of marriage. With this finding we agree. In August, 1947, the defendant, with the consent of the plaintiff, withdrew from said account the sum of $1,500 to complete a settlement for the purchase of premises situate in Laurel Springs, New Jersey, title to which was taken in the name of the defendant. This sum was advanced by plaintiff for the purchase of the property to be used as a home for the parties when married, or if not married, then as a loan to defendant. When the defendant was advised in 1949 that her then husband had divorced her, she imposed such conditions on the plaintiff which were impossible for him to meet. On June 18, 1950, the defendant married Charles Epler, who was also a boarder in her home. At all times the defendant has retained the possession of the deposit book and has refused to return it or any of the money to <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>the plaintiff. The Chancellor after a full hearing of this case, granted the prayers of the Bill and ordered the return to the plaintiff of all the funds now on deposit, and for the defendant to pay to plaintiff the sum of $1,850.00 plus interest.” The hearing Judge, affirmed by the court in banc, decided that plaintiff had made a gift of an interest in the joint bank account to the defendant which was <em>“conditioned upon the mar</em>riage” of plaintiff and defendant; that the parol evidence of such conditional gift was “clear, precise and indubitable”; and since defendant refused to marry plaintiff — but married another — he directed the defendant to return the amount of such conditional gift to plaintiff.</p>

Plaintiff-appellee relies upon <em>Ruehling v. Hornung, </em><a href="/pa-super/98/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="98 Pa. Super. 535" data-case-ids="687946" data-case-paths="/pa-super/98/0535-01">98 Pa. Superior Ct. 535</a>, which apparently is the only reported appellate court case in this jurisdiction on the subject. There the action was in replevin to recover an engagement ring, watch and medallion. There was proof of an engagement of marriage and that plaintiff, in contemplation of marriage, gave defendant the enumerated articles. There was no evidence that defendant broke the engagement or that the gifts were made upon the <em>express condition </em>that they were to be returned if defendant failed to marry the plaintiff. Judge Gawthrop said in his opinion (p. 538) : “We find no case in this State directly bearing on this question, but in 28 C. J. 651, the law is stated thus: ‘A gift to a person to whom the donor is engaged to be married, made in contemplation of marriage, although absolute in form, is conditional; and upon breach of the marriage engagement by the donee the property may be recovered by the donor. But if the gift is made simply for the purpose of introducing the donor to the donee’s acquaintance and to gain her favor, the property is not recoverable, although marriage does not ensue. So where a Christmas present is made by a man to his fiancee it becomes her property and the subse<a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>quent breaking of the engagement does not entitle Mm to recover it back.’ ” The opinion cited a text book and cases from other states which hold that in order for a donor to recover it must be shown that the gifts were either made upon an <em>express condition </em>that they were to be returned in case the donee failed to marry donor, or that the gifts were <em>induced </em>by the donee’s promise to marry the donor. The judgment of the Superior Court was that an engagement ring is a symbol of a contract to marry, subject to the implied condition that if the marriage does not take place due to the fault of the donee, the ring is to be returned. This was held to be a question for the jury. The watch and medallion could not be recovered since there was no evidence that these gifts were made <em>upon the express condition </em>that they were to be returned if the donee failed to marry the donor.

Plaintiff’s testimony, however, is contradictory as to whether or not there Avas an actual engagement or contract to marry. Plaintiff testified: “I had not really proposed, but it had been talked over. We both said, ‘O. X., we will get married.’ ” But he also testified: “I never did ask Mrs. Callahan to marry me”, and “I never came out asking to marry her and she never came out asking me to marry her”. At no time during defendant’s testimony did she ever admit that there had been an <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>actual engagement to marry.

The presumption is that the writing constituted an absolute gift.
