The jury returned a money verdict for the plaintiff. Upon the defendant’s motion, the court en banc entered judgment n.o.v. for the defendant on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to establish causative negligence on the part of the defendant and that he was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. The plaintiff has appealed.</p>

The plaintiff was employed as a cement finisher by a building contractor whom the defendant engaged to repair the outside of a window in a bathroom on the third floor of an apartment building owned by her. The building was three stories in height and shared a <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>party wall with an adjoining building. The first two stories of both buildings, for a portion of their respective widths, extended bach some distance beyond the rear wall of the third story. Between these two projections to the rear, there was an areaway or open space extending upward for the full height of the two stories. The third floor bathroom window, which was to be repaired, was directly over the open areaway. On the roof of the two story portion of the defendant’s building there was constructed what is commonly called a “flat”, that is, a wooden platform fashioned by nailing boards to runners or beams lying on top and along the edge of the roof. The “flat” rested on, but was not physically fastened to, the roof and was, in the plaintiff’s words, “used mostly for hanging clothes on.” For that purpose, there were several 2" x <em>á" </em>vertical posts attached to the beams lying on the roof. These uprights were connected by two parallel horizontal 2" x 3" rails so that the superstructure formed a sort of railing around the outside edge of the “flat”. Access to the “flat” or platform was had through a third floor window which opened on to it.</p>

This fact was confirmed by his witness, the tenant of the third floor apartment, who testified that she “used the flat for hanging clothes. That is Avhat it was put up for, to hang my clothes, and I also kept my trash box out there.” She further testified that, about six months prior to the accident, she notified the defendant that an upright post, which held a clothes line, was “loose” and “falling”. The <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>defendant hired the plaintiff’s employer to make the necessary repairs. And, it was the plaintiff himself who did the actual work of shoring up the sagging post and bracing it to the floor of the platform. The plaintiff freely admitted his previous presence on the “flat”; in fact, a receipt acknowledging payment for “repairing platform flat on third floor” bore his signature.</p>

His explanation for not testing the railing was that it “looked solid” to him. But that, of course, does not excuse his admitted failure to ascertain by inspection the real condition of the railing before trusting his weight to it.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[175,1403,1157,936]],["BL_304.1",304,[272,347,1149,98]]]'>The plaintiff’s expert witness, who examined the railing after the accident, testified that the part of the rail which the plaintiff had previously braced was “rather firm” but that the side rail (i.e., the one that gave way) was “wiggly ... it was a trifle wiggly.” Certain it is that, if the plaintiff had so much as laid his hand on the rail before placing his weight against it, he would have been at once apprised of its weakened condition. His failure so to do — or to take other precautionary steps — was plain negligence. His consequent injury was, therefore, no less attributable to his own carelessness than to the asserted negligence of the defendant. Having thus acted in open disregard of his own well-being, it is not for him to complain that the defendant did not employ adequate safeguards for his protection.

Goldman, to make certain repairs to a third-story bathroom window which could for the purposes of the repairs, only be reached from the outside of the building. Although the structure was three stories high, the second floor projected out from the rear in such a manner as to give it a separate roof, which roof was utilized as the foundation for a porch or “flat.” The word “flat” in this case has a particular meaning entirely unrelated to the usual significance of the word. It means simply a platform surrounded by a railing. Thus, on the second floor roof of Mrs. Goldman’s apartment house there was constructed this wooden “flat” (measuring about 14 by 20 feet), which was used mainly for the purpose of hanging and drying clothes, although it also served as a repository for a large trash box. The upright posts supporting the rails around the platform stood approximately from <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>4 to 6 feet high with a width and depth of 3 by 4 inches. The two horizontal lengths which made up the railing and enclosed the platform measured a width and depth of 2 by 3 inches.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[188,570,1152,657]]]'>Thompson and Bongart reached this “flat” by passing through a French door which gave out on the platform from an apartment tenanted by Mrs. Clara Malone, who testified at length at the trial. The neighboring building also had a second floor projection whose roof was on the same level as the Goldman second floor roof. The two workmen carried with them a long plank described as a “3 by 10” which they prepared to extend from the “flat” to the roof of the neighboring building to thus make a scaffolding upon which to stand in repairing the bathroom window on the third floor of the apartment house.</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[183,1240,1155,1105]],["BL_306.1",306,[270,346,1151,378]]]'>Standing on the Goldman roof, Thompson stooped to get the necessary leverage to push the plank over the void to the other roof while Bongart held the plank at the opposite end. Preparing to brace himself to maneuver the heavy timber, Thompson’s knee came into contact with the lower rail which pulled loose from the post to which it was attached and Thompson was precipitated into the empty air down to the earth three floors below, sustaining serious injuries. Although the “flat” had been built six years before, it appears that very little, if anything, had been done to maintain it in an assured safe condition. It had never been painted to hold off the rot which is ever ready to seize hold of wood and crumble it to dust; no inspection had been made to determine how it withstood the ravages of time, weather and storm; no examination was conducted to ascertain if the nails were at their duty holding fast against the onslaughts of rust and decay. When Bongart saw his partner disappear over the verge, he descended to <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>the ground to render assistance and look at the railing which went over the edge with Thompson. He found that the nails which were clinging to the broken wood were “rusted out.” He said that two of them had been reduced to a “fine thread,” and explained that this deterioration was due to “rain, dampness and staying there a long time.”</p>

In that case the plaintiff was injured when the fire escape, which he had been directed to use in reaching the roof he was to repair, broke because defective. In affirming a judgment returned for the plaintiff, this Court said: “In making-use of the fire escape, as directed and required, the plaintiff had a right to rely on the presumption that the defendant had performed its duty in providing a reasonably safe means of access to the roof. The fire escape was under the circumstances to all intents and purposes, an outside stairway. If instead of making-use of it, the plaintiff had been instructed to take the inside stairway, and had been injured by the giving-way of an improperly constructed platform, it would hardly be contended that the defendant would not be liable for the results. The fact that the fire escape, temporarily transformed at the direction of the defendant into a stairway, was located outside of the building, rather than inside, cannot change the principle involved.”</p>

It assumes as it says, that because “the plaintiff knew that the ‘flat’ was not used as a porch but only as a place to hang out laundry,” he should know that the railing would have inherent weaknesses and defects. This presupposes the extraordinary concept that a platform with a railing three stories above the ground does not need to bo strong if it is used only in connection with hanging out laundry. But in point of objective reality a railing employed for laundry purposes should be as strong, if not stronger, than one enclosing a sitting porch, because in hanging, drying and taking down clothes there is always bound to be a certain amount of leaning against the railing if only in reaching up to apply and remove clothes pins.</p>

It certainly was not erected for purposes of adornment. It had no beauty, it did not qualify for astronomical purposes. It had only one object, only one reason for existence, and that was to serve as a safeguard. Thus, by every rule of common regard for the safety of mankind, there Avas a legal, as well as moral, obligation on the part of the owner of the premises to make the railing a substantial one. To erect at such a point a railing which is less strong than one sturdy enough to hold a leaning body is to erect a trap, a pitfall, a snare. A railing which overhangs a dangerous height and is not sufficiently staunch in anchorage and texture to hold back a per<a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>son who accidentally touches against it is about as treacherous a device as can be found in the whole category of body-breakers.</p>

I would say that if the railing was weakened by time and weather this fact magnifies the fault of the defendant because it placed on her a greater duty to have it inspected and strengthened. There was no obligation on the part of the plaintiff to ascertain how many years the railing was in place. So long as it offered no reasonable evidence of weakness he had the right to assume that he was not being lured to disaster by a false exhibition of security.</p>

The Majority in referring to his testimony says that Mr. Carr testified “that the part of the rail which the plaintiff had previously braced was ‘rather firm’ but that the side rail (i.e., the one that gave way) was ‘wiggly ... it was a trifle wiggly.’ ” After this quotation the Majority makes the astounding statement: “Certain it is that, if the plaintiff had so much as laid his hand on the rail before placing his weight against it, he would have been at once apprised of its weakened condition.” The Majority gratuitously assumes that because the railing was “wiggly” in February, 1953, it wiggled six months before on August 23, 1952. This disregards what the record so clearly shows, namely, that the railing which Mr. Carr examined in February, 1953, was <em>not </em>the one which gave way in August, 1952. This ignores that the new railing which was erected <em>after </em>the accident, and which is the one that Mr. Carr examined, could have been erected and attached differently from the one which injured the plaintiff.</p>

This is indeed <em>ex post facto </em>in reverse!</p>

The evidence, in fact, is to the exact contrary:</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[259,521,1150,265]]]'>Edward H. Thompson testifying: “Q.:As I understand it, there was nothing at all about the railing that indicated to you whether it was safe or dangerous in any particular, was there. A. No. In fact, if it wasn’t safe, I wouldn’t have braced myself against it.”</p>
    <p id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[259,800,1152,210]]]'>Clara Malone testifying. “Q.- Did you ever report anything wrong with the railing? A. As far as I could see or the eye could see, there was nothing that had the appearance of being anything wrong with it.”</p>
    <p id="Akm" data-blocks='[["BL_312.6",312,[259,1023,1150,319]]]'>Anthony Bongart testifying. “Q. Did you ever see anything the matter with that railing? A. No. I didn’t take notice to the railing. The railing looks O.K. to me. Q. And you have spent almost your whole life in making repairs and doing carpentry work, haven’t you? A. Yes, sir.”</p>
    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.7",312,[257,1355,1152,323]]]'>It is important to add that although Mrs. Malone had complained to Mrs. Goldman' about one of the posts (the one that Thompson repaired) she never complained about the railing, and certainly she would have been the one most concerned since she is the one who used the “flat” for hanging up clothes:</p>
    <p id="b312-7" data-blocks='[["BL_312.8",312,[257,1690,1151,209]]]'>Mrs. Goldman testifying. “Q. Did Mrs. Malone ever make any complaint to you about the condition <em>of </em>this railing? A. She never said any thing, to me about no railing.”</p>
    <p id="b312-8" data-blocks='[["BL_312.9",312,[257,1910,1150,490]]]'>Thus, every witness who testified to conditions prior to the accident declared that the railing gave every indication of being safe. Yet, the Majority arbitrarily concludes that the railing was. obviously unsafe and that, therefore, Thompson the plaintiff committed contributory negligence in accepting as true <em>what his senses told him was fact. </em>This is an astounding standard of care that I have not yet found in the law books and therefore, I dissent.</p>
