Their properties were bought and their homes built before the ground was acquired for an airport. These five tracts are located about 1,000 feet or more distant from the Northeast end of the Northeast-Southwest runway, one of three runways of the greater Pittsburgh Airport. The airport, which was erected and is owned and maintained by the County of Allegheny, has been used since June, 1952 as a commercial air terminal by virtue of leases of its facilities to the air lines which are co-defendants.</p>

Starting at the Northeast end of the paved portion of the Northeast-Southwest runway, which points toward plaintiffs’ properties, this glide angle or path of glide slopes upward at the rate of one foot vertically for each forty feet horizontally for a distance of five miles which is the limit of the approach or control zone. The plaintiffs further aver that the glide angle, as it crosses their premises, <em>is below the floor of the navigable air space </em>and <em>about fifteen to thirty feet above the chimneys of their respective houses. </em>They complain that in landing at and taking off from the airport the defendant airlines have <em>committed repeated trespasses </em>and will continue to trespass over their properties.

The governmental authorities who intervened as amici curiae deny that they are either necessary or indispensable parties, even though in many respects they minutely control and regulate the take-off approach and landing of planes at this airport.</p>

When Regulation 60.17 excepted these from the prescribed minimum altitudes it in effect declared— as indeed would have been in any event obvious — that in the course of landing and taking off the minimum altitude must be less than the distances fixed for flights en route. How much less? Clearly no specific minimum could be fixed for that purpose, since it would depend in each instance and for each airport on the size and construction of the latter, on the topography of the surrounding land, on the nature, size and weight of the plane, on the conditions of Avind and weather, and above all, on the directions of the operator in the toAver to whose control the operator of the plane is subject. All that the Regulation said, and could say, Avas that the minimum altitudes prescribed did not apply Avhen <em>“necessary for take-off or landing” </em>which is another way of saying that the navigable airspace pre-empted <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>by Congress was the space above whatever altitude was <em>necessary </em>for such operations. (On July 22, 1954, the Civil Aeronautics Board issued a clarifying interpretation of Section 60.17 in which it construed the exception as prescribing <em>a normal and necessary flight path </em>after take-off or in approaching to land). The State, therefore may enjoin planes in take-offs and landings only if they fly below the <em>necessary </em>minimum altitude, and if as previously stated, the trespasses are of a continuing character, and materially interfere with the landowner’s use and enjoyment of his property. Whether that necessary minimum be more than 15, 30, or any other specific number of feet, cannot be determined except when the facts are ascertained at the hearing of the case. If it be there established that defendant’s planes in take-offs and landings fly below the floor of the navigable airspace as thus defined, and the other conditions above mentioned are found to exist, plaintiffs will be entitled to equitable relief. But it is important to add that, even if planes in landings or take-offs do <em>not </em>fly below the necessary minimum altitude governing such operations and therefore cannot be enjoined from such flying they nevertheless materially impair the use and enjoyment of the landowner’s property, the latter is entitled to be compensated for the easement thus established over his land <em>(United States v. </em>Causby, <a href="/us/328/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="328 U.S. 256" data-case-ids="377275" data-case-paths="/us/328/0256-01">328 U.S. 256</a>), and, if the impairment be so great as to constitute a virtually complete taking of his land, to receive payment of the value of the land in proper eminent domain proceedings.</p>

To my mind, it appears a remarkable hybrid jurisdictional doctrine which holds that while Congress has pre-empted Federal jurisdiction over navigable air space, as determined by the United States Civil Aeronautics Board and the Administrator of Civil Aeronautics, the states have retained jurisdiction over the navigable air space <em>below </em>

The Board acting in pursuance of this enactment filed, its Regulations. Regulation 60.17 provides that over congested areas the minimum altitude is 1000 feet and in all other areas, 500 feet. However, the Regulation <em>expressly </em>states <em>“Except when necessary for take-off or landing. . .” </em>(Emphasis supplied) It is the manner of take-off and landing which is the crux of this case. Where, in so navigating, the airplanes fly so low as to dangerously interfere with the use and enjoyment of plaintiffs’ premises, it constitutes a “taking” as above stated.. I disagree, however, that a state court possesses equity jurisdiction to <em>enjoin such landings and take-offs as a nuisance. </em>The Regulations, as .interpreted by the Board, fix no standards. Indeed, to do so is obviously impossible. As stated in the oral argument by the learned counsel for the <em>Amici Curiae, </em>this is a variable- consideration. They may depend upon any one or a combination of circumstances. For example: the situation surrounding the air field, obstructions, type of plane, the weight of the cargo, the condition of the weather and the direction of the wind, etc. Such considerations are necessarily variable. To have <em>state </em>courts interpose judicial action would clearly interfere with necessarily exclusive Federal control of air navigation. I agree with counsel for <em>Amici Curiae </em>who, state in their brief: “Since flights on take-off and landing obviously, are indispensable if there is to be any flying at all, there is no reason to suppose that Congress intended to leave such flights outside of its concept of ‘navigable airspace;’ Indeed, the Civil Aeronautics Act expressly authorizes air traffic regulation down to the surface of the earth. <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>The ‘safe altitudes of flight’ for air traffic regulation are the ‘minimum altitudes of flight’ which fix ‘navigable airspace’ under the Civil Aeronautics Act (Sec. 1(24), 49 U.S.C. 401(24)), and in which a ‘public right of freedom of transit’ exists (Sec. 3, 49 U.S.C. 403).”</p>

However, such matters were not then before us and therefore constitute dicta. Even though that case related to a proposed intrastate air school, sale of light airplanes and renting of hanger space to private plane owners, such intrastate planes in flight and in landing and taking off obviously <em>could </em>interfere with interstate commerce.
