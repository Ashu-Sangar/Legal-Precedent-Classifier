The attempt of an officer or person to put out the fire, or to rescue people or property therein, or the attempt of any person to escape from the burning building does not constitute in legal contemplation a superseding cause which is sufficient to relieve the arsonist from murder in the first degree. In reason, logic and principle we can see no valid distinction between those cases and a case where an accomplice is killed while setting fire to a house (or building) or attempting to escape therefrom, — the latter’s death is just as readily foreseeable as is the death of an owner who attempts to escape or to rescue lives or property from the building.” (Italics supplied) In the <em>Bolish </em>case the co-felon’s death was the unintentional result of his own acts (of arson), without the intervention of a third person or of the defendant.</p>

Its origin is shrouded in antiquity. The reason for its origin, development and application to modern conditions was and is <em>“the protection of </em>society”.

Malice is obviously just as much <em>present in the felon or felons </em>in a so-called justifiable killing which occurs in a robbery, as in an accidental or unintentional killing which occurs in a robbery.

When they had finished their nefarious plot they rushed from the store and, reaching the street, ran in opposite directions. Cecchini, grabbing a revolver from under the counter, gave chase and engaged in an exchange of gun fire with Jackson with the result that Jackson was mortally wounded by a bullet fired by Cecchini.

Since then, most of the other States of the Union have adopted similar statutes. See Needy, <em>History of the Pennsylvania Statute Creating Degrees of Murder, </em>97 U. of Pa. L.

The term “homicide” is, of course, generic and embraces every killing of a human being by another: 1 Warren, Homicide, §54 (Perm. Ed.); IV Blackstone, Commentaries, *177. The classifications of homicide at common law are (1) justifiable, (2) excusable and (3) felonious. “The first has no share of guilt at all; the second very little; but the third is the highest crime against the law of nature that man is capable of committing”: IV Blackstone, Commentaries, *177-178. A justifiable homicide is <a id="p662" href="#p662" data-label="662" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*662</a>such, as is committed either by command or, at least, with the permission of the law, e.g., execution of a convicted criminal, <em>apprehension of an escaping felon, </em>etc.; an excusable homicide is such as is committed either <em>per vnfortunium </em>(i.e., accidentally) or <em>se defendendo </em>(i.e., in self defense); IV Blackstone, Commentaries, *178-186; and a felonious homicide (i.e., a murder) occurs when a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully and feloniously kills any human being in the peace' of the sovereign with malice prepense or aforethought, express or implied: see IV Blackstone, Commentaries, *195; I Warren, Homicide, §63; 1 Wharton, Criminal Law, §419 (12th Ed.). Such is substantially the definition of murder which this court adopted in <em>Commonwealth v. Drum, </em><a href="/pa/58/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="58 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1013212" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0009-01">58 Pa. 9</a>, and which has ever since then been uniformly applied by this court in the multitude of murder trials that has followed: see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v.

And, yet, in certain circumstances the malice essential to murder need be neither prepense nor express. For instance, at common law an accidental or unintentional homicide committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate a felony is murder, the malice necessary to make the killing murder being constructively imputed by the malice incident to the perpetration of the initial felony. Thus, “if one intends to do another felony, and undesignedly kills a man, this is also murder”: IV Blackstone, Commentaries, *200-201. This type of felonious homicide, known as felony-murder, became firmly imbedded in the common law. Expressions of the doctrine are to be found in many of the common law text writers and commentators, including Lord Coke: see <a id="p663" href="#p663" data-label="663" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*663</a>article entitled “The Killer and His Yietim in Felony-Murder Cases” by Hitchler, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20Dick.%20L.%20Rev.%203" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="53 Dick. L. Rev. 3">53 Dick. L. Rev. 3</a> (1948). The same author further notes that the most widely accepted explanation of the origin of the doctrine is that at early common law practically all felonies were punishable by death and that it was of no particular moment whether a man was hanged for one felony or another. However, the differentiation today in the punishments for the various felonies makes the distinction as to felony-murder vitally important. And, the trend generally has been to restrict rather than to expand application of the felony-murder doctrine. In fact, in enacting the Act of 1794, supra, the Pennsylvania legislature restricted the scope of the felony-murder rule, so far as first degree murder was concerned (i.e., the capital offense which all murder is at common law), to four specifically enumerated felonies, namely, arson, rape, robbery or burglary. The limitation so imposed by the Act of 1794 was carried over into Section 74 of the Act of 1860, supra. And, by Section 1 of the Act of May 22, 1923, P. L. 306, a fifth felony (viz., kidnapping) was added. The statute, as so amended, was later codified in Section 701 of the presently applicable Penal Code of 1939, supra.</p>

It was only such murder as was committed in the perpetration of the statutorily specified felonies that was made first degree murder.

The case was tried before Chief Justice Bigelow and Justices Metcalf, Merrick and Hoar of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and was prosecuted by the Attorney General of the State in person. The Attorney General requested the court to instruct the jury as follows: “That whether [the deceased] was killed by a shot from within or without the armory, all the parties unlawfully engaged in the transactions which resulted in the homicide were at common law guilty, at least of manslaughter.” The instruction was refused in an opinion for the court by Chief Justice Bigelow who said in part (pp. 544-545), <em>“No person can be held guilty of homicide unless the act is either actually or constructively his, and it cannot be his act in either sense unless committed by his own hand or by some one acting in concert with him or in furtherance of a common object or purpose. </em>Certainly that cannot be said to be an act of a party in any just sense, or on any sound legal principle, which is not only not done by him, or by any one with whom he is associated or connected in a common enterprise, or in attempting to accomplish the same end, but is committed by a person who is his direct and immediate adversary, and who is, at the moment when the alleged criminal act is done, actually engaged in opposing and resisting him and his confederates and abettors in the accomplishment of the unlawful object for which they are united.

Coming to the facts of the particular case, Chief Justice Bigelow said (pp. 547-548) that, “If the homicide was the result of a shot fired by the soldiers or other persons in the armory, acting together in defence against the riotous assembly, the defendant cannot be held guilty of either murder or manslaughter. <em>The jury will accordingly be instructed that, unless they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the deceased %oas killed by means of a gun or other deadly weapon in the hands of the prisoner, or of one of the rioters with whom he was associated and acting, he is Entitled to an acquittal” </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>

They would be responsible for what they did themselves, and such consequences as might naturally flow from their acts and conduct; but they never advised, encouraged, or assented to the acts of [the town marshall], nor did they combine with him to do any unlawful act, nor did they in any manner assent to anything he did, and hence they could not be responsible for his conduct toward the deceased.” The rowdyism of the Butlers and their companions was a misdemeanor and not a felony.

On appeal, the defendant, Udwin, contended that the evidence did not exclude all reasonable possibilities that the fatal shot was fired by someone other than one of the conspirators. The Court of Appeals approved “the law of the case as stated by the trial justice” who had charged that it was the burden of the prosecution to establish “beyond a reasonable doubt that the shot which killed [the deceased] was fired by one of the convicts engaged with the defendants, or some of them, in a common purpose or design to unlawfully and feloniously escape.” The defendants were convicted; and, the question on the appeal was whether the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict. By a process of elimination, the Court of Appeals found <em>conclusively </em>from the evidence that the shot which killed the deceased could have been fired <em>only </em>by one of the escaping convicts.

Moyer and Byron, </em><a href="/pa/357/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="357 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="472087" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0181-01">357 Pa. 181</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20736" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="53 A.2d 736">53 A. 2d 736</a>.

The rationale of this pronouncement lay in an adaptation of the doctrine of proximate cause (as known to the law of torts) to the common-law requirement of causation in its relation to responsibility for a felony-murder. Thus, the opinion for the court specifically avowed that “Our decision in the <em>Moyer-Byron </em>case was an application of the long established principle that he whose felonious act is the <em>proximate </em>cause of another’s death is <em>criminally </em>responsible for that death and must answer to society for it exactly as he who is <em>negligently </em>the <em>proximate cause </em>of another’s death is <em>civilly </em>responsible for that death and must answer in damages for it.” As we have already seen, the “causation” requirement for responsibility in a felony-murder is that the homicide stem from the commission of the felony. Obviously, the assumed analogy <a id="p674" href="#p674" data-label="674" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*674</a>between that concept and the tort concept of proximate cause is not conclusive.

More than that, the court affirmed the defendants’ second point for charge which was as follows: “The defendant is entitled to an acquittal unless the commonwealth has produced evidence of such a quality as to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the bullet causing the death of the deceased was fired from the gun of either of the defendants.” And, at the conclusion of the charge and the reading of the affirmed points to the jury, the trial judge, at the in<a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>sistence of counsel for the defendants, reiterated verbatim this requested instruction to the jury.

And, the district attorney nowhere argued or even intimated that the learned trial judge had charged the jury more favorably to the defendants than he should have. The actual fact is the contention that it was <em>immaterial </em>who fired the fatal shot was never raised by the Commonwealth in the court below nor could the defendants have charged error in such regard in view of the trial' judge’s cognate instructions. Consequently, the point required no discussion by this court. What was said in the <em>Moyer </em>and <em>Byron </em>opinion in such connection was, therefore, no more than an expression of the writer’s individual view concerning a matter <em>coram non judice. </em>The jury’s verdict in the light of the trial court’s charge can be taken to mean only that the fatal bullet was fired by one of the felons.</p>

Jackson held a revolver while Thomas rifled the cash register and then they both fled. The proprietor Cecchini seized a pistol from behind a counter and shot at Jackson who returned the fire. In the ensuing running gun battle Cecchini killed Jackson. The surviving robber Thomas was later apprehended and indicted for murder under the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §701; 18 P.S. 4701, which provides, inter alia, that “(a) All murder . . . which shall be committed in the perpetration of . . . any . . . robbery . . . shall be murder in the first degree.”</p>

The statute under which Thomas has been indicted specifically states that “all <em>murder </em>which shall be committed in- the perpetration of any robbery shall be murder in the first degree.” The killing of Jackson was not in the remotest degree murder. It was justifiable homicide. Cecchini not only had the right but -he was compelled to kill Jackson on two counts: (1) in self defense; (2) to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon. How can such a legal act be the basis of a charge of murder?</p>

To hold Thomas then for the act of Jackson who brought about his own death as much as if he had shot himself, is, as I view the matter, absolutely insupportable in the law books or in any classroom of serious discussion.</p>

Hare, 2 Pa. L. J. 467 (1844). Two separate bodies of men were fighting each other with firearms in a public street and as a result a citizen was killed. Judge King held that the members of both bodies of men were guilty of felonious homicide .... President Judge King instructed the jury, inter alia, as follows: ‘If during such a scene of unlawful violence an innocent third person is slain,. . . such a homicide would be murder at common law . . . and all participants in such an act are alike responsible for its consequences .... <em>Shall the violators of the public </em>peace, <em>whose unlawful acts have produced the death of the unoffending, escape, became from the manner and time of the fire it is impossible to tell from what quarter the implement of death was propelled?

Ferlin was then tried for murder on the felony-murder theory <a id="p684" href="#p684" data-label="684" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*684</a>and was convicted. But the Supreme Court of California reversed the verdict saying: “It cannot be said from the record in the instant case that defendant and deceased had a common design that deceased should accidentally kill himself. Such an event was not in furtherance of the conspiracy, but entirely opposed to it.' It follows that the verdict of the jury finding the defendant guilty (of murder) . . . was against the law.” What the California Supreme Court said above applies to the facts in the case before us. As I have already stated, the killing in this case was not in furtherance of the robbery, “but entirely opposed to it.”</p>

But what the Majority is doing here is grotesque. It is investing the dead Jackson with virtues of good citizenship. It completely ignores that Jackson was a robber, a felon, a would-be murderer, an armed member of the criminal forces the nation is combatting. He was seeking to destroy Cecchini, an admittedly good citizen. But Cecchini turned the tables on him and Jackson made his exit in true bandit fashion, shooting it out with the law. To use this felon’s death as the basis for the charge of constructive murder is to turn the drama of a murder trial into a legalistic vaudevillian performance.</p>

The rationalization behind criminal jurisprudence is that if society could turn back time, it would prevent the happening of the event which it now condemns. But if that chronological miracle could be achieved in this case, society would not desire to pre<a id="p685" href="#p685" data-label="685" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*685</a>vent the killing of Jackson, who received his just deserts as he was engaged in trying to kill an innocent person.</p>

The killing which is the subject of every murder trial represents evil. But in this ease we have the startling situation of the law seeking to punish not evil but good. The killing of Jackson was not evil, it was not even excusable homicide; it was a killing which the law demanded. How can anyone be punished for what the law required? If the reasoning adopted by the Majority in the disposition of this case were to be carried to its ultimate development, it would mean that everyone connected with a robbery should be executed if one of the robbers went to the electric chair, because that in itself is a killing.</p>
