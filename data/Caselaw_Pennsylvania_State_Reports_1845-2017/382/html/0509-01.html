The Corporate Net Income Tax Act itself makes no reference to, or provision for, any division of a corporation into different departmental units. It defines the corporate net income as that returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government; it provides that the tax should be based upon the portion of that net income determined by the prescribed allocation fractions and that the denominators of those fractions should be the value of <em>all </em>the corporation’s tangible property <em>wherever situated, </em>the <em>total </em>expenditures of the corporation for wages and salaries to <em>all </em>of its employes, and the amount of its gross receipts from <em>all </em>of its business. The Act was held constitutional in <em>Turco Paint and Varnish Co. v. Kalodner, </em><a href="/pa/320/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="320 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1163676" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0421-01">320 Pa. 421</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.%2037" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="184 A. 37">184 A. 37</a>, but it was there stated (p. 430, A. p. 42) that “If, in particular cases, its operation will work an injustice or achieve an arbitrary result so far out of line with the actual facts as to cause it to be illegal . . . then will be the time to consider such charges.” That time came shortly thereafter when there was presented to this court an appeal in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Columbia Gas &amp; Electric Corp., </em><a href="/pa/336/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="336 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1195631" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0209-01">336 Pa. 209</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 A.2d 404">8 A. 2d 404</a>. While that case did not involve the corporate net income tax but the franchise tax payable by a foreign corporation under the Act of May 16, 1935, P.L. 184, as amended, nevertheless the same principle, was involved, the two Acts <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>being in all respects similar except that the one relates to the entire net income of the corporation and the other to the entire value of its capital stock, the allocation fractions being the same in both instances. The Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation conducted a holding company business outside of Pennsylvania and an operating business within the State for the manufacture of gasoline and natural gas. We held that the tax measured by the entire capital stock was subject to constitutional restrictions imposed by the due process, equal protection and interstate commerce clauses of the Federal Constitution, that the allocation of the taxable value to Pennsylvania must bear a fair relation to the amount of local business done by the corporation within the State, and that unless the value of the portion of capital stock of the corporation represented by its holdings in subsidiary companies, bonds and mortgages held outside of Pennsylvania were excluded from the computation of the tax the apportionment formula would allocate too large a taxable value to Pennsylvania. We therefore hold that, while the Act itself was constitutional, its application in the particular instance would work an unconstitutional result if its provisions were literally followed. We said (p. 224, A. p. 413) : “Appellee performs only a part of its functions within the state, and in connection therewith employs a part of its tangible and some intangible property. Under the principles relating to corporations engaging in multiform business and considering that only part of appellee’s business is conducted in Pennsylvania, as far as the capital stock value is related to tangible and intangible property, only such tangibles and intangibles should be taken into account as are concerned with the functions exercised within the state. ... Its power to act as a holding company is authorized under <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>the laws of Delaware. It is obvious therefore that to include within the taxable measure all the property used in connection with this function would be to levy a franchise tax having no relation to the privilege granted by this State to appellee as an operating company or to any function actually performed herein.” And again (p. 225, A. p. 413) : “In view of the fact that the legislature intended only to levy a tax on a measure fairly representative of the corporation’s franchise to do business in this State, under the exceptional situation here presented, it is the duty of the Court to construe the Act so as to cause the statute’s application to be both constitutional and fair.” Accordingly we held that, in determining the franchise tax to be levied on the Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation, the value of its assets represented by capital stock used in connection with its holding company business should have been excluded by the taxing officials.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This ruling was in accord with a number of cases in the Supreme Court of the United States holding that, in fixing the taxable value with reference to business done within the state where capital stock is used as a measure, the property without the state may be taken into consideration only if it be an organic or functional part of the property within <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>the state; thus only may the taxation of extraterritorial values be prevented: <em>Wallace v.

Apparently the question did not arise with regard to the <em>corporate net income tax </em>until the case of <em>Commonwealth v. The Baker-Whiteley Coal Company, </em>60 Dauph. 434 (aff. 62 Dauph. 207). There a corporation was engaged in two distinct and unrelated businesses, to wit, a tugboat business conducted wholly outside of Pennsylvania and a coal business conducted <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, the one business being completely segregated from the other; the doctrine of the <em>Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation </em>case was followed because the general scheme of the Capital Stock Tax Act and that of the Corporate Net Income Tax Act are identical. Since that decision the taxing officials of the Commonwealth have indiscriminately sought to impose the corporate net income tax on a multiform basis in the case of corporations having multiform activities just as theretofore with respect to the franchise tax. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company resists that attempt because, as previously pointed out, its tax for the year 1950 on a unitary basis would be only $24, 602.33, whereas on the multiform basis it would be $237, 756.83, the difference resulting from the large deduction from its total income of dividends received from other corporations to which it would be entitled under the terms of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[253,1333,1155,993]],["BL_541.1",541,[161,338,1151,1721]]]'>As already stated, it is clear that the Corporate Net Income Tax Act neither expressly nor impliedly provides for a computation of the tax on any other than a unitary basis, making no differentiation in the case of corporations carrying on multiform activities. According to its definition of net income, that of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was $13,-741, 552.02, not $58, 634, 159.64, as contended by the Commonwealth. What the <em>Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation </em>case decided, — -and all that it decided— was that if, <em>in a particular instance, </em>the application of the formula expressly specified in the Capital Stock Tax Act worked an unconstitutional result by imposing upon the corporation the taxation of values beyond the taxing power of the State, and if the corporation therefore objected to the tax, the Act must be so construed and applied as to avoid such a result by computing the tax on a multiform instead of a unitary <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>basis. In the present case, however, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, so far from objecting to the application to it of the express provisions of the Corporate Net Income Tax Act, insists upon such application being made. It points out that this would not involve the taxation by Pennsylvania of any extraterritorial values inasmuch as the permissible deduction of the dividends of other corporations from the net receipts of its General Department results in no portion whatever of such receipts being taxed by Pennsylvania. Be that as it may, it is clear that, if the application of the Act according to its express terms is not objected to by the Company as involving in its particular case any unconstitutional or. unfair result such as existed in the <em>Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation </em>case, it does not lie with the Commonwealth to refuse to apply the Act as written and thereby attempt to impose a higher tax than the Act provides. The Commonwealth argues that its own taxing officials may raise a question as to the constitutionality of the statute, but this overlooks the fact that the Act is not unconstitutional; it is only when its application in a given case brings about an unconstitutional result and the taxpaying corporation accordingly objects thereto, that it must be applied so as to avoid such a consequence. Since the Act as applied to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company does not involve any such unconstitutional result, and the Company makes no claim to the contrary, the court below properly fixed the tax in the amount of 124, 602.33.</p>
