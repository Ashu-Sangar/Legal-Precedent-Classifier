They argue that it rests only in the legislature, which has not properly delegated or granted to the city the right to control rents and evictions. But section 17 of the First Class City Home Rule Act of 1949, P. L. 665, 53 PS §3421.17, provides, inter alia: “The charter of any city adopted or amended in accordance with this act may provide . . . for the exercise of <em>any and all powers </em>relating to its municipal functions, not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States or of this Commonwealth, <em>to the full extent that the General Assembly may legislate in reference thereto .. ., and with lihe effect, and the city may enact ordinances, rules and regulations necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested in the city by the charter it adopts or by this or any other law.” </em>(Italics supplied). The city, therefore, may legislate as to municipal functions as fully as could the General Assembly. By its adoption of the charter (April 17, 1951) the city was then clothed with police power. This necessarily encompassed authority to enact such ordinances as are for the health and welfare of its citizens. It is not necessary for its exercise over rents and evictions that they be specifically enumerated in the Act. Precedent for this lies in the cases where, under their general police powers, municipalities have been sustained in the regu<a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>lation of restaurants, signs, construction and height of buildings, fair employment practices, and other like matters. <em>Kline v. Harrisburg, </em><a href="/pa/362/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="362 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="477322" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0438-01">362 Pa. 438</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20A.2d%20182" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="68 A.2d 182">68 A. 2d 182</a>, is not controlling. That case involved The Third Class City Law of 1931, P. L. 932, 53 PS §12198-101 et seq., which granted general police powers and also <em>specifically </em>granted zoning powers to third class cities. This Court held' that the authority of a municipal body must be exercised strictly in the manner provided in the statute; and that the city could impose zoning requirements solely- in accordance with the specific provisions of the Act. Cf. Section 63 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 PS §563.</p>
    <p id="b407-5" data-blocks='[["BL_407.5",407,[153,1067,1150,322]]]'>Contrary to appellees’ contention, the pleadings do not establish an improper delegation of judicial power to the Rent Commission.

    <p id="b407-7" data-blocks='[["BL_407.7",407,[153,1457,1150,491]]]'>Appellees further contend that the ordinance is invalid because it conflicts with The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951, P. L. 69, 68 PS §250.101. This Act sets up the procedure whereby a landlord may repossess premises if he has a <em>right </em>to evict the tenant. The substantive law as to <em>when </em>he has a right to evict is not touched upon. The Landlord and Tenant Act is not an exercise of police powers by the state, and hence is not'in- derogation of the police power of the city.</p>
