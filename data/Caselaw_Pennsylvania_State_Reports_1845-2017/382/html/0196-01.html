At the same time one Sterling Myers was operating a Chevrolet car west on Highway Route 234 in that Borough. The two cars collided at the intersection of these two highways which forms the “Center Square” of the Borough. Joseph Ratcliff, a passenger in the Yost car, was injured in the collision and brought suit to recover damages against Sterling Myers and the latter’s father, Albert, on whose business Sterling was driving the Chevrolet. The defendants brought in Yost and his employer, the Bryant Air Conditioning Corporation, as additional defendants. In so joining them Sterling Myers claimed also to recover from them the damages which he himself had suffered in the accident, and Albert Myers claimed to recover the damages to his automobile. Yost, on the other hand, filed a counterclaim against Sterling <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>and Albert Myers to recover the damage to <em>Ms </em>automobile.</p>

The testimony at the trial disclosed that the two automobiles, each proceeding at a reasonably low rate of speed and traveling on the right side of their respective roadways, reached the intersection at about the same time. They met at or near the center of the intersection, the left front of the Yost car and the right front of the Myers car coming into contact. There was a traffic light overhanging the center of the intersection; it showed a green light for Myers proceeding westward on Route 234 but no light at all to Yost coming south on Route 194 as the red light was out of order and was not functioning. Yost testified that as he started to enter the intersection he could see about 40 or 50 feet to his left; he looked and saw nothing coming; he went ahead and when he was about half way into the intersection he looked again and the Myers car was then about 20 feet away. Sterling Myers testified that <em>Tie </em>looked, saw the green light in his favor, and the next thing he knew he “was in the intersection and we were in collision”; he said that when he first noticed the Yost car “seeing and hitting was just one.”</p>

However, he left to the jury to determine, in plaintiff’s action against the original defendants, whether Myers was in fact negligent. He also submitted to the jury whether Yost was negligent, and whether plaintiff was entitled to recovery against the original defendants, the additional defendants, or both, and whether Yost was entitled to recover on his counterclaim. The jury re<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>turned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $12,500 against the additional defendants, Yost and the Bryant Corporation, hut a verdict in favor of the original defendants, Sterling and Albert Myers. The latter moved to take off the compulsory nonsuits entered in their actions against the additional defendants; this motion the court denied. The additional defendants moved for judgment n.o.v. against the original defendants with respect to plaintiff’s claim and also with respect to Yost’s counterclaim; this motion the court also denied. The additional defendants also moved for a new trial on the ground that the court should have charged the jury that the original defendants were negligent as a matter of law and therefore jointly liable to the plaintiff with the additional defendants; the court granted a new trial, limiting the issue to the liability of the original defendants in conjunction with that of the additional defendants for the happening of the accident. Two appeals to this court have resulted from those rulings, — one, that of the original defendants from the grant of a new trial; the other, that of the additional defendants from the refusal of their motion for judgment n.o.v. against the original defendants.</p>

Certainly he was either negligent or not negligent, and his legal rights and liabilities in relation to all the other parties in<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>volved in the accident should follow a consistent pattern. The court, recognizing this, and obviously and properly regarding the jury’s verdict exculpating Sterling Myers as perverse, granted a new trial in order to have a jury again pass on the fact of his negligence.</p>
    <p id="b223-4" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[182,623,1156,1491]]]'>Was the court right in declaring Sterling Myers negligent as a matter of law in the matter of his claim against the additional defendants? It is well established that an operator of a motor vehicle who does not look for moving traffic on an intersecting street as he approaches the intersection is guilty of negligence as a matter of law even though he proceeds across the intersecting street with a traffic light in his favor: <em>Lewis v. Quinn, </em><a href="/pa/376/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="376 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1246202" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0109-01">376 Pa. 109</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20382" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="101 A.2d 382">101 A. 2d 382</a>. Myers himself admitted that “seeing and hitting was one,” which is proof positive that he could not have looked up Highway Route 194 before entering the intersection; it must also be borne in mind that the Yost car, coming from the right, had the right of way. It is true that the jury viewed the scene of the accident but this was merely in order to enable them the better to understand the testimony and to visualize the occurrence; if they saw anything which might tend to relieve Myers of liability it is not a part of the record and cannot weigh against the evidence. The court was therefore justified in declaring Myers guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, and indeed he has not appealed from that ruling. Under such circumstances there was nothing for the court to do but grant a new trial in plaintiff’s action since a verdict so incompatible with the decision of the court and so patently contrary to the weight of the evidence could not be allowed to stand.</p>

It was also proper for the court to restrict the new trial solely to the determination of the question of the liability of the original defendants, leaving undisturbed plaintiff's verdict against the additional defendants as well as the amount of the recovery to which he will be entitled against the original defendants should it be adjudged that Sterling Myers was negligent: <em>Trerotola v.

Myers filed his praecipe for a writ joining as additional defendants Yost and the latter’s employer, Bryant Air Conditioning Corporation, on whose business Yost was engaged at the time of the collision. Also, Myers and his father, Albert, the owner of the car which the son was driving at the time of the accident on his father’s business, instituted a separate action against Yost and his employer to recover for personal <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>injuries to Sterling Myers and for damage to Albert Myers’ car. Yost filed a counterclaim in this action, claiming damages of the Myers for injury to his automobile.

In view of the testimony and, especially, the physical situation existing at the scene of the collision, the jury exculpated Sterling Myers of any fault and returned a verdict in his and his father’s favor with respect to both Ratcliff’s and Yost’s claims against them and a verdict for Ratcliff in a substantial sum against Yost for his personal injuries.</p>

Both matters were, therefore, assignable here for error. But, that is no longer important. The Myers, in their brief in this court, make no point of the lower court’s refusal to remove the nonsuits and they limit their present complaint to the grant of a new trial as to them.

Nor is that unconstitutional situation obviated by the procedure which the majority opinion now advances and which, in effect, ivould be an action limited to imposing liability on the Myers for contribution on account of Ratcliff’s verdict against Yost.

At the request of Ratcliff’s counsel the court permitted the jury to view the scene of the collision and the surrounding locality and, in charging the jury later, the trial judge said, “You people, of course, had the benefit of viewing the situation, seeing the ground, and in their arguments counsel have indicated to you what view was obtainable basing that on the recollection of what you saw.” However, we do not predicate any-<a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>tiling on -what the jury may possibly have seen at the view. There is nothing of record to indicate what they saw. Manifestly, the questions involved are to be dealt with on the basis of the evidence adduced at trial. And, such evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom must be taken in the light most favorable to Myers not only because the jury’s verdict was in his favor but also because the nonsuit against him was entered compulsorily.</p>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[249,830,1149,1209]]]'>In addition to the position of the automobiles in the center square after the collision, as above related, the testimony is that at the time of the collision each driver was proceeding on the right-hand side of his respective roadway. From that, it follows with mathematical precision that Myers was beyond the center line of the intersection and Yost had just entered the intersection when their automobiles came together. This fact was confirmed by the trial judge when he said in his instructions to the jury that “The Myers’ car, of course, had traversed half of Harrisburg Street [Route 194] and a little bit more than half of Harrisburg Street in order to arrive at the point of impact.” How, then, could Myers possibly be declared negligent <em>as a matter of law"! </em>He had entered the intersection on a green light and had proceeded more than halfway through the intersection when Yost’s car, which had just entered the intersection a few feet away without a favorable signal, had come upon him. Ratcliff testified that, at the time the two cars came together, “We [i.e., he and Yost] were <em>practically </em>in the intersection. We were <em>in </em>— to the intersection” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

Granted that Myers did not see the Yost car until it was upon him, he had progressed so far in his crossing in pursuance of his right of way that any question of his want of care in the existing circumstances was a question of fact for the jury. In <em>Graff v. Scott Bros., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/315/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="315 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1156722" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0262-01">315 Pa. 262</a>, 265, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.%20659" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="172 A. 659">172 A. 659</a>, the plaintiff approached a right-angle street intersection which he entered on a green light, having observed that traffic to his right on the one-way cross street had halted in apparent obedience to a red light. While proceeding across the intersection, he was struck by defendant’s car which had moved through an open lane in the arrested traffic on the cross street. The plaintiff testified in that case that he did not see the defendant’s car <em>until the instant of the collision. </em>In affirming a judgment for the plaintiff, Mr. Justice Maxey said for this court, — “Certainly the fact that he [the plaintiff], after seeing the traffic light and the arrested traffic, did not make further observations, does not disclose such negligence on his part that the court would be justified in declaring it as a matter of law.” Here, Myers’ right to assume that approaching traffic on the cross street would not violate the red light, which should have been showing there, was the equivalent of arrested traffic when he entered the intersection on a green light. A motorist has a right to assume that a traffic light favorable to him will be obeyed by traffic on a cross street: <em>Zurcher v.

The speed of Yost’s unbidden entrance was not less than 25 miles an hour. Myers, proceeding on a green light and without knowledge that the stop signal for the cross street was not operating, had every reason to assume that traffic on the cross street, if any, would heed the traffic signals. And so, as in the <em>Graff </em>case, supra, a lack of further observations by Myers did not disclose such negligence on his part that the court was justified in declaring it as a matter of law.</p>
    <p id="b232-4" data-blocks='[["BL_232.5",232,[249,945,1150,1035]]]'>The majority opinion infers from Myers’ frank statement that he did not see the Yost car until it collided with his own that he must not have looked to his right before entering the intersection. The conclusion does not rest on fact. Myers did not testify and was not asked whether he had looked to his right or left before entering the intersection. And, no one says that he did not. Nor can such adverse inference be drawn as a matter of law on the assumption that, had Myers looked to the north on Harrisburg Street prior to the collision, he would have seen Yost approaching the intersection. At Myers’ then stage of progress through the intersection, whether he was guilty of negligence in not turning his head to look from side to side was a question of fact for the jury. To borrow an apt observation of a learned jurist,— “[N]o automobilist attentive to the driving of his car can continue to look long in any direction unless that direction is forward.”</p>

It does not mean that the person receiving the signal may proceed without a care or thought as to the safety of others <em>who may be in his </em>path” (Emphasis supplied). It is plain enough that what the learned justice was speaking about was that one at a street intersection, having a “go” signal, could not on that account proceed without regard for the safety of those already in the intersection and in his pathway. However, from that clear and sound pronouncement there unfortunately appears to have grown up an idea that one having the green light at a street intersection must not only observe and be careful for the safety of those already in the intersection and in his pathway but he must also look up and down the cross streets, and continue so to do as he proceeds across, in anticipation of law violators on the cross street who perchance might not heed the stop signal or red light against them. If that should become the fixed rule, then we shall have nullified completely the <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>use of electric traffic signals which have been one of the greatest contributions to the safety of both pedestrians and automotive travelers at street intersections.</p>

On the contrary, the learned trial judge erroneously charged that, since the traffic signal was not showing a light in the direction of Yost’s approach, the situation was the same as if there were no traffic signal at all at the intersection and, for that reason, Yost, who was on Myers’ right, had the right of way. The error of that instruction is twofold. First, there is neither rule of law nor regulation of The Vehicle Code that obliterates the effect of electric signal control of traffic at a street intersection when one of the lights happens not to be operating. Obviously, where a traffic signal is not showing a light, it is an approaching driver’s duty to proceed with caution on the assumption that the light may be showing green for cross traffic. Second, “the rule of the right” pertains to a situation where two drivers arrive at a street intersection more or less simultaneously and there is neither mechanical nor manual traffic control. As we have already seen, Yost and Myers did not arrive at the intersection at the same time. Myers was more than half way through the intersection, and at a slower speed than Yost, when the latter first entered the intersection.</p>
