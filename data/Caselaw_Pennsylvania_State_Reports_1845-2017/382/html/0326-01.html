Marine Trade Association is a nonprofit corporation comprising in its membership steamship lines, steamship agents, stevedoring companies, tugboat and barge companies, marine terminal operators, warehouses and companies rendering other services in and to the marine industry in and about, the Port of Philadelphia. On March 12, 1954, as collective <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>bargaining agent for those of its members who employ longshoremen, it entered into an agreement with the ■International Longshoremen’s Association for the Port of Philadelphia and Vicinity and its affiliated Locals 1290, 1291, 1332, 1566 and 1694, as collective bargaining agent for deep-sea longshoremen in the Port of Philadelphia. The agreement, which was to be in effect until September 30, 1955, contained various provisions in regard to the loading and unloading of oceangoing ships in the Port of Philadelphia and vicinity. One of its obvious purposes was to prevent work stoppages, a joint sub-committee of the parties being established to make recommendations for that purpose.</p>

This innovation apparently involved the displacement of a number of longshoremen engaged in the handling of the cargoes of sugar, but Local 1291 did not concede that such a result necessarily followed. The question of the number of men to be employed at the pier upon the installation of the new system thus became a matter of controversy between the Trade Association and the Union.</p>

The Trade Association then called upon the Union to join in the submission of the matter to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 28, but the Union took the position that Paragraph 11(d) was not subject to the arbitration procedure prescribed by Paragraph 28 and refused to appoint representatives to serve on a Grievance Committee as therein provided. The Sugar Refining Company put the new operation into effect, reducing the number of men employed from some 160 to 108, whereupon the longshoremen refused to work at the pier unless as many of them were employed as before the new system was installed. The present action was then instituted by the Trade Association, the Sugar Refining Company and Dugan &amp; McNamara, Inc., the last named being the contractor which furnishes all stevedoring services to the Sugar Refining Company at its pier and is the employer of the longshoremen here involved. The defendants named in the action were the Local Union No. 1291, certain of its officers and officials, and the 160 longshoremen employed by Dugan &amp; McNamara, <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>Inc. who had stopped work. Plaintiffs prayed for an injunction restraining the Union from violating the collective bargaining agreement, from failing and refusing to participate in the arbitration procedures prescribed by the agreement, from committing any action in violation of the no work-stoppage agreement, and from refusing to supply longshoremen to Dugan &amp; McNamara, Inc. for stevedoring services at the pier. As a result of the work stoppage Dugan &amp; McNamara, Inc. was prevented from fulfilling its contract with the Sugar Refining Company, all unloading of sugar cargoes ceased, and great numbers of the Company’s employes were thrown out of employment. The court, on affidavits, issued a preliminary injunction as prayed for, and subsequently, after a hearing, continued the injunction until final hearing. From that order defendants filed the present appeal.</p>

It was there argued that Congress, by enactment of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, had taken from the State courts the jurisdiction to issue such an injunction, but we held that neither that Act nor any other Federal legislation deprived the State courts of their inherent equity powers for the enforcement of contracts. We pointed out that- Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, giving jurisdiction to District Courts of the United States of suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employes in an industry affecting commerce, did not indicate that such jurisdiction was to be exclusive; moreover, it applied only to suits for the recovery of damages, not for injunctive relief, the right to grant which had been denied to such courts by the Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932. We said (p. 82, A. 2d 255) : “There does not exist any repugnance or conflict, direct or indirect, between the exercise of jurisdiction by a court of equity as in the instant case and the Labor Management Relations Act and the Norris-LaGuardia Act. There are no statutes which would curtail the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court in the circumstances here presented. Prevention of violation of obligations contained in a contract by injunctive relief is a power traditionally exercised by courts of this Commonwealth. Congress has not acted upon the specific subject matter at issue. Enforcement of contracts may be required according to the usual processes of the law.”</p>

In fact the Congressional conference committee report on the Labor-Management Relations Act, in referring to the deletion in the Senate bill above mentioned, stated that “Once parties have made a collective bargaining contract the enforcement of that contract should be left to the usual processes of the law and not to the National Labor Relations Board.” It may be added that the day after the present action was instituted defendants removed the proceedings to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania but that court promptly remanded the proceedings to the State court upon the ground that the Federal court had no jurisdiction. Defendants, now seeking further grounds for ousting the jurisdiction of the State court, claim that the case involves a matter of unfair labor practices and also a jurisdictional dispute between rival labor unions, but the present record furnishes no support whatever for either of those contentions.</p>

Both parties admit that under Paragraph 11(d) the number of men to be employed in view of the adoption of the new technological advancement in machinery or method was a subject for negotiation by the committee provided for in the agreement, and such negotiations were in fact entered upon, but, notwithstanding protracted discussions, no agreement could be reached. Of course no governmental authority, whether executive or judicial, has the power to compel negotiators to come to an agreement. Was the problem then to remain unsolvable? Obviously not, for in such situations recourse must ultimately be had to some tribunal having the power to decide the issue, either a court or a body selected by the parties themselves. In the present case the collective bargaining agreement established such a tribunal, for Paragraph 28 provided that all disputes and grievances <em>of &lt;my hind or nature whatsoever </em>arising under the agreement should be referred to a Grievance Committee, and, if that body should prove unable to resolve the issue submitted, they should immediately refer the matter to an Impartial Arbitrator therein named. Nothing could be clearer, therefore, than that, negotiations having failed under Paragraph 11(d), the dispute had to be referred to the arbitration machinery set up in Paragraph 28. Defendants point to cases such as <em>Henry v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/215/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="215 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="948419" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0448-01">215 Pa. 448</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.%20635" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="64 A. 635">64 A. 635</a>, and <em>B.

What defendants overlook, however, is that the tribunals there set up were each to be independent and final, whereas here the arbitration procedure was to come into operation only after the deliberations of the negotiating committee proved ineffective and failed to settle the controversy. Moreover, we are of opinion that the provision in the agreement requiring arbitration under the circumstances here present is so clear that the question as to whether the dispute between the parties is subject to such arbitration does not itself constitute an arbitrable issue. The construction of a contract to determine what questions the parties have agreed therein to submit to arbitration is one, not for the arbitrators themselves, but for the. court to decide, and the court will not readily infer that it was intended to empower the arbitrators to determine the extent of their own jurisdiction: <em>International Association of Machinists v.

An injunction is a violent measure that should only be utilized to prevent or repel a greater violence. It is for that reason that the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the Labor Anti-Injunction Acts have come close to completely outlawing injunctions in all labor disputes. Of course, Congress did enlarge, in the Labor-Management Relations Act, the scope of injunctive action where national security is involved, but it in no way lifted the bars against injunctions where a collective bargaining agreement was the subject of litigation.

The <em>Alcoa </em>case decided that the plaintiff there, under the circumstances of that case, was not entitled to injunctive relief in the United States District Court.

The record here suggests that the Chancellor, instead of removing any coat of fixed impressions, donned several more as the trial progressed. His task was to ascertain whether the Agreement really required the defendants to arbitrate the differences between them and the plaintiffs. The Chancellor, however, assumed from the beginning that arbitration was imperative. Thus: “The Court: If the people involved were negotiating and they se<a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>lected their arbitrator, Father Comey, <em>as the contract requires, </em>the ease would not be here. Me. Freedman : I object to your Honor’s statement ‘as the contract requires.’ Your Honor has not even examined the contract. The Court : Well, the contract has just been read to me that where there is a dispute, they have to present it to some grievance committee and when they cannot agree, <em>they hare to submit the matter in dispute to Father Gomey. </em>Isn’t that the situation?”</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[254,839,1152,591]]]'>Also: “The Court : Go ahead. These people should be down there working and earning a living. Mr. Freedman: And I take exception to your Honor’s remarks and I again ask that you disqualify yourself from hearing this case because that is further evidence that you have already prejudged the case. The Court: Not at all. <em>You hare an agreement there that Father Gomey is your arbitrator and you just ignore it. </em>Mr. Freedman : I again object to that and ask that you disqualify yourself, again because it indicates that you are prejudging the ease. The Court: Not at all.”</p>
    <p id="b372-5" data-blocks='[["BL_372.6",372,[254,1443,1150,879]],["BL_373.1",373,[152,331,1151,770]]]'>The Chancellor’s treatment of defendants’ counsel was as unfortunate as it was uncalled-for. For instance, he charged the defendants’ lawyer with misleading the defendants. This is a serious imputation and cannot be supported by the record. There is nothing in the testimony to even remotely suggest that Mr. Freedman Avas doing other than properly protecting the interests of those he was ably representing. I see no justification for the Court’s animadversions reflected in the following: “The Court: <em>I think these people are being very badly misled. </em>Mr. Freedman: And I again ask your Honor to disqualify yourself. The Court: No, no. Mr. Freedman: And I object to your Honor’s statement. The Court: You can object to it all you want. That is as plain as the nose on anybody’s face. Mr. Freedman: Your Honor knows, and <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>you asked me the question before — The Court: <em>You would serve your clients better if you would tell them to abide by their agreement and go to Father </em>Gomey— Mr. Freedman: Your Honor knows — The Court: Let me finish. <em>Go to Father Gomey and submit their argument to him </em>— and he may decide in their favor — instead of making a court case out of it. Mr. Freedman : I object to your Honor telling me what to do. I have a right to use my own judgment and I ask your Honor to limit your consideration to this case. The Court: I am not telling you what to do. Mr. Freedman : You just did. The Court : I am telling you that these litigants would be better off if they would abide by their agreement.”</p>
    <p id="b373-3" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[149,1115,1152,931]]]'>With equal disregard for the respect due all members of the Bar, the Chancellor charged counsel with trying to “find ways and means and loopholes” to avoid an obligation: “The Court : Look here, you have better sense than that. What is the purpose of putting in the agreement the provision about submitting all matters in dispute to Father Comey? The very purpose is to try to keep disputes out of the courts. Mr. Freedman: Well, your Honor knows — The Court: Wait a minute. Let me finish. It seems to me that you are trying to find ways and means and loopholes to get out of it. Mr. Freedman: I object to your Hon- or’s statement — The Court: You can object to it, but that is my opinion. Mr. Freedman: It again indicates your Honor’s frame of mind. The Court: Not at all. I remember the last litigation and that is exactly what you are trying to do.”</p>
    <p id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[148,2059,1150,270]],["BL_374.1",374,[252,336,1149,701]]]'>Although it is difficult to believe that the Chancellor would deliberately close his ears to legitimate argument in a case, yet the record here shows that the Chancellor declared he would refuse to listen: “By Mr. Freedman : Q. Did not the Philadelphia Marine Trade <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>Association from time to time during the past year refuse to give employment to the longshoremen members of Local 1291, this union, and all other members of the International Longshoremen’s Association? Mr. Rhoads: I object to that. It is the same question. The Court: The objection is sustained. <em>There was a right to go to Father Gomey and get redress, if necessary. </em>Mr. Freedman: I take exception to your Honor’s remarks. The Court: Well, your question certainly is not pertinent here. Mr. Freedman : If your Honor will listen to me, perhaps you will change your mind. The Court: <em>I will not listen. </em>You put your questions to him.”</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[251,1056,1150,598]]]'>It appears to me, as the above illustrations would indicate, that the defendants failed to receive the impartial hearing to which they were entitled under our Constitution, the laws of the land and all traditions of fairness and undeviating impartiality which govern proceedings in our courts. Every lawyer has the right to be treated with courtesy, listened to with attention and replied to with deliberation. As I read the record, the Trial Judge here failed to observe these tenets and, for that reason, added to what I have further observed on the various questions involved, I would reverse.</p>
