The Telephone Company and all of the affiliates whose dealings with the Company are here questioned are apparently owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the same individual, former Senator Sordoni. Four specific questions are raised on the appeal: (1) the propriety of the allowance by the Commission of certain payments made to affiliates for services rendered by them to the Telephone Company, in the absence of evidence clearly showing the nature and the amount of the services, the cost to the affiliates for rendering the services, and the profit made by them; (2) the propriety of the inclusion by the Commission in the rate base of a large sum for quantities of materials and supplies stockpiled for future use for expansion and in the conversion of the telephone system from manual to automatic operation, where the rate base already included the equipment which the stored materials would replace; (8) the propriety of the Commission’s fixing the Company’s fair rate of return at 6.8%; (4) the propriety of the Commission’s finding as to the estimated annual revenues of' the Company under the new rates.</p>

Yet, except for statements to the effect that one building was constructed at “bare cost” with no profit added, and that the price to the Telephone Company compared favorably with the contract price of similar work performed for the Bell Telephone and other companies, the record contains no evidence to indicate what the cost to the Sordoni Construction Company was, and the Commission made no finding in that regard or whether the profits were reasonable or unreasonable under all the circumstances. The profits made in the case of the other companies is not necessarily the profit allowable in the case of an inter-affiliate transaction, it being the reasonable cost to the affiliate, plus presumably a reasonable profit, which is the statutorily prescribed cost allowed to the utility for the purposes of its rate base.

There was no evidence to demonstrate the need for or advantage to the utility of such a purchase and the only evidence of the reasonableness of the cost was that the price paid was alleged to compare favorably with the then prevailing OPA price. However, since the OPA prices were computed on the basis of age and model and without regard to the actual condition of the car, it ivould seem that the probative value of such evidence was, to say the least, doubtful and not sufficient to justify the inclusion of the cost of these vehicles in the rate base. On remand, the Commission should make findings with respect to the actual value to the Telephone Company of the vehicles so transferred and the reasonable necessity for their purchase.</p>

Such payments apparently amounted to not more than $10,900 per year, so that the Public Service Corporation would seem to have retained some 70% of its income as profit.

What the value is of the entire building, what part of that value is represented by the leased space, what the maintenance expenses of the Inn were, what profit was made by it under the lease, and what it would have cost the Telephone Company to rent similar facilities, if available, from a non-affiliate in that area, — all these facts were not shown in the evidence, lacking which it could not be determined whether the payment to the Inn was properly allowed as an item of expense and the cost of the alterations as a permissible inclusion in the rate base.</p>

In affirming the Commission’s order the Superior Court stated (p. 25, A. p. 885) that “Except in the case of a few minor items, which are de minimis, appellants are unable to present adequate competent evidence that the plant additions were improper, unnecessary or too costly. The fact that the work was done and a profit made by an affiliate raises only the necessity of close scrutiny of the transactions which, in the absence of evidence, we can presume was given by the Commission.” But the <em>appellants </em>did not have the burden of proving that the plant additions were improper, unnecessary or too costly; on the contrary, that burden is, by statute, on the utility to demonstrate the reasonable necessity and cost of the installations, and that is the burden which the utility patently failed to carry. There is, of course, a presumption that the Commission closely scrutinized the evidence in regard to the inter-affiliate transactions, but that presumption does not supply the evidence to be scrutinized; here it is manifest that the Commission could not have closely scrutinized the reasonable necessity and cost of the dealings with the affiliates because a reading of the record discloses that the utility offered wholly inadequate evidence in discharge of its burden of proof.</p>

      <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>There are matters not directly related to the inter-affiliate dealings which are in question. The Commission allowed $475,000 in the rate base for the utility’s inventory of materials and supplies as part of its physical working capital as of September 30, 1952, whereas at the end of 1950 such inventory had amounted to somewhat less than $300,000. Appellants contended, therefore, that the Commission erred in approving this substantial increase in the quantities of equipment because there was an apparent overstocking of telephones, telephone poles, switchboards and other items, and either these materials and supplies were being artificially inflated for the purpose of securing the rate increase or much of them were intended for use, not for current maintenance, but for remote future expansion or in pursuance of a program for conversion from manual to automatic operation of the system.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> While the Telephone Company showed the actual increase in the number of telephone subscribers in recent years it did not show any adequate relation between the actual expansion and the quantity of materials and supplies retained for expansion purposes so as to enable the Commission to determine the proper allowance in the inventory for materials and supplies stocked for normal expansion.</p>

A proper rate <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>of return, which of course should be reasonable and not confiscatory, is necessarily to be determined from the evidence adduced. Here the record does not sustain the Commission’s finding that a return of 6.8% was reasonable. For example, the Commission found 4.3% as the cost of debt capital whereas the utility actually obtained over $1,000,000 secured by mortgage bonds, at 4%. Similarly the Commission ignored the unique financial position of the utility in finding that its current cost of equity capital was 11%. The evidence to support this figure consisted of various averages based on common stock offerings by independent telephone companies during the three preceding years, but there was nothing to indicate that the condition of those companies was analogous to that of this Telephone Company. As pointed out by President Judge Rhodes in his dissenting opinion in the Superior Court (p. 34, A. p. 890) : “This privately owned and financially secure company, part of a large system of privately owned enterprises, is in a unique position relative to cost of capital. Its status in this regard is analogous to the Bell system, with which it is connected, rather than the ordinary small, independent telephone company.” The error of the Commission lay in its disregard of the utility’s history and unusual position, and we agree with President Judge Rhodes that the findings of the Commission on the rate of return were so arbitrary, unreasonable, and unsupported by evidence, as to amount to an error of law.
