It undoubtedly is the established law that if the constitutional debt limit is not exceeded by the proposed increase at the time of its authorization<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> a loan made pursuant thereto does not become invalid even if, at the time it is contracted, the city’s borrowing limit is thereby exceeded; on the other hand, it presumably follows that if the amount authorized would, at the time, result in the then existing limit being exceeded, a subsequent issue of bonds would not be valid even though at the time of their issuance the then existing limit, due to a rise in the as<a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>sessed valuations of the property following the authorization, would not be exceeded thereby. As was concisely stated by Mr. Justice Drew in his dissenting opinion in the <em>Duane </em>case (p. 51, A. p. 409) : “Under, the ruling of the majority [in that case] the validity of a loan is irrevocably determined as of the time of its authorization, and if a subsequent change in conditions cannot nullify a valid authorization, neither can such a change validate a loan rendered invalid because in excess of the debt limit at the time of authorization.”</p>
    <p id="b634-4" data-blocks='[["BL_634.5",634,[260,950,1153,1374]],["BL_635.1",635,[172,338,1152,1208]]]'>The present question, therefore, resolves itself to this: Since the amount of the city’s debt limit must be determined as of the time of the authorization of the proposed increase, must such authorization go into effect simultaneously with the date of the enactment of the ordinance or may the ordinance provide that the authorization shall become effective only upon a subsequent date therein specified? Here the ordinance provided that the authority therein granted to increase the city’s indebtedness should not be valid and effective until January 3, 1955, such a provision being analogous to the ordinary and familiar specifications by statutes of their effective dates. It is obvious that if the present ordinance had been actually enacted on January 3, 1955, there could be no possible doubt of its validity; here the same result is reached by an enactment of the ordinance before that date but with a provision that it should become effective only on January 3,1955,- — -in other words, just as if it were enacted on that date and made effective immediately. This does not involve any departure from the decisions in the cases above referred to since the city’s borrowing capacity is here determined, as there required, at the time of the authorization of the increase of the debt and not at the time when the bonds in pursuance there<a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>of will be issued, tbe only variation being that the time of the effective authorization is here expressly specified in the ordinance, at which time the city’s debt limit was not exceeded by the increase. If, due to a fall in the assessed valuations of the taxable property of the city, the constitutional debt limit would be exceeded at the time of the issuance of the bonds, the bonds would nevertheless be valid; if, on the other hand, the debt limit would have been exceeded on January 3, 1955 by the proposed increase, bonds could not validly be issued thereafter even though, due to a rise in the assessed valuations of the city’s taxable property, the constitutional debt limit would not be exceeded at the time of such issuance. As to the condition set forth in the ordinance that the amount of the city’s indebtedness on January 3, 1955, plus the authorized loan, must not exceed the city’s borrowing capacity on that date, this was merely an expression of what the law, in any event, would require, being a condition that would similarly apply even if an authorization were to be effective at the time of the enactment of the ordinance.</p>

The same consideration of expediency demands that the procedure here adopted by the city be sustained as wholly proper and legal. Under the Home Rule Charter both an operating budget and a capital budget for the ensuing fiscal year must be submitted by the Mayor to the Council not later than 90 days before the end of the current fiscal year, and the Council must adopt the annual operating budget ordinance and the capital budget at least 30 days before the end of the current fiscal year. It is, of course, important that there be known at the time of the enact-<a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>merit of such a loan ordinance and the subsequent approving election what the borrowing capacity of the city will be during the ensuing year, since otherwise the budgetary planning would necessarily be largely conjectural, but such borrowing capacity, based on the assessed valuations of the taxable realty during the ten years immediately preceding the year in which the increase is made, is. in fact known, under existing legislation and practice, long prior to the beginning of the ensuing year. Therefore, in the situation which here existed, it was possible and highly desirable to obtain the prompt consent of the electors to an increase in the debt which could then be utilized immediately after the beginning of the ensuing year, whereas, if plaintiff’s view were to prevail, it would be impossible to obtain such consent until the yeat in which the loan was to be made, and then only when a primary election was scheduled or a special election could be held.</p>
