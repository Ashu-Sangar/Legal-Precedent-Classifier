The defendant filed a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer under Pa. R.C.P. 1017 (b)4 to the effect that .the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, being an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, was immune from suit for consequential damages to real estate which is what the complaint embraced.

The immunity which the appellee thus imputes to itself may be conceded. But, that does not solve the problem which this record presents. This is not a case of injury due to an exercise of the.
