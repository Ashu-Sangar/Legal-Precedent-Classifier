In 1952 Congress enacted the so-called McGuire amendment to the Federal Trade Commission Act which reversed the doctrine declared in the Schwegmann case and removed firom the prohibition of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act ’ the nonsigner provisions of state fair trade acts. The Pennsylvania statute was clearly in force as to <em>intrastate </em>commerce since the Sherman Act applies only to interstate commerce.

In its opinion written by Mr. Justice Burling the Court said: “The foregoing authorities do not reach the present question, namely, whether a state statute in order to have effect must be reenacted after the relaxation of the federal restriction against its operation with respect to interstate commerce. Under the circumstances of the state and federal legislation involved herein we are of the opinion that reenactment of the state statute is not necessary. There is respectable authority for this determination. It is stated that ‘Where a state statute is declared unconstitutional or invalid because it is in conflict with federal legislation, the state statute is in effect merely unenforceable or suspended by the existence of the federal legislation.’ I Sutherland, Statutory Construction (3rd ed., Horack, 1913), sec. 2027, p. 501; Field, The Effect of an Unconstitutional Statute (1935), p. 286 et seq. Consequently, continues Sutherland’s work, ‘the repeal of the federal statute reinstates or revives the state law without an express re-enactment by the state legislature,’ and the same holds true where by express enactment Congress removes an obstacle to the operation of state legislation. I Sutherland, Statutory Construction, ubi supra, pp. 501-502. . .” The same result was had by the State of New York in <em>General Electric Company v. Masters, Inc., </em><a href="/ny/307/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="307 N.Y. 229" data-case-ids="2233989" data-case-paths="/ny/307/0229-01">307 N.Y. 229</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=120%20N.E.2d%20802" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="120 N.E.2d 802">120 N.E. 2d 802</a>, where the court stated: “In the instant cases, however, instead of having, by prior decision, limited the FeldCrawford Act to local commerce, we have squarely held that the statute applies to nonsignatories in <em>interstate </em>commerce, Calamia v.
