        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Allen M. Steabne,\nThe appeal is from a decree in equity enjoining a tenant in a transportation terminal from conducting a store for the retail sale of women\u2019s hosiery. The court found that the conduct of such business constituted \u201cundue competition\u201d with a retail women\u2019s hosiery merchant in an adjoining transportation terminal in violation of a provision in a written agreement.\nThe salient facts are largely undisputed and are thus stated by the Chancellor in his adjudication: \u201cPredecessors of plaintiff, Philadelphia Transportation Company, in 1905 and 1917, leased land at 69th Street to predecessors of defendant, Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company. In 1935 an agreement was entered into between the parties giving the predecessors of defendant Suburban the opportunity to reconstruct their terminal on land adjacent to plaintiff\u2019s terminal at 69th Street. In this agreement predecessors of defendant Suburban were limited to using for commercial purposes 25% of the total area leased under the 1905 and 1917 leases and this was also limited to commercial enterprises that are not unduly competitive with lessees in plaintiff\u2019s terminal. In April, 1953, defendant Suburban let space in its 69th Street Terminal to defendant Gay Hosiery for the sale of women\u2019s apparel, including women\u2019s hosiery. Plaintiff Transportation Company, upon learning of this event, notified defendant Suburban that its action violated their 1935 agreement in that defendant was using for commercial purposes more than 25% of the total area covered by the 1905 and 1917 leases, and that defendant Gay Hosiery would be unduly competitive with a lessee in plaintiff\u2019s adjoining terminal. Plaintiff brought the present complaint in equity to enjoin the action of defendants.\u201d\nThe Philadelphia Transportation Company, as indicated, leased space in its terminal to Carmine C. Bonanni for the sale of women\u2019s hosiery. He also sold women\u2019s aprons and bobby socks. Bonanni is employed by a hosiery manufacturer and supervises the finishing department. For a period he also operated a hosiery concession at the Broad and Olney terminus of the Philadelphia Transportation Company.\nOn April 1, 1953, defendant Suburban entered into a lease with co-defendant Gay Hosiery Company (whose main store is at 711 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia) whereby it agreed to lease space in Suburban\u2019s terminal to Gay \u201cfor the sale of hosiery, underwear, blouses, skirts and sportswear\u201d. Gay opened its store for business on October 6, 1953.\nThe Chancellor found:\n\u201cDuring the month of October, 1953, defendant Gay Hosiery\u2019s gross sales at its store in the 69th Street Terminal amounted to $9,788 of which approximately $2,500 or 25% thereof were sales of women\u2019s hosiery. During the month of November 1953, defendant Gay Hosiery had total sales of $9,082, of which approximately $2,250 were sales of women\u2019s hosiery.\u201d\n\u201cIn October, 1953, Bonanni\u2019s gross sales were $1,-266, a decrease of approximately 21% from his sales in October, 1952; and during the first 22 sales days of November, 1953, his gross sales were approximately $1,166, a decrease of about 18% from his sales in November, 1952.\u201d\nThe learned hearing Judge correctly stated in his adjudication that the \u201cagreement does not forbid competition; it forbids undue competition.\u201d\nAfter quoting comparative figures respecting total sales of both Bonanni and Gay for various periods, especially in October and November, 1953, the Chancellor reached the following conclusion: \u201cThe figures evidence that until Gay Hosiery went into business Bonanni\u2019s business was prospering, despite the selling of women\u2019s hosiery by Liggett\u2019s and Schulte. However, immediately upon the commencement of business by Gay Hosiery, Bonanni\u2019s business dropped drastically. The only logical conclusion is that the competition of Gay Hosiery is in fact undue.\u201d It is upon this conclusion that the court below entered its decree. Where the judgment of the court below is based upon inferences or deductions from other facts, the conclusion, being the result of reasoning, is subject to review and correction by an appellate Court: Blue Ridge Metal Manufacturing Company v. Proctor, 327 Pa. 424, 194 A. 559; William Sellers & Co., Inc. v. Clarke-Harrison, Inc., 354 Pa. 109, 46 A. 2d 497; Brooks v. Conston, 356 Pa. 69, 51 A. 2d 684; Andrikanics v. Andrekanics, 371 Pa. 222, 89 A. 2d 792.\nOur examination of the evidence convinces us that the conclusion reached by the court below cannot be supported.\nThe court below found as a fact that at the time when plaintiff Philadelphia Transportation Company leased to Bonanni, it was known that it was leasing space to the Clover Hosiery Shop for the sale of women\u2019s hosiery. Suburban rented the space to the Clover Hosiery Shop on October 6, 1936. This shop was in continuous operation until October 14, 1950, when the lessee discontinued business on account of ill health of the proprietor. In the same terminal building two other stores, Liggett\u2019s Drug Store and Schulte Cigar, Inc., sell hosiery to which no objection is made. There was no hosiery- shop in Suburban\u2019s terminal after the Clover Hosiery Shop discontinued business until space was rented, on April 1, 1953, by Suburban to defendant Gay Hosiery Company which opened for business October 6,1953.\nAs stated before, Philadelphia Transportation Company rented Bonanni space in its terminal on July 14, 1950. At this date the Clover Hosiery Shop, Liggett\u2019s and Schulte\u2019s were in competition with him in Suburban\u2019s adjoining terminal. Clover Hosiery continued for three months from July 14, 1950 to its discontinuance on October 14, 1950. Consequently, Bonanni had no competition whatever from any other hosiery store until Gay Hosiery opened for business on October 6, 1953.\nWith considerable force counsel for appellant notes in his paper book: \u201cThe Chancellor seems to have placed great reliance on the fact that Bonanni\u2019s business in November was worse than it had been in October, decreasing from $1,266 to $1,097. However, the Chancellor completely overlooked the fact that Gay\u2019s business decreased from October to November in about the same amount, percentage-wise, as Bonanni\u2019s ($2,-935 to $2,250). This confirms the fact that Bonanni\u2019s decrease cannot be blamed on competition by Gay, but was due to an adverse business cycle which affected both stores equally.\u201d\nBonanni testified, at the hearing: \u201cA. There has been a general decline in the hosiery business for the last year and a half at least, but my decline has only started the last month.\u201d\nThe real reason for Mr. Bonanni\u2019s complaint is apparent. It is not that Gay Hosiery Company\u2019s competition is undue, but that Mr. Bonanni feels he should have no competition at all. He testified: \u201cQ. Are you in a position to compete with Gay Hosiery? A. I don\u2019t think I am because I have solely one style and Gay Hosiery Stores sell lingerie, they make maybe two dollars profit on it where I make thirty cents, and in order to attract business they can very well sell hosiery at four cents a pair profit or even at cost in order to get someone in to buy an article where they make three dollars on it and I cannot do that as far as price is concerned because my profit is figured on the units I sell in the hosiery line.\u201d\nA consideration of the testimony convinces us that plaintiff\u2019s complaint of undue competition and the conclusion of the learned Chancellor to that effect, are not sufficiently supported. Competition may indeed exist, but under this evidence it cannot be restrained in equity as undue competition.\nThe decree is reversed and the complaint dismissed at the cost of appellee.",
