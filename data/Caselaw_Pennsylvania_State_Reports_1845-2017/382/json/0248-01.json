        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThis action in assumpsit was instituted by Ryan Brothers, Inc., a coal operator, against Curwensville State Bank to recover $18,271.55, representing the price of coal sold by the plaintiff through its exclusive sales agent, Cassler Coal Sales Agency, for which the defendant bank made collection, crediting the proceeds to the account of the Sales Agency without the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge and which account the bank later appropriated for the payment of debts due it by the Sales Agency.\nThe defendant filed preliminary objections to the complaint which were overruled and the defendant answered to the merits. The case came on for trial before the late Honorable Henry Hipple, President Judge of the 25th Judicial District, specially presiding, to whom the case was tried without a jury pursuant to written stipulation of the parties in accordance with the Act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109, 12 PS \u00a7688.\nOn April 17, 1951, Judge Hipple filed an opinion containing extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law and an order nisi directing the prothonotary to enter judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff duly filed exceptions to the findings, conclusions and order, and oral argument thereon was had. Judge Hipple\u2019s untimely death occurred before he had passed on the exceptions. Reargument was thereafter had before Honorable Robert M. Morris, President Judge of the 54th Judicial District, specially presiding. By order dated June 12, 1954, Judge Morris dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions, and judgment for the defendant was entered in due course. This appeal by the plaintiff followed.\nThe question of the defendant\u2019s liability to the plaintiff depends upon whether the bank knew or had reasonable cause to know that certain of the funds which it collected from purchasers of plaintiff\u2019s coal, and credited to an account of the Sales Agency in the bank, were in fact the property of the plaintiff. The unquestioned documentary evidence and the undisputed facts in the case leave no doubt that the bank had or should have had such knowledge. A mere recitation of the material evidence will readily so disclose.\nIn 1943 Eyan Brothers, Inc., and Cassler Coal Sales Agency entered into an exclusive sales agency agreement which provided for the sale and invoicing of Eyan\u2019s coal by Cassler on a fixed commission basis. The agreement provided that all invoices for the plaintiff\u2019s coal, sold by the agent, should be made payable to Curwensville National Bank (later absorbed by the Curwensville State Bank, the present defendant). The bank was to remit directly to the plaintiff as collections Avere received by the bank for the plaintiff\u2019s coal.\nJames Mitchell, Jr., was executive vice president of the National Bank and later became cashier and treasurer of the successor State Bank. Prior to the execution of the agency agreement the plaintiff\u2019s president and a partner of the Sales Agency discussed with Mitchell the procedure to be followed in invoicing and handling the proceeds from the plaintiff\u2019s coal. Thenceforth, Mitchell handled the bank\u2019s part of the arrangement.\nIn practice, from 1943 until the end of 1945 invoices covering sales of plaintiff\u2019s coal Avere prepared in quadruplicate by the Agency\u2019s bookkeeper on Cassler Sales Agency forms. The invoices, numbered and dated, identified each shipment by name of the purchaser, the car number, weight of the coal shipped, price per ton, amount due and the name of the particular mine whence the coal had come. The original and the three copies of each invoice were identical except that the copies each carried a statement showing the amount due the plaintiff for the coal covered by the invoice and the amount due the Cassler Agency for its commission. The original invoice was mailed by the Agency to the purchaser of the coal. One copy of the invoice (containing the information as to the proportions of the proceeds from the coal due the plaintiff and the agent respectively) was delivered to the bank, another copy to the plaintiff producer, and the third copy was retained by the Agency.\nAll customers\u2019 checks in payment for the plaintiff\u2019s coal were made payable to the order of the bank. And, the only remittances to the plaintiff for its coal were made by the bank with its treasurer\u2019s or cashier\u2019s checks drawn to the order of the plaintiff but transmitted to it by the bank through the Cassler Agency. From 1943 to the end of 1945, during which time the above-described procedure was uniformly followed, large sums of money were collected by the bank for the plaintiff\u2019s coal sold through the Cassler Agency, and the plaintiff\u2019s share of the proceeds, as indicated by the invoices, was disbursed to the plaintiff by the bank.\nAfter January 1, 1946, the bank received for collection in the usual manner six checks drawn by purchasers of plaintiff\u2019s coal and made payable to the order of the bank. From the proceeds thereof there was due and payable to the plaintiff the aggregate sum of $18,271.55 according to the invoices which the bank had received from the Cassler Agency either at or prior to receipt of the corresponding checks of the purchasers. All six checks were collected by the bank in due course, but none of the proceeds was ever remitted to the plaintiff.\nThe defendant bank maintained several different accounts relating to the business affairs between it and the Cassler Agency. One was a checking account in the name of \u201cCassler Coal Sales Agency\u201d; two others were \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts differently titled but with the name Cassler Coal Sales Agency appearing as a part of each designation. The \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts were merely for convenience of the bank in recording its collections relating to the business of the Cassler Agency and were not the usual checking accounts maintained by a bank for customers in the ordinary course of business. The \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts differed from a checking account in a number of important particulars. Only purchasers\u2019 checks to the bank\u2019s order for coal sold by the Cassler Agency were credited to the \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts; the slips for deposit of such checks were prepared by Mitchell, the bank\u2019s officer, and not by the Agency; no periodic or other statements of the \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts were ever furnished anyone outside the bank; no pass books were issued and no signature cards required in respect of the \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts; and, only the bank drew on those accounts.\nThe six checks above mentioned, which the bank received in payment of invoices for plaintiff\u2019s coal, were deposited by the bank between January 25 and March 16, 1946, to the credit of one or the other of the Cassler \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts maintained by the bank. At that time the bank was owed by the Cassler Agency for loans to itself and customers a total of $24,600. The bank charged the indebtedness due on these loans to the checking account in the name of \u201cCassler Coal Sales Agency\u201d after first having credited that account with corresponding amounts charged to the \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts. Of the moneys so used to pay the debts of the Cassler Agency, only $4,800 represented accumulated commissions due the Agency. There being nothing left to the credit of the various Cassler bank accounts after the above-described setoffs, the bank refused tbe plaintiff\u2019s demand for payment of tbe balance due it which the defendant had collected. This suit followed.\nThe 11th finding of fact of the learned trial judge aptly describes the material aspects of the controversy as follows, \u2014 \u201cIn January and February, 1946, Gassier Agency received six checks from Greenpoint Coal Docks, Inc., of Brooklyn, N. Y. and Winslow-Knickerbocker Coal Company of Philadelphia, Pa., both purchasers of coal from Cassler Agency, covering for the most part, payment for shipments of Ryan Bros. coal. Cassler presented these checks to Mitchell at the Curwensville State Bank, where Mitchell, for the amount of three of the checks and at the direction of Cassler, immediately either credited Cassler Agency checking account, or made out bank checks to coal producers, but not Plaintiff, or paid off Cassler Agency notes held by the Bank. The amounts of the other three checks he credited to the special Cassler Agency account. During this period and until March, 1946, Cassler Agency at various times instructed Mitchell to distribute the amounts in the special Cassler Agency account for the purpose of paying producers, but not Plaintiff, paying-off notes held by the Bank covering loans to Cassler Agency, and crediting Cassler Agency checking account. On March 25, 1946, the special Cassler Agency account had little or no balance, and Plaintiff had not been paid by Cassler Agency for the value of coal previously sold by Plaintiff amounting to $18,271.55.\u201d\nThe error of the court below did not lie in its findings of fact but in its conclusions of law. It failed to apply the pertinent rule to the facts as found. In Sherts v. Fulton National Bank of Lancaster, 342 Pa. 337, 339, 21 A. 2d 18, Mr. Justice Stern recognized for the court that \u201cAll the authorities agree that if a bank has knowledge, or notice of facts enough to put it upon inquiry, that the funds in a depositor\u2019s account actually belong to a third person, it may not apply such funds to a debt owed to it by the depositor individually.\u201d As in that case, this principle was sufficient in itself to require that the court below enter judgment against the bank and in favor of the plaintiff.\nIn the earlier case of Franklin Trust Company of Philadelphia, 319 Pa. 367, 179 A. 592, it was held that a bank may not set off against a debt due it by a depositor, individually, deposits in accounts in the name of the depositor with special designations added where the funds represented by such deposits are in fact the property of third persons. , It was there directly held that this is so even though the bank has no knowledge, beyond the special designations of the accounts, of any facts indicating the nature of the depositor\u2019s business or the nature of the funds contained in the accounts. In the Sherts case, supra, it was specifically remarked that in the Franklin Trust Company case we had ranged ourselves definitely with those jurisdictions which have adopted the so-called \u201cequitable rule\u201d there followed. See, also, Witherow v. Weaver, 337 Pa. 488, 491, 12 A. 2d 92.\nThe instant case is even a stronger one for the plaintiff than the cases above cited. Under their ruling, the special designation of the Cassler \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts would of itself have been sufficient to bind the bank with notice that the funds therein contained were presumptively the property of third persons and, therefore, not subject to' setoff by the bank for a debt due it by the depositor individually. But, here, the bank had actual notice that there was |18,000 odd belonging to the plaintiff that was in the Cassler \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts when the bank charged those accounts (practically to exhaustion) in order to credit Cassler\u2019s individual checking account with corresponding sums. Mitchell\u2019s knowledge was the knowledge of the bank for which he was authorized to act in respeet of the various Cassler accounts. It was he who set up the method for the collection and distribution of the proceeds of the Cassler Agency\u2019s sales of coal for various producers including the plaintiff. Mitchell knew at all times from the information contained on the paid invoices exactly how much money due the plaintiff was in the Cassler \u201cDistribution\u201d accounts. To suggest that, when acting for the bank in the premises, Mitchell did not know that he was using money belonging to the plaintiff to pay the Cassler Agency\u2019s debt to the bank would be to ascribe to him less than ordinary intelligence. Nor is it of any significance that Mitchell took directions from Cassler as to the distribution of the proceeds of the six checks received in payment of the plaintiff\u2019s coal: see Witherow v. Weaver, supra, at p. 492.\nThe judgment is reversed and the record remanded with directions that judgment be entered for the plaintiff for the full amount of its claim with interest from the various due dates as shown by the complaint.",
