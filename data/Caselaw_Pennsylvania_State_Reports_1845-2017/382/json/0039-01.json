        "text": "Opinion bx\nMr. Justice Bell,\nThe Court below granted a new trial on the ground that the verdict rendered for the defendant was against the evidence and against the weight of the evidence, and in the interest of justice. This appeal followed.\nThe pertinent law is thus stated in Decker v. Kulesza, 369 Pa. 259, 263, 85 A. 2d 413: \u201cWhile an award of a new trial is an inherent power of the court and its exercise a matter of discretion, the discretion is not an absolute one and it is the duty of this Court to review and determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion: Jones v. Williams, 358 Pa. 559, 58 A. 2d 57; Martin v. Arnold, 366 Pa. 128, 77 A. 2d 99; Stewart v. Ray, 366 Pa. 134, 76 A. 2d 628.\u201d\nExpressed in another way, we will not reverse where the lower Court has granted a new trial for the reasons above set forth \u201c. .. unless there is a clear abuse of discretion or an error of law which necessarily controlled the grant of the new trial or the outcome of the case\u201d: Edelson v. Ochroch, 380 Pa. 426, 429, 111 A. 2d 455.\nPlaintiff brought an action in trespass for assault and battery. The testimony was very brief. Plaintiff, 19 years of age, was employed on April 1, 1952 as a section manager in the subway store of Lit Brothers, which was operated by defendant. One of plaintiffs duties was to handle refunds by issuing credit slips to customers who had returned merchandise. Plaintiff was required to sign his name on the slips before issuing them. Two of these slips, in a handwriting which plaintiff admitted \u201cwas practically the same\u201d as his, had been fraudulently issued, returned, and the cash received therefor. Defendant was making an investigation to ascertain who was responsible for the fraud. Plaintiff, at defendant\u2019s request, went to the office of the chief detective, a Mr. Smith, where he was shown two credit slips \u201cbearing a facsimile of his signature.\u201d He was accused of having issued them for unreturned merchandise. He was then told if he didn\u2019t confess to writing out the refund slips that Smith would call the police. Plaintiff denied the accusation. \u201c. . . I was told to stand up, and then lie came over and he patted all my pockets and things to see if the credit book was there, and then he asked me to give him my wallet . . . and said there was a . credit book missing, that you have to find the credit book.\u201d Plaintiff showed him his wallet which contained nothing incriminating. Plaintiff also agreed to have his apartment searched and nothing incriminating was found there. Smith then said he would come down and apologize to plaintiff if he was not guilty. Smith told plaintiff not to discuss the matter with anybody.\nDefendant offered no testimony and the jury returned a verdict for defendants.\nIf plaintiff\u2019s evidence was believed, defendant was technically guilty of assault and battery. However, even if it was believed, and the jury did not have to believe it, the \u201cpatting\u201d of his pockets was such a trifling battery that the jury realistically gave a verdict to defendant instead of awarding plaintiff damages. That did not justify the grant of a new trial.\nThe Court, in granting a new trial, was impressed by the tactics of counsel for defendant who, while addressing the jury, walked over to counsel for plaintiff, a younger member of the bar, and demonstrated a \u201cpatting\u201d. \u201cThe obvious purpose [said the court below] was to create in the minds of the jury the idea or attitude that a searching or \u2018frisking\u2019 as might have occurred to plaintiff was in no way offensive. '. . .\u201d No complaint was made of counsel\u2019s actions by opposing counsel or by the Court at the time they occurred, nor did the Court mention the alleged improper action in his charge to the jury. We need not decide whether the conduct of defendant\u2019s counsel was ethical and fair, certainly in our opinion it was not so unfair or prejudicial as to justify the granting of a new trial.\nWe are of the opinion that, under the evidence in this case, it was a clear abuse of discretion to grant a new trial.\nOrder reversed.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMu. Justice Musmanno:\nI would affirm the lower Court\u2019s granting of a new trial. Mr. Smith, Chief of Detectives for the defendant City Stores Company, did not deny that he threatened the youth Jon Millenson with police action unless he confessed to a crime he did not commit. Smith did not deny that behind the armor of this threat he accused the plaintiff of having taken a \u201ccredit book\u201d and having fraudulently issued credit slips to a female confederate. He did not deny that he felt the plaintiff\u2019s person to look for the missing credit book, nor did he deny that finding in the plaintiff\u2019s wallet pictures of the plaintiff\u2019s mother and girl friend he insultingly asked how they were connected with the crime.\nAll of this insolent conduct on the part of the store detectives was an attack on the plaintiff\u2019s good name which cannot be taken lightly:\n\u201cHe that filches from me my good name\nRobs me of that which not enriches him,\nAnd makes me poor indeed.\u201d\nAlthough Mr. Smith stated that if it was proved that Millenson was innocent he, Smith, would apologize, there is no evidence that he did so apologize, although Millenson\u2019s innocence was conclusively established. Perhaps the plaintiff is unduly sensitive, but it is part of a man\u2019s rights to be sensitive about an unjustified humiliating experience. The plaintiff could have belonged to that class of people who, in the words of Edmund Burke, possessed \u201cthat chastity of honor which felt a stain like a wound.\u201d\nThe Court below concluded that that stain of dishonor which the unjust accusation inflicted had not been washed clean and, accordingly, in the interests of justice ordered a new trial.\nI would affirm that order.",
