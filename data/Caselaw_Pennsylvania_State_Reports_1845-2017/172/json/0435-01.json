The testimony tending to prove defendant company\u2019s negligence was abundantly sufficient to require its submission to the jury; and that relating to plaintiff\u2019s alleged contributory negligence was not of such a character as to justify the court in withdrawing the case from the jury.\nThe charge as a whole was quite as favorable to the company as it could reasonably ask. The rights and duties of both parties were carefully explained in well guarded language. This was not the case of a traveler voluntarily assuming the risk of known danger. The modification of that doctrine sought by defendant\u2019s fifth request for instructions, cannot be regarded as proper. Discussion of the questions involved would serve no useful purpose.\u2019 The case was well tried and defendant has no just cause of complaint.\nJudgment affirmed.",

The repair was completed on the same day, but the excavation was not filled up.. The excavation was guarded by barrels, and planks placed on the top of the barrels, and extending to a dirt pile. On the evening of the second day after the excavation had been made, plaintiff in running to a fire struck one of the planks, which gave way, and plaintiff was precipitated into the excavation, suffering serious personal injuries. The nearest light to the excavation was a street lamp about sixty-one yards distant. The pavement opposite the excavation was being repaired, and was in bad condition, and this was known to plaintiff. Held, that the question o\u00ed defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was for the jury.\nArgued Oct. 22, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 169, Oct. T., 1895, by defendant, from judgment of O. P. Washington County, May Term, 1894, No. 198, on verdict for plaintiff.'\nBefore Sterbett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before McIlvaine, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on the evening of Monday, July 3, 1893, plaintiff fell into an excavation near the center of Chess street in Monongahela City, suffering serious injuries. The excavation was made on Saturday, July 1, by the defendant for the purpose of repairing a leak in the water pipe. The repair-had been completed in the afternoon of Saturday, but the excavation had not been filled up. The hole was about four feet in length, parallel with the curb line, about two and one half feet in width, and from three to three and one half feet in depth. The material removed from the hole was piled at one end of it. Two empty lime barrels were placed, one at each corner farthest removed from the dirt pile. A piece of plank was laid across the end of the opening from one end of the barrel to the other,, and planks were laid, one on each side of the excavation, extending from the barrels to the dirt pile. On the evening of July 3,. about nine o\u2019clock, plaintiff with two companions while walking on Mead street heard an alarm of fire. Plaintiff and his companions ran down Mead street to Chess street, and turning into Chess street ran up that street, keeping in the cartway; they ran against the barrier surrounding the excavation, the plank gave way and all three were precipitated into the hole. The nearest light to the excavation was about sixty-one yards distant. The pavement opposite the excavation was being repaired and was in bad condition, and this was known to plaintiff. Defendant\u2019s points were as follows :\n5. The plaintiff, having a choice of two ways, to wit, the sidewalk upon the south side of Chess street, which he knew by actual travel over within an hour before the accident to be safe,. and the roadway, which was subject to risks and dangers, and of which he knew nothing, and having voluntarily-chosen the roadway, was thereby guilty of contributory negligence, and cannot recover. Answer: Refused. [1]\n8. Under all the evidence in this case the plaintiff cannot recover, and the verdict must be for the defendant. Answer: Refused. [2]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for \u00a71,000. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1, 2) above instructions, quoting them.\nT. H. Baird, A. M. Todd and James A.
