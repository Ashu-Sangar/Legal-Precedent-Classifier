Goslee, Defendant, and George Weddell, Executor of Elijah McGrew, Deceased, Garnishee, Appellant.\nTrusts and trustees \u2014 Spendthrift trust \u2014 Will\u2014Attachment execution.\nTestator gave the west end of his farm to A. and her four children, S. being the oldest. He further provided as follows: \u201cI direct my executor to make sale of the coal of the west end, when the said S. arrives at the age of twenty-one years; and the proceeds to be under the control of my executor, and to go to the use of the said A. and her four named children, when necessity requires, share and share alike.\u201d Held, that the will did not create a spendthrift trust in favor of the children.\nArgued Oct. 9, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 133, Oct. T., 1895, bygaruishee, from judgment of C. P. Westmoreland Co., Aug. T., 1893, No. 877, in favor of plaintiff, on attachment execution.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated on attachment execution.\nFrom the case stated it appeared that in August term, 1893,' plaintiff recovered a judgment against Sumner F. Goslee, and issued an attachment execution thereon with notice to George Weddell, executor of Elijah McGrew, deceased. The garnishee admitted that he had in his hands \u00a7600 to be applied to the use of the defendant under the will of Elijah McGrew. The material portions of the will are as follows:\n\u201c2nd. I give and bequeath to Amanda Goslee, Samuel M. Goslee, Robert A. Goslee, Sumner Goslee and Catharine Gos-lee, children of the said Amanda, the west end of my farm, the centre of the railroad to be the dividing line between the west and east ends of said farm.\n\u201cAlso, I give to the said Amanda Goslee, two horses, two sets of horse gears, one wagon, one plough and harrow, and I direct my ex\u00e9cutor to make sale of the coal of the west end, when the said Samuel M. Goslee arrives at the age of twenty-one years; and the proceeds to be under the control of my executor, and to go to the use of the said Amanda and her four named children, when necessity requires, share and share alike.\u201d\nUnder this clause, the garnishee contended that a spendthrift trust was created, and that the share of Sumner F. Goslee was not attachable in his hands for debts contracted by the said Sumner, without the consent of the said executor who was made a trustee under the terms of the said will.\nThe court, in an opinion by Doty, P. J., entered judgment for plaintiff.\nError assigned was entry of judgment as above.\nSilas McCormick and Edward B. McCormick, for appellant.\nSpendthrift trusts when reasonable and clearly defined will be upheld in equity, on the ground of the testator\u2019s right of dominion over his own property, for a reasonable time: Brubaker v. Huber, 2 Dist. 703 ; Girard Life & Trust Co. v. Chambers, 46 Pa. 486; Keyser v. Mitchell, 67 Pa. 473; Phila. Trust Co. v. Guillou, 100 Pa. 254; Overman\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 276; Smith v. Savidge, 4 Penny. 320; Hill on Trustees, 494.\nAn attaching creditor stands in the shoes of his debtor, and any equities that could be set up against the latter are equally available against the former: Millinger v. Hartupee, 53 Pa. 366.\nVin. E. Williams, for appellee, filed no paper-book, but made oral argument before the court.\nJanuary 6, 1896:"
