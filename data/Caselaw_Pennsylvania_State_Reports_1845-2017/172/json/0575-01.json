        "text": "Per Curiam,\nIn view of the circumstances, the action of the court, in refusing plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to amend their bill, was free from error. The delay of several years in making the application was very great, and, moreover, it was not made until after the testimony on both sides was taken. It would be contrary to every recognized precedent to allow an amendment in such a case: Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. sec. 887: 1 Dan. Ch. Pl. & Pr. 417; 1 Beach\u2019s Eq. Pr. sec. 159; 6 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 807.\nFor like reasons, the refusal of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike from the record the masters\u2019 report and the testimony was entirely proper. The delay was at plaintiffs\u2019 request and the taking of testimony was \u201c pursuant to agreement.\u201d As stated by the court below: \u201c to now let them take advantage of their own delay would be intolerable, and if necessary an order will now be made nunc pro tune extending the time so as to bring the case within the rule of court.\u201d It is unnecessary to express any opinion as to the validity of the rule thus referred to.\nWe find nothing in any of the other specifications of error that would justify a reversal or modification of the decree; nor do we think that either of them involves any question that requires discussion. They are all dismissed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the plaintiffs.",

T., 1895,- by plaintiffs, from decree of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny County, Dec. T., 1890, No. 124, on bill in equity.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity to declare void an assignment of a secret recipe for the manufacture of Dr. J. Hostetter\u2019s Stomach Bitters alleged to have been made by Jacob Hostetter to David Hostetfcer on February 17, 1858.\nThe bill alleged that at the time the assignment was made Dr. Jacob Hostetter was an imbecile.\nThe bill was filed on September 23, 1890. Defendants filed their answer on November 25, 1890, and on April 11, 1891,. W. K. Jennings, Esq., was appointed examiner and master. Nothing further was done until June 3,1891, when the parties met and \u201cpursuant to agreement\u201d proceeded to take testimony.\nAfter the testimony was taken, the plaintiffs on May 26, 1893, filed a petition for permission to amend their bill.\nOn September 18, 1893, the court made an order refusing to permit the amendment. On May 23,1894, the master\u2019s report was filed. On May 26, 1894, plaintiffs made the following-motion :\n\u201c And now, to wit, 26th of May, 1894, the plaintiffs by their attorney, Levi Bird Duff, move the court to strike from the record the report and testimony filed on the 23d day of May,. 1894, by W. K. Jennings, Esq., under the order of reference-of April 11, 1891, for the following reasons:\n\u201c 1. The parties having-failed to present to W. K. Jennings,. Esq., for hearing the matter referred for twenty days after said reference and the said W. K. Jennings, Esq., having failed to-proceed under said reference for twenty days after the making thereof, the order of April 11,1891, appointing said W. K. Jennings, Esq., master became and was null and void, and the same was vacated without further order, under Bule 17, court of common pleas, No. 1, and the said W. K. Jennings, Esq.,, had no authority to proceed and did not proceed under said order, and had no authority to, and cannot return the testimony,, and report the facts and form of decree under said order.\n\u201c 2. There was no agreement made, nor does any agreement or stipulation appear by the record, or in the report prepared by him, whereby said W. K. Jennings, Esq., was authorized to report the facts to the court, together with the form of decree.\n\u201c 3. There was no agreement made, nor does any agreement or stipulation appear by the record, or in the report prepared by him, whereby said W. K. Jennings, Esq., was authorized to return to court the testimony taken before him.\n\u201c4. The said W. If. Jennings, Esq., not having made report on the matter referred, within six months after the commencement of the proceedings before him, nor within sixty days thereafter, with the written consent of the parties in interest, and the time for hearing and making report not having been extended by the court, the said W. If. Jennings, Esq., was not authorized under said order of reference to return to court the testimony taken before him, nor to report the facts and form of decree.\u201d\nRule of court XVII. is in part as follows :\n\u201cWhenever reference of any matter shall be made to a master to examine and report thereon, if the parties shall fail to present to him for hearing the matter referred for twenty days after such reference, the order appointing the master shall become and be null and void and the same be taken as vacated without further order.\n\u201c The master after such reference is brought before him shall proceed without delay to hear the matter referred and make report thereon to court within six months; the master, however, having the right with the written consent of the parties in interest or their attorney to extend the time for a further term of sixty days. The time for hearing and making report will not be extended by the court except upon petition filed setting out proper cause therefor. The master shall keep and return regular minutes of his proceedings showing the different sessions and the length of time actually consumed and the names of witnesses examined at each meeting and the cause of the delay, if any, so that the court must adjust the amount for the costs and expenses, and direct how the same be paid.\u201d\nThe court made an order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike off the master\u2019s report and testimony.\nThe Court said: It is very apparent that under the rule referred to in these exceptions the appointment of the master was void after six months unless the party now complaining shall be held to have waived the right to complain of the noncompliance with the rule.\nBut it would be contrary to all our practice to hold that after the parties had gone on for nearly three years, to wit, from June 23,1891, the time of first hearing before the master, until April 27, 1894, the time exceptions were filed to his report, without complaint or exception, to now strike the report, etc., off from the record. The party now complaining did not finish his testimony till long after the six months had expired, and to now let him take advantage of his own delay would be intolerable, and if it is necessary an order will now be made nunc pro tunc extending the time so as to bring the case within the rule of court.\nOrder to strike off refused.\nOn October 23, 1894, the court entered a decree dismissing the bill.\nErrors assigned were, (1) order refusing to permit amendment; (2) refusing to strike from record the report and testimony ; (5) decree dismissing bill.\nLevi Bird Duff and F. E. Andrews, J. D. Andrews and O. F. Woodruff with them, for appellants.\n\u2014 The amendment should have been allowed: 2 Roberts\u2019 Digest of British Statutes, 27 ; Iredell v. Klemm, 17 W. N.
