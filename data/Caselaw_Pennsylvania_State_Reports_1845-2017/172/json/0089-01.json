Stevenson, deceased, and permitting his personal representatives to make defense to the judgment.\u201d An examination of the testimony that was introduced in support of the petition to open the judgment etc. has satisfied us that it was quite sufficient to justify the action complained of. Discussion of the testimony, as the case now stands, is neither necessary nor desirable. It is enough to say that it is quite sufficient to justify the court in opening the judgment and sending the case to a jury.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellants.",

T., 1895, by plaintiffs, from order of C. P. Beaver Co., Dec. T., 1890, No. 19, making absolute a rule to open judgment.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nRule to open judgment. Before Wickham, P. J.\nFrom the record and the evidence it appeared that judgment was entered in June 1867, on a judgment note bearing the names of John H. Bigger and P. H. Stevenson, in the sum of $1,657.81. The judgment was regularly revived from time to time, the last revival being on June 3, 1892, for $5,073.17. P. H. Stevenson died on November 28, 1893. The evidence showed that he had never been a resident of Beaver county, but that he had lived all his life in Allegheny county, where lie owned valuable real estate, and that he had always been possessed of means amply sufficient to pay the judgment. Twenty-five witnesses were examined as to the genuineness of the signature. Twenty testified that in their opinion the signature of Stevenson appended to the note was not genuine. Five testified that in their opinion it was in the handwriting of P. H. Stevenson.\nThe court made absolute the rule to open the judgment.\nError assigned was above order.\nJ. E. Reed, for appellants.\nEdward D. Dougherty, John M. Buchanan and Wm. A. McConnel, for appellees.\nNovember 4, 1895:"
