        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThe error assigned is to the admission in evidence of the record of the mechanic\u2019s lien. The objection urged was based on the insufficiency of the lien as appearing on its face. The plea to the sci. fa. was non assumpsit, set-off, payment with leave, etc.\nIn Lybrant v. Eberly, 36 Pa. 347, it was held, following Lewis v. Morgan, 11 S. & R. 234, that the formal validity of a mechanic\u2019s lien is not put in issue by the plea of payment, and that no issue for the jury could be raised on the formal deficiencies of the claim, as they were questions of law and should be raised by demurrer or by motion to strike off the claim. Following this case it was decided in Howell v. City of Philadelphia, 38 Pa. 471, that pleading to the sci. fa. must be considered a waiver of defects as to dates in the lien. In Lee v. Burke, 66 Pa. 336, the plea was no lien, payment and set-off with leave, and it was said by Sharswood, J.: \u201c It was the issues of fact raised by these pleas that the jury were called and empaneled to try. No question of the sufficiency of the claim upon its face could arise at the trial. That would be an issue of law. There might arise a question of variance between the evidence as offered and the claim as filed and recited in the scire facias, but not whether that claim was regular and sufficient.\u201d And he adds that the short plea of no lien was not a demurrer general or special, and raised no question as to defects on the face of the claim filed. There is no conflict between these cases and St. Clair Coal Co. v. Martz, 75 Pa. 384, where it was held that, as the act of assembly gave the plaintiff no such lien as was filed, the fatal error in the claim was not waived as a merely formal defect by going to trial on the issue of payment; and Fahnestock v. Speer, 92 Pa. 146, where the special plea concluded to the court, and was held to be in effect a demurrer.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

Baum, Appellant.\nMechanic's lien \u2014 Pleading\u2014Defects in claim \u2014 Question for jury.\nWhere the pleas to a scire facias sur mechanic\u2019s lien are non assumpsit, set-off, payment with leave etc., no issue can be raised for the jury on the formal deficiencies of the claim, as such deficiencies are questions of law, and should be raised by demurrer or by motion to strike off the claim.\nPleading to a scire facias operates as a waiver of defects as to dates in the lien.\nArgued Oct. 30, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 137, Oct. T., 1895, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co., March T., 1894, No. 165, on verdict for plaintiffs.\nBefore Stekrett, C. J., Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nScire facias sur mechanic\u2019s lien. Pleas were non assumpsit, set-off, payment with leave, etc. Before Stowe, P. J.\nAt the trial counsel for plaintiff offered in evidence the record of mechanic\u2019s lien filed at No. 15, March term, 1898.\nObjected to as incompetent for the following reasons:\nFirst. The lien on its face shows it was filed December 31, 1892; there is no date or item given at the time of the completion of the contract, as appears upon the face of the lien. The last credit- as given upon the face of the lien is payment of money on the 31st of July, $100. The face of the lien shows a payment in excess of the contract price.\nSecond. On the bill of extras attached to the lien for which this lien is filed, it is for the extras alone; there is not a solitary date or time given from the beginning of the bill to the close at what time any of the work was done or any of the material furnished, in all about eighteen or twenty items of extra work, contrary to the requirements of law which require a specific statement of the dates and times when the work was done, particularly with reference to a bill of extras.\nBy the Court: The objections are overruled and bill sealed for defendant.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiffs for $950. Defendant appealed.\n-Error assigned was ruling on evidence as above, quoting the bill of exceptions.\nJ. J. Miller, for appellant.\n\u2014 The plea was in effect a demurrer: Fahnestock v. Speer, 92 Pa. 148; act of May 25, 1887.\nNowhere in the testimony is a date given which fixes even approximately a time when any of the extra work was done, or the material therefor was furnished: Philadelphia v. Trout, 28 Pa. 153.\nThe allegation in the body of a lien, that it was filed for work done and material furnished within six months past, is not in compliance with the requirements of the act of assembly: Lehman v. Thomas, 5 W. & S. 262; Witman v. Walker, 9 W. & S. 193 ; McClintock v. Rush, 63 Pa. 203; Church v. Trout, 28 Pa. 153; Knabbs\u2019 App., 10 Pa. 186; Rush v. Able, 90 Pa. 153.\nL. K. Porter, S. G. Porter with him, for appellees.\n\u2014 In the ease at bar, the pleas being to the scire facias raised only questions of fact, and under such pleas no question as to the deficiency of the claim upon its face could arise : Lee v. Burke, 66 Pa. 336 ; Fahnestock v. Speer, 92 Pa. 148 ; Lybrandt v. Eberly, 36 Pa. 347; Howell v. Philadelphia, 38 Pa. 471.\nJanuary 6, 1896:"
