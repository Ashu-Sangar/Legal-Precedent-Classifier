        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice McCollum,\nIt seems to us that in the formation of the National Electric Company, Limited, there was a sufficient compliance with the act of June 2,1874, and its supplements. The capital of the company was $8,500 and divided into shares of $25.00 each. Two thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight dollars and forty cents of it was contributed in cash and the balance in personal property. The alleged defect in the formation of the company was in the schedule of the personalty. The plaintiff claimed that the schedule was not sufficiently specific to satisfy the requirements of the supplementary act of May 1, 1876. It was attached to and made part of the statement required by the act of 1874 and was so recorded. It consisted of a hundred and fifty-one items, the integrity and valuation of which were not questioned, and they afforded, we think, a sufficient identification and description of the property contributed.\nThe plaintiff cites and relies on Maloney v. Bruce, 94 Pa. 249; Van Horn v. Corcoran, 127 Pa. 255, and Gearing v. Carroll, 151 Pa. 79, as supporting his contention that the schedule was defective. But a reference to the schedules condemned in the cases cited shows that the condemnation of them does not necessarily or reasonably operate as a condemnation of the schedule in this ease. In no case in which the schedule was held insufficient to answer the purpose of the statute was there a specification of the property so complete, descriptive, and clear as in this.\nIn Laflin & Rand Co. v. Steytler, 146 Pa. 434, our brother Mitchell, in discussing the statutory requirement as to schedule said, \u201c It is not intended, however, nor would it be practicable, in many cases where an existing business is the basis of the new firm, to require minute specification of details that may change from day to day. Certainty to a fair business intent is the safe, practical criterion.\u201d This view appears to be reasonable and applicable to some of the items, at least, in the schedule complained of in this case as insufficient. In Cook v. Bailey, 146 Pa. 328, Chief Justice Paxson, speakiirg for this court on the same subject said : \u201c It was never intended that these acts should be used as a trap to catch persons who have honestly complied with their substantial requisites, and impale them upon a meaningless technicality.\u201d That the defendants in forming the National Electric Company, Limited, honestly sought to comply with the statutes, and that their schedule of the items and value of the property contributed was elaborate and truthful is not denied, and that this schedule was sufficient to enable parties dealing with the company to readily ascertain the kind, amount and value of the property contributed to its capital we have no doubt. The names of the persons contributing the property and the amount contributed by each appear in the statement, and this in connection with the specification is a sufficient compliance with the provision of the statute in relation thereto.\nWe think the learned court below erred in refusing the defendants\u2019 third point.\nJudgment reversed.",

The plaintiff brings suit against them as partners, although they are doing business under the name of the National Electric Company, Limited, and claim to be a limited partnership under the acts of assembly which relieve partners from liability other than upon their stock. The plaintiff claims those articles of association were hot sufficient to constitute a limited partnership under the act of assembly, and that therefore they are liable as general partners.\nThe opinion of the court is that the articles of association are not a sufficient compliance with the law, and that therefore the defendants became general partners and are liable as general partners for this indebtedness.\nYour verdict should therefore be against them for the amount admitted to be due.\nVerdict for plaintiff for $766.85. Defendants appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was (3) opinion of the court, quoting it.\nC. S. Fetterman, S. A. and Charles M. Johnston with him, for appellants.\n\u2014 Should any question be raised as to the sufficiency of the signatures of the members of said copartnership, we beg leave to refer to Lafflin & Rand Company v. Steytler, 146 Pa. 434, wherein it is said in regard to the signatures of the members that it \u201c Is to provide for certainty of identification, and the requirement has nothing further in view.\u201d\nA substantial compliance with the provisions of the act is all that is required, and in this case we contend that there has been a full compliance with the law.\nIn Maloney v. Bruce, 94 Pa. 249, there was a mere lumping of the property contributed, without any intimation or indication as to the quantity, quality or value thereof, except a lump value of so much.\nIn Sheble et al. v. Strong, 128 Pa. 315, there was no schedule giving description and valuation of property but merely lump sums.\nIn Van Horn et al. v. Corcoran, 127 Pa. 255, the statement filed was more vague and indefinite than in Maloney v. Bruce.\nAs to the requisities of the statement, we beg leave to refer to Lafflin & Rand Co. v. Steytler, 146 Pa. 434; Rehfuss v. Moore, 134 Pa. 462; Cook v. Bailey, 146 Pa. 328.\nF. P. Iams, C. C. Brock with him, for appellee.\n\u2014 There is nothing on record whatever or in the statement showing that the anonymous schedule was ever signed, acknowledged or recognized in any manner whatever by the subscriber to the partnership association statement.\nThe anonymous schedule in question contains numerous lumping and indefinite items of property which would render the statement in question wholly void if it had been inserted in the statement and connected with the names of the parties attempting to contribute property to the capital stock of the partnership association : Gearing v. Carroll, 151 Pa. 79; Van Horn v. Corcoran, 127 Pa. 255; Maloney v. Bruce, 94 Pa. 249.\nJanuary 6, 1896:"
