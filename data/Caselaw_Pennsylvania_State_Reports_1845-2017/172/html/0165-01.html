The testimony showed that the roadbed through the woodland had not been permanent, but changed as the land was cleared, keeping, however, all the time in the woods. Henry Hoke, one of the defendants, the other being his son, was the owner of a small tract adjoining this woodland, and of which he went into possession in 1861; his ingress and egress were over this road, through the woodland and lane, and such had been the ease as to the other occu<a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>pants who preceded him; the whole period of the use of the road covering about seventy-five years, that is, of a road running in that general direction, but the evidence seemed to show the roadbed had changed to conform to the clearing of the land. There was also some evidence on part of plaintiff, that in 1882 there had been an agreement between Bleistein, plaintiff’s predecessor in title to part of the land, and defendant, by which the latter was granted voluntarily by Bleistein the right to use a lane running through the land; defendant to pay twenty-five cents a year for such use, keep the lane free from briers, and maintain gates.

It must be substantially the same road.” We see no error in this instruction under the cases cited. The wagon track on all roads, to some extent, changes by time ; in public roads, the thirty-three feet generally appropriated is within the public right of use ; the track, by reason of washing or other causes, by consent of the traveling public who use it, changes a few feet, sometimes to one side of the thirty-three feet and sometimes to the other, but the road remains substantially the same.

Such is the record as brought up to us; the written point and affirmation. <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>True, the reporter’s notes and the statement of the court on the motion for a new trial, indicate that the point was not read to the jury; nor was the instruction embodied in it given to the jury in the general charge, but we must take the record as if made up under the act of assembly. The act of March 24, 1877, directs that when counsel shall request the court in writing to charge upon any particular point of law, the judge shall reduce the answer to the point to writing, which said point and answer thereto shall be immediately filed and become part of the record for purposes of error, and shall be considered part of the record for assignment of error. This record was made up in exact accord with this legislative mandate, and we must treat it as the record.</p>
    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[159,1040,1172,650]]]'>To affirm the point, as we have already stated, was error. It in effect nullifies the act of 1850. Every road through woodland necessarily runs into roads or ways on improved land; it extends from a habitation or improvement of the user, to the common highway, village or town. To hold, that because it runs for any distance through improved land, therefore it draws with it the right through uninclosed woodland, leaves the act of 1850 nothing, in the vast majority of cases, to operate on. The act is so plain, that it admits of but one meaning, viz : that a right by prescription to a road through uninclosed woodland cannot be obtained. The answer to this point is the single error apparent upon this record, and for that the judgment must be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b193-6" data-blocks='[["BL_193.5",193,[204,1709,813,42]]]'>Judgment reversed, and v. f. d. n. awarded.</p>
