He was simply as his name in the return indicates the physi<a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>cían or surgeon of the company, whose sole duty it was to examine members of the association who had been injured, when notified so to do, and make report of such examination to the company at its office in Utica, New York.

Plaintiffs’ counsel, however, contends that the return here shows a service in conformity with the statutory direction and cannot be set aside on motion; that evidence is inadmissible to contradict the sheriff’s return; that if defendant is injured thereby his remedy is by action against the sheriff, and that if the defendant company is not suable in this court, the question can only be raised by a plea to its jurisdiction. In support of his position, and as controlling this case, he cites the Ben wood Iron Works v. Hutchinson &amp; Bro., <a href="/pa/101/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="101 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="500893" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0359-01">101 Pa. 359</a>. An examination of that case shows material differences between it and the present one. There was a service upon a proper officer of the company — and no appearance having been entered for the defendant, judgment by default was entered against it for want of appearance and affidavit of defense. The position of the plaintiffs in error was, that it was a foreign corporation, and that the court had no jurisdiction over it by reason of the fact that its officer upon whom service was made was found within the county where suit was brought. No testimony was taken and there was nothing to show that the contract or matter on which the action was founded was not suable in this court, and hence the Supreme Court said that a plea to the jurisdiction was the proper remedy in that case. In this case the service was upon one who was not an officer of the .company or in any sense its agent. The testimony clearly shows this, and it also tends to show that the matter on which the action was founded was not suable in this court, the business not being transacted in this state. The question raised 'here seems to be conclusively decided by the case of Hagerman et al. v. Empire Slate Company, <a href="/pa/97/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="97 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="444799" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0534-01">97 Pa. 534</a>, wherein it was held that a return of service under the act of <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>assembly of March 21, 1849, which omits to set forth the character of the agent served, is only prima facie evidence of a good service, and may be rebutted by proof to the contrary. The return of service in that case was in almost precisely the same words as in this, on motion of the defendants’ attorney a rule was granted to show cause why the return should not be set aside. Depositions were taken under this rule which showed conclusively that the person, upon whom service was made, was the agent for defendant company — and for this reason the service was sustained. It will be noted also that the subject-matter of the suit was actionable in this state, it being a scire facias sur mortgage upon property therein situated. That case establishes the principle, that a return of service which, as in the present case, does not set forth the character of the agent served, is presumably good, but may be inquired into, and that depositions may be taken on a motion to set aside the same, and if the presumption of a good service is conclusively rebutted it will be set aside. That principle covers the whole question involved in this case. We see no reason for declining to follow the direction given us in Hagerman v. Empire Slate Company, <a href="/pa/97/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="97 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="444799" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0534-01">supra,</a> in order to entertain this suit, and following that direction this rule must be made absolute and the service and return thereof in this case set aside.
