Defendant claimed that plaintiff had been guilty of fraudulent misrespresentations as to the value of the real estate, and that by these misrepresentations he was induced to make the contract. The evidence was conflicting as to whether the defendant had actually delivered possession of the stock of goods to plaintiff. Both the question of fraud and the question of delivery of possession were submitted to the jury in an adequate charge, and a verdict was rendered for plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that defendant could not have been injured by refusal of a point to the effect that a party has a legal right to refuse performance of a contract which he thinks was induced by fraud.</p>

The other was whether the goods were actually delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff, pursuant to the agreement? Both of these questions were submitted to the jury on sufficient evidence in a fair and adequate charge of which defendant has no just reason to complain. The verdict is necessarily predicated of their finding that there was no fraud, and also that the stock of goods was delivered to plaintiff according to contract. In view, of these findings of fact, defendant could not have been injured by the refusal of his last point for charge, which was to the effect that a party has a legal right to refuse performance of a contract which he thinks was induced by fraud, — even if his point had been proper!}' <a id="p661" href="#p661" data-label="661" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*661</a>drawn.
