      <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>On June 28,1876, the judgment against Love was assigned of record by Jamison to Francis Mankediek, the defendant in the present case, and after execution had issued thereon at lev. fa. No. 227 July term, 1876. All the papers in this execution are lost, but from the testimony and docket entries the master finds that on July 1,1876, certain persons who had bought lots in C. H. Love’s plan called “ Arlington ” petitioned the court and thereon, on July 1, 1876, the court ordered that after the sheriff should sell that portion of the mortgaged premises remaining unsold by Love, there should be then exposed to sale, if necessary, according to schedule thereto attached, in the inverse order of alienation those lots in the plan which Love had conveyed.</p>

The order made, adjusting the mode and conduct of sale, was a definitive decree adjudicating that the petitioning lot owners had a legal right to have the sheriff sell in a certain order, and an appeal therefrom would have lain, but no appeal was taken by Mankediek.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b557-6" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[126,1490,1174,912]],["BL_558.1",558,[270,363,1169,556]]]'>This order was made because the court considered the act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 1856, section 9, as applicable to the case, and was generally observed and carried out. A very great majority of the thousand lots in the plan was sold to Francis Mankediek, and by arrangement with Mankediek prior to the sheriff’s sale and without any reservation whatever by Mankediek, the others who also had purchased lots subject to the mortgage, were permitted to buy in their lots for the nominal price of $15.00 apiece. The sheriff returned that he had sold the land to the various bidders according to the order of court, .and had realized in all the sum of $7,617.85, which included the proceeds of the sales to Mankediek. An objection was made by Mankediek to the sheriff’s return, for not naming purchasers and prices, and after an amended return, absolutely confirmed, the sheriff executed and delivered to the various purchasers deeds for lots in the Arlington plan, by reference thereto, the plaintiff having withdrawn his exceptions. One of these deeds from the sheriff is to F. M. Love for fifty-seven lots, including <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>lots Nos. 163 and 164, 163 being described as bounded by Station street. These lots afterwards by deed of F. M. Love, dated June 21,1889, became vested in Robinson Wilson. Lots Nos. 321, 322, 323 and 324 were (inter alia) bought in by and conveyed to Francis Mankedick, who by deed dated the 9th day of November, 1890, deed book 740, page 23, granted and conveyed the same to Herman Pry, the plaintiff. This deed refers expressly to Arlington plan by vol. and page, names Station street as one of the boundaries, and contains all the words usual, in the omnibus clause, of a printed Pennsylvania fee simple deed, to wit (inter alia) :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[269,928,1169,194]]]'>“ Together with all and singular the buildings, improvements, ways, waters, water-courses, rights, liberties, privileges, hereditaments and appurtenances whatsoever thereunto belonging or in any wise appertaining,” etc.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b558-6" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[269,1130,1166,136]]]'>The plaintiff then erected his dwelling house upon these lots at the southeast corner of Mevay avenue and Station street, and has resided there ever since.</p>

Love and covered all the land included in the purchase-money mortgage from Love to Jamison. The deed from C. H. Love et ux. to defendant conveying lots 1 and 2 therein, and dated November 1,1872, was acknowledged November 18, 1872, but never recorded. The surveying and laying out of the plan was in July, 1872, and it was recorded November 18,1872, in the recorder’s office of Allegheny county, in plan book 5, pages 54 and 55. This plan shows Station street as extending in a straight line from the southwestern to the northwestern corner of the plan, being in fact the westernmost land therein. Its uniform width is forty feet and it leads, on the plan, into Arlington avenue, which adjoins and parallels the tracks and right of way of the P. C. C. &amp;'St. L. Railway. At the southeast corner of Arlington avenue and Station street stand the defendant’s dwelling house and store, under one roof, on his lots 1 and 2. Not earlier than July, 1877, defendant built a fence at the southwest corner of lot No. 1 and extending-quite across Station street. North and south of this fence defendant erected on the westerly side but directly in Station street a corn crib, two water closets and a wash house. Not earlier than July, 1878, defendant erected at the northwest corner of lot 163 another fence extending across-<a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>Station street, and has more or less since then maintained these two fences and out buildings. Not until May, 1892, did defendant successfully assert and maintain exclusive possession and control of the enclosed space which extended about one hundred and fifty feet from cross fence to cross fence, when he plowed up and cultivated the patch for farming or vegetables. He may have used a portion of the space for gardening previous to May, 1892, but up until that time the public passed and repassed on foot through the two cross fences at an open space in each at the western side and close to the fence which extended from Arlington avenue to Mevay avenue and marked the line between Station street and the property of Benjamin Fereday. From the spring of 1872 until about July, 1877, Station street was used, though never graded nor cared for in any way by the township authorities nor the people in the plan. It was during that time used now and then by teams hauling coal and other vehicles as well as pedestrians, but the master finds and is of the opinion it was never what is known as an open or public street.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[129,1343,1169,659]]]'>It is certain, however, that up to May, 1892, the defendant’s cross fences were not allowed to wholly obstruct the passage, north and south, of foot travelers, as it is admitted the ends of the boards next to Fereday’s line were constantly and repeatedly nailed up and then broken off, and by persons unknown, and the footpaths were well worn. From the time C. H. Love became the owner of the Jamison farm until the sheriff’s sale in July, 1876, he conveyed a number of lots, and at the time of the said sale, there were over fifteen dwelling houses erected here and there in the plan. Beyond all question, C. H. Love, by his plan and conveyance of lots therein, dedicated all the streets and ways in Arlington plan to the public so far as any mortgagor could. This needs no discussion.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b559-6" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[129,2010,1169,399]],["BL_560.1",560,[270,371,1167,552]]]'>It is important that Francis Jamison lived in the plan from its inception to the date of his death, which occurred after the sheriff’s sale in July, 1876, and that no word or act of his in disapproval of the Arlington plan appears in this case. Beyond the release on the margin of his mortgage there appears no distinct affirmative recognition by him of the plan, as such, though from July, 1878, to May, 1876, he certainly beheld dwelling houses and other improvements being made on the <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>land without interference on his part, so far as the testimony in this case shows; but there can be no reasonable doubt that he knew of, and had seen the plan before or at the time he accepted Love’s mortgage to him containing, in the description, an explicit reference thereto, and the master therefore finds, from the circumstances, that he knew of the plan. It does not appear that he was either a traveler or an invalid confined to his house, but he knew what was going on, and had most exact knowledge when, in his release of lots Nos. 91, 92, 93 and 94, he referred to Arlington plan as being recorded in plan book 5, pages 54 and 55.</p>
