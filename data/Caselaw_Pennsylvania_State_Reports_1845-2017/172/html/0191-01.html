In 1889, under an order of court for the payment of debts, the real estate of which he died seized was sold to John A. Emerick for $6,152.88, on account of which he paid $300. Having subsequently refused to pay the residue of his bid, the court in May, 1890, set aside the sale and ordered a resale of the property. Under that order, it was sold May 29, 1890, to Joseph H. Long for $1,152.88 less than it brought at the first <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>sale. This last sale was duly confirmed and property conveyed to Long, by whom the purchase money was paid.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[275,474,1167,967]]]'>The fund for distribution consisted of, (1) $300 paid by the purchaser at the first sale, less expenses etc., and (2) $4,744-^^ net proceeds of the second sale. As to the first item, there appears to be no ground for controversy. It was raised by the first sale, made within five years after the intestate’s death, and while some of his simple contract debts, — which appear to have constituted his only indebtedness, — were still a lien on the land. The second item is the net proceeds of the second sale which was both ordered and made more than five years after his decease. The learned court held that, under the act of February, 1834, and decisions of this court construing the same, the debts in question had ceased to be liens on the land before the last sale, and hence the creditors of the intestate, claiming to participate in the distribution, were not entitled to do so. The fund arising from the second sale was therefore distributed to and among the widow ajid children of the decedent according to their respective interests in the land of which it was the proceeds. In this, we think the court was clearly right.</p>
