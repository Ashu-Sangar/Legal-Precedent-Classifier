The rejected claims were not liens on the land when the same was sold. The claims of David Dunkle and John A. Swartz, referred to in the fourth specification, were based on notes of the intestate which were barred by the statute of limitations. The Dunkle note is dated March 81, 1882, and the Swartz note May 12,1880, both payable one day after date. Nothing appears to have been done whereby the lien of either was extended beyond the period of five years from the decease of the maker. Neither of the specifications is sustained.</p>
