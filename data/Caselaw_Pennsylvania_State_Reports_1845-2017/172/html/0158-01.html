After I signed the paper it seems some person, without my knowledge or consent, has filled out the twenty (20) shares of stock for me, and subsequently, without my knowledge or consent, and some six (6) months after I had signed the paper, an application was made for a charter for a company having for its purpose the purchase and sale of real estate, and also the holding, leasing and selling of real estate. I was not consulted about the formation of the company, nor the purpose for which it was to be organized, and I gave no authority to anjr one for me to assent to the orginization of any such company with any such powers. I deny that I attended any of the meetings of the stockholders of the Columbus Land Company.
