Sink, and levied an execution upon the stock and fixtures of a restaurant in Mrs. Sink’s possession. A. W. Krepps, the plaintiff, claimed that the property belonged to him. The evidence in substance was that on July 12, 1894, Mrs. Sink, being then indebted to Krepps for $182, executed a bill of sale to Krepps for the property in dispute, and received from him in addition $145. The bill of sale was prepared by a justice of the peace and executed before him. Krepps subsequently took a lease from the landlord of the premises in his own name and a verbal agreement was then made between Krepps and Mrs Sink by which she was to pay $26.00 per month, being $20.00 rent for the premises and $6.00 rent or hire for the personal property. Mrs. Sink’s sign over the restaurant was not changed after the sale.</p>

On the sale of personal property, if there be no delivery, the vendee takes no title against subsequent purchasers and creditors of the vendor. <em>Answer: </em>This is affirmed; we told you that in the outstart, if there is no delivery. [2]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b414-7" data-blocks='[["BL_414.6",414,[277,833,1160,248]]]'>2. If the vendee permit the property to remain in his vendor’s possession, he is affected by any subsequent sale of his vendor to any person taking possession, and also by the declarations of the vendor while she held possession. <em>Answer : </em>That is the law. [3]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b414-8" data-blocks='[["BL_414.7",414,[275,1088,1162,708]]]'>4. If Krepps, the alleged vendee of Mrs. Sink, consented or remained silent when he ought to have spoken as to the ownership of the property in dispute, he would be estopped from claiming it. <em>Answer: </em>This is correct as a principle of law; affirmed; the proof in regard to declarations of Mrs. Sink as to the ownership of this property was admitted more for the purpose of throwing light upon the subject and showing whether or not the transaction between Krepps and Mrs. Sink was in good faith ; it would make no difference to Mr. Miller whether these declarations were made or not, because if there was no delivery he would have his rights still, and his rights would not be interfered with; if you find there was no delivery then Harvey Miller must have the verdict; we leave the question to you, gentlemen.</p>

That if from the evidence the jury find said alleged sale and purchase to and by Krepps to have been honest and for value, yet that there was not such an open, notorious and visible change of possession from Mrs. Daugherty to the plaintiff as would be apparent to the public, the same is a fraud in law and not binding on the defendant, J. H. Miller, one of the creditors of Mrs. Sink (or Daugherty) at the time of said alleged sale to Krepps, and the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>We affirm that point if you find these facts.
