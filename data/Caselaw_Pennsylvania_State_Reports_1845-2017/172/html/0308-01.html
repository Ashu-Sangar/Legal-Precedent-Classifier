He then detailed the amount of lumber shipped after that time, stating the number of the cars and the price of the lumber, and you recollect he said that with the burned lumber and the car of cherry taken out, there was left a balance of $812.06 in favor of J. M. Hastings, taking the books as they stood with the charges made and the credits given.</p>

We believe this was figured up until the 26fch of August, 1891, the time defendant called for in the examination, and included all of the lumber shipped and all of the credits.] [24] There were some statements made before by Mr. McClain, brought out on cross-examination by plaintiffs’ counsel, in which the debit side was stated to be a different amount from this, and the credit side different, and showing by that a balance due A.

We will have to beg leave to differ with him there; they would not be entitled to the $7.50 per thousand from the fact the lumber was not loaded on the car, and could only have a claim of $7.00 per thousand under this contract.] [25]</p>

Now, we think, gentlemen, it is for you to ascertain what balance was due and unpaid as between these parties and from whom it was due; this merely bearing on the testimony of Mr. Hastings, whether it corroborates him in his statement; and in connection with that we will have to refer to some of these exhibits.] [23]</p>

McClain agreed to furnish lumber to cover what might be due defendant for money advanced to A. M. McClain &amp; Co., on account of lumber which had been ordered from the Crawford mill but not delivered. The evidence — relating to the Crawford Mill contract, how far the same had been executed, the circumstances connected therewith, and the state of the accounts be<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>tween A. M. McClain &amp; Co. and defendants, and constituting the subjects of complaint in many of the twenty-nine specifications of error — was rightly admitted. That evidence did not raise an independent issue. It was introduced merely for the purpose of showing circumstances, etc., which tended to make the proposition in controversy more or less probable. Much latitude must necessarily be allowed in the admission of corroborating testimony in such cases. The learned trial judge, in some of his rulings, and in those portions of his charge embraced in the specifications of error referred to, carefully reiterated that this evidence was received merely for the purpose of corroboration. The defendants have no just cause to complain of the rulings and instructions.</p>
