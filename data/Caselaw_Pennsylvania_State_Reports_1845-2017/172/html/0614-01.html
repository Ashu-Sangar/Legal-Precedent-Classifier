That while the foregoing is the formal demand upon which the plaintiff relies, it nevertheless incidentally appears that at some uncertain date in the early part of the year 1891, prior, however, to the 3d day of March of that year, a previous demand had been made and refused; and that this demand conveyed the first notice to the defendant corporation that the stock had been pledged to the plaintiff bank.</p>

That this indebtedness arose by reason of fraudulent overdrafts by Jesse H. Lippincott upon his individual account with the Rochester Tumbler Company; that these overdrafts were made from time to time during a period of several years prior to May 1, 1891, by checks drawn upon the funds of the Rochester Tumbler Company', in many and perhaps the majority of instances, for the purpose of taking up negotiable paper, which he had previously issued by fraud, as the treasurer of said company, and had procured to be discounted by various banks, applying the proceeds thereof to his own individual purposes.</p>

That no account accessible to the company was kept of the paper fraudulently issued by him; and while it is impossible to ascertain with certainty when its issue began or the exact amount outstanding at any particular date prior to the date of May 1, 1891, it does appear that fraudulent paper was negotiated by him as early as March 21, T890, and that fictitious methods were employed by him as early as June 28,1887, for the purpose of concealing the extent of the overdrafts upon his account.</p>

That it cannot be found as a fact from the evidence, that any other officer of the Rochester Tumbler Company was cognizant of the overdrafts by Mr. Lippincott, or of the fact that Mr. Lippincott had made fraudulent use of the name and credit of the company, prior to the middle of the month of November, 1890. But it does appear that at or about that date, H. C. Fry, president of the company, became aware of the improper use of the name of the company by Mr. Lippincott, who at the time represented such use to be but temporary and for an inconsiderable amount. This discovery by Mr. Fry was, within a few weeks thereafter, followed by the knowledge that Mr. Lippincott had largely overdrawn his account, and that he had, for his own individual benefit, pledged the credit of the company upon obligations aggregating a large sum of money. But having confidence in Mr. Lippincott and relying upon promises that the paper of the company would be speedily retired and the overdrafts made good, Mr. Fry partially complied with Mr. Lippincott’s request, and but sparingly imparted the information he had gathered to the remaining members of the board of directors, in the latter part of the month of December, 1890. The information then given, to directors Kane and Moulds, was to the effect that Mr. Lippincott’s account was largely overdrawn. The knowledge that fraudulent use of the name of the corporation had been made, does not clearly appear to have been communicated until after January 1, 1891. That while Mr. Fry, as president of the company, may have participated as early as December 11, 1890, in the renewal of paper fraudulently issued by Mr. Lippincott, and then in the <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>hands of bona fide holders, there is not sufficient evidence to show that he knowingly consented to an increase of Mr. Lippincott’s indebtedness. That, by the 1st day of January, 1891, Mr. Fry had sufficient knowledge to inform him not only that Mr. Lippincott was entirely untrustworthy in his statements in regard to the extent of his indebtedness to the company, but was both needy and corrupt to a degree that would lead him into further speculations, is beyond doubt.</p>

This notice, under the evidence, could not have been given earlier than January 1, 1891, nor later than March 3 of the same 3'ear.

Equity in the distribution of funds among creditors is, for the most part in this state, worked out, not by allowing the junior creditor or claimant to interfere with the execution process of the senior creditor, but by means of subrogation after payment or tender of payment in full of the senior creditor’s claim. • If the right of marshaling securities by permitting interference on the part of a junior claimant is ever admissible, it is under exceptional and extreme circumstances. It is an equitable right of the most delicate nature and can be called into exercise only upon affirmative proof of an equity in the junior claimant that is clear, distinct and imperative. It is never allowed as a mere experiment. It must appear, beyond doubt, that its exercise will bring substantial advantage to the junior without injuring or dehtying the senior creditor. As in the case of subrogation, which is never permitted until the senior creditor’s claim has been paid in full, so in the exercise of this extraordinary equitable right, it is never granted unless the security which the junior claimant seeks to have first applied to the senior creditor’s claim is clearly shown to be ample for the satisfaction of that claim. This proof of the sufficiency of the one hundred shares of stock, the National Bank of the Republic has not produced. The master is unable to suppress the observation that, in all fairness, the consideration of the question arising out of the exceptions directed to the matter of this additional stock should not have been forced upon him. The candor of all concerned in the case will compel the admission that if the indebtedness of Jesse H. Lippincott to the Rochester Tumbler Company is a lien upon his stock, the sale of twice four hundred shares in the most favorable market would perhaps not fully discharge the indebtedness.</p>

The language of the certificate is not a representation of any inherent quality of the shares or rights of the holder, but is merely information as to the mode of transfer. From the nature of the business, transfers must be under some regulation and where, as in this case the regulations are imposed by the statute which is the fountain of the corporate power, all parties are bound to take notice of them. The Pennsylvania cases cited are not in point. Willis v. R. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.N.C.%20461" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="6 W.N.C. 461">6 W. N.

There was no question of the mode or conditions of transfer. Wood’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/92/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="92 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="490980" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0379-01">92 Pa. 379</a> and Jeanes’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/116/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="116 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="554343" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0573-01">116 Pa. 573</a>, were cases of private owners who had clothed their agents with apparent authority to transfer and were held to be estopped thereby.

Nor can the claim be sustained that the defendant has lost its right to lien as against the appellant, by reason of negligence in allowing the debt to be created. There is no obligation on a creditor to take care of other creditors of the mutual debtor further than by the avoidance of fraud. An employer may trust his employee to the extent of negligence without impairing his rights against the employee, or giving the employee’s creditor any ground of complaint, before notice of such creditor’s rights. And even after notice it does not follow that he <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>must sacrifice his own rights. In the present case it is doubtful if the learned master did not go too far in favor of the appellant in holding that knowledge by the president and directors of the treasurer’s misconduct raised any duty to outside parties to discharge him, or in any way impair the right of lien even for a subsequent increase of his debt. Such is not the rule even in favor of sureties: Rw. Co. v. Shaffer, <a href="/pa/59/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="59 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="426995" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0350-01">59 Pa. 350</a>. The directors being suddenly confronted with knowledge' that their treasurer.had by outside speculation with the company’s money, become a defaulter, had to decide whether it was for the interest of the company to allow him time and opportunity to withdraw gradually from the illegal ventures and reduce his debt or to stop him peremptorily at all risks. In reaching a decision they were not necessarily bound to take notice of danger to his other creditors, or to prefer such interests to their own. Those are matters which must depend on the particular circumstances of each case. It is not however necessary to go into this inquiry since it is conceded that the debt of Lippincott to the appellee incurred before knowledge of his misconduct or of appellant’s claim, very far exceeds the value of the shares in controversy.</p>

L. 78, and this depends upon the meaning of the word “ indebted ” in the seventh section. The section provides for certificates to be issued to the holders of stock according to the number of shares held, which certificates “ shall be transferable at the pleasure of the holder, in person or by attorney . . . . subject however to all the payments due or to become due thereon; and the assignee .... shall be a member of said corporation and have .... all the immunities, privileges and franchises, and be subject to all the liabilities, conditions and penalties incident thereto, in the same manner the original subscriber or holder would have been, but no certificate shall be transferred so long as the holder thereof is indebted to said company unless the board of directors shall consent thereto,” P. L. 78. The last clause is the operative one from which the lien in this case arises. On its face and by the natural meaning of the words it includes all kinds of indebtedness. Standing alone there could be no question about it. But appellant contends that it should be read with and controlled by -the previous expression “subject to all payments due or to become due <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>thereon,” and its meaning therefore is restricted to indebtedness growing out of the original subscription and subsequent calls or assessments thereon.</p>
    <p id="b647-5" data-blocks='[["BL_647.4",647,[158,505,1168,1834]]]'>The argument is ingenious but not convincing. It is opposed not only as already said to the natural meaning of the words used, but also to the words which would most naturally have been used if the intent had been as claimed. The prior part of the section makes the certificates transferable at the pleasure of the holder, and the transferee takes them subject to all payments and liabilities incident to the original subscription. If the indebtedness which would prevent a transfer without the consént of the directors had been intended to be only that arising from the same source, the easiest and most obvious mode of expression would have been to add to the first clause “ and subject further as to all payments due thereon, to the consent of directors,” or to have substituted for the last clause, “ but no certificate shall be transferred so long as any payments remain due thereon,” unless the directors consent, etc. Either of these forms would have expressed clearly and definitely the restriction of the kind of debt which would prevent transfer, and one of them, or some other similar phrase would have been the natural expression chosen for such idea.. But instead of using any such expression the legislature indicated its intent by the broad word “ indebted.” The fact is as was pointed out by the learned master, that the two clauses as they stand in the act do not refer at all to the same thing. The first, “subject to all payments due or to become due thereon ” refers to the obligations to be assumed by the new taker, while the other “ so long as the holder is indebted” refers to the existing obligations of the former owner. A stockholder may become indebted to his company in many other ways than for calls upon his subscription, and the company may be content with his ability to pay, and its hold upon his shares as security. But this security would be lost if he could step out at any time by the transfer of his shares with only a liability for calls upon the original subscription. The legislature clearly had these considerations in view when it drew the distinction between the new obligations' of the transferee and the old ones of the transferor, and described the latter by the broad word “ indebted.”</p>

If the indebtedness which gives a lien is only such as arises from “ payments due” on the stock, then a stockholder not so indebted can, as the language of the first part says, transfer at his pleasure, and the consent of the directors need only be obtained when he is so indebted. But by section 12, “No shares shall be transferable until all previous calls thereon shall have been fully paid in.” That is, if the present holder is not indebted on calls the consent of the directors to a transfer is not necessary, and if he is so indebted the directors have no power to consent, so that in either alternative the prohibition against transfer without consent of the directors becomes ineffective, and the clause without meaning. A construction which leads to such results cannot be entertained.</p>

But as the subject has been somewhat elaborated in the argument, it may be well briefly to call attention to the trend of legislation in this state towards the gradual assimilation of rights and duties between members of partnerships and of corporations. The statutory authorization of special, and later of limited partnerships has approximated the status of the members to that of mere stockholders in that they may invest a definite amount of capital and avoid the unlimited common law liabilities. On the other hand when a partner sells out, either voluntarily or involuntarily, he passes to his vendee only a right to an account, and he cannot at any time unless by consent withdraw from the firm and leave the others to pay its debts, and in this respect the legislature has passed many acts, including the one under present consideration, tending to put a stockholder desirous of withdrawing, in an analogous position by requiring him first to pay up his indebtedness to the corporation. A number of such acts are cited in the argument of the appellee, and need not be enlarged upon here, further than to say that they have uniformly received from this court a construction in furtherance of their intent, and in harmony with the view we have expressed of the act of 1874.
