The first execution seems to have indorsed upon it a statement by the prothonotary of a waiver of this exemption. This first testatum fi. fa. was returned nulla bona. The second execution was returned (which should be an alias — not material) ; was issued at the suggestion of the plaintiff again to Clearfield county.

Failing to get any satisfaction from the defendant about them or about the payment of this judgment he telegraphed home here and had a writ issued. He is not clear whether he telegraphed to the attorney or to the prothonotary himself. This is the first time for the first writ. The second writ seems to have been issued by the attorney— at the instance of the attorney of the plaintiff. The plaintiff testified that during the time of the pendency of that writ the defendant Read was in possession of property sufficient to have paid the writ, and by the appraisement that was held as returned by the sheriff to the writ this would appear to be the case.</p>

This raises, gentlemen, at the threshold of the case a question of law — a question of practice in such cases, and it is necessary for this court to decide, which decision is binding upon you, whether it was the duty of the prothonotary, under the circumstances of this case in the absence of any evidence before us of special direction of the plaintiff or his attorney to him, to make such indorsement. If it was the duty of the prothonotary to make such indorsement upon the writ, and you would find that such failure to indorse caused the loss of the collection of the judgment in that writ, then the defendant would be responsible to the plaintiff for such negligence.</p>

It is very well said by one of our judges in our early books that officers are created for the benefit of the community, not for the emolument of the individual, and that every public officer ought to know his duty and exercise it with fidelity, or he will become responsible to the party aggrieved. To perform his duty with fidelity is the test of responsibility, in cases like this where negligence is charged against the officer.</p>

      <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>The office of prothonotary is an ancient one; it comes to us in this country from that country whence we derive so many of our laws; we believe he was the chief officer of the court of kings bench, chief clerk, the chief notaiy, we think some of the books say the chief shorthand writer, for they seem to have had such devices, and inventions in that early da^. He is the officer of the court, the clerk of the court who writes its decrees and enters its judgments and issues its processes. We have by an act of 1834 and kindred acts, specified duties defined. Of course, for the violation of those statutory specified duties and consequent damage the officer is responsible in court in actions at law. You will observe the charge here is that he failed to make the indorsement upon the writ of waiver — that the note contained a waiver of the benefit of the exemption. There is no statutory requirement on the officer to make this indorsement; it is not specifically so written in the law; but because of the duty of the officer to discharge his duty with fidelity it is alleged by the plaintiff here that the failure to make this indorsement was a disregard of that obligation, neglect of that fidelity in that respect, that the nature of the duties of his office required. Now, how is that? We are to decide it.</p>

A solution of this question must result, I think, from a consideration of what constitutes essential or vital parts of it, for thus much at least may be said, that whatever constitutes an essential or vital part of the office, so that without it the design and object of the office cannot be attained, must necessarily be ranked amongst the duties which the officer is bound to fulfill; and as the character and design of different offices are different the duties of the officer vary accordingly.” Then some comments are added by the court.</p>

It is necessary for the officer to obey the request of the attorney <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>or plaintiff personally to issue the execution, and the execution must follow the judgment. Whether it must follow it in all its various incidents and complicities, if it has such, we are not now deciding as an abstract question, we will meet the specific question that is before us; we think as a general principle, however, that he is not required to decide the delicate questions that may arise upon the face of the judgment; there are certain plain duties, however, that experience and practice, sanctioned by the utterance of our higher court, unquestionably require him to perform. He is required to place certain indorsements upon that writ. What are they? And those indorsements when so made are controlling upon the sheriff even as against the recitals in the body of the writ itself; and when there is a variance between such indorsements as practices sanctioned and required him to make upon the back of the writ and the body of the writ, the recitals are controlling on the officer, and upon complaint made against the sheriff the indorsement upon the writ will be a protection to him.</p>

These are very plain duties enjoined upon the prothonotary and they are official, and he is expected to perform them faithfully and correctly. Is it the duty of the prothonotary to go further, and where a judgment has been entered waiving the benefit of the exemption that the law applies to all ordinary contracts, is it his duty of his own motion to enter that waiver on the back of the writ as one of the required indorsements ?</p>

Our Supreme Court, however, for sufficient reason to themselves, intimating occasionally regrets since however, have decided that the waiver, when supported by sufficient consideration between the parties, or if made at the time of the original contract, that results in the written evidence of the debt, if the waiver was made then or upon sufficient consideration, we repeat it is good between the parties and a judgment can be collected, notwithstanding the defendant may make claim against it for the benefit of the exemption; the officer, the sheriff, is not bound to regard it if the defendant has waived it.</p>

It is quite true that that practice has obtained throughout the commonwealth, and ordinarily we find on the back of the writs issued upon executions waiving the benefit of the exemption such indorsements; but when the prothonotary is sought to be held responsible for alleged losses due the plaintiff because of the failure of an indorsement of that kind upon the writ, we <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>think it is necessary for plaintiff to go further and show that the prothonotary failed to make such indorsement in disregard of the request of the plaintiff to do so, and there is no evidence in this case that the plaintiff requested him by himself or by his attorney to make an indorsement of that kind or to accompany the execution with a statement for the guidance of the sheriff that the original judgment waived the benefit of the exemption.</p>

We do not for the reason stated think this is sufficient to charge him with negligence. We find it decided somewhere that an indorsement by a justice of the peace upon an execution of a waiver of exemption, when it was unauthorized and when it really was not in the instrument creating the debt waived, will not deprive the defendant of the benefit of his exemption, or his right of complaint at law against the officer for disregarding his claim. Now that is the opposite of this. Here the complaint is that the officer is responsible for not making the indorsement; it is the converse of the other ; and the failure of the officer to make such indorsement when he <em>issues </em>a writ does not of itself deprive the plaintiff of his right to have it followed with a statement or a certificate from the officer that such waiver is contained in the original paper; so that the right of exemption being a general and statutory one, the waiver of this exemption being the result of only a special agreement or a special contract, we think probably it would be holding the officer to too strict a line of duty to require him to decide whether the judgment itself in the absence of any suggestion from the plaintiff actually contained a waiver or not.</p>

If he neglected to do so and in consequence thereof any part of the-claim was lost, he is liable to respond in damages to the extent of plaintiff’s loss. As shown by the record the judgment was regularly entered “ by virtue of a warrant of attorney .... for the sum of one hundred and one dollars, with interest, from May 31st, 1875, with costs of suit, release of errors, without stay of execution, and waiving exemption and inquisition.” The concluding waivers of “ exemption and inquisition ” are important features of the <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>judgment, and should clearly appear in the body of the writ or by indorsement thereon, so that the sheriff charged with its execution may be fully advised that the defendant has waived his right to claim the benefit of the exemption law, and has consented to the condemnation of any real estate that may be taken in execution for the purpose of satisfying the judgment.

That being so, it follows as a matter of course that on issuing execution process on such judgment, it is the duty of the prothonotary to follow the record thereof and not only recite or note the amount of the judgment, etc., but also its terms and conditions so far as the proper execution of the process may be affected thereby.</p>
