The defendant also contends that, even if this arrangement had been made to refund the money, the arrangement made between Jessop and Ivory for Ivory to refund the money upon Jessop becoming dissatisfied with the stock, that subsequent to that time there were acts of ownership over this stock exercised by the plaintiff, Jessop, that <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>that would be, or was an abandonment of the arrangement or agreement. You will remember that the plaintiff states that he took the certificate of stock and went to Mr. Ivory’s house, and demanded the return of the money. Ivory states that Jessop was there at his house, but there was nothing said about the guaranteeing-of the stock; he says that Jessop demanded his money at that time, and said if he would not get it he would expose the company.</p>

B. Cochran to .vote this stock at a stockholders’ meeting where directors were to be elected, and a telegram that the plaintiff sent Ivory to Pittsburg to sell his stock, and a letter that was written by the plaintiff to the defendant at Pittsburg inquiring as to how the plant was getting along and how the stock was. Now as to the telegram that was sent, Jessop, the plaintiff, states that that telegram was sent at the request of Ivory, and that Ivory fixed the amount at which the stock was to be sold. Ivory says that he did not do that. The dispatch reads this wise : “ Kittanning, Pa., January 18th, ’90. R. B. Ivory, Dispatch Building, Pitts-burg, Pa.: Sell my 100 shares of wheel stock at $15 per share.” Now these exhibits of evidence, the proxy and the telegram, and the letter, are all to be taken into consideration by you in determining this case. We say to you that if the agreement, as alleged by the plaintiff, Jessop, was entered into at the time of the sale of this stock, that he was to have his money returned upon -his becoming dissatisfied with it; if that is true in this case and there is nothing offered on the part of the defense to show a waiver of that or an abandonment of the contract by the plaintiff, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. But we also say to you that the defendant, if he, by this proxy, telegram and letter, would show to you that he had exercised rights of ownership over this greater than would be required to maintain and keep himself safe in this matter, then that would be showing such ownership as would be an abandonment of the former contract, if there were one.] [4]</p>

Now, if that .was the contract between the parties at that time, and that was the only contingency that existed in this contract between them as to the returning of the money, then it being in evidence before you that a patent had been procured for this wheel, the plaintiff could not recover in this case.

The plaintiff’s action was upon a parol agreement to take back the stock and refund the price paid if the purchaser should become dissatisfied, and desire to rescind. The defense was a denial of the contract set up, and in corroboration of that denial, an averment that the contract was in writing and contained the only condition on which it was to be rescinded. This paper was not produced but appellant gave evidence of its contents. <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>The question was therefore necessarily for the jury to decide whether the real contract was as the plaintiff or as the appellant claimed. When the case was here before we were obliged to hold that the court below had not given the writing its proper weight in putting it before the jury, but we said clearly that it was a matter for the jury, with instructions that the writing is presumed to contain the whole contract between the parties, and they must so find unless satisfied by clear and convincing evidence that another part of the agreement was in fact made at the time but omitted from the writing by fraud, accident or mistake. The learned judge gave this instruction to the jury by the affirmance of defendant’s fourth point. He could not have gone further and directed for the defendant, because the writing not being in evidence the burden of proving its contents was on the defendant, and his testimony on that subject was inferentially if not expressly denied by the plaintiff. In this class of cases it is common experience that the lay mind takes a different view from the legal one. Juries nearly always give more weight to the words of the living witness before them, than they do to the writings made even by the same witness at another time. It is quite probable that in the present case the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, but it was a question for the jury, they were rightly instructed as to the law, and the correctness of their verdict was for the court below, not for us, to determine.</p>
    <p id="b72-5" data-blocks='[["BL_72.4",72,[246,1649,1169,707]]]'>On the present argument the learned counsel for the appellee called our attention to the fact that the writing in question was not an agreement signed by the parties, but merely a receipt by the defendant, and therefore the rule as to the modification of written agreements by parol evidence, should not apply. The distinction is well founded, and if the verdict had gone the other way we should probably be obliged to hold in favor of the appellee that the rule was laid down too strictly against him. But the substance of the charge, that the writing, when admitted or proved, is presumed to contain the whole agreement of the parties, was entirely correct, and if the requirements of the evidence to overcome the presumption were stated too strongly it was an error in appellant’s favor which affords him no just ground of complaint.</p>
