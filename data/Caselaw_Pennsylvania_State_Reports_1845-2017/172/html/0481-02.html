If this is a debt of Mr. Kauss he must pay it and must pay it because it is a debt. This girl offers this proof, and the burden of proof is on her, the burden is on her to show that there was a contract of some kind by which she was to go to this man’s house and remain with him during his lifetime and perform and work according to that contract, and she must show that she did it and when she had done that then she had complied with her part and she <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>can recover. What was the contract? Mr. Kauss is dead; death has closed his lips; they are sealed forever; he is not here and he cannot tell what the bargain was; the law seals this girl’s lips, therefore the proof must come outside of them. She puts on the stand her mother, who says this; I will read from her testimony: “ Q. Did you have any conversation afterwards with him about it? A. Yes, sir, after she was there a while he came down and got me at Harmony and when he was bringing me back he said if I would leave her with him until his death all he had should be hers, and what he had was hers. Q. Did he tell you what he had ? A. The farm and all he had. Q. Did you assent to this arrangement? A. Yes, sir.” [If what that lady says is true then there was a contract made on which this girl can recover unless she has in some way violated that contract.] [10] Is it true ? If it is not we cannot receive loose declarations to others to establish contracts; there was the proof of Mr. Kauffman and Mr. Dunbar as to statements the old man made to them within the few last years as regards this property. If the mother had not made this arrangement this testimony would not be proper, but it is proper to support and corroborate her statement, [and if you believe that this old gentleman told Mr. Kauffman and Mr. Marburger and Mr. Ripper and Mr. Mc-Niel and Mr. Dunbar that he was going to give this farm to Mary, it is strong corroborative evidence that he made the contract just as Mrs. Williams said he did; you have a right to take it for that purpose.] [11] I said a minute ago that Mary could not be a witness to testify to anything that occurred in the lifetime of the decedent because he cannot tell what occurred, neither does the law allow her to tell, but a latter act allows a party to testify or deny or explain a conversation that is alleged to have taken place between the witness and another party who is a competent witness to testify. [The defendant having put Mr. Seor on the stand to testify to a conversation he heard between Mary and Mr. Kauss relative to this contract, then the law allows Mary to come on the stand and tell her side of the conversation, but nothing else. When Mr. Seor testified then Mary became competent, and you heard her statement.] [12] Let me say if there was a contract between Mary and her mother and Mr. Kauss, as, Mrs. Williams says there was, and Mary went on and fulfilled her part and was performing her part of <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>the contract and had done so for fifteen years, Mr. Kauss could not terminate it then after having received fifteen years of her work, but if Mary went away that was the end of it, but if Mary refused to go and stayed, the old man telling her to go would not terminate it, because you can easily see it would not be fair to receive the benefit of a contract for fifteen years and when he would not need her services much longer that he could terminate it and turn her out without anything, and if she was told to go, that would not terminate this contract unless Mary went away and gave it up.] [13] Mary had a right to say, “ I have a contract with you and I want my pay, and I cannot get it until you die, and I am going to stay with you until you die.” You heard what she said as regards to what the old man did say. Is that true ? If it is then she must recover in this case.] [14]</p>

She can only get what her services are worth, because the conveyance was not made to her in Mr. Kauss’s lifetime. What was it honestly worth? You are here to measure out justice between these parties; you know neither of them; you like the estate as well as Mary; you should not like one better than the other; it is for you to decide how much Mary ought to get; [Mary worked on the farm and in the house; she worked from the time she was six years old until she was twenty-five; part of the time she went to school.

Had she gotten her money every Saturday would it have come to what her clothing amounted to ? ] [20] [You cannot go over three thousand dollars; you only go as far as the sworn proof will justify you; come down to the proof and say how much her services are worth; take it up and render a verdict, and if you find for the plaintiff j'ou say, we find for the plaintiff so many dollars; I will not fix any amount; I would not suggest any amount; that is for you ; that is about what I have to say to you.] [21] As regards the statement of the limitation, it was suggested that you could not go back further than six years. The law is this, that a man must collect his debts within six years after they are due, and if he does not he cannot collect unless he shows some promise to pay it ; [this money would not be due Mary until the old man’s death. Suppose she had sued at the end of ten years she could not recover ; why, because the contract was that she was to be paid at his death; the time did not come until the old man breathed his last, and if she can collect anything she can collect all.] [22]</p>

Proof of the contract did not entitle the plaintiff to recover the value of the estate: Hertzog v. Hertzog, <a href="/pa/34/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="34 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="417991" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0418-01">34 Pa. 418</a>; Graham v.

But it overcame the presumption arising from the existence of the family relation that the services were performed without the expectation of reward, and enabled her to recover on a quantum meruit the reasonable worth of her services. As the right to compensation did not mature until the death of John Kauss, the statute of limitations interposed no bar to the recovery of any part of the claim.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[240,971,1167,1257]]]'>It was not error to permit the plaintiff to testify. A witness called by the defendant had testified to a conversation which occurred in his presence between the plaintiff and the decedent touching the contract relation between them. In contradiction of this testimony the plaintiff was allowed to state what this conversation was. Her examination was limited to the conversation which had been detailed by the preceding witness, and no new matter was introduced. By the act of June 11, 1891, a surviving party is made competent to testify to any relevant matter which occurred before the death of the other party, if such matter occurred between himself and a person who is living and who testifies against him at the .trial, “ or if such relevant matter occurred in the presence or hearing of such other living and competent person.” To this should be added the construction given in Roth’s Estate, <a href="/pa/150/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="150 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="834376" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0261-01">150 Pa. 261</a>, that the surviving party is not competent unless the living witness has been called, and then to such matters only as he has testified to. The act applies to conversations or occurrences which took place in the presence or hearing of the witness who has testified and whom it is proposed to contradict: Thomas v. Miller, <a href="/pa/165/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="165 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="862094" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0216-01">165 Pa. 216</a>. See also Krumrine v. Grenoble, id. 98. The living witness to the conversation between the decedent and the plaintiff having testified, the plaintiff was competent to contradict him and to state her recollection of what was said.</p>

The case belongs to a class requiring the most thorough scrutiny, and in which jurors should be carefully instructed and restrained. In this respect we feel constrained to hold that the charge of the learned judge was inadequate and to some extent misleading. That portion of the charge which is the subject of the seventeenth assignment of error set up a wrong standard by which to estimate her wages, and instead of confining the jury to the proper grounds for recovery tended to incite them to follow their own inclinations and to do what the decedent had failed to do, give the plaintiff practically the whole estate. In addition to board, clothing, care, education and full maintenance the verdict gives her wages at a rate exceeding three dollars a week from the time she was six years old, and for no reason more apparent or convincing than that given by one of her principal witnesses to justify his estimate of the value of her services, that “ she ought to have it.” This'result could not have been reached by any fair calculation, and we assume that it would not have been if proper instructions had been given.</p>
