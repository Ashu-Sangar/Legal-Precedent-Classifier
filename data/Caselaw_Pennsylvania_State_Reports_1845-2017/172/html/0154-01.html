After the three grandchildren came of age, the trustee, Agnes Schrenkle, on May 29, 1895, executed a deed to them for the trust property, each to have the one undivided third part. In that deed she recites the will aud trust, and describes the property, and says: “ And whereas said Agnes A. Schrenkle, trustee as aforesaid, is of opinion that it is safe and proper to use and apply said trust estate for the benefit of said cestuis que trustent by conveying to each of them the one undivided third of said land above described, and that no reason remains for the further continuance of said trust, and it is for the interest and advantage of each of said cestuis que trustent that the same should be so conveyed.” In pursuance thereof the deed was executed and signed by her as “trustee.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b176-5" data-blocks='[["BL_176.5",176,[280,1488,1163,196]]]'>The deed is strictly in conformity to the words, terms and conditions of the trust, as to the discretionary powers of the trustee, contained in the will. It was expressly executed in pursuance of the trust.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b176-6" data-blocks='[["BL_176.6",176,[324,1691,684,42]]]'>Had she power to execute this deed ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b176-7" data-blocks='[["BL_176.7",176,[280,1743,1165,601]]]'>The duration of the trust is not expressly declared in the will. If it was intended to be perpetual, it would be against the policy of the law, and fail. In that event each of the grandchildren would have taken a vested fee simple to the one undivided third, the same as declared in the deed. But I do not think the trust was to be perpetual. From the language and terms used, I think it was to continue only until the grandchildren came of lawful age. That view harmonizes with all the expressions used. The provisions for the common pleas appointing a successor strongly sustain this view: “ In case of the decease of my wife, or other inability to act as such trustee,” evidently refers to the minority of the grandchildren.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b176-8" data-blocks='[["BL_176.8",176,[327,2353,1118,45]],["BL_177.1",177,[127,366,1179,1123]]]'>One clause in the will may raise some doubt or uncertainty <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>The trust is for the use, benefit and behoof of the three grandchildren, “ <em>and the survivor or survivors of them, and their lawful issue," </em>but subject to the control of the said trustee, and not subject to the control, contracts or liabilities of the said grandchildren. The words “ their lawful issue ” do not refer to the lawful issue of the survivor, but the lawful issue of one that might die before coming to lawful age. In other words, the trust was for the use, benefit and behoof of the three grandchildren, to the survivor or survivors and the lawful issue of such as may decease before coming of age. If one or two died before coming of age, not having lawful issue, the trust was then for the benefit of the survivors or survivor and the lawful issue of the deceased. The subsequent clause in the trust confirms this view. The trust was for the maintenance, education and benefit of said three grandchildren, and for the improvement of their said trust estates . . . . “ with power to aid any one, or all of them, by paying to them, or any one of them, such sums of money as she shall think proper after they or either of them, shall arrive at legal age.” Then follow's the other clause on which the deed was made, “ or the said trustee may <em>otherwise use or apply </em>the said <em>trust estate </em>for their benefit, in case she shall be of the opinion that the same will be safe and proper.”</p>
