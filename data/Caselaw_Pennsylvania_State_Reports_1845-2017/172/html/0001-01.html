When the sheriff was about to serve a writ to put plaintiff in possession, plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement in writing by which plaintiff gave to defendant an option to buy the land for a certain amount, in which defendant agreed that if he did not pay the price named before the day fixed, he would move out, and to that end would authorize the sheriff to deliver possession to plaintiff. Defendant did not pay the amount within the stipulated time, and the sheriff executed the writ, and delivered possession to plaintiff. Immediately afterward plaintiff permitted defendant to move his goods back upon the premises and resume possession. Defendant offered in evidence certain declarations of plaintiff that all he wanted out of the land was his money and interest. Plaintiff, however, testified that when he bought the equitable title he gave express notice that he was buying for himself, and that he allowed defendant to resume possession because defendant had no other place to go during the winter, and that he was only allowed to resume possession on an agreement that he would go out at the end of the winter, or that, if he remained, he would pay rent to be fixed at that time. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was insufficient to justify a chancellor in decreeing an equitable title in defendant.</p>

J. Smith, dated August 31, 1881, for the same two pieces of land, recorded in deed book 39, page 507, acknowledged August 31, 1881. Here the defendant alleges and has offered the evidence of witnesses to show that Wm. J. Smith agreed to take this deed and advance the money, some <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>$3,600, for the payment of the amount claimed by Gillespie. We have the testimony of J. U. Gillespie on that subject, in which he states that he had issued a possessory proceeding under the act to recover possession under the sheriff’s vendee, and after obtaining judgment upon that on the docket of John T. Bell, a justice of the peace, they finally settled that matter and he leased the premises in dispute to Wm. C. Williams. Some time after that, proceedings were had under the landlord’s and tenant’s act to recover the possession from Wm. C. Williams, and about the time of the hearing (we believe there was in fact judgment rendered upon that) Mr. Williams went to Wm. J. Smith to get some money, saying that he was going to make a tender to Gillespie of $500. This is disputed, we believe, by Williams, as to Smith making the tender; but a portion of-the money, $300, the plaintiff concedes was furnished by Williams, and Smith furnished the other portion. Smith testifies that Williams told him Gillespie would not take it, would not accept it; but to the surprise of Smith, who appears to have made the tender himself, and the surprise of Williams, Mr. Gillespie accepted the $500 and, as Smith says, he found himself in a box and had to take the title to this land to secure himself. At all events at that time Mr. Gillespie agreed, although he said he had no recollection of having made an agreement of that kind, to receive the $500 and then to receive $500 yearly after that until the last payment, which would come about May first, 1887, of $600, and that he would draw up a contract to that effect. In the meantime, however, and before this was done, it appears Williams and Smith had made some arrangement, got together in the office of A. J. Monks and talked the matter over and made arrangement that this title should be taken in the name of Wm. J. Smith, he to pay off the purchase money going to Gillespie, being at that time some $3600. This was done and the deed made to Smith and, as Gillespie states, Smith stepped into his shoes and was to do whatever he (Gillespie) was to do.</p>

It is a straight contract for the sale and purchase of the lands in controversy for $3,600, payable as follows: “ $500 now in hand, and $500 on <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>or before the first day of May, 1882; $500 on or before the first day of May, 1883 ; $500 on or before the first day of May, 1884; $500 on or before the first day of May, 1885; $500 on' or before the first day of May, 1886, and $600 on or before the first day of May, 1887.” On this contract there is the following receipt: “Received March 28, 1882, of parties of the second part the sum of $500, being in full of first payment within mentioned.” This contract was between Wm. J. Smith of the first part and Wm. C. Williams and Anna M. Williams, his wife, of the second part.</p>

J. Smith and the equitable title in Wm. C. Williams and his wife, with $500 of a credit upon the consideration, which virtually left remaining $3,100. If you recollect the testimony of Mr. Williams, he said that if he had paid any more he would have liad a receipt for it. Mr. Williams claimed that he paid $800, having paid $300 of the money used in making the tender and accepted by Gillespie; Mr. Smith says that was the whole amount paid at that time, including the $300; that Williams had paid either $200 or $300 to him (but the plaintiff concedes it was $300) to make this tender, and that he used $200 of his own money, and that when he came to make this receipt Williams paid $200, making $500, and that was all that was paid; but that'will not be very material to the matter in issue, under our view of the case.</p>

Williams and others, a fieri facias having been issued on that judgment, a sale made of the property, and a deed (which we have already referred to) made by the sheriff to Wm. N. Hadden. This we believe was in December, 1885. There is no doubt under the evidence but what that deed vested an absolute and complete title, so far as any interest of Wm. C. Williams was concerned, in Wm. N. Hadden. If at that time by virtue of the deed made by Gillespie to Wm. J. Smith, Wm. C. Williams was the owner and holder of the legal title <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>through the money he had paid on the original purchase, in the proportion of $300 to $3,600, being a twelfth, and if he had at that time also an equitable title by virtue of the article of agreement of the 28 th of April, 1882, it was all swept away by that sale, he was divested of all the title he had in the property and as well the title and equitable title his wife had in the property. The article of agreement was made between Wm. J. Smith and Wm. C. Williams and Anna M. Williams, his wife. When Mrs. Williams died all the title she ever had would pass to her husband or to his assignees or vendees. So that this sale wiped out every interest of Wm. C. Williams as well as that of his wife, who died we believe about the 20th of December, 1885. Hence by this deed made to W. N. Hadden by the sheriff there was a good title for all of the interest of Wm. C. Williams. It is not alleged we believe that there was any trust at that time, at least, that there was any promise upon the part of Hadden to make the purchase for Williams or anybody else; it was an absolute, direct purchase by him.</p>

We have already referred to that deed. So far as the deed is concerned it is absolute and conveys the premises in dispute to Wm. J. Smith. But at this point the defendant contends there was an arrangement and agreement between Wm. J. Smith and him by which Smith was to take the title from Wm. N. Hadden and hold it for him, Williams. Wm. O. Williams testified, among other things, substantially, “ I told Wm. J. Smith I had arranged to get the title from W. N. Had-den and pay him his money, $400, and thought it was my duty to come out and see him on account of our other business. ‘Well,’ he says, ‘ I am very glad you came out; Captain Hastings and I were talking and he advised me to take it for you, that if another party would get in betwixt us it might give us bother, and I agreed with him that I would take it for you provided you paid me six per cent interest.’ I told him I was satisfied to do that. ‘Well,’ he says, ‘I will take it for you.’ I says, ‘ Mr. Smith, I didn’t come out with the intention to ask you to do that, but since you have proposed to do it I would rather it would be in your hands as any other person’s, our business is all together.’ ‘Well,’ he says, ’I will take it, I would rather take it than leave it go into other hands.’ Then <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>we made arrangements ; I says ‘ Mr. Smith, so we understand one another fully, that there is no mistake. I want this Hadden title signed over to you to make you secure of your money, as the Gillespie title is in your hands.’ He says, ‘ Well, that is all the security I ask.’ Smith, Hadden and I afterwards met in Punxsutawney and the deed was made by Hadden to Smith according to our agreement. Hadden asked me if that was my request that the deed be made to Smith; I said it was; he said if it was not understood he would not convey to Smith ; I told him it was the agreement between Smith and me to secure him for his money; Smith was there at the time.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b27-5" data-blocks='[["BL_27.4",27,[126,931,1175,806]]]'>We also have Mr. Smith’s testimony in which he says he made no arrangement so far as purchasing this property for Mr. Williams; he says he purchased it for himself; that he told Williams he would not give him any more obligations nor would not make any other obligations, he was going to take care of himself. But we are asked on the testimony of Wm. C. Williams to say that there was a resulting trust — from the evidence offered upon part of Williams and some other witnesses as to Smith’s declarations afterwards that all he wanted was his money and his interest. The question is whether it is sufficient to make a resulting trust; and it is'a question of law for the court. We think under the evidence in the case and as shown on the part of the defendant that it is an express trust. Of course if we are wrong in this the party we wrong has his remedy, but we give you what we believe to be the law upon the facts in the case.</p>

Then, gentlemen, we come to the agreement that has been offered by the defendant, dated the 7th of January, 1887. But prior to this time, we think along the 8th of May, 1886, there were proceedings instituted before John St. Clair, a justice of the peace, for the purpose of recovering the possession of the premises by Wm. N. Hadden, the purchaser, his heirs or assigns. On that judgment was rendered for the premises and a writ was issued and placed in the hands of the sheriff to deliver the possession of the premises to the plaintiff. The sheriff executed this warrant, or, at all events, there was a writ issued on the 8th of November, 1886, directed to the sheriff of Jefferson county, Henry Chamberlin, and upon that writ he makes the following return:</p>

This equitable title of appellant was conveyed to Hadden by the sale under execution in 1885, and in June, 1886, Hadden conveyed it to Smith who thereby became vested with both the legal and equitable titles discharged of all claims by appellant. The agreement of January 7, 1887, between Smith and appellant is therefore the starting point of any present equity that appellant may have against Smith or his vendee the plaintiff. This is virtually conceded by the appellant’s fourth prayer for instruction to the jury that they should render a verdict for the plaintiff to be released on the payment of six thousand dollars with interest from January 7, 1887. This agreement of January, 1887, is an agreement by Smith to sell on stipulated terms, but there is no agreement by Williams to buy. The only covenant that it contains on his part is that if he does not pay the price before the date fixed he will move out, and to that end he authorizes the sheriff to deliver possession to Smith. To explain this last provision it is only necessary to recall the situation of the parties at that time. Williams’s equitable title had as already noted been sold by the sheriff to Hadden and conveyed by Hadden to Smith, thereby merging it in the legal title previously in Smith. Possessory proceedings before a justice <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>of the peace had resulted in a judgment against Williams, and the sheriff was present with a writ of habere facias possessionem. Williams therefore had no interest in the land, nothing but a bare possession which had been judicially declared at an end, and which the sheriff was about to terminate in fact. In this situation of affairs, the agreement gave him an option to buy, nothing more, for there was no obligation on his part to do so. It was not a bargain and sale of the land, either present or future, but a stay of proceedings in a writ of possession, upon conditions named, the performance of which was entirely optional on the part of Williams. To take advantage of the option he was bound to comply with its terms, and this it is conceded he never did.</p>
    <p id="b34-4" data-blocks='[["BL_34.4",34,[261,1026,1176,1366]],["BL_35.1",35,[142,361,1161,200]]]'>Down to this point the case is perfectly clear, and shows that the appellant’s entire interest in the land was terminated on January 21, 1887, when the sheriff executed his habere facias, and delivered possession to Smith. It appears however that the sheriff’s delivery of possession was formal only, and after Williams’s goods were set out, he was allowed by Smith to put them back again and continue his actual occupation of the land. He now claims that such occupation was a resumption of his former possession, and a reinstatement of his equitable title which had been divested by the previous proceedings. The burden of proof of such claim was of course upon him, and in support of it besides his own testimony that his original agreement, with Smith had never been regarded by either party as abandoned, he produced several witnesses who testified to declarations by Smith, at times not very definitely fixed but apparently subsequent to January, 1887, that all lie, Smith, wanted out of the land was his money and interest. Against this is the testimony of Smith that at the time of his purchase of the Had-den title he gave express notice that he was buying now for himself, his positive denial that after that purchase he ever made any agreement with Williams for the sale of the land except that of January 7, 1887, and his explanation of allowing Williams to continue his actual occupancy of the land after the sheriff’s delivery under his writ of possession, on the ground that it being winter and Williams having no other place to go, he was allowed to remain until April on the express agreement to go out then or remain as a tenant at a rent to be fixed at <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>that time. In this last matter Smith is corroborated by sheriff Chamberlin. On this evidence no chancellor, even without reference to the act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 533, would feel justified in decreeing an equitable title in Williams.</p>
