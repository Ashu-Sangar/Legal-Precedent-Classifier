    <p class="summary" id="b103-5" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[142,555,1166,350]]]'>As to the third position, that the debt was incurred while proceedings were pending in court for the incorporation of the borough, it cannot be maintained for want of proof. The mere advertisement of an intention to apply for incorporation would not constitute a lis pendens; the first advertisement was on August 16, 1893, but the application was not presented to court until September 18, 1893.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b103-6" data-blocks='[["BL_103.5",103,[141,915,1166,557]]]'>The evidence discloses that the directors of the independent district on August 17,1893, by resolution unanimously adopted, agreed to build a schoolhouse in Aliquippa. The resolution to purchase Woodlawn Academy was duly passed July 22, 1893, and a contract hereafter made agreeing that the same should be paid for on or before September 1, 1893. This purchase was for §2,400 and it seems the schoolhouse at Aliquippa which was built in pursuance to the aforesaid resolution cost §2,000. Whether these debts should have been contracted by the independent district was a matter within the discretion of the directors, and it is not our purpose to question their wisdom.</p>

As to the school property in the case, the only consideration under the law the auditor can concern himself about is only to find whether or not there is an undue proportion of the real estate and schoolhouses belonging to the old district within the bounds of the new, and if so, then how much shall be paid by the new to the old therefor. The law does not prescribe anything to be paid by the old to <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>the new in case there is more of real estate and schoolhouses in the old than in the new. There would be no way marked out by law to enforce a finding made by the auditor on any such premises. But still the borough district may contend that the difference in values of the school properties may be used in making an equitable adjustment of the debt, but your auditor cannot sustain this possible contention. If this difference in value does not create a debt recognized by law, so that the new district could maintain a suit thereon and recover, then your auditor would not be justified in using it as an equitable offset in favor of the borough against the old district. This would be doing indirectly what could not be done in a direct proceeding.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[262,1028,1165,448]]]'>Your auditor is forced to conclude that the only adjustment of this debt that can be made under the law as it is, is to proportion it between them on the ratio of their assessed valuations as determined by their last preceding assessment. And this would have been the way the debt would have to have been paid had the borough remained a part of the old district. And as to the last increase of the debt, there is not much margin of complaint. The old district got the benefit of $2,400, and the new of $2,200.</p>
