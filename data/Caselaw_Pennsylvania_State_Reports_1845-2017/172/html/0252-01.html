H. Lane, filed of record herein as the statement of claim, that the machinery mentioned in the contract attached to said affidavit and the workmanship in connecting and placing the same were the best, and that the same was accepted by the managers of the defendant company after it had been properly tested by the plaintiffs. That both the machinery and the construction thereof were inferior; that the said machinery will not and never did perform the work which by the terms of their contract the plaintiffs guaranteed it would perform ; that the <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>work of putting the same in place was done according to plans furnished by plaintiffs and under the direction of their agent; that such agent was not skilled in and did not understand the business of erecting and placing such machinery, or wholly neglected his duty, and when plaintiffs and their agent left the said machinery it wholly failed to perform the work as guaranteed, both by reason of defective machinery and defective placing and connecting of the same.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[267,743,1163,188]]]'>That the said machinery was not by the said plaintiffs in any way tested, except to attempt to and fail to make the same work as by the terms of the said contract it was agreed that it should work.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b280-5" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[263,951,1167,452]]]'>Deponent further saith that the one thousand dollars paid on account of said contract was paid when the material arrived at the premises at or near Kennerdell station in accordance with the terms of the contract, and long before the alleged completion of the work by the plaintiffs. That by reason of the improper placing and connecting of the said machinery under the direction of the plaintiffs and their agent, defendant was compelled to reset, rearrange and replace much of the machinery at great expense.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b280-6" data-blocks='[["BL_280.6",280,[257,1411,1168,658]]]'>That the said H. H. Lane was sent for by the defendant company as set forth in his affidavit, but he was requested to come only for the purpose of completing and finishing the work which the plaintiffs by their contract had agreed to do and perform, and not for the purpose of doing extra work, as alleged in his affidavit, and defendant never agreed to pay him for so coming or for any time of services rendered by him any sum whatever, and the extra plates furnished by plaintiffs and charged for by them were so furnished under and pursuant to their contract, and in place of other and defective or worthless plates theretofore furnished. That by reason of the failure of plaintiffs to complete their work according to the terms of their contract, they are not entitled to any interest.</p>

It was afterwards suggested by the court that, if the plaintiffs so desired, leave would be granted them to withdraw all the items of their claim except the 1st, 13th, 14th and 15th, and the rule for judgment would be made absolute for the amount of these excepted items, less payments made on account thereof. Acting upon this suggestion they withdrew the 2d to 12th items of claim, inclusive, and judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense was accordingly entered against the defendant for $2,154.26, the residue of said four excepted items.</p>
    <p id="b282-6" data-blocks='[["BL_282.8",282,[296,1259,1164,1205]]]'>The only question presented by the assignments of error is whether the court was right in thus adjudging the affidavits of defense insufficient to cany the case to the jury, on either of said excepted items of claim. The solution of that question depends on the averments of fact contained in the statement of claim and affidavits of defense respectively. As will be seen by reference to the former, the-plaintiffs base their claim on the contract, a copy of which is attached to and made part of their statement, coupled with an averment of performance thereof on their part. After referring to the agreement, its purpose, etc., they say: “That the said machinery, etc., was furnished as provided by the contract, and put in place in such a workmanlike manner as to do the work required in crushing, washing, drying and making the sand ready for the market. That not only the machinery, but also the labor required in placing the same, was of the best and in a workmanlike manner done, and was accepted by the managers of the said Penn Glass Sand Company after it had been properly tested by the plaintiffs. That thereupon the sum of $3,125 became due and owing plaintiffs, as is provided in said contract.” In immediate connection therewith, they admit payments on account amounting to $1,112.40, and as to the residue, $2,012.60, they aver that no part thereof has been paid, “ and no further offsets are due defendants.”</p>

      <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>It may be conceded that plaintiffs’ averments of performance, etc., of which the foregoing is the substance, would be sufficient to entitle them to judgment were it not for the fact — which seems to have been overlooked by the court below — that the defendant company in its affidavit of defense has so far substantially traversed and denied said averments as to put the plaintiffs to proof thereof before a jury. After enumerating in detail the things to be furnished by the plaintiffs, the contract specifically provides that “ the said machinery, etc., including, and intending to include, all things necessary and needful for the setting up and furnishing a complete apparatus for crushing, washing, conveying and drying sand to the full capacity herein guaranteed by the said first parties, the parties of the first part agree to furnish all the above machinery and send one man to put up in complete working order and start said machinery.
