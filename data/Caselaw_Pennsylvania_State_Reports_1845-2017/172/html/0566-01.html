This rule has been recognized and applied in many cases among which are Horner v. Watson, <a href="/pa/79/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="79 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="438392" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0242-01">79 Pa. 242</a>; Coleman et al. v. Chadwick, <a href="/pa/80/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="80 Pa. 81" data-case-ids="1042298" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0081-01">80 Pa. 81</a>; Carlin &amp; Co. v. Chappel, <a href="/pa/101/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="101 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="500877" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0348-01">101 Pa. 348</a>; Williams v. Hay, <a href="/pa/120/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="120 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="559838" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0485-01">120 Pa. 485</a>. This right to support may be released by apt words in a deed of conveyance; Scranton et al. v. Phillips et al., <a href="/pa/94/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="94 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="485657" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0015-01">94 Pa. 15</a>; but such release will not be implied from language that does not necessarily import it: Williams v. Hay, <a href="/pa/120/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="120 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="559838" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0485-01">supra.</a> The grant of a mineral estate, or of the right to mine, is a grant of the right to penetrate the earth in search of the mineral stratum, and when found to quarry and remove the mineral in a proper manner. Such injuries as are the necessary result of this process do not afford a cause of action to the owner of the surface. If his springs are drained or his well destroyed as the natural result of the excavation made to reach and remove the coal, he has no right to complain: Bainbridge on Mines, 483; Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Encyclopædia of Law, vol. 15, p. 588; Turner v. Reynolds, <a href="/pa/23/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="23 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="974001" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0199-01">23 Pa. 199</a>. But a sale of all the coal under a tract of land is not in terms or hy necessary implication a release of the right to <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>surface support any more than the sale of the first story of a building, two or more stories in height, would be a release of the floor so sold from its visible servitude to the remainder of the building. The release must be in either case by express words or by necessary implication. It is thought that this rule has been qualified in the late case of Sanderson v. The Coal Company, <a href="/pa/113/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="113 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="457611" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0126-01">113 Pa. 126</a>, but we do not so understand it.</p>
    <p id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[269,713,1174,1681]]]'>The question presented in that case was whether as between owners of land lying along a stream the owner of the upper tract may open mines upon his land when the drainage therefrom must necessarily pollute the stream and render it unfit for use by the lower owner. We held that the lower tract owed a servitude for purposes of drainage to the tract above it because of its position; and that while the owner of the upper tract was bound to the exercise of diligence in his effort so to use and develop his own land as not to injure that of his neighbor, still, if notwithstanding the exercise of reasonable care and precaution injury was unavoidable, such injury would not sustain an action for damages. Within the lines thus stated Sanderson v. The Coal Company is an authority. Under some circumstances a refusal to apply it might work a practical confiscation of the upper estate for the benefit of the lower, notwithstanding the natural servitude under which the lower is placed by its position. On the other hand to insist upon its application under all circumstances might result in a practical confiscation of the lower for the benefit of the upper. For myself I would permit no general rule of this sort to work confiscation in either case, but leave to a court of equity the adjustment of the terms and conditions on which each could use his own so as to inflict the least practicable injury on the other. This court however is not disposed at present to modify the rule of Sanderson’s case as it is stated above. That rule has no application to this case. Here it is the owner of the lower or servient tenement who invokes it to defeat a recovery by the owner of the surface which is the higher and dominant. The rule stated in Jones v. Wagner, <a href="/pa/66/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="66 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="432415" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0429-01">supra,</a> is that which controls this case. The surface is entitled to support unless its right thereto has been clearly released by the owner. The several assignments of error do not require a separate treatment. They are overruled and the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>
