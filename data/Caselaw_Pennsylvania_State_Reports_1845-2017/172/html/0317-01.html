The amounts reported by the petitioner fell considerably short of the sums he actually received and owed the county.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b338-8" data-blocks='[["BL_338.11",338,[241,1231,1164,1009]]]'>When the auditors, at their sitting in 1891, came to the work of auditing the petitioner’s accounts with the county for the preceding year, they were unable to obtain the tax lien book and treasurer’s sale book, for the reason that the treasurer then in office was preparing a large sale list and was constantly receiving moneys from delinquent taxpayers and could not, or at least he thought he could not, spare these books from his office. The petitioner reported to the auditors that he had taken in, during the year 1893, on the two accounts above mentioned, moneys aggregating $2,065.10. The auditors were unwilling to take his statement as conclusive, and by an arrangement with the county commissioners, and without consulting the petitioner, adjourned to meet at a time when the records mentioned could be secured from the treasurer’s office. Before adjourning, however, they prepared a report, in form complete and final, in which they included the above amounts given them by the treasurer. This report, although not intended to be final, was filed March 26, 1894, and being unappealed from, has the effect of a judgment, under the act of April 15, 1834.</p>

They sat from July 9th until August 3,1894, and the result of their investigations was three reports, in each of which they brought the petitioner in debt to the county. These reports were filed in the court of common pleas on September 3d of the same year. The report covering the last year of the petitioner’s term, and which, for reasons that appear further on, is the only one that need be considered at any length, shows that he still has in his hands moneys collected for and belonging to the county, amounting to $1,596.70. That this money, as well as the sums charged against him in the supplemental reports for the years 1891 and 1892, was received by the petitioner and never accounted for, is established by the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt. The proof is furnished by his own books, and cannot be controverted.</p>

After an examination which they now allege was incomplete, as they were unable to go over the tax lien and treasurer’s sale books thoroughly, they prepared, and on March 26, 1894, filed their report in the common pleas, charging the treasurer with a balance of $18,089.72. This report contained numerous items of charge for accounts realized from tax .liens and treasurer’s sales. No appeal was taken by the treasurer, and the balance found to be due by him was promptly paid. Without consulting the treasurer, and without notice to him, the auditors adjourned to meet at a time when they could have a better opportunity to examine the books. They met again on July 9, and at subsequent times, and reexamined the books, and on September 3 they filed their separate reports for the years 1891, 1892 and 1893, in each of which they charged the treasurer with an additional amount found to be due the county. The treasurer had no knowledge of any of these meetings until July 28, when he was notified to attend a meeting to be held on the 30th. He was present at this meeting and assisted in the examination of the accounts by producing his books and papers. The court directed the reports for 1891. and 1892 to be stricken from the records, but refused to make a similar order as to the report for 1893, holding it to be valid and binding.</p>

Yohe, <a href="/pa/24/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="24 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="9504459" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0305-01">supra,</a> it was said: “ It seems to be an obvious deduction that after the board of auditors have filed their report they have no further power over it.

The earlier meetings had been held without his knowledge. He attended the one meeting of which he had notice, and presented his books and papers, but he made no representation and did nothing indicating an intention to waive any right which he possessed.

In the opinion the present Chief Justice said: “Want of jurisdiction may be taken advantage of at any stage of the case.
