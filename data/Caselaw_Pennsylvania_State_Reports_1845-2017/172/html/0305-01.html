But, assuming for argument sake, that the action of the court was at least doubtful, the result is the same. As was said in Griffith v. Sitgreaves, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20378" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="81* Pa. 378">81* Pa. 378</a>, the act referred to “ was intended to reach only clear eases of error in law, and thus prevent the delay of a trial.” Much valuable time is lost and expense incurred in endeavoring to convict the court below of manifest error in cases where at <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>most there is merely a doubt as to the correctness of its decision.
