    <p class="summary" id="b227-6" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[158,570,1170,1220]]]'>The city of York is a municipal corporation. It is charged with the duty of maintaining the public highways within the city in such a condition of reasonable repair as will make them safe by day and by night for their ordinary use by those who have occasion to use them as highways. Its duty extends not only to the traveled portion of the street between the pavements, but to the sidewalks also. They have control over the height, the width, the slope, the grade, etc., of sidewalks, as well as of <em>streets; </em>and in exercising the powers and performing the duties which are imposed upon them in this behalf, as I said before, the measure of duty and the measure of responsibility is the maintaining of the highways, or preserving them in such a condition as to make them safe and convenient for ordinary use or travel by foot passengers.as well as drivers. I have already said that they have the power to control absolutely the grades, and the slopes, and the heights, and to exercise all these powers within the city of York to which the township of Springgarden is contiguous. Then, in our view of the law, the city legally exercised its powers through its duly authorized officials — by the supervisors or commissioners, whichever they are — highway commissioners, I believe they are called — by absolutely controlling the grade at this particular point, and making the same eighteen, nineteen or twenty inches above the grade of the sidewalk in the adjoining township of Springgarden.</p>

They were not bound by any rule or principle of law to adopt the grade that existed in Springgarden township, or to maintain the previously existing grade. It was a matter within the power and within the dis cretion of the city, so far as to determine what that grade should be; and they did determine on grades eighteen or twenty inches above the grade, as I have said already, of the adjoining township ; and the pavement was laid under the orders of competent city authorities to the grade given by the city surveyor. This made an offset, as has been repeated very often in this case— a difference of elevation of about eighteen or twenty inches, so that anybody going east on that sidewalk must step down, when <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>he reached that place, or go down eighteen or twenty inches to continue his walk.</p>

Then the city caused to be constructed and placed there an inclined plane of timber, stated in the testimony as between five and six feet in length, and four or five feet in width, — about the width or a little wider than the brick portion of the sidewalk, — supporting one end of that with the plank that held up the bank and the upper pavement, and with the other end resting on the pavement below, with strips nailed across to prevent people from falling as they went down that slope; and thus left it after that had been done. That was the city’s method of protecting this otherwise very dangerous place ; — this place which probably, — certainly, according to the statements of some of the witnesses that testified very positively on that subject, — this place which probably <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>at least remained dangerous, notwithstanding that method of protection adopted by the city.</p>

It “owes a duty of active vigilance to the public in respect to the condition of highways under its control,” which binds it “ to discover any defects therein within a reasonable time though those defects are caused by the negligence and acts of others. For practical purposes, the opportunity of knowing, in such cases, must stand for actual knowledge; and, therefore, where open defects in a highway have existed for a considerable time, notice of them is implied, and is imputed to those whose duty it is to repair them; in other words, they are presumed to have notice of such defects as they might have discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence. Such notice may be imputed also where a defect, though temporary, has been of frequent occurrence during a long period.” I have readfrom Shearman &amp; Redfield on the Law of Negligence, section 369.</p>

But the Supreme Court said no; the obstruction was not so patent, and so open to observation, or so apparent, that it was good law, or law, for the court to tell the jury that that failure to discover and remove within that two or three weeks was negligence ; and that it should have been left to the jury to determine, under all the circumstances, — considering the nature and character of the obstruction, — to determine whether the city had constructive notice or not. So here, there is testimony,— adding undoubtedly to the danger of this place, if not creating it, — of the projection of a board two inches above the pave ment, which the city was bound to discover and remedy in the exercise of vigilance which they are required to exercise to <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>maintain, the corporation <em>highways; </em>and they were bound to discover that, if it had remained there long enough to affect them with constructive notice, — and, if so, they are chargeable with constructive notice in not discovering it.

If John Campbell knew that that inclined plane was not along there when he undertook to pass over it, and met with this accident,— if he knew that the projection of that board above the pavement existed there, or had been there when he passed over it safely before, — if he knew of the change which had taken place making the place more dangerous than it was when he passed over it before, he had no right to take the risk, and test this dangerous place, and then undertake to hold the city responsible for the consequences of their negligence, and his negligence contributed to the production of the accident.

For notwithstanding that inclined platform being there, and independently of its removal, and independently of the projecting plank, if that place was known to be a dangerous place to walk on, — if it was still unsafe, — if it was still unsafe for a man to travel at night, — and John Campbell knew it, and voluntarily took the risk, he cannot recover in this case; for that would be contributory negligence.</p>

      <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>Now, I am desirous of making myself perfectly plain in regard to this most important part of the case — and perhaps the most important throughout the consideration of this case, — the question as to the knowledge by this man of the dangerous character of this place, — and that involves whether it was a dangerous place; — and that involves the further inquiry as to what that danger consisted of. Did it consist of, or include that change of grade there, whether the sloping platform was there or not, or whether the danger arising by the abrupt change of that grade was sufficiently protected by the sloping platform; and did the increased danger, of which he knew nothing, according to his statement, arise from the removal of the platform, or incline, by the negligence of the city; or did the danger arise from the projection of that plank; and had the city notice, constructive or otherwise, of that? If they had not, they are not chargeable for that on the ground of negligence. If Campbell had knowledge of the way, and voluntarily tested it, he was guilty of contributory negligence, and cannot recover in this case. Apart from the mere use of the highway, the considerations which I have already detailed to you may of themselves be contributory negligence.</p>

Negligence in any case is the absence of proper care under the circumstances. The degree of care which everybody must take depends upon the circumstances of the particular case; and there is no unvarying rule that can be laid down. You cannot draw a line, and say everything on this side is negligence, and everything on that side is diligence; because the circumstances are not the same in each particular case; — and so we are to consider all the facts in this particular case. This was a highway with an abrupt descent in it; and that at least was known to this plaintiff. He has said so. But independent of any other consideration, with the platform, or without, as has been asserted by one or two witnesses, — and it is a question of fact for you to determine, —knowing the condition of things there, at least to the extent of this abrupt change of grade, — whether he knew of the removal of the platform or not is another matter, about which I will speak to you presently, — he passed along that sidewalk at <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>a rapid pace, three or four miles an hour, with his hands in his overcoat pockets, on a very dark night. Now, the more dangerous the place, the larger measure of care was he bound to exercise to the extent of his knowledge of the existing danger. The darker the night, undoubtedly the more care was he bound to exercise; — for the man who uses a highway in broad daylight, and walks over an obstruction which is patent to him, and which by due diligence he could see, even if he did not, cannot hold the corporation for that obstruction. A man who walks through a street at night is bound to exercise more vigilance than the man who walks through there in the day. But the darker the night, the more the vigilance; and the absence of a light increases the degree which is required. Did this man exercise all due diligence which a man of ordinary prudence under the circumstances of the case, — the darkness of the night; the knowledge of the abrupt descent there, — did he exercise all due and ordinary diligence, — all due diligence which a man of ordinary prudence under those circumstances would exercise ? If he did not, he is guilty of contributory negligence, and cannot recover.</p>

I do not think I can enlighten you any further in regard to that. Now, then, as it seems to me, as far as we have gone, the controlling questions in this case are, What was the proximate cause of this accident? Did the accident result solely and only from the change of grade there, without any regard to the question of the presence or absence of the platform? Did it result from a projecting board, aided by the other cause ? <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>The city undoubtedly had knowledge of the change of grade.

This platform, after having been maintained there a good while, was removed by Mr. Kaltreider, who threw it over into a field. A policeman came there, and the testimony of that policeman reveals the presence, and the taking away of the plank. It is clearly revealed in the evidence, that a policeman of the city of York came there and replaced the platform; and again it was thrown over into the field by Mr. Kaltreider. How long before this accident occurred that replacing and removal took place, is not revealed in the evidence; but the entire time during which the platform was lying over in the field was stated by the witnesses. The lowest period was six weeks, and the highest was three months. Did the city use due diligence in this particular? Did it provide for the replacing of the platform, or adequate means to protect the way, or use due diligence in maintaining it there ? — are two material questions. Although if it be true that the platform remained away from there even during the shorter period in evidence, providing no protection to the .people by that or other means, it was undoubtedly negligence of the city; for a patent defect of the highway like that would affect it with constructive notice in a much less period than six weeks.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b238-6" data-blocks='[["BL_238.6",238,[243,939,1167,1214]]]'>But you must not misunderstand the testimony. The Car-lisle tables are based upon the mortality experience of insurance companies. Of course the insurance companies have gathered together a vast amount of statistics from which they are able to ascertain the average expectancy of life at any particular period; and of course those tables are based upon the selected lives, — for people are only insured by life insurance companies after having passed a medical examination insuring good health. At forty-seven the expectancy of life is twenty-three years. That does not mean to say that a man at forty-seven is going to live twenty-three years. He may die the next day; he may live to be ninety. It simply means that of people, aged forty-seven, the average existence of their lives will be about that. If there is a class of one hundred thousand living at forty-seven years, the average life of those whole one hundred thousand will be twenty-three years. Of course the duration of any particular life, such as this, cannot be predicted; and of course it depends largely upon the condition of health, —the physical condition of the man; — and depends largely upon the acts and conduct, and the liability to contract disease, and matters of that sort. I say this because I do not want you to assume that because the expectancy of life at forty-seven years is twenty-three years, that this man will live twenty-three years. He may live twice that; he may die to-morrow.] [1]</p>

    <p id="b241-6" data-blocks='[["BL_241.7",241,[167,1175,1171,1168]]]'>The negligence of the city in the construction and maintenance of the sidewalk in question is obvious and undisputed, and it is established by the verdict of the jury that this negligence was the sole cause of the injury complained of. The city appears to have conceded its own negligence in the premises and to have based its defence on the alleged contributory negligence of the plaintiff. The questions raised by this defence and all the evidence relating to it were carefully presented to the jury for their consideration, with the repeated instruction that if there was any negligence on the part of the plaintiff which contributed in the slightest degree to the accident, he could not maintain the suit. The city has no cause to complain of the instructions on this branch of the case, as it is clear that the court would not have been justified in ruling that there was contributory negligence which precluded a recovery. The evidence tending to show the plaintiff’s knowledge of the condition of the sidewalk, his manner of passing over it on the night of the accident, and his acquaintance with other streets and sidewalks in the neighborhood of it, were for the jury. From this evidence they found that his case was clear of contributory negligence. It cannot be justly said of the evidence that the weight of it is against the verdict or that it warrants a legal conclusion destructive of the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
    <p id="b241-7" data-blocks='[["BL_241.8",241,[216,2350,1122,42]],["BL_242.1",242,[257,359,1169,1067]]]'>The sidewalk, from the time of its construction until and <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>subsequent to the occurrence in question, was unsafe, and it exposed to casualities, like the one under consideration, all persons having occasion to pass over it at night. The municipal authorities were cognizant of its condition and the risks involved in traveling upon it, but they declined when requested, to incur the expenditure required to render it reasonably safe for public use. It is difficult to imagine a more flagrant disregard of official duty than was shown in this case by the representatives of the city who were charged with the supervision and care of its streets. There is some evidence which indicates that they supposed the sidewalk at the east end of it was in the township of Spring Garden, but as the evidence is clear and uncontradicted that it was constructed by, and within the limits of, the city there was no warrant for their supposition. It being established by a verdict supported by competent and sufficient testimony that the sidewalk at the point where the accident occurred was defective and dangerous, that it was known to the municipal authorities to be so, and that their negligence in the construction and maintenance of it was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury, a particular specification of its defects seems to be unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[257,1435,1170,555]]]'>The city’s contention based on the second specification of error is without merit because it was not shown by either party that there was any change in the condition of the sidewalk from the time of its construction until sometime after the accident, except such as was made by the board bridge at the east end of it, or was the natural sequence of the manner of constructing it. The testimony of the plaintiff explanatory of his fall is consistent with the testimony descriptive oi ¿he condition of the sidewalk anterior to it, and the question whether the city had notice of the latter before the occurrence of the former was for the jury upon all the evidence in the case pertinent to it.</p>
