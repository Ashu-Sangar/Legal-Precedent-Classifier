It was constructed by the borough in pursuance of the petition of the property holders, and paid for by assessments under the borough law. Two or three years afterwards the borough adopted a general sewerage system and constructed another sewer on that street, which rendered the first sewer useless. The plaintiffs would have to pay their share of the expense of the new sewer, in the way of taxes, as the general system was at the public expense. The plaintiffs petitioned the borough council to have refunded to them the whole, or part, of what they had paid for the first sewer, alleging it was unjust and inequitable to do away with that sewer and compel them to pay for another which was not necessary and of no advantage to them.</p>
