Bigger and P. H. Stevenson, in the sum of $1,657.81. The judgment was regularly revived from time to time, the last revival being on June 3, 1892, for $5,073.17. P. H. Stevenson died on November 28, 1893. The evidence showed that he had never been a resident of Beaver county, but that he had lived all his life in Allegheny county, where lie owned valuable real estate, and that he had always been possessed of means amply sufficient to pay the judgment. Twenty-five witnesses were examined as to the genuineness of the signature. Twenty testified that in their opinion the signature of Stevenson appended to the note was not genuine. Five testified that in their opinion it was in the handwriting of P. H. Stevenson.</p>

Stevenson, deceased, and permitting his personal representatives to make defense to the judgment.” An examination of the testimony that was introduced in support of the petition to open the judgment etc. has satisfied us that it was quite sufficient to justify the action complained of. Discussion of the testimony, as the case now stands, is neither <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>necessary nor desirable. It is enough to say that it is quite sufficient to justify the court in opening the judgment and sending the case to a jury.</p>
