The testimony as to his actually taking possession of the well is so positive, and proved by so many witnesses, and really disproved by none, that it must be assumed as an established fact. T. D.

    <p id="b604-5" data-blocks='[["BL_604.4",604,[260,895,1169,1521]]]'>The assertion made in the appellee’s counter statement that there were two separate companies, one called Liberty Oil-Company and the other called Liberty Oil Company, Limited, and that the well in question was a different well from the one claimed by the Liberty Oil Company, Limited, is entirely unsupported by any testimony and is manifestly incorrect. The whole of the testimony shows beyond all question that there was but one well about which there was controversy, and that is the very well which was actually taken possession of by Mr. Friend as receiver of the Liberty Oil Company, Limited. It was the oil from that well that was in dispute, and of that well the plaintiff did not have possession in any sense at any time after the receiver took possession. The plaintiff was examined in his own behalf and he states nothing in contravention of this. He does not pretend to say that he had any kind of possession of the well or that he had anything to do with running it. He said he had bought on December 9, 1891, a part of the interest of A. A. Welsh in the well, which gave him a sixteenth interest. The other interests were owned by the other persons named in the testimony, all of whom who testified, including the president, said that the company was the Liberty Oil Company, Limited, and that the possession was delivered to the receiver in January, 1892. Nor does the testimony of the plaintiff’s witness A. A. Welsh at all affect the situation. He says he was in possession up to December 22 or 23, when he left and did not return. He says he left Vezie in possession about December 24. But he makes no pretense of saying that the well in controversy was not the well of which the receiver took possession, or that there was any other well than this particu lar one whose oil product was in dispute</p>

L. 268, gave a special remedy by replevin.</p>
    <p id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.4",605,[131,767,1174,1628]]]'>In Mather v. Trinity Church, 3 S. &amp; R. 509, Tilghman, J., said, “I understand the substance of the charge to be, that although the jury should be of opinion that the defendant had the exclusive and adverse possesssion of the land from which the stones were taken, for any time less than twenty-one years, yet the plaintiff might recover in this action of trover. This is not the proper form of action in which to try the title of land, nor have I been able to find any case where it has been sustained for that purpose. . . . Neither do I find any case where trover has been supported when the possession of the land was held adversely to the plaintiff. . . . That the law draws possession to the property, of personal chattels unconnected with the land, may be true, and yet it does not follow that the possession is drawn in like manner to the property of that kind of chattel which was part of the soil until severed from it, when the soil itself at the moment of severance, was held by another. I should rather suppose that in such case he who had possession of the land had possession also of the stones dug from it, and against him another who had the right to the possession of the land could not support trover. He certainly could not support trespass. But he would not be without remedy, for he might first recover the possession by ejectment, and then recover the mesne profits in an action of trespass.” In Baker v. Howell, 6 S. &amp; R. 476, the action was assumpsit for money had and received. The defendant had taken certain sand from certain premises and sold it. The plaintiff claimed title to the premises from which the same was taken, and the action was brought to recover the proceeds of the sale of the sand. It was held that an action of assumpsit would not lie, as it involved conflicting titles to land. There are many other cases to the same effect: Brown v. Caldwell, 10 S. &amp; R. 114; Lewis v. Robinson, <a href="/watts/10/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="10 Watts 338" data-case-ids="1850946" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0338-01">10 Watts, </a><em><a href="/watts/10/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="10 Watts 338" data-case-ids="1850946" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0338-01">338</a>; </em>Lehman v.

      <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>The learned court below conceded the correctness of the foregoing proposition, and as there was no real conflict as to the actual possession of the well we think the first point of the defendant should have been affirmed. But the court adopted a theory that the defendant was still the agent of the plaintiff for the purpose of carrying the oil to its lines or tanks, and therefore the possession of the receiver was not the exclusive possession of the well. We are unable to agree to this theory, (1) because we cannot discover any evidence of the fact that the defendant had any pipe line upon the premises for the purpose of canying the oil from the wells to its own lines, (2) because if the fact were so, we cannot regard the defendant as anything more than a common carrier, bound to receive and transport for all persons alike all goods intrusted to its care. Such carriers are not in any sense to be deemed as agents for the pei'sons committing goods to their care, and with power either to affect their rights by acts or declarations or to conserve the litigated claims or rights of their customers as between them ’and other persons. When the defendant received notice of the change of possession of the well from the receiver, they were obliged to consider their own position and liability in the premises, and if they were then receiving the oil which they originally received from the plaintiff, but now received from another person clothed with legal control over the oil, by reason of ownership changed by act of the law, they were not at liberty to disregard the notice. No theory of a prior agency and consequent liability to the original consignor, would suffice to relieve them of their liability to the present consignor. The question therefore recurs who was in possession of the oil as it was then being delivered to the defendant, and that is an independent question to be decided upon its own merits. As we regard the merits of that question they are all with the defendant, and the court should have delivered a binding instruction to the jury to find for the defendant. The assignments of error are all sustained.</p>
