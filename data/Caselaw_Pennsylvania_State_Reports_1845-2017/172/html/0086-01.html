The residue of the ground, <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>that mentioned in the claim filed by the plaintiff in this case, was used by said congregation as a burial ground, in which they interred the dead of said congregation and their relatives and others, from about the time the land was acquired or soon thereafter until about 1859, and the available space therein was principally occupied by the graves of those buried therein, and has been since then used and occupied exclusively for that purpose of sepulture, except the triangular piece at the northern end.

The present chief justice, delivering the opinion, said, “ The constitutional exemption relates to taxes proper, or general public contributions, levied and collected by the state, or by its authorized municipal agencies for general government purposes, as distinguished from peculiar forms of taxation or special assessments imposed upon property, within limited areas, for the payment of local improvements therein, by which the property assessed is specially and peculiarly benefited and enhanced in value to an amount at least equal to the assessment. There is such an obvious distinction between all forms of general taxation and this species of local or special taxation that we cannot think the latter was intended to be within the constitutional exemption.” It is not necessary to repeat the reasoning of the opinion as it is of such recent date. As graveyards are in the same category with churches in the exempting clause of the constitution, the same reasoning applies to both. We consider that the case cited, and the other cases quoted in the opinion above referred to, control the present case, and we are therefore obliged to reverse the judgment rendered by the court below.</p>
