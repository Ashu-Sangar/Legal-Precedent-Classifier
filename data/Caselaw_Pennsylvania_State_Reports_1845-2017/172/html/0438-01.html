Plaintiff also states that said defendant mined out the coal underlying said surface and took away the natural support thereof and allowed the same to be and remain without support, either natural or artificial, whereby the plaintiff’s said surface has been caused to settle and crack, taking away and destroying the said well and three springs and leaving the said surface destitute of the water which is necessary thereon for domestic and grazing purposes, and rendering said surface unsafe for grazing purposes ; and injuring and damaging said surface for agricultural and any other purposes for which the same is available.
