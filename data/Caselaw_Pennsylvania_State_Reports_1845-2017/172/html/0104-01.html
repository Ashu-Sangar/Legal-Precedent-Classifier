But is it void?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b127-4" data-blocks='[["BL_127.4",127,[105,633,1179,1730]]]'>At the date when this agreement was entered into there were but six persons (under the terms of the testator’s will) interested in the plantation which was to be sold or in the proceeds of the sale thereof — the widow and the five children then surviving. Those of George Ralston’s children who were to take under his will were those only who survived his widow. The five children then still living had an equitable contingent interest in the proceeds of the sale of the land, the three that wrere dead left no interest therein which descended to their heirs at law. Their death took them out of the class that were to be benefited by this clause of the testator’s will. Each of the five children who were still living had an equal interest in the others which could only be defeated by death. But would they all live longer than their mother, and if not, who should die before her and who should survive her were questions they could not answer. With each one the question was, shall my interest be increased by the death of one or more of the others before my mother die, or shall I die before her and the others survive and my children be left without an inheritance. I give my chance of having my share increased by the death of one of the others for the assured fact that my children will get my one fifth, if I die before my mother. This evidently was the thought of each and led to mutual family agreement of January 1, 1868, and was a sufficient consideration to support such an agreement. [The agreement has all the requisites of a valid family agreement. It tended to promote peace and harmony among the five children and their issue; it was made with a full understanding of all the facts and by all the parties equitably interested, and upon a sufficient consideration.] (2) It settled the question of the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate after the death of the widow, which at the date of the agreement was in doubt because it could not be foretold whether all five of the children would survive the widow or not, and if not, who would and who would not.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[158,2376,1120,42]],["BL_128.1",128,[276,384,1167,1478]]]'>But it is said that all the children of George Ralston, Sr., <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>who died before the date of the agreement, to wit: January 1, 1868, did not die intestate, unmarried and without issue. A son and daughter, it is admitted, did so die, but James left a widow and one son, who both died intestate and without issue before the widow, but who were living at the date of the agreement. From this it is argued that the agreement is invalid for want of the necessary parties. It is said that at that time this widow and son of James had an interest in the estate under the intestate laws, and that if all five of the children of George Ralston, Sr., then alive should have died before the widow, that the proceeds of this farm would have been distributed under the intestate laws. Granting this to be true, the agreement entered into by the children then living in no way deprived the widow and child of the deceased, son of the testator of their rights. For, without an agreement by and between the five children, this widow and child were entitled to nothing out of the proceeds of the plantation if any of the five survived. The effect of the agreement was simply to strike out of the will the clause of survivorship, and the widow and child of the deceased son of the testator surely had no interests that would be sub-served by allowing that clause in the will to remain. The two words in the testator’s will, to wit: “then living,” which the agreement sought to strike out of it were the very words that deprived the widow and child of the deceased son of any interest in the proceeds now for distribution; and how the except-ants, either as sons of Ralph Ralston, deceased, or as the owners by purchase of the interests of Mrs. Meloy, Mrs. George and John O. Ralston, Sr., can complain of the auditor’s finding that this was a valid family agreement, I cannot see.</p>

That on January 1, 1868, three of the children of the testator having died, the five surviving children at that date were all the persons who had any interest in the question of distribution after the death of the widow, and that the widow and child of the deceased son, James Ralston, had no such interest in the subject-matter of the agreement of that date as to make them necessary parties thereto.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b129-4" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[120,710,1166,1277]]]'>4. [That the agreement of January 1, 1868, is a valid family arrangement that in equity should be enforced in the distribution of the funds now being made, and that the exceptants were awarded by the auditor all they are entitled to under said agreement, and that they have no standing to object to the distribution made except so far as it affects their own interest. One son and one daughter of George Ralston, Sr., had died before the date of the agreement, unmarried and without issue, and of course the agreement could not in any way be construed as relating to them. James, another son, was also dead at that time, but left to survive him a son, and granting, as contended by exceptants, that the agreement of the five surviving children contemplated a participation of that child in the distribution of the fund at the death of the widow with the children of any of the five that might die, still we do not see how the exceptants can complain that this child’s heirs, if it had any, were not recognized by the auditor, when they received all they were entitled to. It appears that three of the children of George Ralston, Sr., died before January 1, 1868, and that the widow and son of one of them died before the widow, Isabella Ralston, and it must be presumed, in the absence of testimony to the contrary, that any interest that would have vested in them under the terms of the agreement or otherwise, was at the date of the distribution lapsed, or was included in the five interests that the auditor recognized in the distribution.] [3]</p>
