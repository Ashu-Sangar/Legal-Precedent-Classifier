      <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>On May 7,1883, plaintiff took a judgment note from the firm of “Royal Flint Glass Works.” The note was signed “Royal Flint Glass Works, J. Elsoffer, Treasurer, William McKibben, President.” Henry Wagner was one of the partners. On February 4,1892, the note together with a declaration setting forth the names of the partners was filed in the common pleas, and judgment entered under the warrant. Henry Wagner, one of the partners, petitioned to have the judgment stricken off as to him, but his rule was discharged. The court subsequently opened the judgment to allow Wagner to defend on the sole ground that he had not authorized the note or assented to it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b91-4" data-blocks='[["BL_91.4",91,[186,916,703,42]]]'>The court charged in part as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b91-5" data-blocks='[["BL_91.5",91,[144,967,1170,764]]]'>Now, gentlemen, if there were nothing more than the signatures of Elsoffer and McKibben to this note the defendant here would not be liable, because it is a well-known rule of law, well established, that no partner, whether he is acting as business manager, secretary, treasurer or president of the partnership concern, has an implied authority to bind the partners by confessing judgment against them. He may have authority to give notes — common promissory notes — to draw checks, drafts and bills, and accept the same; he may have authority to make all needful contracts of the business, but this authority to confess judgment against his partners can only be obtained by some special understanding or agreement or authorization between him and his copartners. It may, however, result from a ratification of what he does later, and I shall speak more fully in regard to this matter presently.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b91-6" data-blocks='[["BL_91.6",91,[139,1739,1174,659]],["BL_92.1",92,[263,353,1172,973]]]'>■ As I said before, there is no implied authority on the part of one partner to bind another by confessing a judgment against him, or giving an instrument containing a warrant of attorney which will result or may result in the confession of judgment. A judgment entered on such an instrument is binding upon the partner who gives it, upon his individual property; it is binding on the assets of the partnership; that is, the partnership property which can be taken in execution may be so taken and sold. [And, gejntlemen, it is binding on each and every partner who does not sign it, but who agrees to the giving of the note; who authorizes it, who directs and permits the note to be given, whether his name is attached to it or not.] [3] [If a partner, who fails to sign, authorizes the giving of the note, judgment <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>may be confessed against him on the note individually after-wards, when the note is filed in the prothonotary’s office; that is sufficient authority in Pennsylvania.] [4] [And, furthermore, even if he knows nothing at all of the giving of the note at the time it is given, has not authorized or consented to it in any way, if afterwards he ratifies or approves the note, <em>knowing </em>it to be a judgment note, agrees to pay it or in any other way ratifies the act of the partner or partners who have given the instrument, he is fully bound thereby, and he is liable to pay it out of his individual estate as well as out of his share of the partnership assets.] [5] Gentlemen, you will see that a judgment note, where a just debt is due, is merely a short cut given the creditor to collect on his claim, together with certain advantages that usually follow in the way of waivers. In the present case, as I said before, a suit could have been-brought against Wagner and each and every partner, and judgment could have been obtained because the debt is not denied, and the property of each individual member of the partnership could have been levied upon and sold, if they had any property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[259,1334,1174,810]]]'>But in this case, it is alleged, instead of bringing suit, the plaintiff, William Miller, secured a judgment note from two of the partners, the third, who is here concerned, Henry Wagner, not consenting thereto and not afterwards ratifying the act of the partners who gave that judgment note. The issue before you now, gentlemen, is (whether it is formally made up on the record or not I do not know, but that, if necessary, can be done hereafter) did the defendant, Henry Wagner, either authorize the giving of this judgment note when it was given, or before it was given, or did he afterwards, knowing that this judgment note had been given — this note here in suit- — ratify the act of his partners — approve it, in giving the instrument? If he did either of these things he is liable and you should find in favor of the plaintiff in the issue which we are trying. If you find that he did neither of these <em>things then </em>you should say you find for the defendant in the issue joined.</p>

He admits that he heard of it later; that he knew a judgment note had been given. But the plaintiff alleges, and offered evidence here to that effect, that afterwards there was a conversation between the defendant and John Miller, the plaintiff’s agent and bookkeeper, wherein the defendant ratified and approved the conduct of his partners in giving this note; that he agreed to pay it in part at least. [Well, gentlemen, if he agreed to pay it, or to pay his pro rata share, or any other share thereof, of the note as a note, that would be an admission that the note was binding upon him. It would be in the nature of an admission that his partners had authority to give the note; it would be his duty, of course, if the discussion turned on this note, or if he was asked to pay it, to deny any liability on the note as such.] [6] Now, he says that he did not admit his liability on the note; that he admitted he was liable for his pro rata share of the indebtedness due William Miller. John Miller says that the note was talked about. The defendant used the word note, perhaps, once or twice in his testimony in speaking of this matter, but the general effect of his whole testimony is that he only admitted the indebtedness; he says he did not know the amount of the indebtedness even at that time, and that he agreed to pay his share of that indebtedness. Gentlemen, you must determine who is telling the truth here, whether John Miller or the defendant. [If the defendant admitted his liability on this note — if he, knowing the judgment note had been given by his partner or partners, agreed to pay that note in whole or in part, then the, plaintiff is entitled to your verdict;] [7] otherwise the defendant is entitled to the verdict, unless he authorized the giving of the note at the'time it was given.</p>

He further instructed the jury that although appellant did not know of the giving of the note at the time, yet if he subsequently assented to and ratified it, he would be equally bound. In this there was no error. There was a conflict of testimony as to the principal act of ratification alleged, the appellant claiming that he had only agreed to pay his pro rata share of the debt, while the plaintiff testified that the agreement was to pay his share of the note. The learned judge called the attention of the jury specifically and clearly to this difference, and left it to them to say which was the truth. He could not have done otherwise. Appellant’s promise to pay his part of the note if the jury found that such was his promise, was certainly evidence of knowledge of its existence and its nature, and of assent to it in the form in which it stood.
