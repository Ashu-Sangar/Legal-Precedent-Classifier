Since 1865 Gallitzin township was formed out of parts of Allegheny township and Washington township, and the lands are in Gallitzin township. J. M. Christy died June 27, 1882. J. M.

No conveyance was made by George and Bernard Delaney to any one for the 103 acres and 27 perches, until March 21, 1881, when they conveyed this land to J. M.

It was agreed by the purchaser that the deeds should be made to Samuel M.

M. Christy for the purchase of said lands, and the purchase money paid.to George and Bernard Delaney was paid by J. M. Christy, in the opinion of the master, out of this money. There is some evidence that there was some money in the hands of Christy belonging to his wife Rebecca A. Christy, and it is urged by defendants that that money was used for the purpose of buying the particular tract in question, but in the opinion of the master it is not strong enough to raise that presumption, and he is of the opinion from the evidence as a whole that the purchase money paid by J. M. Christy to the Delaneys was out of the funds in his hands belonging to the Allegheny Mountain Coal <em>&amp; </em>Lumber Company as they styled themselves. The deeds for the several tracts purchased by J. M. Christy for the company were prepared by Mr. Pershing, including the one in question, in all of which the name of Samuel M. Kier was inserted as the grantee excepting the deed from Bernard and George Delaney. By an oversight of some one preparing the deed under Mr. Pershing the name of the grantee was not inserted. The deed without the name of a grantee was acknowledged by the grantors George and Bernard Delaney and delivered to the agent of Samuel M. Kier, and placed on record by him in the recorder’s office of Cambria county November 8,1866. The said deed was dated July 26, 1865, and contained as recorded the following receipts : “ Received the day of the date of the above indenture <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>of the above name Samuel M. Kier the sum of $2500, lawful money of the United States being the consideration money above mention in full.” (Signed) George Delaney for Bernard Delaney. Witness Samuel Craig. The said company paid the taxes regularly on the tract in question until the same was sold under a decree in equity of the court of common pleas of Cam bria, and since that time by the subsequent holders of title. The land having been assessed in the name of Samuel M. Kier. That Samuel M. Kier having died, a suit in equity was instituted wherein J. W. F. White was plaintiff and 1. C. Pershing et al. were defendants. The said defendant, as well as the plaintiff, being entitled to the interest in said land as beneficiaries of the title held in the name of Samuel M. Kier. A decree was made in said case June 8, 1881, for the sale of said lands. John W. White, being appointed by the court to sell the same, and under said order a sale was made to James L. Reed by the trustee, which was confirmed and a deed was duly executed to him. The said J. L. Reed sold and conve3red the said lands to S. C. Baker by deed dated November 23, 1881, and the said S. C. Baker sold and conveyed the same to the Altoona Coal &amp; Lumber Company, the plaintiff in this action, by deed dated November 23, 1881. J. M. Christy on the 26th day of March, 1881, obtained from Bernard and George Delaney a deed for the land in question without any further or other consideration than that paid for the deed intended to be made to Samuel M. Kier. The said deed was obtained from the Delaneys upon the representation of J. M. Christy that the former deed made by them was lost and could not be found, stating to them that the land was his. The Delaneys first objected in making such deed, but after consulting counsel concluded to do so, but accepting no consideration for the second deed. The original deed made by George and Bernard Delaney had a consideration of $2,500 (in writing), but the testimony shows but $1,339 was paid for the same. F. N. Burk, one of the defendants to this action, by deed dated February 10, 1882, purchased from J. M. Christy an undivided half interest of the land in question after the death of Josiah M. Christy. His heirs and F. N. Burk, the defendants in this ease, brought an action of trespass quare clausum fregit against S. C. Baker in the common pleas of this county on December 9, 1882, to <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>recover damages for an alleged trespass on the tract of land in question, and in which the question of whose money went into the land in question was raised on a defense founded on a deed to — intended to be S. M. Kier, and the jury found in favor of S. C. Baker and a judgment entered on a verdict. From the above facts warranted by the evidence and the evidence as a whole the master is of the opinion that the prayer of the complainant should be granted, a,nd suggests respectfully that a decree be made by your honorable court in conformity with the bill directing the Delaneys to execute a deed to the Altoona Coal &amp; Coke Co., and that F. N. Burk and the Christy heirs be directed to deliver up their deed from the Delaneys to be canceled.</p>

The purchasers did not agree that the deeds for said lands, not including the Delaney, should be made to S. M. Kier.

Christy, nor with the <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>consent of said Christy.

Kier, one of their number, and intending to be incorporated as the Allegheny Mountain Coal &amp; Lumber Co., and then have the tracts conveyed from S. M. Kier to the corporation.” This finding is not borne out by the evidence but is contradicted by it. The Delaneys knew no one in the transaction but J. M. Christy, and his own check paid the money for the land. And in this connection it is proper to object to the reception of the evidence of Hon. C. L. Pershing in this case without his personal presence before the master. And more so because J. M. Christy was dead when this hearing was held. The master <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>again erred in this part of his report in finding that the money paid for the Delaney land was furnished by the Pittsburg parties.</p>

Nor can there be any doubt that their money paid for the laud. There is no evidence to sustain the claim of the defendants that it was paid with funds of either Christy or his wife. If it had been his wife’s money,- why take the deed of 1881 to himself ? If all the participants in the transaction assented to making the deed witli the vendee’s name in blank, upon the understanding that the corporation name or that of a trustee should be thereafter inserted, how can Christy, the agent of the purchasers, take advantage of the arrangement to secure to himself the title ? If, on the other hand, the omission occurred through mere accident or mistake, as stated by. Judge Pershing, Christy was in no better position to take the title for which his principals had paid. As to the claim that he was to be paid at the rate of $20.00 per acre for the sales negotiated by him, it is enough to say the burden of making out such claim is on the defendants ; but as the controlling question in this case is, whether he bought <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>the 103 acres in suit for the Pittsburg parties as their agent and paid therefor with their money, it is a matter of indifference what his compensation was to be.</p>

If it had been a sale to his wife or himself, as is claimed by the defendants, would he not have kept it? It was taken by Mr. Barrett, the ageart of the Pittsburg parties, with other deeds belonging to thean, to the recorder’s office and placed on record. After it was recorded, it was lifted by Mr. Martin, one of the Pittsburg parties, and the recorder’s fees paid by him. The receipt iai the deed, for the purchase money, is to Kier, and not to Chaisty or his wife. In 1869 Chilsty brought suit against the “ Allegheny Mt. Coal Co.,” being this same Pittsburg party, to recover compensation for land purchases negotiated by hian for them, and in his declaration enumerates the tract of land iar suit as one of those bought for them. In his amended declaration he mentions it again as one of the tracts purchased by him for the defendaaits, saying, he “pa’ocured for said defendants a good title therefor by the deed of conveyance of the former owners of the same, duly delivered to said parties.” After the sale of 1865 the land was assessed in the name of Kier. Bernard Delaney, one of the vendors, says he understood Christy was buying for the “ coal company, and that the deed of 1881 was to be a new one in place of that of 1865, which Christy said had been lost.” It was not understood as a new purchase. The consideration mentioned in each deed is $1,339, and not a cent was paid in 1881 for the second conveyance. The <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>theory of the plaintiff seems, therefore, to be fully sustained by the evidence, and the report of the examiner and master is confirmed and the exceptions thereto overruled.</p>
