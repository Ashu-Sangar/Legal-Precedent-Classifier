It is argued that the clause of the act of 1889, upon which the city relies in this case, had been given a different construction by our Supreme Court than that which was placed upon a similar clause in the act of 1874; and the case of Oil City v. Oil City Trust Company, <a href="/pa/151/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="151 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="836669" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0454-01">151 Pa. 454</a>, is cited to sustain this position. After a careful examination of this subject, I agree with the learned counsel that a different construction has been given to this clause in the act of 1889 by our Supreme Court from that put upon a similar clause in the act of 1874. It is settled that a license tax empowered to be levied and collected by virtue of the act of 1889 is a tax in a general sense, and is not levied under the police power of the city. From this it is argued that the decisions heretofore delivered by the court, sustaining the classification of subjects similar to those in controversy, have no application. That, under the act of 1874, the license tax was an exercise of the police power of the city. It is true there is quite a difference between the power of taxation and the exercise of the police power. Burroughs, in his work on taxation, page 396, section 122, speaking of license fees or taxes levied under the police power, says: “ The provisions for equality and uniformity do not apply to this species of tax, but should they be held to apply, the only effect should be that each class of pursuits should be taxed alike.” Where, however, a license tax is a tax in a general sense, there must be under the provisions of our constitution “ uniformity upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and they must be levied and collected under general laws: ” Section 1, article 9, of the constitution of the state of Pennsylvania. This, however, in my judgment, does not destroy the effect of the reasoning in the cases heretofore decided. The court in the case of the City of Allentown v. Gross, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20Pa.%20322" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="132 Pa. 322">132 Pa. 322</a>, in passing upon <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>the question of the right to classify by ordinance in pursuance of the act of 1874, seems to have had in view the question of uniformity of such assessment. He says in his opinion : “ It is argued here that the grading of the license tax according to the amount of annual gross sales is illegal, because it is not uniform; that all liquor sellers should be required to pay the same amount, and that by making the amount of their sales the basis it is, in effect, an income tax. But this is not the taxing of the person of the liquor seller, but of his property estimated by the volume of the annual sales. A tax of this character, graded in the same way for state purposes, has been levied and collected for many years, .... being taxation of a thing and not of a person, the classification makes uniformity the same as in the case of money at interest, and real estate. The man who has two thousand dollars at interest pays twice as much as he' who has but one thousand dollars,” etc. The same may be said of the case of Hadtner et al. v. The City of Williams-port, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20W.N.C.%20138" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="15 W.N.C. 138">15 W. N. C. 138</a>, in which the learned court held that under article 9, section 1, of the constitution of Pennsylvania, taxes need not be uniform upon all subjects within the territorial limits, but only upon the same class of subjects. An ordinance, therefore, which imposes license taxes varying in amounts upon different kinds of industries is not void because of want of uniformity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b200-4" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[279,1599,1170,807]],["BL_201.1",201,[143,372,1170,656]]]'>We can really see no materiality in the controversy whether this license tax is a tax in a general sense or is under the police powers, because, after all, if the authority claimed by the plaintiff here is conferred by the act of 1889, then it matters little whether you call it a tax or a license. That the legislature itself may classify the subjects of taxation does not admit of any doubt, and if this be so, does not the legislature, when it confers the power of taxation of certain subjects to a municipality thereby confer all the power which it itself has over the subject, and if it has the right to classify why should not the municipality have the same right? The power of classification is inherent in the power of taxation, and, in my judgment, the only limitation upon this power is that such classification be made in such manner as to produce as great uniformity and equality of taxation as possible. By the act of 1889 the legislature vested in councils the discretion to tax the subjects named in <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>the act in any amount not exceeding one hundred dollars. Is it not clearly implied that in the exercise of this discretion they would have the right to classify any or all the subjects of taxation named according to the amount of their gross sales ? I will go further and affirm that, in my judgment, if the subjects named were taxed without regard to the amount of their sales that it would be most unjust and inequitable, and such assessment could not produce uniformity. The very fact that it is not a license but a tax makes it necessary that the municipal authorities should have the discretion to classify the subjects and graduate the assessment on some basis, particularly as regards some of the subjects named in the act, in order to produce uniformity and equality.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b201-3" data-blocks='[["BL_201.4",201,[146,1037,1167,1168]]]'>If it were a license merely, then it might be proper that every man should pay alike for the privilege of doing a certain business, but to levy a tax upon the same principle is to say that a dealer whose sales amount to but two or three thousand dollars a year shall pay the same tax as he whose sales amount to two hundred thousand dollars. The inequality of .such a mode of assessment is so apparent that it needs no argument to prove it. The case of Banger’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/109/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="109 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="542246" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0079-01">109 Pa. 79</a>, is not at all in conflict with this position. That was an attempt to classify the same occupation according to the earnings of individuals. It was very properly ruled that such a tax would be an income tax, measured by the amount of the earnings of the party, but even in that case the right to classify the tax upon property is, at least impliedly, recognized. The tax in controversy is clearly not an income tax in any sense, but it is a tax of the defendant’s property estimated by the volume of his annual sales. I might add, that to my mind it is evident that the power to classify is delegated by the clause of the act of 1889 in controversy, from the fact that the legislature in conferring the power to impose a license tax did not regulate the levy and collection thereof, but left the mode of assessment and manner of collection to the discretion of the municipality, fixing only the maximum which could be levied on any one subject.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b202-5" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[252,713,1165,605]]]'>But in view of the fact that the classification provided for by the ordinance in controversy so closely follows that adopted by the state herself in the act of May 14, 1841, and which has been in force ever since, how can we say that the classification in this case is unreasonable and inequitable? There is, of course, no such thing as a perfect uniformity and equality in taxation. All that can be claimed is that it should approximate uniformity and equality as nearly as possible. But it. is sufficient that the municipality had the power to classify as they did in this case, and that there is nothing in the ordinance itself or in any evidence in this case to indicate that there was any abuse of their discretionary power.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b202-6" data-blocks='[["BL_202.6",202,[253,1325,1164,861]]]'>But it is further urged by counsel in this case that if they had the right to classify and did classify some of the subjects named in the act, they were bound to classify all subjects named therein. We can see nothing in this position. As all subjects of taxation cannot be classified by the same standard, so there are subjects which do not admit of classification at all. Classification depends not only upon the physical nature or position of the subjects selected, but upon a variety of considerations. It may be wholly impracticable to classify certain subjects, and to attempt to do so might destroy uniformity of taxation instead of producing it, and the municipal authorities ought not to attempt such classification in such cases or even where the result would be doubtful. They must exercise a sound discretion on this subject, and where they do so courts will not attempt to interfere with their action. Because municipal authorities cannot classify all subjects of taxation it does not follow that they cannot classify any.</p>

The legislature itself in this case has made the classification of subjects, and the defendant belongs to a different class from that to which the auctioneer or the peddler belongs. Some other mere technical questions are raised by the bill of particulars filed by the defendant in this ease, which have not been commented upon by counsel in their argument, and which, I think, are not of any consequence in this case, and therefore will not take up the time to discuss them.</p>
