During the night a fire broke out in a building across the alley. The building did not belong to the defendant, and it had no control over the cause of the fire. The car caught fire and the contents of the car and the car itself were partially destroyed. The whole would have been burned if the company’s employee had not immediately after the five broke out run the car out of reach of the flames, and put out the fire. The evidence showed that the car door was open for a space of about ten inches at the time the fire broke out, and probably through this opening sparks from the burning building set fire to the twine. The bill of lading provided that the carrier should not be liable for loss by fire. <em>Held, </em>that under the undisputed evidence it was for the court to say as a matter of law that the defendant company was not guilty of any negligence which was the proximate cause of the loss.</p>

About three o’clock in the morning, a fire broke out in a large warehouse directly across the alley from where the car was standing ; the fire was communicated to the car, partially destroying both it and contents. The whole would have been burned, if defendants had not, immediately after the fire broke out, run the car out of reach of the heat and sparks of the burning building, and put out the fire. The evidence showed the car door at the side was open for a space of about ten inches at the time the fire broke out, and probably through the opening the sparks from the burning building set fire to the car and lading. The facts were undisputed, that the fire originated on property other <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>than that of defendant, and from causes over which it had no control.

The defendant knew, as all know, that fires frequently occur in large cities; that its yard being within the city, the freight cars therein might be endangered by such fires ; it attempted to guard against the peril by employment of watchmen to notice fire and give the alarm ; they had the means at hand for quick removal of the cars endangered; and although the fire broke out within twenty feet of the yard, so prompt was the action of the company, that the only destruction of property was a portion of this one car and'contents ; and the verdict of the jury establishes the fact that the company exercised care, diligence and promptness in removing this car as soon as possible after the fire broke out. But under the submission, the jury has gone further, and found as a fact that leaving the car door open a few inches, whereby sparks entered, was negligence, without which negligence the goods would not have been injured. It seems clear to us that on these two findings, in view of the undisputed facts, defendant is not answerable. The necessity for a quick removal of the cars from that freight yard on sudden peril from fire, was one which defendant could foresee, and thereby was bound to provide for; having done its full duty in this respect, was any other or further duty imposed upon it, so far as relates to damage from this fire ?</p>

    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[158,723,1168,1626]]]'>But the facts here are entirely different from those supposed; the freight yard of a common carrier in a large city was a necessity to the transaction of its business as a carrier; its laden cars must stand at some point within it for the convenience of both itself and the public; the delivery from the car to the cart or wagon of the consignee was a necessity; for purpose of such delivery, it stood at this point; that a fire might break out somewhere in a large city could be anticipated and provided against by having on hand watchmen to detect fire, and sufficient motive power to quickly move the cars to a place of safety; but that a building on a street opposite this particular car should catch fire but a few hours before the car was to be unloaded, and that in less than twenty minutes, before, by the utmost promptness and exertion, the car could be moved, sparks should pass through an aperture ten inches wide in the car, and communicate fire to the goods, is now seen to have been possible, but, even after the event so remotely possible, that certainly no jury or court can say it might or ought to have been foreseen. To say so would be, in effect, to hold, that common carriers of freight destined to large cities must transport such freight in tightly closed fire-proof cars, for that is the only precaution which could, under the circumstances here proven, have given protection against destruction by fire. We deem the fact of the open door as unimportant, because, as against all that could be reasonably foreseen, or was within control of defendant, the goods were safe on an uninclosed car; the defendant had no reason to apprehend fire in that particular building, or that it would immediately be of such fierceness as to communicate itself to the car before the latter could be removed, therefore by what particular channel or means the fire immediately reached the combustible car and cargo has no weight in determining the proximate cause.</p>

For the latter are those things or events which are likely to happen, and which for that reason should be foreseen.
