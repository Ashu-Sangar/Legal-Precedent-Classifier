You will reqollect that the teller’s check was the property of the Germania Savings Bank; that it was taken to the Farmers Deposit Bank, and there received, and a cash credit for $88,000 given, just as if the Germania Savings Bank had deposited that amount of money. If it had deposited cash it would have had a right to call on the Farmers Deposit Bank to respond to that amount, and so with this check, apparently, until something else occurred, and, if there were nothing else in the case, the Farmers Deposit Bank would be responsible for that amount of money to the Germania Savings Bank. But the check was not to be presented until Monday morning. It was deposited with the Farmers Deposit Bank on Saturday, and on Monday morning the final crash of the Penn Bank came and the check was not paid. The Farmers Deposit Bank, then, not receiving the money as it ought to have received it from the Penn Bank, or would have received it if that bank had not failed, stood in this position: [It had given the Germania Savings Bank credit for this money; it had this worthless check in its hands, and it immediately, or <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>shortly afterwards, notified the Germania Savings Bank that the check had not been paid, and charged back the amount that credit had been given for, notified the Germania Savings Bank of the fact, and then and there ceased, as T understand it, to have any further interest in the matter.] 3 [So far as the Farmers Deposit Bank was concerned, the money that it had given the Germania Savings Bank credit for had been recaptured, as it were, taken from the credit of the bank, and, of course, there could be no claim by the Germania Savings Bank for that, for they were the indorser, and they would have been liable, if there had been no indorsement, for any money paid for their use without sufficient consideration. That is not all, because it appears that the Germania Savings Bank had drawn a check for several thousand dollars. That was charged back, and to-day, so far as that evidence shows, if you believe it, and there is nothing to the contrary, the Farmers Deposit Bank has no interest or title to this check whatever.] 3 [It has by its own act paid everything it had as against the Germania Savings Bank in this transaction, and that being the case it would, in that point of view, have no title to the check, would have apparently, to my mind, no more right to set it up than i f: entire strangers, although it has possession of the check, and although it appears that the Germania Savings Bank refused to receive it back when tendered.] 4 [The Farmers Deposit Bank holds it in trust for the Germania Savings Bank, which is entitled to it, and if the latter should demand, and the Farmers Deposit Bank should refuse to deliver it, I apprehend it could be recovered, either its value or the check itself, by proper legal action.] s [If you find these facts as testified to, and as they are apparently established by the evidence, the defendant has no such interest in this check as would justify it in setting it up as a defence to this action, and nothing which would prevent the jury from giving a verdict for the plaintiff for the entire amount of the claim, with interest.] 6</p>

Text writers also have adopted the theory that checks so deposited are deemed to be taken for collection, in the absence of any special agreement: Daniels Neg. Inst., §1623; Morse on Banks and Banking, 2d. ed., 320, 3d. ed., § 506; 2 Edwards on Bills and Notes, § 749 ; Randolph on Commercial Paper, § 1394. Wherefore, the deposit is taken and credit made, by the bank conditionally; upon condition that if the check is returned unpaid, the same shall be returned to the depositor and the credit canceled, and this is in accordance with the practice and usage of banks: Morse on Banks <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>and Banking, 8d ed., § 586, and consistent with the cases of Dougherty v.

Bank was liable as an indorser; the amount of the check was 188,000, and the balance of the Penn Bank’s credit with the defendant was a little over $23,000. Moreover, the check was not payable at the defendant bank. Where, at the maturity of a note held by a bank, the maker’s balance on deposit is insufficient to pay the note, the bank is not bound to apply that balance to the payment of the note, for the protection of the indorser : Peoples’ Bank v.

That the holder of commercial paper for collection may maintain an action in his own name, is far from saying that such a holder can use it as a set-off against his own debt, for that would be to permit an agent to pay off his own debts with his principal’s money. And it has been expressly held that when a note is held for collection, the holder cannot set it off against his own debt: Lewis v.

In a suit brought by the assignee of the Penn Bank against the said Farmers Deposit Bank to recover a balance of $23,218.59, admittedly due the Penn Bank at the time of its failure, the Farmers Deposit Bank attempted to use the check of $88,000 as a set-off. The court below instructed the jury that the latter bank could not so use it. This is the one error of the case and it runs all through it.</p>
    <p id="b311-3" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[243,894,1188,612]]]'>The theory of this ruling was that the check belonged to the Germania Savings Bank, and a large amount of time was wasted in trying this unimportant fact. Of what possible concern was it to the Penn Bank whether the defendant held it for collection or for value ? It had no defence to the check in the hands of either bank. If there had been a defence as to the Germania then the Penn Bank might have called upon the defendant to show that it had paid value. But as the case stood — with no defence as to either bank — it had no standing to inquire into the relations between the defendant and tlie Germania, any more than if the check had been presented at its counter and payment demanded before its insolvency.</p>
    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[238,1513,1192,819]]]'>If we concede that the defendant was a mere collecting bank, so far as this check was concerned, it does not alter the case. As such its title was sufficient to maintain a suit in its own name. This is settled law: Brown v. Clark, <a href="/pa/14/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="14 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="405909" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0469-01">14 Pa. 469</a>; Ward v.

If it could maintain a suit on this check in its own name, it is difficult to see any good reason why it could not set the check off in a suit against it by the assignee of the Penn Bank. The rights of the assignee rise no higher than those of his assignor. Neither the Penn Bank nor its assignee has any concern with the question of the ownership of the check, unless a defence be shown as against the Germania, or that the defendant became the holder after the assignment. As no defence was set up against the check in the hands of anyone, and as it is an undisputed fact that the defendant became the lawful holder thereof several days before the assignment, we are all of opinion that the set-off should have been allowed.</p>
