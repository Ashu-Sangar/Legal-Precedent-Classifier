The question of law must be determined by the court, and the questions of fact by you. As we have already said, this lease was made to William S. Guffey &amp; Co., August 5, 1885. On March 18, 1886, it was assigned by them to C. D. Robbins, and on January 20, 1887, it was assigned bjr Mr. Robbins to the defendant company, which has held it and been in possession of the property leased ever since the last mentioned date. It is claimed by the defendant company that as this second well was to have been <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>commenced witliin four months from May, 1886, which would be about the first of October, 1886, therefore they are not liable in this action, because the breach of the covenant complained of was before the date at which the assignment was made to the company. It is true as a general proposition of law, “that a total breach of a covenant which affects realty, becomes a mere personal right, which does not descend with the land to the heirs, nor run with any future assignment to third parties. Where the right of action falls, there it lies.” But let us look at this lease and at the facts, as the plaintiffs allege they are, and see if this principle of law will relieve the defendant from liability in this case. The plaintiffs leased their farm, and their evident intent in making the lease was, if their land proved to be paying gas territory, to obtain from the lessee, or their assigns, the price of at least two wells, or $1,600 per annum. The lessees, or their assigns, could hold the leased premises twenty years, and could drill as many wells as they saw fit within the twenty years, and could drill them when they pleased, provided, they drilled at least two wells, so that within a certain time the lessors would be receiving at least $1,600 per year as the usufruct or rental of the leased premises. It was the increased rental of $800 which the completion of a second paying well would insure to the plaintiffs, that they wished to secure to themselves, when they inserted in the lease that a second well was to be commenced within four months from May, 1886. [The true interpretation of the lease is, that the lessees bound themselves and their assigns not only to commence a second well by October 1,1886, and diligently drill it to completion, but, if gas ivas found and utilized, to pay to the lessors, the plaintiffs in this case, $800 within sixy days after its completion; and the payment of the $800 at the end of the sixty days is the vital part of this agreement to the plaintiffs. The breach of this covenant to drill a second well is not complete until the end of the sixty days, as the $800, until then, is not over-due. The commencement of the breach was the failure to begin a second well on or before October, 1886; and the consummation was in not paying the $800, when it ought to have been paid, had a paying well been struck.] 3 Suppose C. D. Bobbins, the holder of the lease, on October 1,1886, according to the provisions of the lease, had commenced a well and <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>had diligently prosecuted the work thereon, and in a reasonable length of time, which, according to the testimony, would have been January 1, 1887, had struck gas in paying quantities which was utilized; could he have been sued by the plaintiffs for the |800, the price of this well, before January 20, 1887, the date on which he assigned the lease to the defendant company ? Certainly not, for the '$800 was not necessarily payable until sixty days after the completion of the well, which would be March 1, 1887, nearly one month and a half after the date at which the defendant company went into possession. [Again, we hold that the obligation to drill a second well continued, and that it fell upon the defendant company on the day they took possession of the leased premises under the assignment. And, if by the exercise of due diligence the company has had time to drill a second well to completion, and in addition to that time, sixty days in which to pay the $800 had expired before the bringing of this suit, which was brought about July 29,1887, then the company would be liable in this suit as the assignee of this lease.] 8</p>

If you believe, first, that whatever difficulty there may have been between these parties in regard to the payment of the rental on the first well and for not drilling the second well, or for the rental of the second well the same as though it were chilled, was compromised by these parties, then your verdict must be for the defendant, and you need go no further. If you find for the plaintiffs on that question, and think the compromise did not include this second well, then the next question is whether there was a failure to drill the second well; and there is no dispute about that. Then the next will be, did that failure, judging from all the evidence in this case, damage the plaintiffs. Are you satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that this failure actually damaged the plaintiffs ? If you think it did not damage the plaintiffs, and that they would not likely have got anything therefrom, if the defendant company had drilled the second well, then your verdict should be for the plaintiffs for six and one fourth cents damages, simply for not drilling the well, nominal damages for the breach. [If you, however, think that not drilling that second well did actually damage them, then you will determine how much it damaged them; if, in all probability the second well would have been a paying well, then are they entitled to the full yearly rental, which was $800, with interest from the time it ought to have been completed.] 6 These are all the remarks I wish to make in this case, and you will take it and give it such careful consideration as the case deserves, bringing in <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>sucli a verdict as you think will do justice between these parties upon all the evidence.</p>

Hence, we maintain there was an implied covenant to complete the well; that this covenant continued and was binding upon the lessee at the very moment of the assignment. Now the whole argument of the defendant rests upon the assumption that the covenant to commence a second well on October 1, 1886 was broken. But was it broken? The well would be commenced when the parties began the erection of a derrick; and the evidence clearly shows that a derrick was erected for this second well a few days before October 1, 1886.

By the terms of the lease Guffey &amp; Co., the lessees, acquired the exclusive right to drill and operate wells for oil and gas on about seventy-five acres of land for the term of twenty years. In consideration of this grant they undertook to commence operations on the premises, and complete one well within six months from the date of the lease. They were also to commence a second well four months after the time for the completion of well No. 1. The royalty to be paid was fixed by the terms of the lease at one fourth of all oil produced if oil was found, and eight hundred dollars per annum for each gas well operated, if gas was found in sufficient quantities to be utilized. The <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>lessees took possession and drilled one well in accordance with their covenant, which produced gas in sufficient quantities to be-utilized. Three months before the time for putting down the second well Guffey &amp; Go. assigned the lease to C. D. Robbins, who held it from March 18, 1886, till January 20, 1887, and then assigned to the Washington Natural Gas Co. The second well should have been drilled, allowing three months to be a reasonable time in which to complete it, during the time when Robbins was the holder of the lease. The action, however, is against the assignee of Robbins, whose title was acquired some two months after the time when the well should have been completed, and at least five months after it should have been begun.</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[246,1013,1192,1231]]]'>The liability of the assignee was brought to the attention of the court by the sixth "point submitted on the part of the defendant below, as follows: “ It being a conceded fact that a reasonable time for drilling said second well had elapsed before defendant became assignee of the lease, the defendant cannot be held liable for a failure to drill said well.” This point was refused. The seventh point asked the further instruction that. “ it being shown by the plaintiffs themselves that the covenant in the lease .... to commence the second well .... was broken before the.defendant acquired any interest in the lease, the proper remedy for such breach was an action against the original lessee, or the holders of the lease at the time of the breach.”' This was also refused; and the learned judge told the jury in his general charge that the breach of the covenant to drill a second well was not complete until the end of sixty days after the well should have been finished, because that was the time when the rent for the second well would fall due. “ The commencement of the breach,” said the learned judge to the jury, “ was the failure to begin a second well on or before October, 1886, and the consummation was in not paying the eight hundred dollars when it ought to have been paid had a paying well been struck.” The answers to the points and the foregoing instruction are assigned for error.</p>

If the well had been drilled at the proper time the covenant would have been fully performed, though neither gas nor oil had been found, and in that event no rent would have been domandable. The duty to pay rent for the second well, as for the first one, was conditioned upon actual production, and it ceased when the production ceased, or when the quantity of gas was too small to be utilized. The object of the covenant was to secure the development of the lessor’s land by the putting down of two wells upon it, for which rent was to be paid if the wells were successful. The breach was complete when the lessee failed to drill as he had agreed. Loss of rents and profits might or might not follow, depending on the productiveness of the field. This subject might have been considered by the jury in fixing the damages after the plaintiffs’ right to recover was settled, but bad no relation whatever to the question on which the liability of the defendant depended.</p>

That they continued liable, notwithstanding their assignment to Robbins, is very clear. The covenant was their own, and their privity of contract with their lessors continued, notwithstanding their assignment of the lease. Their assignee, Robbins, who was in possession when the time for performance arrived, was also liable, because of the privity of estate which arose upon his acceptance of the assignment. Acquiring the leasehold estate by an assignment of the lease, he is fixed with notice of its covenants, and he takes the estate of his assignor cum onere. But as his liability grows out of privity of estate, it ceases when the privity ceases. If he had assigned before the time for performance, his liability <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>would have ceased with his title, and liability would have attached to Ms assignee by reason of privity of estate, and so on, toties quoties. Each successive assignee would be liable for covenants maturing while the title was held by him because of privity of estate; but he would not be liable for those previously broken, or subsequently maturing, because of the absence of any contract relations with the lessor. While he holds the estate and enjoys its benefits, he bears its burdens, but he lays down both the estate and its burdens by an assignment,-even though, as is said in some of the cases, his assignment be to a beggar: Negley v. Morgan, <a href="/pa/46/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="46 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="420644" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0281-01">46 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/46/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="46 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="420644" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0281-01">281</a>; </em>Borland’s App., <a href="/pa/66/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="66 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="432498" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0470-01">66 Pa. 470</a>.</p>
    <p id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.4",612,[236,972,1190,602]]]'>It is clear, therefore, that when Robbins made his assignment to the Washington Natural Gas Co., the time fixed in the lease for the sinking of the second well had gone by, and the covenant was broken. Guffey &amp; Co. were liable upon their contract, because although their assignment had divested them of the lease, it could not relieve them from their contracts. Robbins, who was the owner when the covenant matured, was liable because of the privity of estate; but the gas company had no relations with the lessor or the leasehold until after the covenant was broken. The covenant ran with the land until the breach. It then ceased to run, because it was turned into a cause of action.</p>

The assignee of the lease owned adjoining lands upon which it was operating, and it stopped work on the Blair farm. The action rested on the breach of the covenant to prosecute the business of producing oil from the land of the lessor with due dilligence and “ without inter<a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>ruption.” The obligation of a covenant to prosecute the business of developing the land of the lessor without delay and without interruption, is a continuing one. The breach for which the Bradford Oil Co. was held liable was not that of some previous holder of the title, but its owner.</p>
    <p id="b613-3" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[181,606,1184,974]]]'>There is another reason for reversing this case, brought to our attention by the eighth assignment of error. The check for $650, sent by the treasurer of the gas company to the attorney of the lessors, was expressly stated to be in full for the Johnson lease from May 1, 1887, to May 1, 1888. <em>A </em>receipt was returned for the amount, stating that it was received for rental of well No. 1, on Johnson lease. The treasurer promptly returned the receipt, saying, “The $650 was sent, and so stated, in full for Johnson lease,” and -requesting its return if not accepted as sent. It was not returned. The party paying money has the right to direct its appropriation. It was the plain duty of the lessor to accept the check for the purpose for which it was offered, or to return it. Attention was again drawn to the subject by the treasurer in a note dated July 21st, asking the return of the check unless accepted as in full payment of all rents due on the lease. The refusal to return it after this explicit direction ought to be regarded as an election to accept it for the purpose for which it was offered, viz.: as payment in full for all rents-due upon the lease.</p>
