      <em>Mr. A. W. </em>Williams, for the plaintiff in error:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b128-5" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[257,667,1191,709]]]'>1. If the power of boroughs to impose license regulations on the business called hawking and peddling, were questioned, authority on the point might be found in Warren Bor. v. Geer, <a href="/pa/117/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="117 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="555848" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0207-01">117 Pa. 207</a>: The power is also recognized by the act of May 17,1883, P. L. 31, restricting the authority of boroughs in that regard. The power to impose license regulations having been once delegated to boroughs, it remains of course until taken away by the legislative power, either by express words or by necessary implication. There is no express repeal, nor does the act of April 13, 1869, P. L. 890, repeal by implication. The law does not favor repeals by implication: Brown v. County Commissioners, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%2043" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="21 Pa. 43">21 Pa. 43</a>. One act is held to repeal another by implication, only in cases of very strong repugnance : Commonwealth v. Easton Bank, <a href="/pa/10/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="962753" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0442-01">10 Pa. 442</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b128-6" data-blocks='[["BL_128.6",128,[254,1388,1189,714]]]'>2. The rule applies with especial force to the repeal of laws governing municipalities. A grant of power to a municipality is always considered as additional to the power of regulation exercised by the state: Dillon on Mun. Corp., § 54. The act of 1851 is, properly speaking, the charter of all boroughs that have accepted its provisions. A general statute, repealing all laws contrary to its own provisions, does not repeal a clause in a municipal charter on the same subject: State v. Branin, 3 Zabr. N. J. 484; Dillon on Mun. Corp. § 54. Municipal corporations are institutions designed for the local government of cities and towns; and the very object of granting to them corporate charters is to clothe them with power to regulate those matters which can better be left to local government than to state legislation.</p>

In order to give it this effect, or indeed any effect, if the plaintiff’s position is correct, it must be that by necessary implication the act of 1869 repealed all prior laws, whether restraining, regulating or prohibiting the peddling of the articles in question, as far as regards the class of persons described, and within the territory named. Any other construction would defeat the evident purpose of the act.</p>

    <p id="b129-5" data-blocks='[["BL_129.6",129,[191,885,1181,147]]]'>This case involves the validity of so much of the ordinance of the borough of Sliaron as prohibits the selling or hawking within said borough of any garden, farm, or dairy products.</p>
    <p id="b129-6" data-blocks='[["BL_129.7",129,[190,1040,1183,769]]]'>The right to make and enforce such ordinance is expressly conferred by the act of April 8, 1851, commonly called the borough law. If this were all, the case would be free from difficulty. But the act of 1869, P. L. 890, provides that “any resident citizen of Mercer county may, without other than a United States license, peddle farm, garden, and dairy prod uets within said county.” The plain language of this act protects the defendant below from any attempt on the part of the borough to compel him to take out a license. It is true the act of 1869 does not in terms repeal the section of the act of 1851 conferring this power upon boroughs. We are of opinion, however, that it repeals this part of the borough law by necessary implication so far as Mercer county is concerned. Its terms are so direct and so broad as to conflict with the act of 1851. They cannot both stand.</p>
