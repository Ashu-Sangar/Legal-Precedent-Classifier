With reference to the construction of contracts it is held to be matter of law; that is, that what a contract means is a question of law, and is to be determined by the court.

The intent and meaning’ of the parties to the contract appears to be, on the one part, to transfer the hotel property and secure the payment of the hotel indebtedness, of some kind; and, on the other part, the intent to accept the transfer and to incur or assume liability to a certain extent thereby: and I say to you, as to the meaning of the contract or the construction to be put upon it by you, that the indebtedness contemplated by the ageeement was not limited as expressed in the bill of sale merely to furnishing and improving, but would, as expressed by the terms of the bond, include indebtedness for running the hotel. I am convinced that such was the intent and meaning of the parties, by the fact that bills against Bingham &amp; Spencer, for items of a like character to this claim and for running expenses of the hotel, were paid by the' defendant under the terms of this contract. The limit of defendant in his liability, I take it to bo about $23,500, something more or less, and within reasonable proximity to the amount fixed, as circumstances may require; and, as the creditors are not named or specified in the writings, I take it that it would he the privilege of the debtors, Bingham &amp; Spencer, to indicate, if they saw proper so to do, the line of payment, and in the absence of any direction on their part, then it would be the privilege of Delp to make the application to the payment of the indebtedness in his own way. When the limit of liability assumed has been answered by payments to the full extent, the obligations have been met and the liability of the defendant under the contract is at an end. The liability as assumed is not satisfied simply by the payment of $23,500, but by the payment of a sum <em>about </em>that amount, and such as you may under the circumstances consider reasonable; about that stun and needed to meet the debts. If, however, the payments made at the time this action was begun (or if yon find no evidence to indicate an earlier appropriation, in which event the earlier date would control) did not amount to the full liability incurred by defendant, I take it that the plaintiff would he entitled to recover to an amount at least not exceeding the total liability of the defendant under his contract and not at the time paid out.</p>

The property is sold <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>outright.

The obligation created by the bill of sale could not be thus broadened by the bond given. The bond was merely collateral, and as an independent undertaking showed nothing enabling the plaintiff to sue. It is merely a personal obligation, and is not only much more extensive in character and in amount than the consideration of the bill of sale, but is outside of it, for that consideration is clearly defined and restricted both as to subject and amount, and the consideration of the bond is not.</p>

That the claim of the plaintiff was one clearly included and intended to be included in the contract, was established by the evidence beyond all doubt. The bond, executed with the bill of sale and the only paper executed by the defendant defining his obligation and liability, was sufficient evidence of his liability.</p>

    <p id="b70-4" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[252,412,1191,1026]]]'>On the 31st of January, 1887, Bingham &amp; Spencer, who were lessees and proprietors of the Hotel Albemarle, in the city of Pittsburgh, executed a bill of sale to Sebastian Delp for the leasehold, with the furniture, fixtures, etc., and generally of the personal property, used in, or belonging to, the hotel, including the stock of liquors on hand, with the outstanding claims, bills payable, etc. The consideration expressed was $3,500 to Bingham, $5,000 to Spencer, and the “further consideration of the said Sebastian Delp assuming to pay about $23,500 partnership debts of the late firm of Bingham &amp; Spencer, proprietors,” etc., “made in the furnishing and improving said hotel.” Contemporaneously with the execution of the bill of sale, a bond was executed by Delp to Bingham &amp; Spencer, in .the sum of $30,000, conditioned that the said Delp would thereafter indemnify Bingham &amp; Spencer from the payment of any and all of the debts of the firm, contracted in “furnishing and running” the Hotel Albemarle, “presently due and to become due, of and from all actions,” etc. Possession was taken at once and thereafter the hotel was constructed by Delp.</p>
    <p id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.6",70,[254,1444,1192,976]],["BL_71.1",71,[192,374,1197,812]]]'>Mr. Delp testifies that he could not get an itemized statement of the indebtedness, but Bingham &amp; Spencer told him, at the time, that these debts would not exceed from twenty thousand to twenty-two thousand dollars, and their bookkeeper confirmed this statement; whilst their actual indebtedness exceeded this sum several thousand dollars. The bookkeeper, admitting that he told Mr. Delp the indebtedness was from twenty-two thousand to twenty-three thousand dollars, says that he gave Delp an itemized statement of the debts to that amount; that this statement was made on January 4, 1887; that the house was running at a loss of $2,500 per month, and the loss from January 4th to February 1st was to be added to this amount. However this may be in fact, we must assume from the verdict of the jury under the instructions of the court, contained in the answers to the defendant’s fifth and sixth points, that if any misrepresentations were made by Bingham &amp; Spencer, as to the extent of their indebtedness, they were not made in fraud or with any intent to deceive Delp, but rather in ignorance of the indebtedness as it actually <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>Tbe amount stated in tbe bill of sale was approximate only; tbe indebtedness was estimated at “ about §23,500; ” and, according to tbe testimony and the tenor of the writings executed by Delp, it is plain that be assumed tbe payment of tbe whole as it might ultimately appeal'. Delp himself says that Bingham &amp; Spencer at first estimated the amount of their debts at §15,000, afterwards at 118,000, then at §20,000. The bookkeeper fixed bis estimate at §22,000, and finally the bill of sale expressed the amount at “ about §23,500.” If this is true, it was certainly apparent to Delp that Bingham &amp; Spencer had but little knowledge of their real condition, and common prudence would have suggested the propriety of insisting upon an accurate statement and a contract with specific reference thereto. If by entering hito a loose contract he has made a bad bargain, it is his own fault, and we cannot disturb well settled rules of the law to relieve him.</p>
    <p id="b71-5" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[169,1208,1246,1175]]]'>Brewing Company was not a party to this contract, and the general rule of the law is, that no one can sue on a contract to which he is not a party, but there are several very well recognized exceptions to that rule. “ Among the exceptions,” as we said in the very recent case of Adams v. Kuehn, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20Pa.%2085" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="119 Pa. 85">119 Pa. 85</a>, “ are cases where the promise to pay the debt of a third person rests upon the fact that money or property is placed in the hands of the promisor for that particular purpose; also, where one buys ont the stock of a tradesman to take the place, fill the contracts, and pay the debts of the vendor; these cases, as well as the case of one who receives money or property on the promise to pay or deliver to a third person, are eases in which the third person, although not a party to the contract, may he fairly said to he a party to the consideration on which it rests: in good conscience the title to the money or thing which is the consideration of the promise passes to the beneficiary, and the promisor is turned in effect into a trustee.M This doctrine, asserted in a long line of cases, embracing Blymire v. Boistle, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.%20182" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="6 W. 182">6 <em>W. </em>182</a>; Torrens v.

Delp, by the very terms of the agreement, held the property and effects of Bingham &amp; Spencer for the benefit of such of their creditors as had just claims contracted in the course of their business; he assumed the payment of these debts, and the property was put into his hands for this express purpose. Whether thereby a technical trust was created is not material. It has always been held that the creditor in such a case has a right of action to compel payment in accordance with the agreement. The act of April 26, 1855, requiring a promise to pay the debt or to answer for the default of a third person, has no application: Stoudt v. Hine, <a href="/pa/45/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="45 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="9502096" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0030-01">45 Pa. 30</a>; Clymer v.

    <p id="b72-4" data-blocks='[["BL_72.4",72,[254,1147,1198,982]]]'>It is contended, however, that the debt in suit was not contracted in the “ furnishing and improving ” of the hotel, and was, therefore, not embraced within the terms of the contract. To furnish, in its ordinary acceptation, is to supply or provide; and, as the bill in suit was for liquors furnished or supplied for use in the hotel, it would be difficult to draw a distinction which would, by the mere force of the language employed, exclude this .claim. Besides, it is manifest that the parties so understood their contract; for, in the bond of indemnity, executed at the same time, the debts are defined as those contracted during the continuance of said firm “in furnishing and running ” the hotel. If anything more were wanted to explain any supposed ambiguity in the contract, we might allude to the interpretation which the parties themselves have put upon it in the mode of its performance. In the statement of the debts paid by Delp, without objection, we find bills for other liquors, for oysters, natural gas, flour, fish, meat, milk, ice, etc.; indeed, if the testimony is believed, he paid one hundred dollars on the bill now sued upon and promised to pay the balance.</p>
