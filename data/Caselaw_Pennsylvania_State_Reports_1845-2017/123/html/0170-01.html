Upon that there is a variety of testimony. The plaintiff claims very large damages. The defendants contend that there was very little damage, merely nominal, that there was no real injury; and that the greatest injury Mr. Cook sustained was because he chose to give up and drop his whole business there and move away, for the reason that he did not have things just as he wanted them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-6" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[188,1022,1185,611]]]'>On the question of damages, it is first contended that the defendant companies went up School street with their mains. You have heard the law very properly stated that a gas company has a right to go up a street if it does so in a proper manner; particularly upon getting the consent of councils of the city. They can lay their pipes in the streets, and if they do no more damage than merely cutting up the street, and laying the pipes, no one can complain. But in this bond the defendants agree that if any damage is sustained by reason of laying the pipe up the bank, and as described here, they would pay for it, any actual damage. Hence, as I said, it is a question of proof of damage.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-7" data-blocks='[["BL_195.6",195,[188,1642,1186,559]]]'>Now, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants moved away his floats; kept him for some days from conducting his business. If that be the case, whatever his actual loss for that time would be, you ought to allow him under this agreement. The next item of plaintiff’s claim is that they tore up his plank road which he had built on School street. He was allowed to build it for his own use and they tore it up and did not put it back. It would make no difference whether it was on the street or not. You all know if you have permission to make a plank road and a stranger comes along and takes it up,' he must pay for it.</p>

To allow him to recover damages for that, there must be some necessity shown for it. He could not give up his whole business there because there were some inconveniences, some damage to him, and go off to another place and hold the defendants liable for all his loss in business. That could only be done from some necessity, such as is claimed here, that it was absolutely unsafe and dangerous to life to stay there, something of that kind. It is claimed by Mr. Cook that he was compelled to move ; that they laid their pipes under one end of his boat near where his saw-mill apparatus was, and that they leaked; that it was actually dangerous and unsafe, and he had to move away on that account. Even if that were true, you must judge whether he was justified in doing that. Could the leaks have been mended ? He must first try to see whether that could not have been rectified. If it was an absolute necessity that he move, if it was unsafe to stay there, and there was no use to stay there, and he could not, then he could go away and hold the defendants for the loss occasioned by that. You are the judges of that. You know the facts that surround human life better than I. I can give you the rule of law, and you will apply it to the evidence. You will say when you come to that matter of damage, whether Mr. Cook was justified in giving up a large business in a place like that and going off without anything more, and charging all the loss to the defendants. There must be a necessity for it; it must be unsafe to remain there, and you are the judges of that.</p>

When the bond was offered in evidence it was “ objected to as incompetent and irrelevant, and no proof of title in the plaintiff, and because the lease in question shows <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>that it bad expired at the date of the injury complained of; and further and particularly object to the bond, because there is no proof here of any reference to viewers or any statutory proceedings had in the matter.” The objections were overruled and bill sealed for the plaintiff.</p>

There was no need of any formal statutory proceedings to condemn this property and assess the damages. The defendant company might have proceeded under the statute to file a bond in court and have a jury appointed to assess the damages. Instead of doing so a voluntary bond was tendered to and accepted by the plaintiff, and the company entered at once upon his property and laid their pipes. In doing so they recognized plaintiff’s title and right to damages.</p>

At the time these objections were made, the bond had already been admitted in evidence, and properly so, for anything that appears in the case. The second objection, therefore, came too late.

The contract was executed. The defendants had availed themselves of the consideration. They had obtained all they needed from the plaintiff, and the objection that the bond was executed without authority of the respective corporations came with an'ill grace at such a late hour. There is a long series of cases — some of them very recent, to which I need not refer specifically — that when an agent exceeds his authority, his principal cannot avail himself of the benefit of his act and at the same time repudiate his authority. This principle rests upon the solid foundation of natural justice and common honesty. There was no proof whatever in regard to the seals. It is said in Angelí <em>&amp; </em>Ames on Corporations, § 226 : “ The signature of the agent <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>of a corporation executing the instrument on its behalf, being-proved, the seal, though mere paper and a wafer, stamped with the common desk seal of a merchant, will be presumed to be intended as the seal of the corporation until the presumption is rebutted by competent evidence.” There are numerous other authorities to the same point.

    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[228,871,1190,550]]]'>The only remaining question to which I refer is that of damages. This is raised by the 1st, 2d, 4th, 8th, 11th, 12th, and 14th assignments. We see no error in the rulings of the learned judge below upon this point. He merely enforced the rule adopted by the parties themselves, and expressed in the bond. That instrument covered “ all damages of whatsoever nature or kind that may be suffered or sustained by said Cook.” This is broad enough to embrace all damages allowed by the court. The parties might have stipulated for a narrower rule, but they did not, and we do not sit here to make their contracts for them.</p>
    <p id="AER" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[1000,1442,366,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
