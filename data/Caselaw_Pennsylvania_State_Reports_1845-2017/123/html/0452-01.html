Monitor Towboat Company, No. 51 October Term 1885, of this court, we held that the unrecorded assignment was good against a creditor of the assignor living in another state where the assignment was made and the assignee lived. Our decision was based mainly on a question of comity between the states, and the manifest injustice of permitting a creditor to escape from the forum which had jurisdiction over the assignment and over the assignor and his creditors, and by coming into this state, seize property and take it to the exclusion of other creditors. We thought the act of May 3, 1885, P. L. 415, was not intended to apply to such a case. Our decision in that case seemed to be satisfactory to the able counsel who argued the question before us. Our attention is now called to a recent decision of oxir Supreme Court, the Chemical National Bank v. Tuttle, 17 W. N. 415, which seems inconsistent with that case, but it does not appear from the report of the case cited that the question of comity was raised. It was ruled on a question of evidence as to what was sufficient to establish “actual notice.” If the question now suggested had been <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>raised and decided in that case, of course we should cheerfully conform to it, as would be our duty, but we are often reminded that a decision is authority only for the questions raised and decided in it. We need not repeat what we said in the Exchange Bank v. the Monitor Towboat Company, but refer to the opinion filed in that case for our views. If this case must go to the Supreme Court, we think there is no injustice in requiring the plaintiff to _ take it up.</p>

With this duty the assignee in this case failed to comply.</p>

Both the plaintiffs and the defendant in that writ resided in the city of New York. Before it issued the defendant had made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. The assignment was made in New York and was in conformity to the laws of that state. Under all the authorities it passed the title to the property in this state. It is sufficient to refer to our last case, Smith’s App., <a href="/pa/117/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="117 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="555842" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0030-01">117 Pa. 30</a>.</p>

L. 415, relating to foreign assignments, and the attaching creditor had no notice of the assignment, the property was liable to the attachmeut. The first section of the act of 1855 isas follows: “That whenever any person making an assign<a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>ment of bis or her estate, situate within this commonwealth, for the benefit of creditors, shall be resident out of this state, such assignment may be recorded within any county wherein such estate, real or personal, may be and take effect from its date; Provided, that no bona fide purchaser, mortgagee, or creditor, having a lien therefor before the recording in the same county, and not having had previous actual notice thereof, shall be affected or prejudiced, and the Courts of Common Pleas may dismiss or appoint trustees under such assignment, as in other cases.”</p>

Hence it was held in Steel v. Goodwin, <a href="/pa/113/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="113 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="457568" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0288-01">113 Pa. 288</a>, that • where a foreign attachment had issued after an assignment in another state, but before it was recorded here, and the attaching creditor had no actual notice of such assignment, the attachment was good as against such assignment. To same effect, see also Philson v. Barnes, <a href="/pa/50/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="50 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="425186" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0230-01">50 Pa. 230</a>. These cases were well decided, but they do not rule this one. The act of 1855 is not invoked by any Pennsylvania creditor seeking its protection. As before observed both these parties, plaintiffs and defendant, are residents of New York. The plaintiffs come into this state to obtain an advantage by our law which they could not obtain by their own. They are seeking to nullify the law of their own state and ask the aid of our court to do so. This they cannot have. If for no other reason, it is forbidden by public policy and the comity which exists between the states. This comity will always be enforced when it does not conflict with the rights of our own citizens: Bagby v. Railroad Company, <a href="/pa/86/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="86 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="1056565" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0291-01">86 Pa. 291</a>.
