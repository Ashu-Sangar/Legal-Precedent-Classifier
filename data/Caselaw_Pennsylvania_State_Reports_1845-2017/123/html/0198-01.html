A piece of rolled metal of the proper width and length was doubled on itself at a welding heat. Within the fold a mandrel was inserted to form the eye and the mass placed in the cavity of the lower <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>one of a pair of dies, made stationary.

Some I will have to pass upon by way of instructions to you but most of them I think have been settled, so far as you are concerned, in the trial of this case now, by the decision of the Supreme Court in Palmer’s Appeal, which was a case involving this contract, and of course involving the' patent, because it was by the representative of Mr. Palmer against the defendants then using the device. There is however a question of fact for you to pass upon. Counsel on both sides have agreed to the amount of verdict that should be found, if you should find for the plaintiff, so that [you really have but one question of fact to pass upon and I need not take up our time in going over the evidence, or elaborating the case, to bring you to that one question, which is, whether the dies were used for the purpose of welding these polls as well as shaping them. As I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, it is that where the dies were used for the purpose of shaping the poll of the axe alone, the defendants are not liable; but, where it has been used for welding as well as shaping, then the defendants are liable, and that is the question of fact now for you, whether these dies were used for welding the polls for these axes as well as shaping. I say to you in general terms, before I answer the points of law presented by the defendants’ counsel, that if the welding was regularly and substantially done under the little hammer the plaintiff cannot recover. An occasional welding under the drop when the little hammer was out of order, or a little incidental welding under the drop, would not be sufficient to make the-defendants liable under this contract. But if the drop and <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>dies were used for welding as well as shaping the polls, the defendants are liable.] 10</p>

The federal courts have uniformly ruled that an action on a contract to recover royalties due for the use of a patented invention, if the parties are residents of the same state, is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts. One of the very first steps in making out a case of that character is proof that the defendant had made use of the patented invention for which the contract bound him to pay royalty; and it would be preposterous to hold that the state court must arrest the proceeding whenever the defendant raises a question about his use of the patented device. Such question may involve a construction of the patent, in so far as it may be necessary to determine its scope ; but it is competent for the state court to determine the scope, as well as the validity, of a patent when it becomes necessary for the adjudication of a cause that is properly before it: Slemmer’s App., <a href="/pa/58/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="58 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1013210" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0155-01">58 Pa. 155</a>.

The origin and substance of that agreement are as follows: On August 22, 1871, letters patent of the United States were issued to Charles <em>W. </em>Hubbard, of the firm defendants below, and George Palmer, plaintiff’s intestate, “ for a new and useful improvement in the manufacture of axes.” On September 2d following, the patentees assigned their interest in the patent to the firm, and on the same day, and as part of same transaction, the agreement in suit was executed. After reciting the issuance of the letters patent to Hubbard and Palmer “ for an improvement in the method of manufacturing axes,” and the assignment by them to the firm, <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>the agreement provides that, in consideration of the assignment, etc., the firm “ will keep a true and correct account of all axes and hatchets manufactured by them by the process described and claimed in said letters patent, and shall, on the first day of July and January in each and every year, during the term of said letters, .... render unto said party of the first part (Palmer) a true and correct statement of the number of axes and hatchets so as aforesaid manufactured by them by the process aforesaid, and at the same time shall pay unto the said party of the first part the sum of one cent, as royalty, on every axe and hatchet so as aforesaid manufactured by them since the last preceding statement and payment.”</p>
    <p id="b227-4" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[207,957,1183,1075]]]'>Doubtless the purpose of the firm in procuring the assignment was to secure to themselves a monopoly of the patent. Hubbard, being one of the patentees and a member of the firm, had a right, of course, to use the patent in the partnership business of manufacturing axes, etc., but Palmer also, as copatentee, had a like right to use it or license others to do so. Hence it was necessary for the firm to procure the assignment in order that they might enjoy a monopoly in the use and control of the patent. But, it matters little what their purpose was. Palmer disposed of a valuable right, and the only consideration he received or was to receive therefor was the royalty which the firm agreed to pay. They refused to pay anything, and several years after the agreement was executed, a bill was filed by the personal representative of Palmer, praying for an account, etc. That suit was so proceeded in, that in November, 1880, it was finally decreed by this court that the firm of Hubbard, Lippincott, Bakewell &amp; Co. pay to said personal representative $5,482.45, arrears of royalty accrued before the bill was filed: Palmer’s App., <a href="/pa/96/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="96 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="494586" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0106-01">96 Pa. 106</a>.'

As to a considerable portion thereof the statute of limitations was successfully interposed. The residue of the claim was resisted mainly on two grounds : 1st. Want of jurisdiction in the state courts, in that the cause of action arises under the patent laws of the United States, and is therefore originally cognizable in the Circuit Court <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>thereof. 2d.

The court said: “ The peculiar privilege given to this class of cases was intended to secure uniformity of decision in the construction of the acts of congress in relation to patents. The dispute in this case does not arise under any act of congress, nor does the decision depend on the construction of any law in relation to patents. It arises out of the contract stated in the bill, and there is no act of congress providing for or regulating contracts of this kind. The rights of'the parties depend altogether upon common law and equity principles.5’</p>

Teas, <a href="/us/106/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="106 U.S. 613" data-case-ids="3498554" data-case-paths="/us/106/0613-01">106 U. S. 613</a>, between citizens of the same state, brought in a court thereof for moneys alleged to be due to the complainant under a contract whereby certain letters patent, granted to him, were transferred to the defendants, it was held that the suit, not involving the validity or the construction of the patent, is not one arising under a law of the United States, and cannot be removed to the Circuit Court. “It is clear,” said Mr. Justice Woods, “from an inspection of the bill and answers, that the case is founded upon the agreement in writing between the appellee and the appellants, Albright and Cahoone, by which the former, for the consideration therein specified, transferred to the latter his interest in certain letters patent. The suit was brought to recover the consideration for the transfer and was not based on the letters patent.The only question raised by the bill and answer was simply this : What is the sum due the appellee from Albright and Cahoone, for his <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>royalties under the contract ? In ascertaining this amount, it, of course, became necessary to inquire what goods were manufactured by the appellants under the patent of the appellees* In prosecuting this inquiry an incidental question might arise, namely, What goods were manufactured by appellants under other patents of which they were the owners or licensees ? But this incidental and collateral inquiry does not change the nature of the litigation. The fact that Albright and Cahoone had licenses to use the other patents under which they were manufacturing goods, does not give them the right to litigate their cause in the United States courts, because certain goods which they asserted were made under the other patents, the appellee asserted were really made under his. The suit, notwithstanding the collateral inquiry, still remains a suit on the contract to recover royalties, and not a suit upon the letters patent. It arises solely upon the contract and not upon the patent laws of the United States. We are therefore of opinion that, even if we go outside of the pleadings and look into the testimony, the case is not one arising under the laws of the United States, and consequently the courts of the United States had no jurisdiction.”</p>

In other words, there can be no manufacturing “by tbe process ” unless each and every step in tbe process is employed. We do not think so. As was said in tbe former case, defendants below might not find it convenient or advantageous to use all tbe mechanical devices covered by tbe patent; but, according to what must be regarded as tbe true interpretation of tbe contract, tbe employment of one or more of them was a manufacturing “by tbe process described and claimed in tbe letters patent.” Tbe word “process,” as used in tbe agreement in suit, was not employed in tbe restricted technical meaning that it has <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>acquired in the patent law when used in speaking of patented processes, etc. As distinguishable from the mechanical devices described and claimed in the letters patent, there is no patentable process described therein. .The patentees themselves did not represent that they had invented any new process which, in and of itself, was the subject matter of a patent; but that they had “invented a new and useful improvement in the manufacture of axes,” and, proceeding to explain the “construction” thereof, they describe three distinct sets of dies by referring to the drawings attached to the specifications. It thus appears from the claim and specifications that the invention covered by the letters patent relates not to a patentable “process,” but solely to mechanical devices. The invention consists wholly in the mechanical devices embodied in the dies. Each separate set of dies is a patented invention, so far at least that the unlicensed use thereof would undoubtedly subject the party using the same to an action for infringement of the patent. The plaintiffs in error themselves would doubtless so regard it, if any one should attempt to use the pair of dies which constitute the second item of claim covered by the patent of which they are the assignees. Nothing is better settled in practice than that the unlicensed use of either of several mechanical devices embraced in the claim of a patented invention, is an infringement of the patent; and it ought to be regarded as equally clear that a licensee or assignee of a patent containing several distinct items of claim, is liable for the stipulated royalty, if he use the invention covered by any one of those items, unless his liability is clearly and distinctly limited.</p>
