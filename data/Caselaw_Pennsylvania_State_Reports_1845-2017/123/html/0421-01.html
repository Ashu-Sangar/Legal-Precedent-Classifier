The grating was displaced by his step upon it, and turned or slipped away, whereby the plaintiff fell into the coal-hole to his arm-pits, receiving a severe injury upon his right leg below the knee. He was confined to his bed at the St. Charles Hotel for two months, under treatment, and was off duty for still another month. Erysipelas supervened during his confinement. His testimony, as to the occurrence resulting in his injury sufficiently appears in the charge of the court below and in the opinion of this court.

The injury he received would have no connection with his being intoxicated, even if he were, which, it seems to me, the evidence entirely fails to show, and therefore there is nothing <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>which would justify the jury in finding he was guilty of what we call contributory negligence.] 1</p>

Parties who make holes in the pavement know, and are bound to-know, must know, as everybody else does, that if the covers are not kept solidly in place, somebody may fall through and get hurt, and they are therefore bound to exercise all reasonable skill, care and prudence with reference to the possible injury that may occur to persons passing along the street. Of course, they are not insurers, but they are bound to exercise such a degree of mechanical skill in arranging the openings as would be ordinarily proper and necessary to protect travelers in view of what might occur. If the defendants did everything in arranging or having arranged, tins grating, that was prudent and cautious, in view of these circumstances, they are not liable here, without they have neglected in some way or other to keep the grating in proper order and repair; and when I speak of the defendants I speak of the man Johnson, who had charge of the grating, because the defendants are responsible for the neglect of Johnson. If the defendants put the charge of this grating in the hands of Johnson, gave him authority to look after it, and Johnson neglected his business, and the plaintiff was hurt, it was the same in legal effect as if the defendants had kept charge of it themselves. Johnson says that before he had these flanges put upon it, the grating got out of order from time to time, and his attention was attracted to it, and he had wired it down in some way, but it still kept getting out of shape, so as to indicate it might become dangerous. [He then went to the gentleman who fixed it, Mr. Farrell, I believe, and had these flanges, or ear pieces, put on. Farrell says they were not at all necessary; that the grating was sufficient before. In that he is probably mistaken, because the evidence of Johnson himself shows that it was getting out of order. But at any rate, they were put on as á matter of extra precaution, and Farrell says in his opinion it was perfectly safe. Now, if they did make the grating safe, in so far as ordinary skill, prudence <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>and foresight could anticipate any possible or probable damage arising from it, that is all tbe defendants are bound to do, and they are not liable for an accident of this kind; but because they sent to a man they thought skilful, and engaged him to do the work, it does not necessarily follow that they are not liable. It must be established reasonably to the satisfaction of the jury, that the man employed did the work in a proper and reasonable way, such as would be proper and sufficient protection under the circumstances. I cannot relieve myself of a duty 1 owe to the public by employing a man I think is competent to do the work. I must go further, and prove that when he did it, he not only did the work to the best of his judgment, or the best of my judgment, but did it in a way which was reasonable and proper in the judgment of the jury, under all the circumstances of the case.] s I may think a man is competent to do a certain piece of work, and he may make me a very bad job, and by his bad work somebody may be injured. I cannot avoid my liability in a case of that kind where I owe a duty to the public, by showing I have exercised the best judgment I had. If that were not the law I would be imposing somebody between me and the public when a duty devolved on me. I am responsible, in a case of that kind, for the neglect, or want of skill, of the party I employ.</p>

First, the plaintiff, if he is entitled to recover at all, is entitled to recover his actual expenses. That involves doctors’ bills, medicine, nursing and hotel bills. That is the money this accident has actually cost him. He is entitled to receive that, if he is entitled to recover. Then he is also entitled to recover the value of his lost time; that is, what he would have made during the time- he was laid up. These things can be easily computed. He gives three months as the time he was disabled absolutely, and he rates the value of his time at f 100 a month — says that is the average sum he could have made. If that is so you can arrive at the amount with some degree of certainty. Then there is another element of damage — compensation for pain and suffering he has undergone ; that is a matter we have to keep suggesting to juries in cases of this kind, that is to be governed by the judgment of the jury itself. There is not of course, any standard by which we can weigh human suffering; there is no manner, indeed, in which we can tell the degree of suffering a man endures. [The fact is, one man may endure pain better than another one; may endure more pain with a similar injury; but that there is suffering and pain incident to all such injuries as this, is manifest not only to physicians, but to everybody; and the evidence in this case is that the pain was very severe, especially after erysipelas set in. As to that, if the erysipelas would not <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>liave occurred if the injury had not happened, it is to be considered by the jury as part of the injury itself, to be compensated for in some way.]:s</p>

The opening was in the sidewalk of a public street in a populous and much frequented portion of the city, and was used for the defendant’s private convenience. It was Ms duty, therefore, to exercise reasonable care and diligence, not only in making, but in keeping it safe and secure. He was bound to know that persons would pass and repass on this pavement not only in day time, but in the night time also, and that as the opening was in the centre of the sidewalk, they would, without apprehending danger, stop upon the cover which he placed over it. It is quite certain that this cover was not secure, or it would not have turned, and the jury has found that its insecure condition was owing to the defendant’s want of due diligence and care concerning it. It is absurd to say that in order to charge the owner of the premises with notice, “the defect must be so notorious as to be evident to all pedestrians passing in the immediate neighborhood.” Whether the cover was made and adjusted in a way that was reasonably safe and secure, was for the jury, and that question was fairly submitted.</p>

    <p id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.7",449,[189,1801,1186,250]]]'>“ The pavement was apparently all right; I was going along and I stepped on this coal-hole cover, which went out in front of me and I went in. It was done so quickly I could not tell how it went out; it either slipped from not being properly placed on, or else it turned, one of the two.”</p>
    <p id="b449-7" data-blocks='[["BL_449.8",449,[191,2060,1184,149]]]'>“ Q. Did you notice this coal-bole covering at all before you stepped on it? A. I noticed it as any man would notice anything along the street.</p>
    <p id="b449-8" data-blocks='[["BL_449.9",449,[191,2216,1183,135]]]'>“ Q. Was there anything apparently wrong with it? A. No, sir; it was apparently all right, or I should not have stepped on it.</p>
    <p id="b449-9" data-blocks='[["BL_449.10",449,[239,2371,1133,47]],["BL_450.1",450,[248,364,1188,97]]]'>“ Q. So far as you could tell it was resting properly in the <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>rim that supported it? A. I don’t look down to know that in regard to every coal-hole I come to.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[247,468,1190,188]]]'>“ Q. II it had been displaced you probably would have noticed it? A. I might have noticed it, and might not; it is evident I did not notice it; it is evident it was displaced, and I did not notice it.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[246,673,1190,447]]]'>“ Q. Of course you have no knowledge of it further than that it let you down ? A. That is all. I looked at it as it lay there to see what had been the cause of my going in there, and found — I saw there were pieces attached to it; little pieces of iron — three of them, I think, attached to the side of it; the front side had none attached, and it was the front side, towards Penn avenue, I stepped on ; my impression was it was slightly displaced, and as I stepped on it it revolved on these two places and went in front of me and let me in.”</p>
    <p id="b450-6" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[247,1138,1191,613]]]'>It is the duty of every pedestrian upon a public highway to use reasonable care for his own safety and to avoid «m open or apparent danger. But as the cover was placed in the pavement as a part of it, for persons to tread upon, it is plain that Hollister was not bound to exercise that critical and extreme care which would involve a particular examination of its structure and adjustment before stepping upon it. He had a right to assume that°not only the public but private owners had performed their duty, unless there was something reasonably apparent to give him notice or cause some apprehension of danger, when, of course, a greater degree of care would be required, and there is not the slightest proof that he had any such warning.</p>
    <p id="b450-7" data-blocks='[["BL_450.7",450,[249,1757,1188,199]]]'>Farrell was not an independent contractor; he was a mere servant; he was subject to the direction and control of Dickson, and might have been dismissed and another person employed at any stage of the work.</p>
    <p id="b450-8" data-blocks='[["BL_450.8",450,[248,1963,1203,454]],["BL_451.1",451,[186,339,1200,1131]]]'>Although, according to the testimony of the medical experts, erysipelas is not a necessary consequence of such an injury, yet it is conceeded that in frequent instances it does follow flesh wounds. The causes which produce erysipelas would seem to be obscure; the modern theory is that erysipelas is the result of some specific poison, which enters the system' through the exposure of a wound; but the nature of this poison and the conditions under which it operates, are not well understood. The disease was, however, a development which <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>might fairly have been anticipated as a result of the injury; and as in this instance the disease developed, in the wound, it was a reasonable inference of the jury that if there had been no wound there would have been no erysipelas. There is no intimation that erysipelas intervened from any want of care or skill on part of Dr. Orr, or that proper precautions were not taken by the use of antiseptics, etc., in the treatment of this wound. On the contrary, it is conceded that the disease, if not the necessary and usual result, frequently occurs in such cases. The negligence of the defendant may therefore be regarded not only as the direct cause of the wound but of the disease, which from occult causes, not attributable to treatment, improper habits, or peculiar constitutional tendencies, frequently develops from personal injuries. It was in this view of the case the court instructed the jury that even if the erysipelas was not the immediate result of the injury it might nevertheless be regarded by the jury as part of the injury itself. Nothing intervened to produce this disease other than might have been fairly anticipated as the direct, although not the necessary result, of the injury; as well might we attribute the contact of the atmosphere or the microscopic existences therein as an intervening cause in such cases.</p>
