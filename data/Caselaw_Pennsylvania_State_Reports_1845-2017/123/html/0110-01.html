He further alleges that if Staib owns the 64 acre tract he has acquired title in pursuance of said parol agreement. He denies any aggressions or trespasses in either the 200 acres or the 64 acres, and avers that he has done nothing in either which he did not have legal right to do. He admits a trespass by mistake upon the 97 acre tract, but alleges that it was prior to the time plaintiff became, if he is, the owner thereof, and alleges further that plaintiff has since that time mined across the line upon defendant’s coal' and taken away a still greater quantity of coal than that taken by defendant.

In it he avers that in the month of October, 1877, the plaintiff and the defendant were the owners respectively of two contiguous coal properties, and at that time a tract of 200 acres of coal in the rear of and adjoining both of said properties, was exposed to public sale and was purchased by the defendant Hayes at $76 per acre and that he holds the deed therefor dated February 6, 1884. That “ at or about the time of said sale and purchase it was verbally agreed ” that the plaintiff Staib “should pay a proper proportionate part of said purchase mpney ” and should purchase and convey to Hayes the 64 acre tract at a sum not to exceed $76 per acre, whereupon Hayes should convey to Staib such a portion of the 200 <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>acre tract as would be cut off by an extension of tbe division line of tbe two contiguous tracts first mentioned, the respective portions of purchase money to be ascertained by a survey of tbe property. He further avers that be, Hayes, has paid the purchase money of the 200 acres, the plaintiff, Staib, “ having from time to time paid him sundry sums of money on account of his proportion of said purchase money under the said agreement ; ” that the plaintiff, Staib, has acquired title to the 64 acres but repudiates the agreement and refuses to convey said coal land to the defendant. He also alleges that, in pursuance of the rights and privileges appurtenant to the 200 acres and of his parol agreement with Staib, he has at great expense driven a main entry and many cross entries into the 64 acres and is now ready to operate said tract of coal. Averring his willingness to comply with his agreement he asks that the agreement be established of record and Staib compelled to carry it into effect, or otherwise that it be annulled and Hayes declared to be the sole owner of the 200 acre tract of coal.</p>

It is admitted by the pleadings that some agreement or understanding did exist in relation to the 200 acres of coal. The plaintiff’s allegation is that it was an arrangement for a joint purchase of the property and for the joint and equal benefit of both parties.

The first paragraph of the defendant’s answer and the second paragraph of his cross-bill would appear to convey the idea that the <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>defendant first became the purchaser of the property and after the purchase was made agreed by parol to divide with the plaintiff.</p>

Under partition proceedings upon the estate of Robert Robison, deceased, George T. Work, then sheriff of Washington county, was appointed trustee to make sale inter alia of certain coal lands lying near the Monongahela river in said county. On October 2,1877, the trustee exposed to public sale a tract of coal and surface fronting on the. river and which adjoined a coal tract of 97 acres belonging to Lewis Staib, the plaintiff. W. S. B. Hayes, the defendant, became the purchaser of this front tract. There was also exposed for sale the 200 acre tract of coal, now in controversy, which lies directly back of the 97 acres belonging to the plaintiff, and the front coal and surface bought by the defendant. It also adjoins the 64 acre tract mentioned in the bills and answers, and known as the Wickerham Reserve Coal. When the 200 acre tract was put up for sale both the plaintiff and the defendant became bidders upon it, the plaintiff bidding for himself and the defendant, though present, bidding through Thomas S. Hutchinson. It appears that there were no others bidding upon the property. The two parties competed until the bids reached $74 per acre, the last bid being that o.f Staib, the plaintiff. At this point the bidding stopped for some reason, and Thomas S. Hutchinson approached the plaintiff and proposed the making of some arrangement, by which each could obtain part of the property and the price be kept down. At his suggestion the plaintiff and defendant came together and made some agreement. Bidding was then resumed and the property was finally knocked down at $76, upon the bid of Mr. Staib. The master is unable to find from the testimony whose name was announced as the purchaser. Subsequently, but on the same day, the two parties, in company with the trustee and Mr. Hutchinson, met at Monongahela City, where the ten per cent of purchase money required by the terms of sale was paid, one half by each, and a receipt for the whole amount taken in the name of Staib. By direction of the parties, the trustee returned the sale as made to Mr. Hayes and it was duly confirmed by the court. The balance of the first instalment of purchase money was paid <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>equally by the two parties on plaintiff paid his full half and $120.67 additional, the balance being paid by the defendant. The difficulty between the parties having arisen before the [next and] last payment was made, the plaintiff did hot pay his half of it, although he attempted and was ■ ready to do so, and after these proceedings were instituted the defendant paid the balance of the purchase money and received a deed for the property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[253,779,1214,1070]]]'>The agreement between was was present when it was made except Hutchinson, who was acting as the friend of the defendant. The testimony of all the witnesses shows that whatever the agreement was, it was made before the property was purchased by anybody. It could not therefore have been what the defendant’s answer and cross-bill would seem to indicate, a parol agreement by the defendant to sell and convey to the plaintiff, but it was, — and the master so finds as a fact from all the evidence, — an agreement to make a joint purchase of the land for the use and benefit of both parties. The evidence also clearly establishes the fact that in pursuance of the agreement the plaintiff bid the property to $76 and that both parties were interested in the purchase. And although the deed was subsequently made to the defendant, the beneficial ownership was in both, which is in accordance with the claim made by the plaintiff in the first paragraph of his bill. This appears to the master to be, so far, a sufficient answer to the position assumed by the defendant’s counsel upon the argument, viz.: that the allegation of the first paragraph of the bill was at variance with the proof and that the bill could not, for that reason, be sustained.</p>

On this point the testimony on one side and on the other sharply disagrees. Here the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to sustain his version of the agreement by the evidence of two witnesses or one witness and corroborating circumstances, for the answer of the defendant, though not as Clear as it might be, is sufficiently responsive to put the plaintiff to his full proofs. The plaintiff alleges that the 200 acres, being jointly purchased, was to be divided equally, each party taking 100 acres in the rear of his own river front property. <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>The defendant’s answer is silent on this point, but in his cross-bill he alleges that the division line agreed upon was an extension or prolongation of the medial line between the two front properties. Divided by such a line the parts would be unequal, the defendant getting between sixteen and seventeen acres more than the plaintiff.</p>

It is claimed, however, that the plaintiff’s testimony should not be believed, because he is contradicted not only by the defendant and Hutchinson, but also by his own witness Sheriff Work, as to the time of the conversation between the parties. Staib stated, although he afterward admitted the possibility of mistake, that the arrangement was made before the front tract was sold. Tbe sheriff only saw the parties consulting once and that during the crying of the sale of the 200 acres. The master is of the opinion that Mr. Staib is mistaken as to the time the agreement was made, but he declines to give this apparent contradiction the weight and importance asked for it. The time of the conversation is a matter of no special consequence: the real matter is what did the parties agree to do.</p>

[The fact that the plaintiff paid the half of the purchase money and that the defendant permitted him so to do, is strong evidence that it was the contract <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>that he should so pay, and the master finds as a fact established that such was the contract.] 8</p>

Neither party then had anything to give or anything to receive as between themselves; each stood on an equal footing; each wanted the property, or was willing to take a part of it, at as low a figure as possible. There was therefore no reason why either should enter into an agreement by which he might eventually be compelled to pay for one hundred acres of coal and only get eighty or eighty-five. The only consideration for their agreement was mutual abstaining from bidding and this was as much for the benefit of one as of the other.</p>

It is charged that in his sworn answer and cross-bill the defendant sought to convey the impression that the only contract between the parties was a parol agreement on his part to sell to the plaintiff a portion of the 200 acre tract. This is rendered almost certain by an examination of the injunction affidavits made by the defendant. Thus on August 12, 1881, he says upon oath: “After the respondent became the purchaser of the said two hundred acre tract of coal at the trustee’s sale in the said partition proceeding, he made a verbal agreement to sell the complainant a certain part of the same which be is advised that it is unnecessary to set forth for the reason that, if the complainant alleges there is a breach thereof, he has an adequate remedy at law.” And on September 28, 1882, the defendant made another affidavit in which he asked that the statements of the former affidavit might be considered part of the one then made. On the same day Tilomas S. Hutchinson made affidavit that lie had examined both of the defendant’s affidavits “ and that the facts therein stated are true as he verily believes.” Our attention lias also been called to the contradictory statements of the defendant in the sixth paragraph of his answer and the first paragraph of his cross-bill on the subject of plaintiff’s ownership of the 97 acres. If the plaintiff was, as the cross-bill alleges, the owner of that tract in October, 1877, and the defendant knew that fact, then the sixth paragraph of this answer, in which he alleges that his trespass on that tract “ prior to January 1, 1880” was “before the plaintiff became, if he is, the owner of the 97 acre tract,” was untrue. We are also asked in this connection to consider the rather remarkable affidavit made by Hutchinson and presented before the master July 27, 1886, the evident purpose of which was to prejudice the case of the plaintiff and which was shown to be baseless by the joint survey made under the master’s direction. These are all matters proper to be considered in determining what weight should be given to the testimony of these two witnesses and they certainly cast a cloud upon their testimony.</p>

A. Brokaw, a gentleman wbo makes bis borne with Mr. Hutchinson, and wbo testifies to two conversations between tbe plaintiff and Hutchinson, said to have occurred five or six weeks after the purchase of tbe 200 acres, in the course of which it is alleged that the plaintiff admitted that the division line was to be a prolongation of the Victory line, and also that plaintiff was to procure title to the 64 acres for the defendant. This witness makes the plaintiff say that he wants the “ difficulty settled ” without a lawsuit, to which Hutchinson replied that it could be settled by the plaintiff securing title to the 64 acres and then the line would be run straight through; but according to the defendant’s story that was the original agreement, and according to both Brokaw and Hutchinson the plaintiff was not calling that in question. What then was the difficulty, unless it was, as the witness afterward states, “about changing the line.” Hutchinson testifies to the same conversations, but he says that there was no difficulty spoken of nor was there at that time any misunderstanding between the parties. Accordipg to his testimony the plaintiff wanted some written evidence of his interest in the purchase, in order that he might make some business use of it, to which Hutchinson says he replied that that was not necessary and, very irrelevantly, proceeded to state over his version of the agreement and thus drew out an admission from the plaintiff. The vagueness- of Brokaw’s testimony, in the absence of his memorandum, made so strangely at Hutchinson’s suggestion, and the unnaturalness of the story as detailed by Hutchinson, lead the mind to hesitate over allowing such evidence to turn the scale in so important a mat-. ter, and we decline to give it that weight. [In view of all the testimony and the facts and circumstances, the master finds that not only was the purchase joint, but also that the purchasers were to hold equal interests in the property.] 4</p>

This 64 acre tract belonged to William Wickerham and according to the testimony was not for sale at the time of <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>the transactions under consideration. After the death of William Wiekerham the coal was purchased by the plaintiff, at the rate of $100 per acre, by agreement dated September 25,1880. In his cross-bill the defendant charges that it was part of the agreement between himself and the plaintiff that this coal should be purchased for him and that he is informed and believes that the plaintiff has acquired title thereto in pursuance of said agreement. He insists that this was an important part of the consideration moving him to agree to convey part of the 200 acres to the plaintiff. Substantially the samo facts are averred in the second paragraph of the answer, but this averment was not responsive to anything contained in the bill.</p>

This he attempts to do by the testimony of himself, Hutchinson and Brokaw, the last witness testifying, as already stated, to alleged admissions by the plaintiff. Mr. Hayes testified: “When it came to selling Purpart B, which was the 200 acres, Mr. Hutchinson bid for me also. Ho and Mi1. Staib bid it up to, I think, $74 an acre, and they stopped for some reason or another, foi' some time.It stopped for some time and Mr. Staib and Mr. Hutchinson got to talking about bidding against one another, and they both came over to me and we agreed there to not bid against one another and to bid it in.Whatever was above the Victory line I was to deed to Mr. Staib, and he was to purchase the sixty-four acres of the Wiekerham Reserve Coal and deed it to me.” Q. “ At what price ? ” A. “ At $76 an <em>acre; </em>at the same price this was bid off, whatever that was: at the same price as the two hundred acres.” Upon cross-examination he was asked whose money was to be used in purchasing this coal. He answered, “ There was nothing said about money. He was to purchase it and deed it to me. There was nothing said about money at all.” He gives as a reason for not himself buying the Reserve coal that it was not up for sale.

He denies that, beyond this, the 64 acres had anything to do with the purchase of the 200 acres, or that his right to have the portion of the 200 acres for which he paid was in any way conditioned upon his obtaining title to the 64 acres.

We must, therefore, from all that was thus hurriedly said and done, endeavor as best we can, to arrive at the true intention of the parties at the time the contract was made and if possible exclude from the testimony, in our consideration of the matter, what appears to be an afterthought on the part of either of the parties. We have carefully read and studied the testimony with a view of ascertaining what was in the minds of the parties when they came to an agreement on the day of this sale, and our conclusion in regard to the 64 acres of Reserve coal is this: that its purchase was to be an after-consideration; the two hundred acres were then up for sale and they must act in regard to it immediately; the sixty-four acre tract belonged to another person and was not then in <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>tbe market; the proposition to buy it, we think, arose out of the suggestion of the defendant that it might turn out that more than half of the two hundred acre tract lay on Staib’s side of an appropriate dividing line, and that he would not get as much coal as Staib or would not get coal that was favorably located in reference to his river front, and that thus he would .fail to realize as much out of this joint-purchase of the two hundred acres as the plaintiff. Staib then proposed that he would buy, or could buy, the sixty-four acres some time in the future and that it and the two hundred acres could be divided so as to give each an equal amount of coal well located with reference to their front coal. The purchase of the Wickerham coal was proposed by Staib to quiet the fears of Hayes that he would not get an advantageous division of the two hundred acres on account of its location, which he knew nothing about.</p>

The defendant, however, claims that the two hundred acres was to be divided by the prolongation of the division line between the tracts of front coal belonging to the parties respectively, which if prolonged without deflection would give him one hundred and sixteen acres and the plaintiff eighty-four acres.

This contention involves an entire mis<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>conception of the purpose and meaning of the act of 1836. That act, if it has any application to a trust created under the circumstances here alleged, has no application to proceedings at law or in equity in respect of the title; it refers rather to the control and management of the trustee, where the trust has been created by deed or will, or has been otherwise established. In 1836, and for twenty years thereafter, ejectment was the only means by which a trust might be assorted against the holder of the legal title; and that, being a local action, was necessarily brought in the Common Pleas of the county where the lands were situated. It is absurd to suppose that the legislature intended that an ejectment might be brought in one county to recover the possession of lands lying in another county.</p>

The agreement of itself is nothing, of course; under the act of 1856 an express trust cannot exist by parol; if any trust was created, it must be implied from the payment of the purchase-money. The agreement is only important as it exhibits the purpose of the parties with reference to the payment; that is, to say, by the agreement it may appear that the money was applied, not as a loan, but in the purchase of the lands, or of some particular estate or specific interest therein, or of some designated part thereof; but the trust arises, if it arise at all, from the payment of the money at the inception of the title. “No oral agreements and no payments before or after the title, is taken will create a resulting trust, unless the transaction is such at the moment the title passes that a trust will result from it: ” Perry on Trusts, 133.</p>

The plaintiff having been called as a witness testified substantially in support of the bill, but he was not sustained by any other witness, and the only matter, by way of corroboration, which we have been able to find in the evidence, is the presumption which is supposed to arise from the fact that the parties contributed equally to the payment of the first two instalments of the purchase-money.</p>

He said he could buy the Reserve tract of sixty-four acres and have it deeded to Hayes, and that he would do that; then there would be plenty for both. Mr. Hutchinson brought the parties together; he says the matter was talked over between them in his presence, and that it was then and there agreed and well understood that Staib would have the sixty-four acres conveyed to Hayes; the price was not definitely fixed, but Staib said that he could get it at the same price per acre the two hundred acres would sell for at the Orphans’ Court sale, and that the Victory line should be extended straight through the two hundred acre tract; that after this agreement was concluded, the two hundred acre tract was knocked down to Staib at $76 per acre, but he directed the title to be made to Hayes in pursuance of the agreement between them.

Whether the trust was for the undivided half of the land or was for a particular or designated portion thereof in severalty, upon the terms stated by the defendant, is for the plaintiff to establish; the party who seeks to fasten a trust upon the legal title to land takes the burden of establishing it, and all the essential requisites of that trust must be shown by clear, explicit, and unequivocal proof: Earnest’s App., <a href="/pa/106/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="106 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="455720" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0310-01">106 Pa. 310</a>.

The plaintiff has shown <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>no title to the two hundred acres in common with the defendant, and, therefore, cannot have partition. If he is entitled to any interest in that land, his interest is in severalty and is confined to that portion of the tract above the prolongation of the Victory line. The plaintiff has obtained and now holds the title to the Reserve tract of sixty-four acres; he holds it in his own right and for his own use; he has not offered and does not now offer, upon being reimbursed for his outlay, to convey it to Hayes. He cannot complain, therefore, that Hayes declines to recognize his equity to any part of the land; for it is a fundamental principle or maxim that he who seeks equity must do equity; the court can give to the plaintiff the relief to which ho is entitled only upon condition that ho has given, or is ready and willing to give, the defendant such corresponding rights as he may be entitled to in respect of the subject-matter of the suit.</p>

The possession of one tenant in common, even though he be in the exclusive receipt of the profits, may be, and as a general rule is, treated as the possession of all for the purposes of a partition; the possession of one is the possession of all, unless by an actual ouster, or an exclusive pernancy of the profits, against the will of the others, one shall manifest a clear intention to hold the land adversely and in hostility to the common right. In this case it is clear that Staib has never had, nor does he pretend to have, any possession of the premises ; indeed, Hayes has admittedly been in the exclusive occupancy of the lands and pernancy of the profits ever since his purchase, and, at the filing of the bill, held in open and avowed hostility to the plaintiff. Having shown no title nor possession the plaintiff is certainly not entitled to a partition, and upon the same ground it is plain that his prayers for a discovery for an account, for an assessment of damages, and for other relief, must also be refused. For the recovery of such damages as he may have sustained by reason of the defendant’s invasion of the Victory Works, or for mining in the Reserve tract in excess of his rights, the law affords an adequate and proper remedy.</p>
