      <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>OPINION :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b379-4" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[229,412,1185,405]]]'>The pleadings in this matter raise questions of jurisdiction alone in respect of the alternative prayers. In the view which this court takes, that question only will be discussed which relates to its jurisdiction to compel the respondent, the Odd Fellows Savings Bank, to re-transfer the stock which James Marshall, Jr., fraudulently assigned while acting executor under the will of James Marshall, deceased. This court has such jurisdiction and should exercise it, and for these reasons:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[228,825,1186,240]]]'>1. It is immaterial, so far as the Odd Fellows Savings Bank is concerned, whether or not petitioner has an interest vested under the will, or contingent upon the action of the executors; for she alleges, and the executors do not deny, her beneficial interest.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b379-6" data-blocks='[["BL_379.6",379,[223,1083,1190,1230]]]'>2. The executors admit that they have neglected and refused to institute proceedings for the recovery of this stock, and that this stock is required in the administration of the estate. No reason is given for the failure to institute such proceedings. The default of the executors in this behalf surely makes this petitioner a party interested to quicken their action. It is not essential that she should attack the financial status of respondents, as a basis of relief. The due administration of the trust is a vital matter to her, and is sufficient. The executors are the officers of this court, and her trustees; and here is the only forum in which she can lay any complaint of, and correct their default. The 57th section of the act of March 29, 1832, P. L. 208, provides that the jurisdiction of this court may be invoked by “ petition of any one interested, whether such interest be immediate or remote, setting forth facts necessary to give the court jurisdiction, the specific cause of complaint, and the relief desired; ” and “ this is followed by all the means of enforcing the decree of the court possessed by courts of law and equity:” Mussleman’s App., <a href="/pa/65/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="65 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="430626" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0480-01">65 Pa. 480</a>, 489. The rule in chancery is that creditors may bring suit where their trustee refuses: Story’s Eq. PL, 516. But, even were this view doubtful, the position taken by the executors in this matter removes any difficulty in respect of a competent party complainant. They substantially ask to intervene.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b379-7" data-blocks='[["BL_379.7",379,[223,2321,1185,146]]]'>The amenability of respondent depends upon the existence of jurisdiction in this court over the subject matter in controversy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b380-3" data-blocks='[["BL_380.3",380,[235,353,1191,1687]]]'>
      <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>3. It will be conceded that this court has exclusive jurisdiction of the settlement of the estates of decedents; that within the orbit of its jurisdiction it has all the powers of a court of chancery, and that its jurisdiction must be maintained. The relation of these principles to the question involved is obvious. Possession of the assets of decedents is essential to the exercise of this jurisdiction. The whole machinery of the court contemplates and would be useless without it. Administration implies it. For this reason the Supreme Court, in Leiper v. Levis, 15 S. &amp; R. 108, held such assets exempt from execution, and in Mickle v. Miles, 1 Grr. 320, from distress. When once hi possession of this court, the assets of decedents are in the grasp of the law, and a well recognized rule forbids interference without leave: Kerr on Receivers, 165. Interference without such leave is, in courts of chancery, punishable as a contempt, and the power to enforce restoration follows as an incident. The power of this court hi respect of the assets of decedents is the same, and its jurisdiction must be maintained. It is immaterial through how many hands or transmutations these assets may have passed, if in fraud of the trust; so long as they can be identified they may be followed. Identification gives jurisdiction of the thing, and jurisdiction of the person who happens to be in possession necessarily follows; for the former would be useless without the latter. Those into whose hands assets may pass in fraud of the trust become thereby trustees ex maleficio, subject to the same rules and remedies as other trustees: Perry on Trusts, <em>245; </em>and, consequently, to the jurisdiction of this court as a court of equity: Brooke’s App., <a href="/pa/102/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="102 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="502722" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0150-01">102 Pa. 150</a>. The act of May 19, 1874, P. L. 207, was simply declarative of an existing remedy. If this court had the powers of a court of chancery, its power to maintain its jurisdiction by appropriate process follows as a logical deduction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[236,2052,1190,308]]]'>The possession of the assets of decedents by this court must necessarily be by executors, administrators and other trustees, who are its officers, just as the possession of courts of chancery is by its receivers and other officers: Beach on Receivers, § 239; and that possession is a trust which must be administered in the mode prescribed by law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[279,2362,1148,49]],["BL_381.1",381,[240,347,1187,408]]]'>It will be seen from the foregoing, that there are competent <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>parties and a subject matter in this proceeding within the jurisdiction. The Odd Fellows Savings Bank having wilfully interfered with this court’s possession of the assets mentioned in the petition, in violation of the trust under which they were held, must, in accordance with the principles stated in this opinion, make restoration. This is the direct and appropriate remedy, and avoids the additional expense and delay involved in the alternative prayer.</p>

The petition avers, and the demurrer admits, that said stock belongs to the estate of James Marshall, deceased; that it was wrongfully pledged by James Marshall, Jr., one of the executors of said estate, for his individual debt, and that appellants knew when the stock was pledged with them that it belonged to the estate of James Marshall. This leaves the single question whether the Orphans’ Court had jurisdiction in this proceeding to compel appellants to deliver up said stock to the parties legally entitled thereto.</p>

While its authority to try disputed questions of title may well be doubted, it is very certain that it has the control of the assets which admittedly belong to the estate of a decedent. It was held in Brooke’s App., <a href="/pa/102/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="102 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="502722" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0150-01">102 Pa. 150</a>, that the surety of a guardian who had received certain bonds belonging to the minor’s estate, could be compelled by the Orphans’ Court to deliver them up to the guardian notwithstanding an express stipulation in which the latter had joined that the bonds should remain ha his hands until the minor arrived at age. The act of May 19, 1874, P. L. 206, provides that the Orphans’ Court “shall have power to prevent by order, in the nature of writs of injunction, acts contrary to law or equity, prejudicial to property over which they shall have jurisdiction; provided that security shall be given as is now required by law in cases <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>of writs of injunction.” This act was but declaratory of the law as it stood prior to its passage, and if this were not so, the act in express terms gives the Orphans’ Court chancery powers, so far as an injunction is concerned, in regard to property over which it has jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b385-4" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[231,616,1181,809]]]'>The court had jurisdiction over this property for the reason that it belonged to the estate of James Marshall. It cannot be doubted that under the act of 1874, it had the power to issue a restraining order in the nature of an injunction to prevent the appellants from transferring this stock. This would be the exercise of a chaneeiy power expressly conferred upon the Orphans’ Court. This equitable jurisdiction having attached, it was sufficient to embrace every relief necessary for a full disposition of the case: Winton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/97/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="97 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="444820" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0385-01">97 Pa. 385</a>; Mc-Gowin v. Remington, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Pa.%2063" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="12 Pa. 63">12 Pa. 63</a>; Souder’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/57/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="57 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="1010408" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0498-01">57 Pa. 498</a>. When a cause is once within the grasp of a court of equity, or a court lawfully exercising equity powers, it has no need to call in the aid of a court of law. Its process is plastic, and its power is only limited by the necessities of the case, and by its duty to administer equity in accordance with established rules. In such case it needs no other court to finish its work.</p>
