Patterson, as trustee and agent for the life-tenants, entered into a contract with Frazier Brothers for the making of certain changes in the building so as to convert it into a hotel building. The work having been completed, and a balance due upon the contract left unpaid, Frazier Brothers apportioned said balance to the parcels owned by the several life-tenants and filed liens therefor, each lien setting forth: “The sum aforesaid being a debt contracted for the construction, erection and completion of said Patterson Block, now part of the Hotel Albemarle (the part thereof described), by said claimants continuously, within <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>six months last past, in and about the erection and construction of said building,” etc.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.4",436,[249,444,1189,767]]]'>The evidence was undisputed that the Patterson Block was originally a four story building, the ground floor consisting of store-rooms with large glass fronts, on Penn avenue and Sixth street; the second and third floors consisted of offices, and the fourth floor made up a large hall. The internal changes made by the plaintiffs were as follows: a floor was put in'above the fourth floor, making a fifth floor: partitions were made to divide the fourth and fifth floors off into rooms; the second and third floors were also so divided, hall-ways changed, doors cut, and some new windows made, the majority of them opening upon alleys in the rear. The only external change was by a new door put in the front of one of the store-rooms,_ which from a store-room was made the entrance into the hotel. The glass front and windows of the front were retained. The external appearance of the other store-rooms was unchanged.</p>

Under the act of assembly, in Allegheny county, to maintain a lien of this kind, on a building of this kind, there must be a new erection. That don’t mean it must be a new house built from the foundation up, because it has been held that that is not necessary; but the erection or building should be of such a character as that when the changes or alterations are made it will have assumed substantially a new form so as to indicate in fact a substantial change and be in substance and in effect a new building, and it seems to me that is really the main question in this case. Take a building like this, knock down a few partitions, run some other partitions across and use it for some other general purpose; the court would say, as a matter of law, <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>it did nob come within the lien law, because it was not in any shape or form a new erection. [But, where the alterations substantially change the entire character of the building, and particularly where there are any external changes made, or even where the internal changes are of such a character as to manifestly indicate that it is a substantially new structure, turning three or four buildings, if you choose into one, it may do. It does not then become a question of law. It is for the jury to say whether the changes have been so substantial and material as to make it really and in effect a new building, such as would be apparent and manifest to anybody looking at it. That is for the jury in this case to determine, and not for the court, and it is the main question, I think.] 4</p>

If it is the mere alteration of an old building, so as not to give it substantially a new character, so that it may be in effect and substantially a new building, then it does not come under our act of assembly of 1836, under which this lien is filed, and of course you must find for the defendants.</p>

The principle involved in that case is, that the change of the building must be so great and radical as to indicate to parties interested by general or casual, external observation or inspection, that an old structure has been changed into one substantially new. Tins may be done in some cases without any great change of the external appearances of a building. Thus, if a building containing a dry goods store, should have its internal arrangement radically changed, be turned into a flouring mill, <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>so that the change would be obvious by external inspection, I apprehend it would be treated as a new building under the lien law. In regard to the case in hand, the evidence shows there is some change in the external appearance of this building. One of these store-rooms was thrown into an entrance hall, and it was made the entrance into the hotel, which is obvious from looking at it; if you go along the building, you can see that it is different from the others, an absolute change there, that is obvious, as the evidence indicates. In regard to the changes in the case in hand, there is some change in external appearance, a very considerable one in internal arrangement by which it was changed from several purposes into one purpose, to wit, a hotel. It was used before as several stores, and it was thrown in a way together; so it is used now for the one common purpose, and that purpose is a hotel. The question is for you as to whether the block of buildings used as they were before the change, has by the alterations made, been changed into what constitutes in substance and in effect a new building. That is, has the structure of the building been so completely changed, that in common parlance, it may be properly called a new building or re-building. If so, it comes within the lien law. That is the very language of the Supreme Court in one case. “ If the structure of the building has been so completely changed, that in common parlance it may be called a new building or a re-building, it is within the lien law,” and that is a question for you to determine under the evidence. If so, it comes within the lien law and you should find for the plaintiffs. If you should find that it is not so, that the building has not been so changed, you should find for the defendants. If you find for the plaintiffs, you take the whole amount of the claim and divide it by three.3.....</p>

The court instructed as matter of law that the change of purpose and of interior arrangement is the essential thing, and that if this is indicated by any external change, however slight, or even if there be no external change, provided the internal change is of such a character as to be obvious from external observation, it will constitute a new erection. This amounted to a binding instruction that the changes in this building, as a matter of law, constituted a new building; whereas the instruction should have been that under the undisputed evidence the changes did not constitute a new erection and the liens were not valid.</p>

Whether the work covered by these liens constituted a new building, or simply the alteration and construction of an old one, we submit was a question to be left to the jury.
