The estimated value of her property was $13,588.52. George Murdy was appointed committee, qualified, and entered upon the discharge of his duties. Mrs. Hazlett died on Thursday, March 15, 1888. Until with<a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>in a few months of her death she seems to have been permitted to select her place of abode, and resided with different families successively. She had no known blood relatives. In July, 1887, with the permission of her committee, she visited certain relatives of her late husband, in whom she seems to have taken an interest, and while there she executed a will in which she made these relatives her principal beneficiaries. She complained to them of harsh treatment on the part of Murdy, her committee; expressed great fear of him since he had attempted suicide, and importuned them to have him removed from the trust. In accordance with her request, proceedings were instituted on July 21,1887, and the committee filed an account, to which exceptions were taken, and an auditor was appointed, before whom the matter is still pending. On October 22, 1887, Murdy, the committee, removed Mrs. Hazlett from the custody of her husband’s relatives, forcibly and against her protest, and took her to his own house, where she remained until the time of her death.</p>

Sunday forenoon Mr. Quaill spent in conversation with Mrs. Hazlett, and in the afternoon a will was drawn by him and executed by Mrs. Hazlett in which Murdy and his family were made the principal beneficiaries. One of the witnesses to the fact of execution of the will was the brother-in-law of Murdy, and the other his laborer. Murdy himself seems to have been in the room twice for short periods during the day, but said nothing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[256,2049,1191,363]],["BL_487.1",487,[196,340,1186,664]]]'>On the day Mrs. Hazlett died, the two subscribing witnesses came to the register’s office with a view to probate, but on the advice of Murdy’s attorney they left and returned on the following day. Murdy had accompanied them part of the way on the first day. This will was in the possession of Mr. Quaill from the time of its execution until its offer to probate. Murdy denied that he knew the purport of the business for which <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>Mr. Quaill’s sendees were desired by Mrs. Hazlett, or knew a will bad been executed, until after Mrs. Hazlett’s death; but the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that he did know. A caveat having been filed to the admission of the will to probate, the proponents called upon the caveators for proof of interest. The will of July, under which the caveators claimed, was thereupon produced, and the testamentary capacity of testatrix at the date of its execution established. The proponents of the November will then examined the subscribing witnesses as to the fact of execution, and Mr. Quaill as to the testamentary capacity of testatrix on the day of execution, and also other witnesses as to her mental condition near that date.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[179,1012,1231,1231]]]'>The register refused to admit this will to probate; whereupon the present appeal was taken and a demand for issue was made. At the hearing before this court the case was submitted on the testimony taken before the register. Counsel for appellant having contended that the testimony offered by the caveators in support of the will of July, raised a presumption of continued sanity, this court intimated that such was the ordinary rule, but that the decree of lunacy without lucid intervals had reversed the ordinary rule; and thereupon counsel asked that he be permitted to offer additional testimony as to testamentary capacity, which was granted. The testimony shows that at the date of the writing of November, 1887, Mrs. Hazlett had such knowledge of the objects and subjects of her bounty as persons of her advanced age ordinarily possess, but that she was very easily influenced by those who immediately surrounded her. The testimony also shows that the only persons to whom Mrs. Hazlett expressed a wish as to this alleged disposition of her estate were George Murdy, her committee, who, with his family, are the principal beneficiaries, and Mr. Quaill, his counsellor; and Mr. Quaill’s only opportunity of testing her capacity was in her committee’s house. The circumstances leading up to the day on which the paper was executed rest in the testimony of the committee alone.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[236,391,1216,468]]]'>It may be conceded that, leaving out of consideration the element of trust relation which, existed as between the alleged testatrix and her- principal beneficiary, the evidence submitted would be sufficient to justify the grant of an issue devisavit vel non. But upon the whole case this court is of opinion and finds that the writing propounded as the last will of Mrs. Hazlett cannot be sustained, and an issue must therefore be refused. The reasons which have led to this conclusion are, briefly stated, these:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[239,856,1228,931]]]'>1. The alleged will is in contravention of public policy. Mrs. Hazlett had been adjudged a lunatic without lucid intervals by a court of competent jurisdiction, and that finding was still, in contemplation of law, in full force and virtue at the date of execution of this writing. Her committee, intrusted by the same jurisdiction with the custody and care of her person and estate, could not become her beneficiary, because, so far as he was concerned, it was inconsistent with his official relation to her. He was invested by authority of law with dominion over her person and estate, because she was incapable of intelligent action. Dominion in him was inconsistent with testamentary disposition by her. He could not divest himself of his office at will, much less pervert it to his personal profit. Any other theory than this must necessarily place the estate of this helpless class at the mercy of the committee. The policy of law is to throw every safeguard around the. administration of trusts, and by taking away the power prevent abuse.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b488-6" data-blocks='[["BL_488.6",488,[246,1782,1213,624]],["BL_489.1",489,[206,363,1185,199]]]'>There is a class of cases in which it has been held that where one who stands in a confidential relation to a testator with impaired faculties at the time of making the will, receives a considerable benefit therein, a presumption of undue influence arises and the burden of proof is shifted on him to show that such benefit was the result of free and unbiased action on the part of testator: Culbertson’s App., <a href="/pa/84/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="84 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="1053539" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0303-01">84 Pa. 303</a>. This is a liberal extension of the power of testamentary disposition. But no court has gone so far as to hold that a will made by one judicially found to be a lunatic without lucid intervals, in favor of the committee in charge of his person and estate, can be sustained by any measure of proof, and thus practically set <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>aside the finding without tbe intervention of tbe tribunal which made it. This ease does not come within the reason of the rule, but as already seen, comes within the prohibition of public policy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b489-4" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[195,569,1202,1703]]]'>2. But assume that the case does come within the rule of Culbertson’s Appeal, supra, and like cases, the evidence falls far short of overcoming the presumption of undue influence. There is no evidence, other than that of the committee himself, that Mrs. Hazlett, either before or after the day of execution of the writing propounded here as her will, expressed any intention or desire to make such a will or confer any benefit on the committee or his family. Although a person of admittedly weak mind, and easily influenced, there is no evidence that she consulted any disinterested person in reference to the matter. On the other hand, the evidence of her hostility to her committee and of her intention to give her estate to others, when she was not under his dominion, is strong and direct. Her expressions of friendship for and gratitude to her committee were confided to his counsel alone on the single occasion of the making of the alleged will, and these were made under circumstances which only tend to strengthen the presumption of undue influence. The frequent expressions by Mrs. Hazlett of fear of her committee, and the execution of a will in favor of her late husband’s relatives, who would naturally be the objects of her bounty, shortly before her forcible removal to her committee’s house; the execution of the writing now offered as her will after such forcible removal from the care of her husband’s relatives, while under the committee’s dominion and in his house : the committee’s persistent and successful efforts, pending exceptions to his account and proceedings for his removal from the trust, to induce his attorney in those proceedings to go out to his house to make her will; -and the committee’s denial of knowledge of the purposes of his attorney’s visit, are facts, which go to show directly undue influence. If under such circumstances a will can be sustained, no man’s property is safe from the wiles of designing men who have been invested with trusts.</p>

Not only did the witnesses called by the proponents testify to mental capacity when the paper offered for probate was executed, but the caveators and those interested in the paper dated July 16, 1887, all testified to the mental capacity of the testator at that date. The law presumes mental capacity, and it also presumes the continuance of a condition once established. To consider the credibility and weigh the testimony of witnesses offered to overcome a presumption, is peculiarly the province of a jury, not of the court. Hence, when the execution of a testamentary paper is proved, it is error to refuse an issue, or withhold it from the jury on the ground that the evidence shows that the person by whom it was executed was incapable of understanding the nature of the act. This would be to decide as matter of law that which is purely a matter of fact: Rees v.

The testatrix was an old woman with a large estate, who had been duly found a lunatic in 1883, without lucid intervals. The appellant, George Murdy, was appointed the committee of her person and estate, and so continued down to the time, of her death. She had no blood relations, and in July, 1887, was’ permitted by her committee to visit some relations of her deceased husband. She complained to them of harsh treatment on the part of Murdy, and importuned them to have him removed from the trust. In obedience to her request proceedings were commenced against him, which resulted in his filing an account. The account was referred to an auditor, and is still pending. In October, 1887, Murdy forcibly took her away from her friends and removed her to his own house, where she remained until the time of her death. Whilst in his house and under his control he procured from her a will giving to himself and wife the bulk of her estate.</p>

It would require very strong evidence to sustain a will under such circumstances as these. The appellant not only occupied a confidential relation to the testatrix but he had power and control over her by virtue of his position as her committee. When to this is added the fact that she was a lunatic, without lucid intervals, duly found so by inquisition, the attempt to set up this will seems almost grotesque, to use no harsher word.</p>
