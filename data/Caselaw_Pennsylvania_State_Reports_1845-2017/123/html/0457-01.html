The purchase was made in open market in two lots, one of which was minuted in the broker’s book as follows: “ Pittsburgh, May 15, 1854, of J. O. Fisher &amp; Co., 45,000 barrels United at 83|-; storage paid and deliverable. J. C. Fisher, seller.” There was a similiar contract made for 5000 barrels, signed by C. C. Beggs &amp; Co., sellers. Under the rules of the exchange, the oil could not be delivered until the following day, when it must be delivered through the exchange clearing house by the sellers in certificates, accepted, taken out' and paid for by the broker before the close of ^business. The plaintiff notified the defendant of the purchase immediately after it was made, and of the money required to pay for the oil. The next morning, May 16th, the defendant sent this order: “S. B. Thompson: Sell spot oil flat at best; we cannot take care of it. Lou. 5, 16, ’84.” This order reached the plaintiff about 11: 30 A. M., after the oil had been delivered to him in the clearing house, but before it had been taken out by <em>him; </em>thereupon he went upon the floor and offered 61,000 barrels of oil, including that he had for the defendant, and it was taken by J.

In all transactions between a customer and his broker, on the exchange, the wager, if any, must of necessity be either between the customer and the broker, as principals between themselves, or between the customer and third parties, through the broker as agent.

Now, as the plaintiff had no interest in the transaction in question, aside from his fixed commissions, and no margins had been put up, it follows that the wager, if any, could not have been between plaintiff and defendant as principals, as they occupied the position of principal and agent, and it must be shown to have been between plaintiff and the parties with whom he dealt as agent for the defendant. But members of the firm of Fisher &amp; Co. and Beggs &amp; Co. testified that b'oth firms made the sale on the 15th, that they intended to deliver, and they actually did deliver through the clearing house, and that they were paid for their oil.

    <p id="b483-6" data-blocks='[["BL_483.6",483,[212,1164,1182,1130]]]'>We think it was error to withdraw this case from the jury. It may be that the purchase of oil was a gambling transaction, and that the jury might have found it so. But the case depended upon the oral testimony, and that was for the jury. The learned judge instructed them that “under all the evidence in the case your verdict must be for the defendant.” This withdrew from the jury the question of the credibility of the witnesses. It is true the principal testimony tending to show that this was a gambling transaction, came from the plaintiff himself. At the same time if, as the plaintiff testified, this was a bona fide purchase of oil, and the only reason why a full delivery was not made was that such delivery was prevented by the positive instruction of the defendant the next morning to sell the oil for cash, and the sale in pursuance of such instructions was to the same party from whom the plaintiff had bought it, there was a question left for the jury. Had the instruction of the court been that if the jury believed from the evidence that there was no delivery and no intended delivery of the oil, but that it was a mere sale upon a margin with the intent to settle for differences, the case would have been free from difficulty. As it stands we think the question of its being a wagering transaction should have been left to the jury.</p>
