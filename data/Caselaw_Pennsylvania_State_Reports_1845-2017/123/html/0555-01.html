And that kind of evidence has been ascertained by experience to be little, if any, less satisfactory than that which is known as direct or positive. Where a wilful, deliberate murder contemplated beforehand is committed, it seldom occurs that direct, positive evidence respecting it can be produced. As was said by Chief Justice GibsON in the case of the Commonwealth v. Harman, <a href="/pa/4/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="401909" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0269-01">4 Pa. 269</a>: “ The only difference between positive and circumstantial evidence is, that the former is more immediate, and has fewer links in the chain of connection between the premises and conclusion; but there may be perjury in both. A man may as well swear falsely to an absolute knowledge of a fact, as to a number of facts, by which, if true, the question of guilt or innocence is solved. No human testimony is superior to doubt. The machinery of criminal justice, like every other production of man, is necessarily imperfect, but you are not therefore to stop its wheels. Innocent men have doubtless been convicted and executed on circumstantial evidence; but innocent men have sometimes been convicted and executed on.what is called positive proof. [All evidence is more or less circumstantial, the difference being only in the degree; and it is sufficient for the purpose when it excludes disbelief, that is actual disbelief; for he who is to pass on the question is not at liberty to disbelieve as a juror while he believes as a man.] 14 It is enough that his conscience is clear.”</p>

In the last named case, Mr. Justice Meiicuu said substantially that when a judge prominently presents in his charge the theory and strong features of the case of the prosecution, and the facts on which it is based, this constitutes a cause for reversal. Moreover, the court erred in not charging the jury that they might convict the defendant of manslaughter ; the whole tenor of the charge being that they must convict him of murder of the first degree, or acquit him. “ I hold it to be the duty of a judge trying a man for his life, to charge fully upon the law as applicable to the facts; and this without regard to the points presented by counsel: ” Meyers v.

It is well settled that the sheriff, as the principal conservator of the peace for his county, has full power to make arrests for disturbing the public peace or for the commission of other criminal offences, upon view, with or without warrant, and in case of murder, to arrest upon mere suspicion, with or without warrant. In the performance of his official duty, liis individual capacity is almost wholly absorbed or lost sight of. Under the provisions of the act of April 10, 1867, P.

Though the grand jury returned the bill of indictment on the-same day the hearing on the writ of habeas corpus began, yet from the very nature of the proceedings there could be no denial or abridgment of the defendant’s rights. Here were two separate and distinct proceedings instituted in two different courts, each of which had exclusive jurisdiction over its own subject matter. It would be mere usurpation for one court to inquire into the regularity of the proceedings of another : Williamson’s Case, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Pa.%2024" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="26 Pa. 24">26 Pa. 24</a>.

From the examination in its entirety of each juror, where the challenge for cause was overruled, and the fact that it was stated distinctly that if sworn to try the defendant the juror could and would make up Ms verdict wholly from the evidence, the juror was clearly competent.

Morrow, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Phila.%20583" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="9 Phila. 583">9 Phila. 583</a>, it was said: “ A contrary doctrine would exclude from the jury-box, in all cases of great public importance, the most intelligent class of jurors, those who read the papers and receive therefrom impressions from passing events.

It discloses a murder perpetrated by lying in wait and to accomplish a robbery. The defendant in this record affirms that there are errors in it which contributed to his conviction, and he brings it here for inspection. The alleged errors are contained in fifteen specifications which we will pass upon in their order.</p>

It is contended in support of these motions that the finding by the grand jury of an indictment against the defendant pending the hearing on the habeas corpus allowed on his application, was irregular, illegal, and an abridgment of his rights under the writ, and that the sheriff, having made the information on wlrich the warrant for his arrest was issued, could not lawfully participate in the drawing of the petit jurors.</p>

No decision of this pr any court has been cited to sustain this view of the law, and the counsel who advocate it confess that their research has failed to discover one. They direct our attention to a remark of the present Chief Justice of this court in Commonwealth v. Bartilson, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20Pa.%20488" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="85 Pa. 488">85 Pa. 488</a>, which we quote in connection with the language which explains it: “We do not deny the power of the court to quash an indictment for matters not appearing on its face. This is sometimes done for defects in the process of drawing and summoning the grand jury, or irregularities connected with the jury wheel, and where an indictment is found pending a writ of habeas corpus. It is a power, however, that should be exercised with great caution, especially where it is for some defect of proof.” In the case in which this language appears, the quashing of an indictment by the court below for defect of proof was held to be error. The remarks quoted were made in discussing and illustrating the power of the court to quash an indictment for matters not appearing upon its face, and did not announce, and were not intended to declare, that it was the duty of the court in all cases to quash an indictment found pending a writ of habeas corpus. As the statute of limitations in criminal procedure runs from the commission of the offence until indictment found, cases might occur where the rule contended for would defeat justice by suspending or setting aside proceedings necessary to save a prosecution from the bar of the statute. We have been referred to the case of Commonwealth v. Hoey, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Phila.%20370" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="8 Phila. 370">8 Phila. 370</a>, as supporting the view of the plaintiff in error, but we do not so regard it. It decides that the pendency of a writ of habeas corpus in another court <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>is not cause for suspending or setting aside proceedings in tlie court baying jurisdiction of tlie offence. In our case, tbe court of Oyer and Terminer bad jurisdiction of tbe crime witb wbicb tbe defendant was charged, and proceedings there could not be disturbed or affected by tbe pendency of a writ of habeas corpus allowed on his petition in tbe Court of Common Pleas. We cannot convict the court below of error for refusing to quash the indictment, or to arrest judgment on the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b593-4" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[176,764,1182,1339]]]'>No misconduct is imputed to the sheriff in the drawing of the petit jury. If there was any irregularity, favor, or prejudice in the act of drawing, it is not charged or shown. Indeed it is difficult to perceive how the sheriff, could, in the presence of the jury commissioners and without their complicity, exhibit partiality in it. The selection of jurors is an act which involves the exercise of a sound discretion, and is judicial, while the mere drawing of a jury under our present law is a ministerial act in which there is no room for bias. The sheriff was not a party to the issue, and he had no interest in it except in' common with all good citizens. As a conservator of the peace and in aid of public justice he made <em>the </em>information on which the warrant wrns issued. An information made under the circumstances and in the manner of this one is not a disqualification of the officer making it, and does not interfere with the discharge of his official duties which are merely ministerial. A suspicion or belief cannot exceed in disqualifying power, actual and personal knowledge, and an avowal of the former can have no greater effect than the statement of the latter. Whether the avowal or statement be oral or written, is of no consequence. If the sheriff had been an eye witness of the crime and had arrested the perpetrator on view of it, he would have discharged a plain duty and no disqualification would have resulted from his knowdedge or his action upon it. We conclude that the refusal of the court below to quash the array of petit jurors was not error.</p>

As a fixed opinion denies to evidence its proper effect, and prevents an impartial trial, it is a disqualification of the juror. Whether the juror has such an opinion, is to be determined upon evidence, and the usual and proper practice is to examine him on his voir dire as to the opinion he has formed. If from the evidence elicited by such examination it is found that he has a fixed opinion, the challenge is sustained; if it is not so found, the challenge is overruled. The disposition of the challenge depends on the finding of a fact, and in passing upon such finding here, we must consider the evidence as a whole and remember that the examination was in the presence and under the direction of the court below and that it had better opportunity to discover the nature and character of the opinion held by the juror than is afforded this court in review.</p>

An isolated answer is not decisive of the question under investigation, but it must be determined upon the whole evidence affecting it. A careful study of the evidence of jurors Riggle, White, South, and Dulaney has failed to convince us that either of them had a disqualifying opinion. We think that under the decisions of this court in Staup v. The Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/74/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="74 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1034729" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0458-01">74 Pa. 458</a>, and the subsequent cases on this subject, they were competent jurors.

To the objection that this evidence, if admissible at all, could only be received in rebuttal, the answer is, that the order of the testimony was in the dis<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>cretion of the court below. It is true that the observation of the witness was made in March when there were no leaves ou the trees, but it is not claimed that there were trees in the line of vision between those points, or that any obstruction was in that lino in September, that was not there in March.
