Scott, the use plaintiff, purchased the original judgment, No. 5 May Term, 1879, in good faith, relying on the defendant Jacob Duvall’s certificate of no defence, there can be no doubt that Duvall is completely estopped thereby from setting up the defence of usury, even though Scott may have relied also upon the verbal guaranty of the legal plaintiff. But it is equally clear that if, as alleged, the certificate was obtained by Miller under an arrangement with Scott for the purpose of heading off ” Duvall, and compelling him to pay the judgment in full with the usurious interest included, there is no estoppel; the case stands as if there had been no assignment of the original judgment; and Duvall’s right to have it purged of the excessive interest is unquestionable.

If he did, then the defendant is estopped from asking a credit for the usurious interest paid to Mr. Miller, and your verdict should be for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim. On the other hand, if you believe Mr. Scott has not given a true or <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>full statement of the manner in and the purpose for which he purchased the judgment, and that he was acting in collusion with Miller, and the sale of this judgment was not made in in good faith but was made for the purpose of assisting Mr. Miller in collecting more money from Duvall than he himself otherwise could have collected by law, then the defence of usury can be set up against Mr. Scott, and the defendant will be entitled to a credit on the principal debt of the interest paid Miller in excess of six per cent. In passing on the question of good faith on the part of Mr. Scott, you will carefully consider all the testimony in the case. The allegation is that Mr. Scott acted in collusion with Mr. Miller; that they conspired together to collect from Duvall this usurious interest, and the certificate of no defence necessary to accomplish their purpose was obtained from Duvall for this purpose.] 3 Such conduct on the part of Miller and Scott would be a fraud on the rights of Duvall. Fraud is never to be presumed, but must be clearly and satisfactorily proven, or facts must be clearly and satisfactorily proven from which fraud can be fairly inferred. Mere suspicion is not sufficient, but the testimony must rise to the dignity of satisfactory proof. It is not necessary for us to refer to the testimony in the case. You will readily recall it without assistance from the court. [The only controverted question, in our opinion, in the case, as we have already said, is as to the character of the purchase of this judgment: was it sham, or'was it a bona fide purchase ?] 3 . . .,. .</p>

It is one of those eases where, if you believe the testimony of the plaintiff, he is entitled to recover; if however, there is in the facts surrounding the transaction sufficient to produce a conviction in your minds that Mr. Miller and Mr. Scott were perpetrating what really would be a fraud upon this party, and that this assignment was a sham, then your verdict should be .for the defendant. Of course, if this certificate of no defence had nothing to do with the purchase of this judgment, and you think Mr. Scott was falsifying when he said-it did, it would amount to nothing; it would not avail him anything if he purchased solely on the guaranty of Mr. Miller. But if it in any degree influenced <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>him to buy the judgment, then Mr. Duvall is bound by the certificate, and he will have to stand the consequence of signing it; because he (Scott} had a right to rely upon both the certificate and guaranty, but if he relied on the guaranty and didn’t rely upon the certificate, then he would have to stand the credit of the usurious interest. [Now, the plaintiff asks me to take this case from the jury and say that there was no evidence of collusion between Mr. Scott and Mr. Miller, and that the defendant is not entitled to credit for the usury he has paid. This judgment was opened by Judge Hart, who directed an issue to be formed that these very questions should be submitted to a jury, and therefore I consider it is my duty to submit them to you regardless of wbat my opinion would be; 1 therefore leave the questions to you for your determination. You are the proper judges of the credibility of witnesses.] :! The agreement of counsel as to the amount of the verdict is, that if you believe this transfer was valid and Mr. Scott was influenced in any degree by the certificate of no defence, then your verdict will be for tbe plaintiff for $500.01, the amount handed to you by Mr. Dougan; on tbe other band, if you believe be purchased entirely independent of the certificate of no defence, or that this sale on his part as well as Mr. Miller’s was not in good faith, then yon will find in favor of the plaintiff for $91.87, the amount handed you by Mr. Irwin.</p>

Prima facie, the certificate of no defence fully protected Scott in his claim to have the entire amount of the revived judgment. To overcome the certificate, the burden was upon the petitioner to produce evidence that the assignment under which Scott claimed was merely colorable; that no real interest passed or was intended to pass from Miller to Scott, and that Miller still owned the judgment. It is believed that the measure of proof would be that prescribed in English’s App., <a href="/pa/119/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="119 Pa. 533" data-case-ids="558129" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0533-01">119 Pa. 533</a>, namely, clear, precise and indubitable.

Of course, what was in the minds of the parties cannot be shown by direct evidence, but does not the whole transaction expose the fact that the assignment, with the procurement and use of the certificate, was colorable, — a trap to obtain a revival judgment by adverse process, and a levy and sale of defendant’s property, in order to defeat the credits to which defendant was entitled?

Scott, the use-plaintiff, assigned the judgment to Scott. It also appeared that Scott had bought the judgment upon the faith of a certificate of no defence signed by Jacob Duvall. Scott then caused the judgment to be revived against Jacob Duvall, the other defendant, Alexander Duvall, being then deceased, and a return of mortuus est as to him. After the entry of judgment upon the scire facias, No. 134 May Term 1885, for $692.57, Jacob Duvall presented his petition to the court below, praying that both the original judgment and the judgment upon the .scire facias be opened, and that he be let into a defence.

I quote his testimony in full upon this point: Q. In your petition you say that you aver, believe, and expect to be able to prove that the assignment by Scott to Miller was merely colorable, and that no real interest in said judgment passed, or was intended to pass, by the same to A. D. Scott; and that said judgment is still owned by the said James M. Miller. A. I did believe it at the time that was drawn up. Q. State any facts within your own knowledge that led you to make that assertion. A. Just; because the way Miller talked to me. He always told me he had to do this, and did not tell me anything else, only that he’d done it. Q. That is the reason you made that assertion in this petition? A. Yes, sir; the way he talked to me I thought he still held the notes yet and owned it. Q. Any other reason than that ? A. I don’t mind just now.</p>
    <p id="b183-5" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[228,1669,1184,303]]]'>This is all there is in the case. On the other hand, Mr. Scott testified that he bought the judgment upon the faith of the certificate, and paid for it in cash the sum of 1520. He is corroborated by Miller, and they both deny everything that Duvall testified to that is of any importance touching the consideration and good faith of the transfer.</p>
    <p id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.6",183,[227,1981,1183,198]]]'>It will thus be seen that the judgment was opened, resulting in an expensive jury trial, without so much as a scintilla of evidence to support the material averments of the petition. It is hardly necessary for us to say that this was error.</p>

Aside from this, the case went to the jury upon substantially the same testimony as was taken upon the rule to open the judgment. There was not a scintilla of proof to show that the assignment of the judgment was collusive.</p>
