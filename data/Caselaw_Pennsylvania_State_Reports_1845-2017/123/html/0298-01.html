To meet the requirements of the statute, the whole agreement must be in writing, and certainly the subject matter is an essential part of every contract. The receipt fails to describe the land, either as to quantity, dimensions, or location. Nor are there such other matters of description, as in Smith’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Pa.%2047" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="69 Pa. 47">69 Pa. 47</a>, and Ross v.

Staver, <a href="/pa/33/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="33 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="988379" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0411-01">33 Pa. 411</a>.</p>

Nor was the case helped by the attempt to prove the delivery of the drafts or papers at the time of the signing of the receipt; for, oven if they sufficiently described the land, and they did not, there was no reference to these papers in the receipt, and their connection could only be shown by parol evidence, which is not in accordance with the statute, and that is all the plaintiff proposed to do. We admit that it is not requisite that all the parts of a contract, to be good under the statute, should be contained in one paper; but it is abundantly settled by the authorities that where the contract is made up of several papers or letters, they must be so connected by written links as to form one written contract: Sugden on Vendors, 14th ed., 205; Tyson v.

The drafts were not, either of them, attached to the receipt, nor were they referred to, nor was the receipt referred to in the drafts. No date or signature was upon the drafts. They were mere pencil sketches such as could be made or altered at any time without detection. It may be admitted, for the sake of the argument,- that if the drafts had been attached properly or referred to in the receipt in such shape as to identify them, that a surveyor could locate the land, being assisted by sufficient evidence to make a starting-point on the ground, or, in other words, to apply a complete description to the land on the ground.</p>

It cannot be by parol. It is by parol if it requires verbal testimony to prove any essential part of it. In this case the land could not be identified or described without parol testimony. The receipt did not help the draft, nor the draft the receipt. One could have been made for one person, the other for another : the receipt could travel over any piece of land in the ward, and the draft could describe any part of a tract which might have been the subject-matter of negotiation. The two were in no way tied together, and to attempt to join them by parol evidence, would open the door which is shut by the statute. Among numerous authorities, we refer to Hammer v.
