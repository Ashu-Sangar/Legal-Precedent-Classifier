It was also arranged, as was claimed, that the defendant should take the 10. acres under the option of purchase; and, on April 28, 1883, the mining company notified the White heirs “ that the said company will purchase said land according to the conditions of said agreement.” On March 21, 1883, a deed was executed by the White heirs to the Mercer M. &amp; M. Co. for the 10 acres, which deed, however, was not then delivered. At a later date, the defendant made a contract for the grading of the switch, and on August 13, 1883, a paper signed by “ Hubbard Mining and Manufacturing Company, per D. H. Williams,” was served upon the White heirs which read: “You may give Mr. Muldoon the privilege to enter the 10 acre lot and do his grading. The deed will be taken up and the money paid over this week. The Mercer mining company will make us a transfer of title <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>and all will be satisfactory.” On October 15, 1888, a notice signed by J.

Williams, agent of Jesse Hall, authorizes me to give notice to said Heirs that Jesse Hall is ready and willing to perform the whole contract in behalf of the Mercer M. &amp; M.

If that be so, it is argumentative, and strongly so, to the effect that what the company did thereafter, they didnot for themselves, but for Mr. Hall; and yet, as Mr. Hall was not present at that time, if he gave no authority for them so to do, he would not be bound by it, unless he ratified what was done without authority at a subsequent time. But if he did ratify subsequently what was done at that time without his express authority by accepting its benefit, then he would be as much bound by it as he would if he had authorized it before it was made. Now in the subsequent transactions which resulted in the making of ■ the agreement of February 3,1883, who, does it appear, according to your convictions, was the real beneficiary in the lease ? Whom was the lease being made to, and to whom was the option of sale being made ? And by that I do not mean in the intent of the White heirs, but as between the Mercer M. &amp; M. Co. and Mr. Hall. Was the company then acting for itself to procure rights and privileges for itself, or was the company by its agents acting then to procure rights and privileges for Mr. Hall under his direction or under his subsequent ratification. If the company were procuring privileges for themselves and for their own right, it would be a very different matter than it would be if they were acting for Mr. Hall and procuring privileges for him under an agreement previously made that they would do so.] 3 At the time of the original agreement or the sub-lease on February 1,1883, Mr. Williams states that it was essential, as they considered, to the enjoyment or the use of the eighty acres, that they should have the rights and privileges for making an opening, etc., upon a part of that eighty acres of land. If that be true, that they so considered, and if that agreement was made by the authority of Mr. Hall, given at the time or prior thereto or subsequently ratified by him, and if Mr. Hall entered into possession of the land and made improvements upon it under <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>tbat agreement, be could bold the land against the Mercer M. &amp; M. Co., and if be were the real party who was negotiating there and whom the company represented, be would be bound by their agreement; or, if he subsequently thus entered into possession of the land and promised to pay the purchase money which was not yet due, and made improvements upon it, and the land was purchased by the company for him, that would likewise bind Mr. Hall in this suit and he would be responsible. It is true Mr. Hall would not be liable in this suit if he was not in a position to claim the land and to hold the land which he entered into possession of. If there was no right on his part to hold this land, there would be no right on the part of the plaintiffs to recover from him the purchase money for it. But if the facts which I have stated as being sufficient to enable the plaintiffs to recover for this land, are shown by the evidence, Mr. Hall could hold the land and his responsibility for the purchase money would be fixed. [There is one fact to which you should direct attention, and it has been presented to you by the counsel upon both sides, and it is this: Whether the company at the time of the closing of the negotiation on February 1, 1883, undertook, without pay from Mr. Hall to the Whites or anybody else, to acquire the rights and privileges which Mr. Hall desired. If that was the agreement between the parties, Mr. Hall would not be hable in this suit; but if the agreement then was that the company or its agents would procure an agreement from the Whites for Mr. Hall, securing to him certain privileges, but that he would fulfil the conditions of the agreement, then that would be such an agreement as, with the other facts presented, would entitle the plaintiffs to recover in this case.] 4 Now, how was that? Was it the agreement between the parties that Mr. Hall should have those privileges without paying anything for them? Was that part of the matters for which he already paid in the agreement of February 1, 1883, or was the company’s obligation merely to act for him in getting those privileges, but that he would pay whatever they would cost to the Whites ? The evidence does not disclose, so far as I recall it, that anything on that subject was said on the day of the transfer, to wit, on February 1,1883, and what the agreement of the parties was, you must discover from the other evidence in the case, and an interpreta<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>tion of that agreement, or, the agreement in that particular can be had by the subsequent conduct of the parties. Did they in their subsequent treatment of this article of February 8, 1888, treat it as though the Mercer M. &amp; M. Co. were to pay what was to be paid for the rights and privileges to be acquired in that land, or that Mr. Hall himself was to pay therefor ? I believe that with the answers to the defendant’s points in the ease the instructions given to you will cover this case, and I will not undertake a discussion of the evidence.</p>

Can a written contract between A. and B. for land, become a contract between A. and C. for that land, or can C. become a party thereto so as to be liable to A. for the consideration, except by a written contract with B. to pay his debt to A ? We concede he cannot hold the land from A. and that A. can dispossess him by ejectment, but that is not the ques<a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>tion. Even if C. were to take possession under B.’s contract, that would not make him personally liable to A. C. being a stranger to the contract between A. and B., not a party thereto, and that contract being for land, he could obtain no interest therein except by writing signed. And the consideration being the debt of another, B., C. could not be liable for it to A., except by writing duly signed.</p>

Our eighth point, that the tender of a deed would be a condition precedent to the right of plaintiffs to recover, should have been affirmed. Had this been an action of covenant by the plaintiffs, would they not have been compelled to tender a deed before suit brought ? And that from the very nature of the transaction, not from the form of the action, but because they would have no right of action until performance or tender of performance on their part. Why should any different principle apply when the action is assumpsit ?</p>

If this were all, there would be nothing to connect the defendant below with the contract. The jury have found, however, and upon abundant evidence, that the Mercer Mining and Manufacturing Company were but the agents of the defendant; that they negotiated the transaction for him, and that in pursuance thereof he entered into the possession of the land and made certain improvements thereon. Under such circumstances it is horn-book law that the vendors had the right to sue the principal for whose benefit the contract was made. The mere fact that they might have pursued the agent, does not deprive them of the right to proceed against the principal when discovered.</p>

In other words, that the Mercer Mining and Manufacturing Company were to pay for it, and the benefit thereof to accrue to the defendant as their lessee. This raised a question of fact for the jury, and unfortunately for the defendant they have found it against him. It was fairly submitted, and a careful examination of the testimony satisfies us that the verdict is fully sustained thereby. It would serve no useful purpose for us to recapitulate the testimony and discuss it at length. Our concern is with the manner of its submission. A careful examination of this branch of the case fails to disclose any substantial error either in the admission or rejection of evidence, in the charge of the court, or in the answers to points. The main question of <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>fact went to the jury under fair and adequate instructions from the learned judge below.
