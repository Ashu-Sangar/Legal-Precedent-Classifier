We have then this state of affairs: All mortgages and loans are, by § 1 of the act, taxable at the rate of three mills on the dollar of their actual cash value, and all of them, except corporate mortgages and loans, are in practice so taxed; while corporate mortgages and loans, which are undoubtedly embraced in the general terms “ all mortgages and loans,” are in practice taxed at the rate of three mills on their nominal value, which often differs by one hundred per centum from their actual value, so that the tax is in many cases double and in others not more than one half the amount it would be if the tax were upon the actual value; with the result that of two persons owning taxable property, of exactly the same value, one is taxed twice as much as the other, and this, not because of any defect in the working of the law, but as a necessary result of its provisions. And the question to be answered is, are taxes so levied and assessed <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>uniform within the meaning of that term as employed in the constitution ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[240,449,1188,756]]]'>It must be conceded that the uniformity required is not absolute, for as said by Mr. Justice Miller, in State Railroad Tax Cases, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20U.S.%20612" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="92 U.S. 612">92 U. S. 612</a>, “ Perfect equality and perfect uniformity of taxation as regards individuals or corporations, or the different classes of property subject to taxation, is a dream unrealized.' It may be admitted that the system that most nearly attains this is the best. But the most complete system that can be devised, must, when we consider the immense variety of subjects which it embraces, be imperfect. And when we come to its application,.....made by men whose judgments and opinions must vary as they are affected by all the circumstances brought to bear upon each individual, the result must inevitably partake largely of the imperfection of human nature, and of the evidence on which human judgment is founded.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b622-7" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[236,1224,1188,870]]]'>This extract points out very clearly one of the limitations with which the requirement of uniformity must be understood. Taxes are uniform in the sense of the constitution, when any inequality of burden which results from their imposition is due to the imperfect knowledge or judgment of the persons whose duty it is to assess them. When, however, the law itself is so framed that it necessarily produces gross inequality of burden, no matter how perfectly it may be administered, it would seem impossible to avoid the conclusion that it violates the mandate of the constitution. If some of the subjects of a given class were not taxed at all while others were, there would, of course, be a gross inequality, in that the burden would fall on one and not on another. But this is forbidden by § 2, of article IX., which ordains that all laws exempting property, other than certain enumerated subjects, shall be void. Hence, if any given class of subjects be taxed, none belonging to that class can be exempted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b622-8" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[236,2100,1184,302]],["BL_623.1",623,[182,349,1185,1068]]]'>The mandate in favor of uniformity in § 1, article IX., means more than this. It is not satisfied until the taxes, which are imposed upon all the subjects of a given class, are so imposed that each person owning the same species of property, shall pay the same amount of tax, upon the same value, when that has been ascertained by the proper authority. The <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>values need not, of course, be absolutely the same ; but they must be so in the judgment of the official whose duty it is to fix them. When this is clone, and when, the rate being fixed, the proportion between values and taxes is constant, theoretical uniformity has been attained; and this is all that is or can, practically, be required. But, if in one case the value to which the rate is applied is the expression of the judgment of the proper official, and in another a mere arbitrary nominal value, it is in the very nature of the case that the resulting taxes cannot be uniform. There can be no definite proportion between the value of the property of the citizen ‘and the amount of his taxes. And, as the findings of fact show, this would be the inevitable consequence of the enforcement of the law in question in this case, no matter how faultless its administration might be. We have, therefore, no hesitation in declaring that if all mortgages, money owing by solvent debtors, whether by promissory note, penal or single bill, bond or judgment, including corporate loans, are by the act of 1885 embraced in the same class of subjects, § 4 of the act violates the constitutional mandate in favor of uniformity, and cannot bo enforced.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[189,1434,1178,609]]]'>Nor would the result be different if we should assume that the class to which corporate loans belong includes the mortgages, bonds and evidences of debt of corporations only. The findings of fact show that there are large amounts of bonds and evidences of indebtedness of corporations, not doing business in this state, which are held and owned here. These are by the act taxable at their actual cash value, to be fixed by the local assessors, while the same subjects of taxation when issued by corporations doing business in the state, are to be assessed at their nominal value. Hence the same want of uniformity which we have condemned above would exist here also, and must come into like condemnation.</p>

Let us assume that this is so. Then, under the facts, the necessary working of the law is that a citizen owning these loans to the value of ten thousand dollars, may pay a less amount of tax than another whose holdings are worth only five thousand. The only, difference between the working of the law, on this <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>assumption and on the other, would be that while in the other cases some of the valuations would be arbitrary, here they would all be so; there, in some cases there would be no definite proportion between the real value and the tax; here, the want of proportion would exist in all cases.</p>

Nor shall we now consider the other objections to the settlement which are specified in the appeal. If we are in error in deciding the one to which we have given special attention to be fundamental, the others will appear upon the record, and will have to be passed upon before a final judgment can be entered.

While the tax is not imposed upon it, and it is simply required to retain the tax out of interest due and pay it over to the state, it is not, as it is argued on behalf of the commonwealth, a tax collector in the strict sense of the term. The settlement is against it; if it failed to appeal within sixty days after notice, the settlement would become conclusive against it; there is no provision in the act for notice to the individuals who must pay the tax, and their rights, probably, cannot be determined in this proceeding; defendant has therefore a direct interest in the matter which entitles it to be heard, and if the tax is illegal and unconstitutional it was under no obligation to retain it and pay it over to the state.</p>

Section 4, of tbe act of 1885, under which these taxes are imposed, does not transcend the limitations of article IX. of the constitution. It will be seen from the language of the two sections of the article that there is no restriction upon the kinds of taxes. There is no restriction to property only; nor is there a restriction to ad valorem taxes; nor upon the methods of taxation, by prescribing that it shall be based upon the principle of valuation. But whatever taxes are imposed, and upon whatever subjects, those taxes must be uniform, and it will be noticed that the word, equal, is not used anywhere in the section. Moreover, the requirement of uniformity is limited in its application. It does not say simply, All taxes shall be uniform, but confines tbe rule of uniformity to a class of subjects only. Tbe inherent power to tax or not to tax all subjects, still remains.

The foregoing cases are tbe landmarks of the constitutional law of Pennsylvania relative to taxation prior to 1874. They show: (1) That equality in taxation is impracticable. (2) That classification of subjects is permissible. (3) That exemption from taxation of any class or of any portion of a class of subjects was allowed. (4) That taxation by special laws was allowed. Here the new constitution intervenes, and by §§ 1 and 2 of article IX., the following reforms are-declared: (I) That taxation by special laws is prohibited. (2) Exemption from taxation of any portion of a class is prohibited. Equality of taxation is not hinted at, and classification is the very basis of the constitutional declaration. Taxes are uniform, therefore, in tbe sense of tbe constitution, when all the members of a given class are taxed without exception. They are not uniform, if any members of tbe class are exempted.

The tax is upon mortgages, as property, and they are all subjects of one class which cannot be subdivided, (b) The legislature has not attempted such classification.</p>

During the year ending as aforesaid, the defendant’s bonds, secured by mortgage, were outstanding to the amount of $800,000; of these, $700,000 were held by residents, and $100,000 by non-residents of the state. The company deny the authority of the legislature to require an assessment to be made by the treasurer; and, although they made a return of the amount of the outstanding indebtedness, they refused to assess the tax or deduct it from the interest, as required by the fourth section of the act referred to. The company further contend that by the first section of the act of 1885, <em>all </em>mortgages, money in the hands of solvent debtors, etc., etc., are made taxable at' the rate of three mills “on the dollar of the value thereof annually,” which is the actual value, and, therefore, to create a valid tax on corporate loans the rate must be applied to the actual and not the nominal value thereof, and that the actual value can be ascertained only by assessment in due form of law, upon notice to the holder and with the right of appeal. Their contention is, that, in view of the provisions of the first section of the act, the system of taxation provided for in the fourth section, as to corporate loans, is repugnant to that clause of the constitution which provides that “all taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax.” The argument is, that the taxing section <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>of the act subjects all the taxable subjects therein designated, including corporate loans, to a tax of three mills on the dollar of their value; that all the other subjects are valued and taxed according to such value by the local assessors, while corporate loans are, without being valued and assessed, taxed at tlieir nominal value; that nominal value is not a certain measure of actual value, which is often much greater and often much less ; so that, in many instances, the tax upon corporate obligations is much more, and, in many others, much less, than it would be if imposed upon the actual value.</p>

The taxation there complained of was of corporate bonds, under the act of June 7, 1879, P. L. 112, and its supplement of June 10,1881, P. L. 99. By the express words of these acts, such securities were made taxable at the rate of four mills “ on every dollar of the value thereof,” which was the precise basis for assessment of individual property and securities, under the general revenue system of the state, by the local assessors; the rate only was different. The phrase “ every dollar of the value thereof ” was held to be the actual value ; and as neither the act of 1879 nor 1881 made any provision for the ascertainment of the actual value, it was held that they did not constitute an independent scheme for the taxation of corporate loans, but were to be aided by the machinery of the, act of 1844; for, as the loans were taxable in the hands of resident owners, at their actual value, a legal ascertainment of that value was essential to the assessments. The tax of a citizen, as we there said, is the result of the rate applied to the value of the property he owns, and he is not taxed until the rate is thus applied, by some legal mode of adjustment. It was held further, that neither the return of the amount of the indebtedness, nor the account settled by the auditor general thereon, could be taken as an assessment, for neither the corporation nor the accounting officer of the commonwealth, had any authority to make it; that could not be regarded as an assessment of an ad valorem tax, made by a person whose interests were adverse, who was charged -with no duty, and was under <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>no oatb or obligation ; where the real party in interest had no notice, no right to interfere if he had notice, and no appeal; as there was no other means of assessment provided by law, it was the duty of the local assessors, in making the general assessment in 1880 and in 1881, to value and assess corporate bonds wherever found in the hands of resident owners, and it was presumed in law that these officers had performed their full duty in the premises. -</p>

The obligation rests upon the company, but as the company can only act through its officers, the default of the officer is esteemed the default of the company, and the penalty is visited upon them. The treasurer is designated, in order that there may be no evasion; he has exceptional opportunities to know, and has the power in his own hands to perform the several matters required. This system of collecting state taxes was first introduced under the 42d section of the act of April 29, 1844, P. L. 501, where it is applied to municipal loans, and by the act of April 30, 1864, P.

In the last case cited we said: “We can see no constitutional or other difficulty in the way of obliging the officers of corporations, municipal or private, by appropriate legislation, to assess and collect taxes upon their corporate loans or stocks. This method of reaching subjects capable of successful concealment, and liable to escape the notice of the most vigilant assessor, has for many years been recognized as a valid exercise of legislative power.”.“The tax is imposed indiscriminately upon all mortgages, etc., in the hands of the owner or possessor, but the corporation is made the collector of the tax upon the corporate loan. This was the construction put upon the act of April 30,1864, by this court, in the case of Maltby v. Railroad <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>Co., <a href="/pa/52/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="52 Pa. 140" data-case-ids="1002273" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0140-01">52 Pa. 140</a>, and the reasons there assigned are generally applicable here.” The case of Maltby v.

Such obligations are not ordinarily put upon or quoted in the market, and therefore have no variable market value as other securities have; on the contrary, the actual value of corporate securities is dependent upon a variety of conditions, independent of the value of the debtor’s estate— the fluctuations of trade, the date of maturity, the rate of interest, the amount of competition, and generally upon the stringency of the market and the financial condition of the country. Some of these securities, it is said., upon which interest is regularly paid, sell in the market as low as fifty cents, and others, perhaps, as high as one hundred and fifty cents, on the dollar. And it is argued that as by the first section of the act of 1885 individual and corporate obligations constitute a single class of subjects for taxation, the act unjustly discriminates between them in the fourth section, and that therefore the taxes imposed cannot be said to be uniform upon the same class of subjects.</p>

These several classifications and departures from uniformity in methods, were intended simply to bring about a just uniformity in results.

Pious ehold and kitchen furniture, gold and silver plate, exceeding a certain value, pleasure carriages, and gold and silver watches, kept for use, prior to the act of May 13, 1887, P. L. 114, were selected from the like articles in.trade, and from other articles of personal property, and with money at interest, were subjected to a special tax.

There are several reasons why corporate and individual obligations should be distinguished, in classification, not arising wholly out of any essential difference in their physical nature perhaps, but out of want, of adaptation in our general tax laws to reach them, in the ordinary methods of taxation. They are, as a class, transferable by delivery, and therefore capable of concealment. The transactions out of which individual securities originate in the ordinary course of business for the loan of money, have more or less publicity. Experience has shown that the ordinary methods of valuation, as to these, do not fail of enforcement. But in the case of corporate loans, whilst corporate mortgages may be recorded in one city or county, the bonds may be found in the pocket of the holder in another city or county of the commonwealth. Experience has taught us that, in the ordinary processes of valuation, they are not found; the law, generally applicable, lacks adaptation to the discovery of this quality of obligations. Moreover, their negotiability gives them a commercial quality; a vast brood of bonds is covered by a single mortgage, and as they are issued they fly from hand to hand throughout the whole commercial world: it is only upon their annual return at the interest periods that their ownership can be ascertained. These securities constitute one of the commodities on sale in <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>the market; they are sensitive in many instances to the conditions which affect the price of stocks. They are subject to great fluctuations, caused by the condition of the money market, or the condition of the country, and sometimes by artificial or even accidental means. Well-informed men must differ greatly in their estimate of the value of such property. The stock market exhibits changes in the quotations daily, sometimes hourly. Presumptively, however, the nominal value is the true value of securities yielding and paying interest, and the legislature has therefore fixed the nominal value, or the par value, for the purpose of taxation. These peculiarities of corporate securities, with others, perhaps, that might be mentioned, arising partly from their nature and properties, and partly from a want of adaptation in our general system to reach this quality of subjects, give rise to their distinct classification.</p>

The tax is not upon the corporation, it is upon the holder of the corporate bonds; and the holder may be am individual, a partnership, a banker or broker, or a private corporation; the law is general, and applies to all holders. Whether the tax is paid or not is a matter of indifference to the corporation, for if they pay it, they may defalk it from the interest. The tax being paid by the debtor, out of the interest he pays to the creditor, we cannot see that there is any ground of complaint, that the obligations are taxed at their face value; the tax is to be deducted from the interest, and the payment of the interest, by the debtor himself, is presumptive evidence of his solvency: Commonwealth v. Phoenix Iron Co., supra.

A reference to the cases already cited will abundantly verify this statement. The fourth section of the act of 1885 is a substantial copy of the 42d section of the act of 1844; its purpose was simply to apply the same system to the taxation of corporate loans. It has proved to be an efficient and just method of collecting taxes upon this class of securities; it is easy of enforcement and precludes the escape of large amounts of taxable property, which would evade collection in the ordináry methods, and we are of opinion that it is in no way repugnant to the provisions of the constitution.</p>
