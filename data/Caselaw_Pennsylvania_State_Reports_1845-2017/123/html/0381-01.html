The contract is capable of snob construction, especially when both parties have acceded to it in carrying it out.

This was practically done, as the sale of the bonds at par was assumed before Hutchinson paid the July estimate of $17,004.15, the sum of $30,000 cash being in hand when he gave his last check of $8,004.15 on that estimate.</p>

So far as they were needed when he received them, he used them as collateral to borrow money for the bridge ; part were after-wards sold and part retained, and no demands were made for them or for money or credit, as heretofore appears, and none could be demanded so long as there were means in hand from bonds and stock already sold.

It must be inferred that Hutchinson, beyond such means as he did furnish, regarded this use of the entire amount of bonds and stock at McDowell’s discretion, as ready and properly to be used or disposed of consistent with the terms of their contract as understood by them, the moment they were available. So that the only practical effect of his absence or of anything he then did or left undone, so far as can be very certainly assumed, is, beyond the worry and exertions McDowell testifies to, that instead of paying the July estimate of $17,004.15 out of the means in his own hands, he <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>would have acquired it out of the money in Robinson Brothers’ hands. And if it is assumed that the particular arrangement with Robinson Brothers might not have been made, it cannot be doubted that a month later, when the next estimate became due (which is the first one not paid by Hutchinson) the advanced construction would have certainly made the bonds available at full value, either for sale or by hypothecation.</p>

On October 11, 1883, defendant Hutchinson, party of the first part, entered into a contract with plaintiff reciting the above stated agreement, by which Hutchinson agreed “ to advance from time to time whatever money is needed to carry on the work of construction of said bridge, or loan his credit to party of the second part to enable him to obtain the necessary funds . . . . , and in a total amount not to exceed the <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>sum of $270,000 for tbe entire completed bridge, franchises, land and other damages, and the purchase of real estate.”</p>

McDowell did not know of this until tbe money was needed and on application at Hutchinson’s office could not be procured. There was an attempt to show that Hutchinson had made arrangements for the money but it was not proved that they were actually made. It amounted to mere conversations with other parties, and, if it was made, he neither notified McDowell of it nor had the money or credit ready to be furnished.

The cost of the bridge was necessarily increased by legal proceedings instituted which compelled the raising of the bridge. This and other matters found by the master increased the proper cost of the bridge as between these parties to $308,870.50 of which an item of #13,549.89 is estimated which may be reduced eventually. Some receipts of stock besides the bonds heretofore mentioned were proved in the hands of Hutchinson which will be referred to when we come to re-state the account.</p>
    <p id="b425-6" data-blocks='[["BL_425.6",425,[224,1444,1188,922]]]'>We have examined the evidence with great care, and, while we differ from some of the inferences of the learned master which he has denominated as findings of fact, we are enabled to find all the .essential facts within his report which should determine the equities in this case, and his report has therefore been of great service to us. Where, as in this case, a large number of facts are found to be proved and inferences are drawn therefrom as facts themselves, it is essential in a review of the case to note the distinction between a proved fact and an inference. We think this accounts for the way in which, as we view the case, the court below were misled. An examination of the findings of fact by the master will show that the first three are inferences, proper enough from the standpoint of the master, but wholly misleading if the court erroneously and unconsciously adopts them as actual facts. We shall not criticise the report of the master specifically in all points where we differ, except so far as our conclusions, themselves modify it.</p>
    <p id="b425-7" data-blocks='[["BL_425.7",425,[271,2374,1140,45]],["BL_426.1",426,[236,366,1188,508]]]'>The facts above stated are beyond dispute. The evidence <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>in its totality, fairly considered, shows that to the utmost requirement McDowell lived up to the letter and spirit of his contract with Hutchinson; that Hutchinson performed only a part of the covenant .which was exclusively his duty to perform ; and the only cause for not realizing the fullest expectations and legitimate success of the contract and the enterprise, was due to Hutchinson’s default and failure to perform. That this is a proper conclusion of fact as well as law, will further appear. The master makes the inference himself and no other could be adopted.</p>
    <p id="b426-4" data-blocks='[["BL_426.4",426,[237,882,1189,714]]]'>The law governing this case is that which the parties have themselves made in their written contracts. They are unambiguous and clear. Let us look at the contract of October 11, 1883. Hutchinson bound himself “ to advance from time to time whatever money is needed to carry on the work of construction of said bridge or loan his credit to party of second part to enable him to obtain the necessary funds in a total amount not to exceed the sum of $270,000.” That which was “necessary,” was money or credit of Hutchinson sufficient for the entire completed bridge, franchises, land and other damages and purchase of real estate. It was stated in the preamble that this money or credit was necessary to enable McDowell to carry out his said .contract with the Bridge Co. to completion.</p>
    <p id="b426-5" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[238,1603,1188,499]]]'>McDowell on his part was already bound to complete the bridge, but it was reiterated that the burden was upon him to furnish a bridge completed in every respect, and that he would do it so far as Hutchinson was concerned out of the $270,000 that he was to furnish, and guarantee that the whole cost would not exceed $290,000, or, if it did, it was expressly agreed that McDowell was to pay the surplus and it was not to come out of Hutchinson’s share of the bonds or stock. McDowell was to transfer his right to receive the entire bonds and stock. He did transfer it at once.</p>
    <p id="b426-6" data-blocks='[["BL_426.6",426,[240,2118,1189,303]],["BL_427.1",427,[221,353,1185,562]]]'>Is there any ambiguity about the terms of this contract? Certainly not. It is not the case of an ordinary partnership in which both parties may be called upon to do all that the partnership contemplates, and in which the act of one is the act of both as between themselves. Specific acts are here fixed for each party, and the specific act of one is the consideration <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>■of the specific act of the other. McDowell is not to do Hutchinson’s duty, nor Hutchinson McDowell’s, and the whole success of the bridge and of the enterprise, as a business venture, depended upon each one actively and constantly doing his own peculiar duty. Hutchinson’s duty was just as essential to support the enterprise, as the foundation stone to be laid by McDowell was essential to support the bridge. It required no notice from either party to create an obligation if he failed to perform; it might be safe to give such notice, but it was not necessary. McDowell had the right to assume that Hutchinson would keep his contract when he left for California.</p>
    <p id="b427-4" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[221,923,1182,919]]]'>
      <em>A </em>gain; what was the status of the bonds and the stock ? They were the consideration of McDowell’s work and materials. They were his property. Hutchinson loaned or was to loan the money or his credit to McDowell. In the latter case McDowell was to procure the money. It is not pretended that the transfer of bonds and stock to Hutchinson was a sale of them. So far as he and McDowell were concerned they were in Hutchinson’s hands to secure the performance of the contract, and that was, that when the full amount was advanced and the bridge completed the advances were to be paid first out of the proceeds, and the residue divided in specific bonds and stock between the parties. It matters little whether we call them collateral securities, or held in trust by Hutchinson; the law and the equities are the same. When a loan like this is provided for and a large amount of securities passed to the lender, the law fixes the character of the holding. The title was still as between McDowell and Hutchinson in McDowell. As regards third parties who purchased, it would be different.</p>
    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[220,1850,1183,562]],["BL_428.1",428,[244,360,1184,147]]]'>This transaction differs nothing from every absolute transfer of stock as a collateral with a power of sale. It is the loan or advance which is made and to be repaid which gives the character of a pledge to the transfer. It verges upon the point of absurdity to say that before Hutchinson had advanced a dollar of money or credit, the transfer of §650,000 of securities to be received for the bridge was an absolute sale of the securities. It is true, that in his testimony Hutchinson seems to so consider it, but it is contrary to all business transactions and every legal presumption to so treat it. McDowell swears to the contrary in his testimony, and says the understanding <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>was that the securities were not to be sold. His testimony is corroborated by the legal construction of the contract. Thus much as to the nature of the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[240,514,1187,448]]]'>We have seen that in all respects McDowell fulfilled his contract and that after the advance of the $80,478.09 Hutchinson failed in his. This is the turning point of this case : a clear breach of covenant on one side and performance on the other. At this juncture McDowell stepped into the breach and performed Hutchinson’s duty. He did it at great loss to himself and to the common enterprise. This he had the right to do, but it changed the equities of the parties under their contract.</p>
    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[240,979,1185,147]]]'>At this point we might close this case, settle the equities, re-state the account and allow McDowell the proper damages, but we will consider the equities at length.</p>
    <p id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.6",428,[241,1133,1185,138]]]'>McDowell asks us to declare the contract wholly rescinded as of the date of Hutchinson’s breach. Can we go to tins extent?</p>
    <p id="b428-7" data-blocks='[["BL_428.7",428,[237,1288,1189,820]]]'>A party who keeps his contract under a vital breach of the other party, may do' one of two things: rescind the contract, or stand upon the contract and ask for damages for the breach. If he rescinds it, he must do so at once or within a reasonable time. This McDowell did not do. He might have done it. The master correctly states the situation when he says, “ Had McDowell stood up then for his present construction of the contract we think his position would have been maintained, and in such case it might have even been doubtful whether the bonds and stock could have been tied up by hypothecation.” He did not dissolve the relationship and abrogate the contract. It would probably have involved litigation which it was necessary to avoid. He cannot ask us to do what he did not do for himself. He can however stand on the contract and ask to be reimbursed for Ms damages by reason of Hutchinson’s breach. He did not release his damages.</p>
    <p id="b428-8" data-blocks='[["BL_428.8",428,[237,2115,1188,302]],["BL_429.1",429,[223,366,1186,911]]]'>The master errs in allowing the clear facts of the case to be set aside by his inferences. The rules of evidence will not permit it. We find nothing in this record which amounts to a waiver of his equities in tMs behalf. It is true he did not show a belligerent spirit nor anticipate trouble until it was necessary, but tMs is no evidence of a release of his rights. His delivery <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>of the stock subsequently to Hutchinson, to the extent which he did, and his letter after he had by his loss secured the success of the enterprise, nor the mere talk before the contract that $50,000 might be all the money that would be needed, were no waiver of his rights. Solemn covenants cannot be set aside nor broken contracts released, on such slight testimony. When pressed to a point where if he had yielded he might have compromised his rights, McDowell quietly but persistently refused to comply with Hutchinson’s demands, and hence the latter instituted the legal proceedings against the bridge company. When Hutchinson returned from California he did not seek to take up the burden McDowell had assumed. His anxiety alone seems to have been to secure the largest possible fruits of profit to himself without any corresponding fulfilment of duty on his part. In the light of the legal obligations resting on the parties, the conduct of Hutchinson stands in marked contrast to that of McDowell, and as we gather from the report the master himself so views it.</p>
    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[221,1296,1184,660]]]'>We need not discuss the question whether the covenant of Hutchinson was dependent or independent; it is one in which the breach may be compensated in damages, and it is to be treated exactly as stated by Gibson, C. J., in Ligget v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.%20333" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="3 W. 333">3 W. 333</a>, as if it was separate and independent. We have a covenant kept in part and broken as to the residue, and the measure of damages is what it cost to fulfil the contract. Hutchinson is to be held responsible for his breach. After his failure to comply, the sale of the bonds by McDowell was such a necessity and reasonable provision to save the enterprise, that it threw the loss thereby suffered wholly ;ipon Hutchinson. It increased the cost to them of the bridge and McDowell should bear no part of it.</p>
    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[219,1966,1184,458]],["BL_430.1",430,[254,374,1188,302]]]'>The items of account as found by the master are in the main correct. We adopt a simple mode of stating the account and in this differ from the statements presented by counsel for both sides, which contain manifest errors. The mode of settling their accounts is provided for in the contract. It is a division of the bonds and stock on hand as specific articles, a division in kind, not in the first instance in value as dollars and cents. There is no cash on hand “ proceeds of bonds or stock ” to be divided. In this division, the bonds are out of the ques<a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>tion because they are sold or appropriated. We make these statements, because a state of things might have existed which would require the cash account and the stock and bond account to be kept separate. Fortunately, for clearness of understanding the account may be all stated as if in dollars and cents, the items showing what is cash and what specific articles of stock.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[254,683,1191,1231]]]'>It is admitted that the preferred stock is worth par and with the bonds and stock recéived by Hutchinson he has received practically in cash more than sufficient to pay all his advances and interest. In the view we have taken the bonds and stock were all assets in the hands of McDowell to first pay the cost of the bridge which included all the advances by Hutchinson either made or to be made up to $270,000, and such amount as should be added to the $270,000 by operation of law. Under the facts of this case, the loss on bonds, $30,000, as a cash item, is to be added to the cost of the bridge just as the $7,500 was added by the master, as loss on the stock sold by agreement of parties. It is clear that if both parties had kept their agreement and the bonds and stock held and only sold as contemplated to pay the final cost of the bridge, the division in bonds and stock would have been the difference between the gross amount of bonds and stock, and the cost of the bridge. This gives us a sure method of stating the equities between the parties. Equity will hold Hutchinson to the full performance of his duty under his contract, by making him responsible for what he failed to perform. This legal aspect of the case is warranted by the nature of the transaction and the object and design of the parties. Partners may hold each other to such independent covenants, and claim damages for their breach: Wright v. Smyth, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20533" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 533">4 W. &amp; S. 533</a>.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[252,1920,1191,559]]]'>The measure of damages is properly stated by Gibson, C. J., in Ligget v. Smith, cited above, to be what the contract would yield less a sum sufficient to compensate his defective execution of the contract, and it makes no difference whether the covenants are mutual or dependent, or separate and independent. When, as in this case, the part of the covenant not fulfilled must be performed, the same rule of damages is what it costs to fulfil it: Sedgwick on Meas, of Damages, 286, note. In stating the account we shall allow Hutchinson such profit as the contract would have given him less the losses occasioned by his own default.</p>

      <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>Another question raised in the case and covered by the sixth assignment of error is with reference to the prayer for an injunction against prosecuting the suit against the bridge -company. It is clear that the disposition of this case leaves no equities or legal claims on the part of Hutchinson against the bridge company. Any equity against them must be sought through McDowell. The pendency of that suit is a mere menace to prevent a settlement between the company and McDowell. Why then may not McDowell in equity ask that the proceedings may be enjoined? The cause of action and the proceedings are fully admitted on this record under the bill and answer, and the proofs correspond. It is true McDowell is not a party to that action but he is interested and hence does not come within the case of New York v. Connecticut, 4 Dali. 1-3, cited in the text books. The bridge company accepted notice of and approved of the assignment by McDowell to Hutchinson, and for this reason Hutchinson claims to hold the bridge company. They became'in effect sureties for McDowell for the delivery of the bonds and stock to Hutchinson, in case Hutchinson fulfilled his agreement. But Hutchinson did not keep his agreement and by his failure he released the sureties. They join in the prayer of the bill, were made defendants in the bill, as McDowell had the right to make them. The proceedings at law are inconsistent with- the decree in this case, and a clause may therefore be inserted in the decree restraining those proceedings: Hilliard on Injunctions, 3d ed., 273. It is also a not uncommon basis of jurisdiction in equity, when the application is to stay proceedings where sureties have been released by a mode of dealing with the principal debtor: Story’s Equity Jurisprudence, section 883. The parties are all before us and this plaintiff shows his equity. We think the demurrer should have been wholly overruled instead of partially.</p>
