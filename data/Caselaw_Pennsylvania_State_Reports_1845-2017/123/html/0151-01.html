The ordinance in question, moreover, is not and never was necessary for the peace and good order of the borough. Since the passage of the act of 1851, there have been passed the following special acts authorizing the licensing of vehicles in cities and boroughs: April 10, 1873, P. L. 704; <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>March 30, 1860, P. L. 363 ; April 13, 18T0, P. L. 1130; act of February 18, 1869, P. L. 199. If, under the general law, boroughs have the authority to require the owners of hacks used to convey passengers for hire to take out a license, then this special legislation was entirely unnecessary. The passage of these statutes is a strong interpretation that the old law granted no such powers.</p>

It was urged, however, that it is authorized by the second section of the act of 1851, which provides that such corporations shall have power “ To make such laws, ordinances, by-laws, and regulations not inconsistent with the laws of this commonwealth, as they shall deem necessary for the good order and government of the borough.” This section is followed by twenty-five other sections specifying minutely the subjects which the borough may regulate by ordinance. If the ordinance in question related to any one of these subjects there would be no question about its validity, provided the ordinance itself is reasonable. And we are of the opinion that the general powers referred to in the first section must be confined to the particular subjects referred to in succeeding sections. There is no analogy between this ordinance and one requiring coal, hay, or produce to be inspected or weighed, for this is expressly authorized by the act of 1851; nor with an ordinance requiring a telegraph company to pay a fixed sum for each of its poles, for this fairly comes within the police power over the streets, given by the same act.</p>
