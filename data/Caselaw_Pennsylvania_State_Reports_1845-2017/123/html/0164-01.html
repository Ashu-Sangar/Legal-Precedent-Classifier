The argument that the building referred to in the case stated is municipal property and therefore taxable because a revenue is derived therefrom, is answered by Sewickley Borough v.

The lot on which the building stands was dedicated for market and other purposes. The building erected thereon belongs to the borough; and the fact that defendant has’ the use of it for a certain term does not change the character of the property. By the case stated, only the “ building, so far as the interest of the defendant ” is <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>concerned, is assessed. Under Watson v. O’Hern, : - ' - the right granted to the defendant is a lease for years, which is but personalty: Wood’s L. &amp; T., § 68.

By the case stated, the building is part of the capital stock of the defendant and as such pays the usual taxes to the commonwealth.

It is erected upon one of the public squares of the borough dedicated for a market house and other public purposes, and is only used for the purpose of a public market, and is necessary and indispensable therefor.

It differs in no respect from an individual who is engaged in the same business, except that its building is located upon a public square in the borough, which the company is permitted to occupy until the borough purchases and pays for the building under the terms of the agreement referred to in the case stated. The county of Allegheny, under the authority of the act of assembly of April 15, 1834, assessed the market house for county purposes. That act requires that all houses, etc., shall be assessed. There is no act of the legislature which exempts this property from assessment. If the market house were located upon other land it would not be pretended that it could for any reason escape taxation for county purposes. It is not the question whether one municipal corporation may tax another, which <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>might arise when a borough, empowered so to do, erects a market house which is entirely under its own control. It is simply and only the case of a private corporation carrying on its business and owning real estate under the description of a house.</p>
    <p id="b189-3" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[197,617,1184,302]]]'>It is however claimed that because it is upon the public square, and the borough has the right at some future time to purchase and pay for it and then carry it on as a public market, it should be exempt. The answer to that is, it is time enough to decide that it is legally property of a public corporation, when the facts exist which constitute it such.</p>
    <p id="b189-4" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[192,930,1189,1269]]]'>The learned judge of the court below seemed to take the view that this state of things already existed, for he based his judgment upon the case of Coatesville Gas Co. v. Chester Co., <a href="/citations/?q=97%20Pa.%20481" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="97 Pa. 481">97 Pa. 481</a>. It will be seen that in that case and all the kindred cases in which it was held the tax assessed was illegal, the principle which controlled the court was that the public works of a public corporation, such as a railroad company, canal company, or gas company, could not be subjected to double taxation without an express mandate of the legislature to that effect. The principle has, however, never been applied to a private corporation. A public corporation is one which cannot carry out the purposes of its organization without chartered rights from the commonwealth. Railroads, canals, and gas companies must have the right of eminent domain in order to perform their functions. Their property, which is indispensable to their chartered rights, is represented by their capital stock, and as such is taxed specially by the legislature, and the law will not subject it to duplicate taxation by mere inference. It must expressly be made subject by statute. Such of the property of such a corporation as is not so indispensable but is' merely convenient, is held subject to taxation under the general law assessing such property. A private corporation which needs no chartered rights in order to carry on its business, stands in no different position from an individual.</p>

The case of South Reading Market House Co. v. Berks County, 11 W.

These principles are clearly enunciated in the following cases: Lehigh Co. v. Northampton County, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 334" data-case-ids="483321" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0334-01">8 W. &amp; S. 334</a>; West Chester Gas Co. v.
