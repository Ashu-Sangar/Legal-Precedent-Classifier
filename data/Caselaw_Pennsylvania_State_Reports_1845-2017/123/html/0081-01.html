Freeman, by his deed dated November 3, 1847, conveyed his nine parcels or subdivisions to James Magee, whose name figures prominently in this trial, it being alleged that the defendant in this case succeeded to his title. Norman and Jones, for aught we know from the records, held on to their properties; but, if the records are to be believed, the time came when they each and all forgot or neglected to pay their taxes. The taxing powers, ignoring, or ignorant of, the subdivision of the tract and change of ownership, went on assessing tract 4278 as a whole. The taxes for 1848 and 1849 seem to have been unpaid, consequently the right of the public to sell the land for taxes ripened in 1850, or earlier. On June 8,1850, an entry in a book from the treasurer’s office, put in evidence, shows that D. McLaughlin paid the taxes on one hundred and twenty acres of the tract. It is alleged here in behalf of the plaintiff that the one hundred and twenty acres was the Jones subdivision, No. 10. Two days after McLaughlin paid the taxes on the one hundred and twenty acres, which would be June 10, 1850, the remainder of the land, estimated at nine hundred and twenty-six acres, was sold, it is claimed by the plaintiff, for taxes, to Robert Orr. It <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>is alleged that the treasurer’s deed made to Mr. Orr has been lost; the loss of the deed, if its existence is sufficiently proved, would not in itself impair in any degree the plaintiff’s title. You have the books and other records before you, and you must determine the fact of the sale for yourselves. Were the taxes in arrear? If so, the right to sell therefor existed. Was the sale made? Was Orr the purchaser? Did he receive a deed from the treasurer ? Answer these questions, gentlemen, in the light of the evidence.</p>

Quite a controversy arises here between the plaintiff and the •defendant; the plaintiff avers that Magee only intended to redeem, and actually did redeem, the nine parcels he bought from Charles D. Freeman; these nine parcels, or subdivisions, contained, according to the deed to Magee, eight hundred and forty-four acres and one hundred and fourteen perches, and, I believe, allowance; he redeemed eight hundred and forty-four acres, according to the proof. [The defendant contends that Magee redeemed subdivision No. 7. The evidence showing that he sought to' redeem more than his own land is not clear; in the opinion of the court it is not sufficient to justify a finding that he did so ; but the view taken by the court of the law governing the redemption of lands sold for non-payment of taxes, makes Magee’s alleged effort towards redeeming the Norman lot, if he ever made such an effort, of no importance in the case. Magee never owned the Norman lot; he never claimed to own it; he had no interest of any kind in it; as a consequence, his voluntary act as a mere stranger could not deprive Orr of his title to the Norman lot under the treasurer’s deed, if any title Orr had. Magee could redeem his own eight hundred and forty-four acres and no more; and, indeed, under all the evidence, as I have already intimated, it would be difficult, and impossible, perhaps, to say that he tried or intended to do more than this. So far as subdivision No. 7 is concerned, he was a stranger, and, if our opinion of the law is correct, any interference with it would be an act of intermeddling between Orr, the alleged purchaser at the treasurer’s sale, and <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>Henry R. Norman, or those claiming under him, in whom and whom alone the equity of redemption was vested.]1 Nothing is shown in the way of a ratification on Orr’s part of Magee’s alleged act in redeeming, or attempting to redeem, this parcel. A rule that would require the owner of land in severalty, sold as part of a larger tract, to redeem the whole tract might produce great injustice; the ignorance, neglect, perversity, or fraud of an assessor might cast upon a poor man possessing-hut one acre the duty of redeeming ten thousand acres to save his own. The rule that would permit a mere stranger to redeem land wherein he had no color of title or interest, and whereto he had no shadow of claim, would give him a right to intermeddle without excuse, to divest title with which he had no possible concern. The law does not encourage, nor as a rule permit, volunteers to injuriously interfere with the vested rights of others.</p>

He should then have the right to tender his proper proportion of the taxes and relieve Ms land. I am aware of no statute or rule of law which clogs this right, or the right of redeeming, with the condition that he shall pay all the assessments on, perhaps, half the lands in a townsMp, because a lazy, careless, or uninquiring assessor has assessed them as a single tract, to one whose life and title were notoriously things of the past, ere the officer, who thus seeks to perpetuate both, was born.</p>

The act of 1862, cited by the defendant, was intended to provide for cases of interfering surveys only, where there are two or more conflicting titles or surveys covering part of the same land. In our case, on the contrary, there was no interference, no overlapping or conflict of titles, but simply an assessment of an entire tract as one, which previously had been divided into three several parcels. No implication, therefore, arises from the passage of that act that prior thereto there was no authority for one of two or more owners of several parcels to redeem his own land by paying his proportionate part of the redemption money. Such right, moreover, was <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>expressly recognized, before the act of 1862, in McCord v. Bergautz, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%20490" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="7 W. 490">7 W. 490</a>. And in Die trick v.

These cases show that before the act of 1862, there was no rigid rule such as is asserted in this case. And again, the penalty under the act of 1806, for not returning one’s land for assessment, is confined to the fourfold tax provided by the act.</p>

In this case, the treasurer made an apportionment before the sale, in favor of David McLaughlin. The dictum of Justice Rogebs in McCoy v.

And a reference to Morton v. Harris, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.%20327" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="9 W. 327">9 W. 327</a>, will show that the learned justice did not contradict what he had previously ruled in McCoy v.

Rider, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20Pa.%20383" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="51 Pa. 383">51 Pa. 383</a>, an authority for the position urged, for the point decided was that a redemption by one tenant in common, under the circumstances of that case, was necessarily a redemption for both.</p>

He gets back his money with twenty-five per cent additional, for the part redeemed, and for the unredeemed part he gets the land itself; in either case, all he bargained for. He knows when he bids that he will obtain only an inchoate title, which may be defeated in whole or in part by many contingencies as to which he must take the risk. At any rate, if he does not complain of a redemption of a part of the land he bought, it does not lie in the moutli of a stranger to complain for him. “ When the purchaser himself has ratified an unauthorized act of redemption, who can be permitted to object to it ? ” Orr v.

    <p id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[241,415,1199,1786]]]'>In 1844 the tract of unseated land in the warrantee name of John Barron, No. 4278, containing ten hundred and forty-four acres, was owned by T. W. L. Freeman. In 1845 he projected on paper a division of his tract into eleven lots, but no lines were run on the ground, nor was there any natural monument or other mark indicating the subdivision or the position of any one of the lots. In the same year he conveyed eight hundred and forty-four acres of the tract, covering all the lots except Nos. 7 and 10, to Charles D. Freeman. He soon after conveyed No. 7 to H. R. Norman, and No. 10 to J. L. Jones, as containing one hundred acres each. The tract continued to be assessed as a whole in the name of the original warrantee, and in 1850 it was advertised for sale by the treasurer of Jefferson county for the non-payment of the taxes of 1848 and 1849. Before the sale, David McLaughlin paid the taxes upon one hundred and six acres, and the treasurer, deducting the money paid from the whole amount of taxes and one hundred and six acres from the number of acres at which the tract was assessed, proceeded to sell the warrant as containing nine hundred and twenty-six acres to Robert Orr. In May, 1852, Magee, who had succeeded to the title of Charles D. Freeman to eight hundred and forty-four acres of the tract, sent his agent to the office of the county treasurer to redeem his lands. He paid the redemption money upon the whole tract, as it was sold, and took the treasurer’s receipt therefor, in which, after acknowledging the payment by Magee of the sum of $53.74 in full for the redemption money, the treasurer described the land as a tract “warranted in the name of John Barron, No. 4278, and containing eight hundred and forty-four acres.” It had been sold by the same description, except that the quantity of land had been stated to be nine hundred and twenty-six acres. The tract redeemed was the same that had been sold as the John Barron, No. 4278; and the variance in stating the number of acres it contained was in an immaterial matter of description.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

This question is answered by considering the nature of the transaction. The treasurer is a public officer. What acts are necessarily performed by him in the sale and redemption of unseated lands are done by him as the agent of the law. The act of 1815 provides that the owner may offer the money necessary to redeem his lands from a sale for taxes to the county treasurer, “who is hereby authorized and required to receive and receipt for the same,” and pay it over to the purchaser. The payment of the money to the treasurer is, prima facie, a payment to the purchaser, and divests his title. If the purchaser denies the sufficiency of the redemption for any reason, he must show affirmatively that he has not taken the redemption money before he can be heard to deny the effect of the payment to the treasurer. The legal presumption is that the treasurer has paid the money to him, and it is very clear that ho could not be allowed to hold the money and the land at the same time. This consideration alone would dispose of the question now raised. The legal effect of the receipt of the treasurer for the redemption money due upon any given tract of land is shown by Bubb v. Tompkins, <a href="/pa/47/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="47 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="485563" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0359-01">47 Pa. 359</a>. In that case the treasurer had, by mistake, failed to include the taxes paid by the purchaser after the tax sale, with the redemption money, and had given the owner a receipt in full for the redemption of the tract without noticing his mistake. The act of the treasurer was held to constitute a valid redemption of the land, and the purchaser was required to look to the treasurer for the money which bis mistake had left uncollected.</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[199,1868,1178,559]],["BL_114.1",114,[231,360,1199,755]]]'>But there is another reason why the redemption by Magee was effectual as to the whole tract. The assessment was made upon the tract as a whole by its number and the name of the warrantee. It was sold as a whole by the same description. There were no division lines on the ground. Whether an examination was made upon the surface of the tract, or upon the tax records, the tract and its assessment were entire. When Magee came to redeem the eight hundred and forty-four acres in the warrant to which he had title, he had no safe course to pursue except to redeem the tract. He owned fully nine tenths of the land sold by the treasurer as warrant No. <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>4278, but be could not point out wbat belonged to bim on tbe ground, or distinguish it from what was not his, for it was not separated from the body of the tract by lines, or located by any natural landmark. The payment of the whole redemption money, was therefore the only prudent, if not the only possible, method of redeeming his own land. If, upon the facts of this . case, he had offered pa^t of the amount necessary to redeem the tract, it is probable that the treasurer would have declined to receive it; but, if he had received it, would the purchaser have been compelled to accept less than his bid, and the interest allowed by law from the treasurer ? Could a tract which had been assessed and sold as a whole, and which was undivided on the ground, be split up in the hands of the purchaser by the payment of fractional parts of the redemption money to the treasurer ?</p>
    <p id="b114-4" data-blocks='[["BL_114.4",114,[235,1134,1198,1181]]]'>These questions show the wisdom if not the necessity of the redemption by Magee of the entire tract as sold. If the several part owners had complied with the requirements of the" law by returning their separate holdings for taxation, they would have been separately assessed, each with his own land. In that case Magee would have had no possible interest beyond his own lines, and no standing from which to redeem the separate lot of any other owner which might be sold by the treasurer. All the lots so assessed and sold would require to be separately redeemed, and such redemption could be made only by or on behalf of the owner or his lien creditor. But as we have seen, none of the part owners of No. 4278 had returned his land for taxation, or caused his lines to be run on the ground, and it is to be presumed that for this reason the tract continued to be assessed as a whole. The taxes were a lien upon the land, and in the absence of any division upon the ground or upon the tax records, they were a lien on the whole tract. The whole tract was sold for their non-payment. The whole redemption money was paid in due time by one who owned a large but unseparated part of the tract, and this divested the title of the purchaser absolutely. The court below was in error in its rulings upon this question, which is the controlling question in the case.</p>
