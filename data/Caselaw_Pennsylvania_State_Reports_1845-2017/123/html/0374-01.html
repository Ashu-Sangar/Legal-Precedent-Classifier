It is there held that the works of a corporation whose purposes are of a public nature, are exempt from local taxation in the form of real estate, provided such real estate is necessary for the business of the corporation, and provided such corporation pays a state tax on its capital stock. It must be conceded that if the Philadelphia Co. can be classed as a public corporation, this property cannot be taxed as real estate, unless the power to tax capital stock carries with it the power to tax real estate as representing so much capital stock. But we deny that this corporation is of such a public character. It has no such public character as a railroad, a canal, or a navigation company. It is not a transportation company in any sense of that term, as this court has decided: Carothers’ App., <a href="/citations/?q=118%20Pa.%20485" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="118 Pa. 485">118 Pa. 485</a>.

It is a principle universally declared and admitted that municipal corporations can levy no taxes, general or special, upon inhabitants or their property, unless the power be plainly and unmistakably conferred: Dillon on Mun. Corp., § 763. The character of a corporation, for purposes of taxation, depends upon the business in which it is engaged. In the act of May 29, 1885, P. L. 29, we have the legislative declaration that the transportation and supply of natural gas for public consumption is a public use; and in Johnston’s App., 5 Cent. R. 564, as well as in Carothers’ App., <a href="/pa/118/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="118 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="556773" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0468-01">118 Pa. 468</a>, where the charter of the plaintiff came in question, this court has said that the plaintiff, under the terms of its charter is rightfully engaged in its present business.</p>

While the most if not all the cases cited by the defendants, on the position that the gas pipes of the plaintiff are assessable as land, or as an interest in land, have little bearing upon the question, owing to the nature of the statutes involved or the facts shown therein, we do not propose to discuss them, for assuming that the property assessed has the character of ■ real estate, it does not follow that the present tax is lawfully assessed. On the contrary, the cases are ruled against the defendants by: West Chester Gas Co. v. Chester Co., <a href="/pa/30/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="30 Pa. 232" data-case-ids="415634" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0232-01">30 Pa. 232</a>; Coatesville Gas Co. v.

The principle is, that the public works of a corporation, used as such, with the necessary appurtenances, shall be exempt from taxation as land, but be subject to it in another form; and that a gas company so far partakes of the nature of a corporation for public purposes as to be subject to the same rule.</p>

      <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>3. The claim that this tax can be sustained as a tax on capital stock, under the acts of 1840 and 1841, is now first made-after the lapse of forty-seven years since the passage of the act which is said to have conferred the power. Gas pipes are not capital stock. In some of the cases cited, specific prop-, erty of a corporation is spoken of as “ a part of the capital stock,” but these words are not used in any exact sense, and are readily understood in connection with the questions involved in those cases. The specific property may represent the capital stock, in the sense that it may have been purchased with funds received from a sale of the stock, but it cannot in any sense properly be said to be the capital stock, or a part thereof. But, conceding that a tax on capital stock is a tax on property, it does not follow that a tax on property is a tax on capital stock. The distinction is recognized in Pullman Palace Car Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/107/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="107 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="8856696" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0156-01">107 Pa. 156</a>.</p>

L. 612, and the latter act provided for the assessment of the capital stock of banks and companies, that the assessment of these gas pipes eo nomine was an assessment of the capital stock. If the act of 1841 were now before us, it is doubtful whether it could be sustained. It is in conflict with the system of taxation adopted by the commonwealth since the act of 1840. It must receive a strict construction, and that would limit both acts to the six years named therein, for both stand stamped with the legislative sanction that they are extraordinary acts, and experiments for only that period of time. But, whether that is true or not, the learned judge very properly dismissed that part of the case with the laconic remark that the bill and answer disclose no taxation of the capital stock as such.</p>

It may be somewhat difficult to define what is a public work or a public corporation in this sense, but it is clear that one of the characteristics is that it has the right of eminent domain, that it has franchises which justify the legislature in defining or considering it public. A mere private corporation needs no franchise from the state in order to carry on its business. Men may manufacture shoes without corporate power, but they cannot occupy streets or property of private individuals without corporate power or warrant from the state. They need a delegation of sovereignty and in such cases their works may be properly called public works. In the class of cases in which the double taxation here sought is inhibited, it will be found that this is one of the characteristics. It has assumed a distinctive criterion for the division of our tax laws, and runs through the construction and classification of the same. The decision of the learned judge of the Common Pleas was in entire harmony with these views and must receive the sanction of this court.</p>
