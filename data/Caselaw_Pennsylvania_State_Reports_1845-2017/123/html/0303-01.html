If the bill escapes dismissal for misjoinder of parties or multifariousness, must not the case be based upon the facts which are common to all ? If the case of McFarland depends upon the fact that Joseph Myers told him that the bank was paying sixteen per cent and had a surplus of $40,000, and thus induced him to purchase, certainly, even admitting that Myers could thus make his copartners responsible for his representations, McFarland could not join with him as a plaintiff Mr. Sampson, who bought because his partner, Mr. Fairman, whose estate is also a plaintiff, had bought some and told him (Sampson) what dividends had been paid; nor could he join with him Mr. Graham, another of the plaintiffs, who bought simply on the reputation of the bank. These particular inducements being excluded, we have the case within a very small compass. There is apparently little else than that the existing partners, thinking, though mistakenly, that the stock which they had was worth $120,000, fixed that as its value, and offered to take in as partners persons who were willing to contribute $130,000 more and make the entire capital stock $250,000, and the acceptance of the offer. It is true that the plaintiffs rely upon the fact that large dividends had been paid and that the declaration of the July dividend was advertised; but these they cannot well maintain are evidences of fraud, whilst admitting that the stockholders and directors honestly believed the bank to be in a flourishing condition and the stock well worth the estimate put upon it in November, 1871. If we relieve the old stockholders from the charge of intentionally dealing in <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>worthless stock in November, 1871, and admit that at that time they thought it was worth what it was estimated at, we cannot well infer from the declaring of dividends and advertising them previously, that their intention was to impose worthless stock upon others. If the stock was in good faith considered worth $120,000 in November, 1871, then the declaring or the manner of declaring the dividend in July, 1871, cannot be held to afford a particle of evidence of bad faith at that time with respect to this same matter.</p>

It must be remembered that the defendants did not actually submit to the plaintiffs any statement as to the specific condition of the bank, and that this was not strictly a sale to the plaintiffs of an interest which the defendants owned. It was a reorganization of the bank, and the new capital was to constitute more than half of the assets of the bank; and it is only by inference, if at all, that, we arrive at the conclusion that the old stockholders placed a valuation upon the assets of the bank. Beyond doubt they did not pretend or assume that a division of the assets at the time would give $400 to each share. They counted largely on the established business of the bank, and probably, if the question had been asked as to why they fixed $400 as the value of each share, the answer would have been, that the stock readily sold for that in the market; and this answer would have been strictly true. This relation of trust and confidence which heightens the responsibility of the vendor does not arise in a case where the vendor has simply previously had better opportunities than the vendee of becoming acquainted with the subject-matter of the sale. If it did, we could apply the doctrine to almost every case of sale. The subject-matter of the sale must be of such a character or so situated as to preclude the presumption that the vendee has availed himself of the ordinary sources of information: Rockafellow v. Baker, <a href="/pa/41/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="41 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="480066" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0319-01">41 Pa. 319</a>.

This second proposition is to a great extent based upon the case of Eawlins v. Wickham, 3 DeGfex &amp; J. 304. At first blush that case would seem very similar to the present one; but a closer examination shows wide differences. In the case of Eawlins and Wickham the partners exhibited to the proposed purchaser a balance sheet containing erroneous statements specific in their nature and of the very essence of the contract. If Wickham had simply said to Eawlins that he believed the interest which they proposed to sell was worth the amount asked and exhibited no statement, would he not have done substantially what justice Bruce says he should have done, if he wanted to avoid responsibility for the absolute truth of specific statements contained in the books. Or if he had simply told him that he (Wickham) had paid a like amount for a like interest, certainly it would have affected the liability to which he was held. As we have before suggested, it being admitted that the defendants, in good faith, thought the stock worth $400 per share in November, 1871, it is simply impossible to regard their declaring and advertising of previous dividends as part of a scheme to get more than its value for their property. Besides, it must at all times be kept in view that these defendants did not sell their stock to the plaintiffs and did not propose to sell it to them, but simply offered them a chance to contribute money and form a new copartnership with a more than doubled capital, taking the old concern as the basis and throwing in the asset of unknown value, its established business or good will. In Eawlins v. Wickham, whatever may have been the actual facts of the case, the opinions are based largely on the idea that there was an actual sale by Wickham to Eawlins, not simply the formation of a new company to which both contributed.</p>

If, however, mistake is the foundation of the plaintiffs’ case, it is best answered by considering the effect of the statute of limitations and the plaintiffs’ laches. The statute of limitations is a bar to the plaintiffs’ case, excepting in a single contingency, to wit, the fraud of the defendants ; and this fraud must, in the opinion of the master, be actual fraud. Not actual' fraud in a narrow or restricted sense, but something more than mere constructive fraud, which involves no moral guilt whatever on the part of any one. It may be false representations as to material facts by the defendants, or by parties who were their agents or the benefit of whose representations they received; or it may be representations made as to facts as to the truth of which the defendants have not knowledge, the statements being made in such a way as to involve an assertion of knowledge on their part. In any of these cases the defendants would be chargeable with fraud, which might prevent the running of the statute of limitations in their favor, until the discovery of the fraud; but any other case made out by them would be barred.</p>

This, however, is on the assumption that the defendants were under some special obligation to protect the interests of the plaintiffs in this transaction. Morgan v. Tener is the case of an attorney (collection agency), liable for money collected by its agent misleading the party to whom responsible by reporting (in good faith, it is admitted) from time to time that the claim was uncollectible. It was held that the statute was prevented from running by these misleading reports. The doctrine upon which this ruling is based is well settled in Pennsylvania, and is, it might be said, peculiar to the case of a party employed to collect money or placed in a like situation. It does not depend upon fraud, and the misleading report is not stamped as fraud. It depends upon the peculiar relations of the parties. A glance at the method of its evolution at once explains <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>its nature. It was first held that the onus was on the attorney to show that he had notified his client of the collection, and that the statute would run only from the time when he showed that such notice had been given: McDowell v. Potter, <a href="/pa/8/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="8 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="959497" data-case-paths="/pa/8/0189-01">8 Pa. 189</a>.

Evans, <a href="/pa/66/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="66 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="432492" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0192-01">66 Pa. 192</a>, and Morgan v. Tener, supra-It is true that in Campbell v. Boggs, “fraudulent concealment” is that which is spoken of as sufficient to prevent the running-of the statute, but an examination of all the cases, including Morgan v.

But in this case the defendants constituted a partnership; they acted through a board, and they, by authority, through an executive officer. No individual partner sold his interest in the firm. The partnership as a firm authorized its board to sell an interest in the firm for the benefit of the firm, and the new capital was to go into the firm. At least a part of these agents and the principal acting and authorized agent knew that it was a fraud. It is as though A, B and G were partners in trade, B and C having given over the management to A, who, without the knowledge of B and C, has mismanaged the business and misappropriated the funds until the firm is insol vent; and thereupon, at the instance of A, his copartners make him the agent <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>of the firm to procure D and E to enter the firm, contribute to its capital and become liable for its debts, on the assertion that the firm was solvent.

The modern doctrine of courts of equity in reference to the lapse of time, we understand to be as follows : (1) Where the cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations, courts of equity give the same effect to the statute as do courts of law, except in cases of technical trust. (2) But when the statutory time has not elapsed, or when for any reason the statute does not apply, yet where a complainant has so long refrained from filing his bill that injustice or loss would be inflicted upon innocent third parties who have become involved in the subject matter, or, where the defendant has been misled to his injury by the inactivity of the complainant, there courts of equity will refuse relief. This latter doctrine is the doctrine of laches, as applicable to the present case: Overt v. Overt, <a href="/nj-eq/12/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="12 N.J.

In the light of these principles and authorities, was not the decree dismissing our bill on the ground of laches clearly wrong ? No facts or circumstances are pointed out, which would make it inequitable to grant that relief to complainants which the merits of the case show they were entitled to. The master, whose reasoning is adopted by the court, treats the case as one of election. The plaintiffs were compelled to pay the partnership debts ; they surely had no election as to that. The only part of their conduct that savors of choice, was that they chose not to file* their bill until by their aid and #their money the debts were paid. The very opposite effect ought to be given to their choice.</p>

    <p id="b348-4" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[245,607,1192,713]]]'>Assuming, as the court does, that under the facts found the appellees were at one time liable to appellants for the loss they respectively sustained, and that, within a reasonable time after they purchased the stock and discovered the fraud that was practiced on them, they had a right, in some form of action, to rescind the contract and recover the money paid by them, respectively, we think there was no error in holding that a bill in equity is the proper and better form of action, for the reasons that the remedy at law would be inadequate, and that a bill in equity prevents multiplicity of suits. As the result of the sales of stock to appellants, they and appellees became, as to third parties, partners in fact, and hence there were equities to be settled between each of them, individually, that could not be conveniently adjusted in an action or actions at law.</p>
    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[240,1329,1193,1022]]]'>The remaining and controlling question is whether or not appellants did not sleep too long on their rights, and thereby lose their remedy against the appellees. We are constrained to concur with the master and court below in holding that they did. They are demanding the rescission of a contract executed eight years before their bill was filed. One of the first duties of a party who seeks that form of equitable relief is promptness. Assuming that appellants were ignorant of the fraud until the company became notoriously insolvent in January, 1875, they were certainly made aware of the fact then; but, instead of promptly repudiating the contract which they then knew was conceived in iniquity, they co-operated with the appellees as partners, and waited until nearly six years had elapsed. Beyond doubt that was unreasonable delay. Conceding the right to rescind and demand restitution of the consideration of the contract immediately upon discovery of the fraud, which was certainly not later than January, 1875, when the company became notoriously insolvent, the right was and ought to be lost in consequence of the inexcusable delay in asserting it.</p>
