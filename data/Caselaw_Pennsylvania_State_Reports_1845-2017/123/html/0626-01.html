No report was made, as of the first of January, in any year, to the auditor general; nor did he, so far as <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>lias been shown, fix tbe amount of tbe tax and. transmit tbe required notice to the treasurer, and therefore tbe tax has not been assessed as required by tbe act. And even if all this bad been done, tbe fatal objection of want of notice to tbe bondholders and opportunity to appeal, would still remain. There is also tbe additional objection to both of these acts that they require tbe assessment of the tax upon, and its retention from the interest on, all tbe evidences of indebtedness of tbe municipalities, without regard to whether they are owned by residents of the state or non-residents, although it has been determined by the Supreme Court of the United States that non-resident bondholders cannot be taxed: State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds, 15 Wal. 800.</p>

We have grave doubts whether both § 42 of the act of 1844 and § 4 of the act of 1864 are not repugnant to this clause. We know, not'what it means, nor to what it can be applied, unless it be that all taxes on the same class of subjects must be levied and collected under the same general laws; that the taxes on part of a given class of subjects cannot be levied and collected under a law which applies to them only, and prescribes a mode in which they are to be levied and collected, different from that in which the taxes on the remaining subjects of the same class are to be levied and collected under the general laws. If this be so, and if municipal loans be a part of the class of subjects described in § 1 of the act of 1885 as “all mortgages, money owing by solvent debtors, whether by promissory note, penal or single.bill, bond or judgment, .and all public loans and stocks whatsoever .and all other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens;” then it would seem that, as the taxes on these municipal loans are not levied and collected under the general laws, there is a violation of the mandate of the constitution in the attempt to levy and collect them under these special laws.</p>

Their vice is that they do not embrace all of the class to which they are naturally related.” And in the same case, which is a tax case, the court say the same rule for determining what is general and what is special legislation must- be applied to the constitutional mandate that property must be assessed for taxes under general laws. These considerations seem to make it at least doubtful whether these sections of the act of 1844, and the act of 1864, are not, both, unconstitutional and void, because they are special laws for levying and assessing taxes.</p>

This interest money, as soon as it is set apart for the payment of the bondowner, becomes and is his individual property, and when it reaches him, then the commonwealth may tax it; but until it reaches him, and becomes a part of his estate, it cannot be taxed to him indirectly: Murray v.

On its face the settlement is made under the act of 1885, and the court has decided and the attorney general concedes that the claim is not under this statute. If the state is to fall back upon the act of 1864, it is obvious that none of the requirements of <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>that act have been complied with, either by tbe municipality or by tbe state.

The settlement is therefore void, as made against the wrong party: Commonwealth v. Morrison, 1 Pears. 317. But, according to all the well-received rules of construction, the act of 1864 must be held to have repealed § 42 of the act of 1844. The act of 1864 provides a system for taxing municipal bonds at a time and in a manner different from that provided by the act of 1844. Both acts cannot possibly be pursued, and hence, as the whole ground is covered by each, the last act must prevail.</p>
