But if they were guilty of negligence in a failure to properly support and prop this pipe that they had undermined, and the accident occurred by reason of their negligence, and was the natural result of it, then they would be liable. [The Chartiers .company claims, however, to be free from liability, because, they say, they had given out a contract to do this entire work (apparently laying their main pipe all through Pittsburgh) to one Martin Joyce, and that it was his duty to see to this propping and the proper filling of the trench; that as they had no power over it, therefore they are not liable, and have asked us to so instruct you, which we refuse to do. The ordinary rule is, as claimed by the learned counsel for the Chartiers company, namely, that where an owner or a company having a work to perform gives out the contract as a whole to some independent contractor, who has charge of the entire business, and an accident occurs by reason of the negligence of that contractor, the owner is not responsible. That is a general rule and a particular rule. It has some exceptions, however. If the owner or the party giving out the contract has a special duty to perform to another, private or public, the failure to do which is negligence, he cannot get rid of the obligation by giving out a contract to a third party. If, when the contract is given out for the work in contemplation and necessary to be performed, great danger is incurred, or an injury may be done to the public or to some private person that requires great care to guard against, the owner or party giving out the contract must see that the contractor or somebody else guards against it. As, for instance, if a contract for a building contemplates a great excavation out into the street by the contractor, which is very dangerous, I take it that the owner must see that the public is protected in that case. The failure to perform some duty that is an ordinary one of the contractor, or the doing of some act by the contractor not necessarily contemplated in the contract, would be the negligence of the contractor alone; as in this ease, any act <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>causing an injury done by Martin Joyce, which was not fairly necessary in the contemplation of the contract between him and the Chartiers company, would be Martin Joyce’s negligence and not that of the company. For instance, if he failed to put lights or proper protections in his trench and somebody fell into it (and a great many like things) the company would not be responsible. But the very contract itself in this .case contemplated and made necessary the excavation and undermining of this service pipe. It was in contemplation of the parties that it should be done. It was the thing that the Chartiers company directed by its contract should be done by Martin Joyce, and they owe a duty, as I have said in answer to one of the points, to the owner of that pipe and to the public, to take reasonable care to see that it was properly supported; and the consequences of failure to perform that duty cannot be gotten rid of, simply because there was a general contract on the part of Martin Joyce to do it, and he may be, and no doubt is, responsible to them for his negligence. As I have said, if this accident occurred by the negligence of Martin Joyce in doing something not contemplated in the contract— if, for instance, he had properly protected this service pipe and given it a secure and complete foundation so that it would not sink down, and then negligently himself in filling up or paving over it caused the injury, the Chartiers company would not be responsible. That is something that would be Martin Joyce’s negligence; that is something not necessarily in contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.] 3 The question I may say to the jury, as I have stated to counsel in your presence, is in my judgment a close one. I do not think it is absolutely ruled by any case in Pennsylvania. I have given you the instructions as to what in my judgment is the proper rule of law under the peculiar circumstances of this case, and under the act of assembly and the ordinance of the city of Pittsburgh, and if I am wrong the Supreme Court will correct me. I have given the ruling that I'think is supported by authorities in this country and in England, and a rule that in my judgment is necessary for the proper protection of the public.....</p>

There is evidence from which the jury may fairly find, that the accident occurred by reason of the breaking of the service pipe of the Philadelphia Company, and that the breaking of this pipe was caused by tbe taking away the proper support of said pipe by the digging of tbe trench and laying of the large main of the Chartiers Valley Gas Company, and failure to renew the support. When the Chartiers company undertook to lay its main along Penn street, in the city of Pittsburgh, under the act of assembly and the city ordinance, and contracted for tbe laying thereof, it owed to the Philadelphia Company, which bad already bad its pipes there, and to the property holders and to the public, a duty of supporting such pipes. This duty was a positive obligation which they could not get rid of by giving a contract to a third party to do the work. If the pipe broken was necessarily undermined and its support taken away by tbe laying of tbe Chartiers company’s main, as contemplated in the contract with Martin Joyce, and it was not supported by that company or its agent or contractor, but left without reasonable or proper support from an ordinary pressure from above, and thereby it was broken so as to cause the gas to escape, and thereby canse the accident, the Chartiers company cannot escape tbe consequence of the neglect of its obligation, by showing that they bad contracted with another to perform the duty. The act of assembly provides that “ any company laying a pipe line under the provisions of the act shall be liable for all damages occasioned by reason of tbe negligence of said company.” There <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>is also evidence from which the jury may fairly find — in fact it is the uncontradicted testimony — that the Chartiers company’s main had been fully laid and completed for a considerable time, past the place complained of, and the trench filled up and the pavement relaid, and also that the superintendent of the company had full notice and actual knowledge of the faulty manner in which its contractor was performing the duty of securing the pipes of other companies.1</p>

It follows that the gas company brought itself within the well known principle that one who renders services in the course of a lawful employment, representing the will of his employer only as to the result of his work, and not as to the means by which it is accomplished, is an indepéndent contractor, and his principal is not liable for his negligence. It is difficult to see how the provision of the statute, the second proviso to § 10, act of May 29,1885, affects the company’s liability, as it would be liable for its' own negligent act irrespective of any such provision.</p>

Lynch, the ruling of the court below upon the question raised in this case was affirmed with regret. The case was tried upon the assumption that the liability arose by reason of the gas company having taken negli<a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>gent work off the hands of the contractor, knowing that it was negligently and dangerously done, and the judgment was reversed because of insufficient evidence to sustain the points made. The present case below was put on a modification of the doctrine as to independent contractors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b247-4" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[216,619,1186,767]]]'>2. The distinction contended for is akin to that which arises in certain eases between master and servant. When the master or superior places entire charge of his business, or a distinct branch of it in the hands of an agent or subordinate, exercising no discretion or oversight of his own, the master is held liable for the negligence of such agent or subordinate : Mullan v. Steamship Co., <a href="/pa/78/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="78 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1040403" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0025-01">78 Pa. 25</a>; New York etc. IT. Co. v.

So in this case, when the property or the rights of others axe necessarily to he interfered with, we claim the responsibility cannot he delegated. If, of two adjoining houses having a mutual easement of support, one is to be taken down, and the act necessarily endangers the other, there is no justice, whatever the law may be, in permitting the owner who removes the building to shift his duty over upon a contractor who may he wholly irresponsible.</p>

Where the employer of the contractor has no duties, but the contractor has, the contractor is liable; but where the employer has a duty towards the plaintiff, he cannot delegate its performance to a third person: McLaughlin v.

The act of assembly provides that ‘ any company laying a pipe-line under the provisions of the act shall be liable for all damages occasioned by reason of the negligence of said company.’ There is also evidence from which the jury may fairly find, in fact it is the uncontradicted testimony, that the Chartiers company’s main had been fully laid and completed for a considerable time past the place complained of, and the trench filled up and the pavement relaid, and, also, that the superintendent of the company had full notice and actual knowledge of the faulty manner in which its contractor was performing the duty of securing the pipes of other companies.”</p>

There are no facts proved to take the case out of the rule which relieves the defendant company. The latter part of the answer of the learned judge which relates to an implied acceptance of the work from the contractor, and full notice of the faulty manner in which the contractor performed his work, is not sustained by the evidence, and the proper disposition of the case rests upon the first paragraph of the answer to the defendant’s first point.

It is, however, urged that under the act of 'assembly and the city ordinance the defendant owed to the Philadelphia Company, and the property holders and the public, a duty of supporting such pipes, and hence the Chartiers company is liable. We have seen that so far as the immediate facts of this case are concerned, as between the company and the contractor, the former is not liable. Is she liable under the principle that an express statutory obligation is inferred from which she cannot be relieved? We can discover no such clause in the act of assembly referred to. The only sentence referred to is where the act provides that “ any company laying a pipe-line under the provisions of the act shall be liable for all damages occasioned by reason of the negligence of said company.” Certainly no duty is imposed by this language; no express or definite obligation is laid upon the company as regards what work she shall do or how she shall do it. It is not necessary to determine in this case whether the English rule of liability has been or should be adopted by our courts. It will be seen that this case does not come within the principles of the English cases which the learned judge below; undoubtedly had in his mind, and are referred to by the learned counsel for the defendant in error.</p>

Pullen, 5 B. &amp; S. 970, is cited as authority for the principle, and in his treatise the author condenses the case properly by saying: “ Where a statute ordered the owner of land to make a drain and to refill it with earth, and the owner employed a contractor who neglected properly to refill the drain, it was held that the owner was liable.”- The case shows that there was an express and fully defined statutory duty absolutely imposed upon the owner of the premises, and how he was to perform it, and the time when, and it was properly held that he could not delegate fit or shift this responsibility by employing a contractor. The judgment of the court clearly puts the case upon the fact of a statutory duty absolutely created. There is in this case no ordinance of the city shown which creates <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>such a duty. The learned judge seems to think that because the pipe of the Philadelphia Company was necessarily undermined and therefore contemplated by the contract, it changes the rule, because it is a necessary interference with the rights of others. The answer is, there is no necessary interference with the rights of others unless negligence exists. Both companies had their rights, and they are perfectly consistent with each other. If the company itself was guilty of negligence she would he liable for consequent injury to another’s rights; if the contractor alone is guilty, he alone is liable.</p>
    <p id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[243,878,1183,148]]]'>The view of the learned judge would introduce an additional refinement into this branch of the law, the necessity of which is not apparent upon the facts of this ease.</p>
    <p id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[242,1033,1185,253]]]'>We are of the opinion that the point of the defendant should have been affirmed without qualification. Inasmuch as the error committed runs through the other assignments of error is is unnecessary for us to refer to them specifically. No negligence was proved against defendant.</p>
