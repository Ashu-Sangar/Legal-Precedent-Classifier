The street is occupied by two main tracks of the defendant company and a number of side tracks. On the side of the street where the station is, there is quite a village wherein many mill-hands reside. The only regular public crossing in the neighborhood is a township road near the upper end of the steel works. A street called Belle avenue opens upon the railroad opposite the steel works, but there is no crossing, although for a number of years persons, principally mill-hands, crossed from the mills, directly or diagonally, at this point, to enter or leave Belle avenue, with the knowledge of the defendant company and without objection or warning. „</p>

There was ample evidence that the defendant company for years prior to this accident had permitted whoever chose to do so to cross its tracks at the mouth of Belle avenue; that whilst using this crossing Alfred Marland was injured, and that it was a want of reasonable care which caused the accident.

Troutman, 11 W. N. 453, cited by the court in the first case, were decided upon the fact that there was a common and well known foot path across the track, well known to the railroad company to be used by persons crossing, and that the company was bound to anticipate that people might avail themselves of the license. But in the present case, identical almost with Penn. R. Co. v.

He testified that he looked up and down the road and saw no train, but nevertheless he was struck by an approaching engine, and we held he could not recover. In the very late case of Penn. R. Co. v. Bell, reported in <a href="/pa/122/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="122 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="1948406" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0058-01">122 Pa. 58</a>, we reversed the judgment because the court below did not direct a verdict for the defendant upon <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>entirely similar facts and for the same reason. There also the plaintiff’s witness testified that he looked for the train, but that the deceased was struck the moment they saw the headlight, and we held that the deceased had voluntarily placed himself so close to the rails that he was struck by the engine, and, therefore, there could be no recovery.</p>
    <p id="b511-4" data-blocks='[["BL_511.4",511,[191,670,1182,563]]]'>In the present case, the facts aré still more damaging to the plaintiff, because he attempted to cross the track immediately in front of the train which he could not possibly have looked for without seeing. It was about half-past five o’clock upon an afternoon in February. There was no evidence that it was dark, and the plaintiff’s principal witness testified tliat he saw the plaintiff falling, from a point almost a hundred feet distant. The attempt to cross the track in front of an approaching train so close that the plaintiff was instantly struck, was an act of gross carelessness on his part, contributing directly to his injury, and this precludes any recovery.</p>
    <p id="b511-5" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[970,1239,358,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[706,1293,155,32]]]'>No. 214.</p>
    <p id="b511-7" data-blocks='[["BL_511.7",511,[193,1343,1179,149]]]'>For the reasons stated in the opinion in the case of Marland, a minor, by his next friend, v. The Pittsb. &amp; Lake Erie R. R. Co., the judgment in this case is affirmed.</p>
