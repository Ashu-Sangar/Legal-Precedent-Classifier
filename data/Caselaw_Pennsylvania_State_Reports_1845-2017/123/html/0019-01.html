Further drilling was delayed by a resulting “fishing job” until April 4, 1884.

    <p class="summary" id="b43-5" data-blocks='[["BL_43.5",43,[227,628,1186,458]]]'>The plaintiff claims substantial performance. In two particulars it was clearly not according to the plain terms of the contract. (1) The contract required the well to be reamed out to 8 inch diameter below salt water, so as to admit a casing of five and five eighths inch diameter in the clear. It required the well to be thus reamed out from 940 to 1820 feet. (2) At the bottom, for 180 or 200 feet, the well was only four or four and one fourth inches in diameter instead of five and five eighths inches.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b43-6" data-blocks='[["BL_43.6",43,[228,1093,1184,668]]]'>It is not pretended that there was any serious obstacle or difficulty in completing the well strictly in accordance with the contract. Mr. Reese, the driller, and others, show that it would only have required more time and expense. It is also a patent fact, as well as proven by Mr. Guffy, that a four and one quarter inch well would not produce as much gas as a five and five eighths inch well. The plaintiff, however, replies that the defendants have no good ground of complaint: (1) Because the four and one fourth inch hole tested the territory as well as a five and five eighths inch hole would have done; and (2) that reaming out the well to the depth of 1820 feet would only have subjected the defendants to further expense and further loss, as the experiment proved it was not gas territory.</p>

They do not prove substantial performance of contract; they simply amount to this: — true, the well is not according to our contract, but as the matter turned out you ought not to complain, because it tested the territory, and at a less expense to you than if we had completed it according to the contract. In opposition to this stands the contract, in plain, unmistakable terms. It says nothing about a test well. No doubt the defendants expected to get gas, and made their contract in view of it. The plaintiff agreed to sink a well of the definite, specific diameter and depth required. They could have done so, but did not. If <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>they wilfully neglected to do so, they have no legal claim upon defendants for their pay.</p>

If in this case, the results of drilling the well as it was drilled were substantially the same as if it had been drilled in strict accordance with the contract, that would be strong evidence of substantial performance : Tilton v.

    <p id="b46-4" data-blocks='[["BL_46.4",46,[235,1556,1191,509]]]'>The equitable doctrine of substantial performance is intended for the protection and relief of those who have faithfully and honestly endeavored to perform their contracts in all material and substantial particulars, so that their right to compensation may not be forfeited by reason of mere technical, inadvertent, or unimportant omissions or defects. It is incumbent on him who invokes its protection to present a case in which there has been no wilful omission or departure from the terms of his contract. If he fails to do so, the question of substantial performance should not be submitted to the jury.</p>
