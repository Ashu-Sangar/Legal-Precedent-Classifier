There is no question of tender involved, and the authorities cited upon that question are therefore inapplicable. The plaintiff sues upon a policy insuring against loss by fire. The defendant admits the loss, avers the covenant to assign “ on receiving payment,” and alleges an offer to perform, on its .part, on or concurrently with performance by the plaintiff, which was refused and its right to such assignment denied. This is. a complete answer to the action. The plaintiff cannot compel performance by the insurance company, while refusing performance of its own covenant with which that of the insurance company is connected and upon which it is dependent.</p>
