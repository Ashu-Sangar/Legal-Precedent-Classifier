It does not expressly or by implication repeal any of the provisions of the act of 1832, and the entire current of legislation, dating from 1832 to the present time indicates that the act of 1832 was the parent stem upon which was en-grafted the acts of 1834,1851,1853, and other acts down to the present time. While the act of 1853 does not in precise terms provide that the provisions of the act of 1832 regulating the <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>sale or mortgaging of land by an administrator, in counties other than the county of the domicil of the decedent, should be strictly followed as to mode of procedure, yet the same, we submit, is plainly inferable from the act of 1853, itself.</p>

It is true that as to the land lying in Clearfield county, the Orphans’ Court of Jefferson county could-not consummate the conversion of the real estate in Clearfield county into money, without the aid of the Orphans’ Court of the latter county.

If this were a new question, the opposite view from the one presented might be taken without injustice to those who have relied upon the decided cases in this court. But to hold now that the Orphans’ Court had no jurisdiction in this case, in the face of the decisions above cited, some of which have stood so long uncriticised, would not only injure an innocent purchaser, but would unséttle titles to the amount of millions of dollars.</p>

Schumacher at the time of, or prior to, his decease was in Butler county, and letters of administration upon his estate were, after his death, in due form of law, committed to his widow, Julia C.

The Orphans’ Court of Butler county having jurisdiction of the accounts of the administratrix, had power on her application, under the act of <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>March 29, 1882, to authorize a sale or mortgage of the real estate of the decedent for the payment of his debts. If the real estate, with respect to which the application was made, was situated in Butler county, the Orphans’ Court of that county had full power to order the sale or mortgage of such part or as much of the same as to the court should seem necessary for the purposes stated; but if the real estate was situated in another county, the Orphans’ Court of Butler county, if satisfied as to the propriety of a sale or mortgage, would have had power merely to authorize the administrator to raise, from the real estate so situated, such sum of money as was necessary for the purpose stated, designating the amount, and the Orphans’ Court of the county where the real estate is situated, upon presentation of such decree, and upon proper application, had the power to make the order of sale or mortgage of so much and such parts of the land as would, in the opinion of that court, be necessary to raise the sum specified. In this form of procedure the Orphans’ Court of the county having jurisdiction of the accounts, alone, has the power to decide whether or not the personal estate of a decedent is sufficient to pay his debts, to determine the amount of the probable deficiency, and to pass upon the propriety of a sale or mortgage of the decedent’s lands to raise the amount required; and for the better determination of these matters, it is provided that no authority for the sale or mortgage of real estate lying in the same or another county shall be granted until the administrator shall have exhibited to the court an inventory and appraisement of all the personal estate of the decedent, a true account or schedule of his debts and a statement of all his real estate wheresoever situated. The Orphans’ Court of the. county where the land is situate, if it be situate in another county, is presumed to know what part and how much of the land it would be necessary and expedient to sell to raise the sum specified; but the jurisdiction of the court to order a sale or mortgage is dependent wholly upon the decree of flu: court having jurisdiction of the account.</p>

But this proceeding was not instituted in the Orphans’ Court of the county having jurisdiction of the administratrix’s account: there was no inventory or appraisement of the personal property, schedule of debts or statement of the real estate of the decedent exhibited to the court: it is not pretended that the mortgage was made pursuant to the provisions of the act of 1832.</p>

L. -503. This act was based upon a widely different policy and was intended to accomplish a wholly different purpose: it was passed because, as stated in the preamble, “ the general welfare requires that real estate should be freely alienable.” The intention was to untie the cords which fetter real estate, whether bound by the disability of persons, the limitations of contingent interests, or by restrictions to limited uses and purposes, and at the same time to preserve to every interest its proper share in the result: Burton’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=57%20Pa.%20219" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="57 Pa. 219">57 Pa. 219</a>; and, as it unfetters the realty from the disabilities of owners and from limited and restricted titles, it secures to the purchasers clear and indefeasible titles in fee simple. Its design was to facilitate the transmission of titles, to make real property available for commercial and business uses, to encourage and promote improvement and thereby to stimulate trade and to develop the resources of the state. The act has no reference to or necessary connection with the administration of decedents’ estates. It was not passed for that purpose and cannot in any sense, we think, be regarded as in pari materia with the act of 1832.</p>

Upon a somewhat careful examination of the act we find nothing therein which could appear to give jurisdiction in this case, unless it be found to fall within some one of the following provisions, which we have extracted and set down in their order :</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[252,811,1220,517]]]'>The act provides that such sale, mortgaging, leasing, or conveyance upon ground-rent may be decreed whenever real estate shall be held for or owned by minors, etc.;.whenever a decedent’s real estate is subject to the lien of debts not of record;.or, where any party interested therein is under a legal disability to sell and convey the same. It is expressly provided, however, that nothing in this act contained shall be taken to repeal or impair the authority of any act of assembly, general or private, authorizing the sale of real estate by a decree of court or otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b214-8" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[255,1328,1194,1132]]]'>It is plain that if the sale had been prayed for upon either the first or third ground, the guardian of these minor children would have been the only proper party to the petition: neither the widow nor the administrator could represent them in such a proceeding. We do not understand the defendants in error to place the question of jurisdiction on either of these grounds; the minority of the children and their title to the land are facts set forth in the petition, and their disability to convey may of course be implied, but the ground upon which they rest the jurisdiction of the court is as follows, viz.: “ That the said real estate is subject to the lien of debts due by said decedent, and not of record, and that it is for the best interest and advantage of those interested therein that the same should be mortgaged for the purpose of raising a-sufficient amount of money, to pay or discharge the debts due by the estate of said decedent.” Now, if this petition had been accompanied by the proper inventory, schedule and affidavits required by the act of 1832, no one can doubt that the Orphans’ Court of Butler county would have had full jurisdiction to order a mortgage, for the purpose stated, and this course of procedure would have been in conformity with the uniform and established practice.</p>

If the petition had been by the children through their guardian, or in their behalf, for leave to raise money by mortgage, jurisdiction would undoubtedly have attached: Morrison v.

The interest of the heirs was absolute and in fee; there was no entailment; no limitation by way of contingent remainder or executory devise, nor was their estate restricted to any particular use or limited purpose. Whilst the Orphans’ Court, under the act of 1853, has jurisdiction to sell real estate in any of the cases recited in the act, yet it is plain that the court cannot exercise jurisdiction until a proper case is presented, at the suit of a proper person, and then only to the extent to which that person has a right to demand its exercise. One tenant in corbmon of an absolute interest in fee cannot compel his co-tenant to submit to a sale of the whole title, under the act of 1853, simply because an undivided interest is held for or owned by a minor; nor can he insist upon a sale of the entire title, because the whole is subject to the lien of debts <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>of record. Whilst, in case, may upon the court, under that act, sell his own interest by an indefeasible title, freed from the liens not of record, he has no standing in court to demand the sale of his co-tenant’s title. act of 1853 has application “ whether the ownership be in severalty, joint-tenancy, co-parcenary, or in common;” but mere fact that lands are held in joint-tenancy, co-parcenary, or in common, is no ground of jurisdiction under the of 1853, any more than if they were held in severalty. The act is applicable only, as we have said, when a proper case is presented, and when the proper parties submit themselves to the action of the court. The petitioner, as the widow, no way represented the heirs, or had any right or power over their interest in the land, and although the debts are a lien upon the estate as a whole, she had no standing in court upon that ground, on her own petition, to sell their shares: she might, perhaps, have disposed of her own title under the order of the court, free from these liens, but she had no such interest in their title as would give her standing to compel the sale of theirs.</p>

In the court below the petition was dismissed upon several grounds: first, it was not contemplated that the court in this summary manner should settle and determine disputed titles, and thus supersede the action of ejectment; second, the petitioner was not a person interested; and, third, as the land passed under the intestate law in fee, and was not fettered by entail ment, executory devise, or contingent remainder, a part only of the heirs could not compel a sale of the entire title against the will of the others, and thus deprive them of the right of partition.
