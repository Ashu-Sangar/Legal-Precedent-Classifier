If there were no attachments issued, and the notes had come back to their pledgor, the Penn Bank, or its assignee, still this fund would have to be distributed to the holders of all the notes which were secured by the mortgage pro rata, and notwithstanding the fact that, the Penn Bank was the indorser upon the paper held by the other preferred creditors of William Plolmes, the proceeds of whose property is here for distribution. The fact that there is a liability on the part of the Penn Bank to those creditors, creates no lien in those creditors upon this fund. The lien, which they have, arises from the mortgage of the property which has been sold. It was made by William Holmes. That the Penn Bank after-wards indorsed the paper gives them no other lien upon the property of William Holmes than they had before. Their lien in the first place was for the proportionate share of the property, in the ratio that the notes which they hold bore to the whole amount of the notes secured by the mortgage. That being the collateral security to which they were entitled by virtue of William Holmes’s mortgage, it is not increased or diminished by the indorsement of the Penn Bank; and if the Penn Bank were in possession of the notes which it pledged to the American Exchange National Bank, its assignee would now be entitled to participate in the fund for the benefit of the general creditors of the Penn Bank, just as any other holders of the secured paper.</p>

The objection is made by creditors of the Penn Bank against the participation of another creditor of the same bank. Before the auditor would be justified in excluding such a creditor, contrary to the equitable maxim, which is a part of the common law of Pennsylvania, that “ Equality is equity,” the rights of the contesting creditors against the Penn Bank by virtue of its indorsements ought to be settled in some other proceeding ; and the auditor is of opinion that a mere claim of liabili<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>ty never adjudicated in any court is insufficient to give such creditors a standing here to contest the equal distribution of this fund among all the holders of the notes secured by the mortgage of the property out o£ which it arises.</p>

The reason why this is so, is indicated in all the cases cited; but in Perry’s App., supra, which was a case of a mortgage debt split up into instalments, it is briefly expressed in the statement of Woodward, J., who delivered the opinion, that “ when instalment bonds are assigned, they pass, by relation, an equivalent portion of the mortgage debt.”</p>

Moreover, the dictum on which the learned judge based his decision had reference to a controversy between a mortgagee holding some of the bonds secured by the mortgage, and other persons to whom he had assigned the remainder. Here, however, the Penn Bank, at the time of its assignment, held none of the notes secured by the Holmes mortgage, and the controversy is between rival creditors to whom they had been transferred, as to whom the maxim that equality is equity, should apply.</p>

Bank or Henry Warner, assignee, shall eventually get the notes, it is in favor of the Fourth N. Bank, and arises by reason,of the title to the notes it acquired under the attachment; for in Rushton v. Rowe, <a href="/pa/64/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="64 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="1021275" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0063-01">64 Pa. 63</a>, this court held that an attachment of a mortgage debt operated as an assignment of the debt. And, while it is true that an attaching creditor stands in the shoes of the' defendant debtor, in one sense, this doctrine applies only as between the attaching creditor and the garnishee. Another proposition: The equity, if any exist, of the German N. Bank and Thomas Hare to have distribution prior to the Penn Bank, arises, when? Certainly when it appears by a sale of the mortgaged premises that the fund is insufficient to pay all. This occurred in the present case after title to the notes upon which we claim had vested in Henry Warner, in trust for the creditors of the Penn Bank. Under these circumstances the law will not inquire as to whether or not the holder holds for value. The assignee, in this matter, stands for the creditors.</p>

Were all the notes held at the time of distribution by indorsees, their equities would unquestionably be equal, and they would all be entitled to the fund. Unquestionably, also, if the notes held by the German N. Bank and Thomas Hare, agent, had passed to them by mere delivery, and there was no liability on the part of the Penn Bank upon them, then all the notes would be entitled to share equally. But such is not this case. The Penh Bank by its indorsement assumed a liability upon the notes so held, and when it assigned its assets to Henry Warner it did so subject to the contract on the part of the bank to pay these notes, if the makers did not pay them; and when by its assignment it passed to Henry Warner its interest in the Holmes mortgage, it did so subject to its engagements and liabilities, whatever they were, upon the notes indorsed over to the German N.

Bank and Thomas Hare, agent, have been paid ? The Penn Bank having indorsed the notes to the German N. Bank and Thomas Hare, agent, before maturity and for value, thereby became suretj' for their payment: Daniels on Neg. Inst., § 1303; Byles on Bills, 243*. “Where a surety or a person standing in the situation of a surety for the payment of a debt, receives a security for his indemnity and to discharge such indebtedness, the principal creditor is entitled, in equity, to the full benefit of that security : ” Kramer’s App., <a href="/pa/37/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="37 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="418908" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0071-01">37 Pa. 71</a>.

This principle has been recognized and followed in a number of cases, <em>j </em>It is sufficient to mention Mohler’s App., <a href="/pa/5/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="5 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="953549" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0418-01">5 Pa. 418</a>; Perry’s App., <a href="/pa/22/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="22 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="413721" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0043-01">22 Pa. 43</a>; Hancock’s App., <a href="/pa/34/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="34 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="418003" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0155-01">34 Pa. 155</a>; Hodge’s App., <a href="/pa/84/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="84 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1053553" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0359-01">84 Pa. 359</a>. If there were nothing else in this case we would be constrained to reverse the court below and adopt the views of the master. pBut there is a principle involved which did not enter into any of the cases cited. The Penn Bank was indorser upon each of the notes issued by Holmes, Lafferty &amp; Co., and which were secured by the mortgage in question. When, therefore, the Penn Bank negotiated these notes with its indorsement thereon, it occupied the position of surety to the holders. ]</p>

Together they amount to more than the fund for distribution. The American Exchange National Bank held the remaining three of said notes, amounting to $20,000, as collateral security for an indebtedness of the Penn Bank. The indebtedness of the latter to the American Exchange National Bank has been fully paid out of other securities held by the latter, and the notes would have been returned to the Penn Bank but for the fact that, just prior to the assignment by the latter to Henry Warner for the benefit of its creditors, an attachment was issued in New York by the Fourth National Bank of that city, appellant, and served upon the American Exchange National Bank as garnishee of the Penn Bank, <em>j </em>This attachment is pending in the Court of Errors and Appeals of New York, and we cannot speculate as to its result.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[210,1185,1190,1233]]]'>Such an attachment would be worthless in this state, for the well-settled rule is that the debt must be attached in the hands of the debtor; the mere evidence of the debt not being the subject of attachment. In any event I do not see how the attachment in New York can possibly result in more than the transfer of the notes in question from the garnishee bank to the attaching bank, in which ease the equities of the latter would rise no higher than the equities of the Penn Bank. The equities of the American Exchange Bank would not pass to the Fourth National by operation of law or the mere transfer of the notes, for the reason, amongst others, that the Penn Bank has paid the former, bank in full, and as it is no longer a creditor it has no equities. Under such circumstances the Fourth National would stand in the shoes of the Penn Bank,, so that this case must be disposed of precisely as if that bank was the owner of the $20,000 of notes in question. The fact-that it is now represented by its assignee for creditors does not alter the position in any degree. We have said so often that the assignee is but the representative of the assignor, standing in his shoes, enjoying his rights only, that we are almost weary of repeating it. Yet it seems as necessary to say it now as it ever was. I will refer only to two of the numerous cases that, might be cited upon this point: Wright v. Wigton, <a href="/pa/84/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="84 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1053549" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0163-01">84 Pa. 163</a>; Morris’s App., <a href="/pa/88/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="88 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="1061152" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0368-01">88 Pa. 368</a>.</p>

      <em>V </em>We come now to the question what is the position of the Penn Bank as a claimant upon this fund ? / If it had not become surety on the notes held by the Germán National Bank and Thomas Hare, agent, it would be clear, under Donley v. Hays and the other cases cited, that the fund would have to be distributed pro rata among all the holders of the notes, including the Penn Bank. But that it is such surety is a vital fact in the case. There was no question' of a surety or a guaranty in Donley v. Hays or the other cases referred to. Yet in Mohler’s Appeal and in Hancock’s Appeal the fact that a guaranty of the bonds by the party selling them might affect his rights as a claimant upon a portion of them, was clearly foreshadowed. The principle adopted by the auditor that “ equality is equity ” is very well in its place, but it is not always adopted in distributing a fund among creditors. Such distributions are made upon equitable principles. Thus, it sometimes happens that a creditor who has a first lien is not entitled to take the fund. It was ruled in Himes v. Barnitz, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%2039" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="8 W. 39">8 W. 39</a>, that “ In the appropriation of the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale, though a party claimant had a prior judgment, yet, if insolvent, he shall not take the money raised, to the prejudice of another subsequent judgment creditor to whom he is bound as surety for the payment of his judgment.” Why, then, should the insolvent Penn Bank, which stands as surety on the appellee’s notes, take the fund which in equity and good conscience should go to the holders of those notes ?</p>

The syllabus of that case, which embodies the principle decided, reads: “ Though a claimant to the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale of the personal property of his debtor has the prior execution,' he cannot by virtue thereof, if insolvent, receive the fund to the prejudice of a subsequent execution creditor, for whose claim he was bound as the surety of the debtor, but the proceeds will be appropriated to the latter claimant.” It was said by Justice Woodwakd, in delivering the opinion of the court, that it would be inequitable to permit a joint debtor who is insolvent to divert a fund from a creditor to whom he owes it, into his own irresponsible pocket. It is true, upon the face of the papers the Penn Bank is entitled to a pro rata share of the fund in question. But it is equally bound to the appel<a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>lees -upon its indorsements. Equity would require that the Penn Bank should hand over its share of the notes as soon as received to the appellees for whom it is surety. Equity will apply it as it would he the duty of the Penn Bank to apply it, by handing it over directly to the appellees. <em>J</em>
