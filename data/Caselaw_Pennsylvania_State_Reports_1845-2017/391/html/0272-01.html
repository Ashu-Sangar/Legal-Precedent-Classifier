The basis of this equity action<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> is that decedent had $10,000 in cash in his room prior to his removal to the hospital — approximately two weeks before his death; Stephen Szabo, without decedent’s knowledge or consent, removed this money; upon discovery that the money was missing, William Szabo and Irene Hayek, the two other children, demanded a return of the money whereupon Stephen Szabo turned over to them $7000; on January 22, 1953, William Szabo and Irene Hayek rented a safe deposit box in the Mellon Bank (Braddock Branch) wherein they placed $7000; despite the fact that the safe deposit rental contract provided only for joint access, the Mellon Bank permitted Irene Hayek alone to enter the box on January 8th and January 11th, 1954, without William Szabo’s knowledge or consent; the box was changed from the names of Irene Hayek and William Szabo to Irene Hayek and Carl Hayek, her husband, and now contains $6000 the return of which to the estate has been refused. The relief requested in this action was three-fold: (1) that Stephen Szabo be declared trustee of $3000 and directed to return it to the estate, (2) that Irene Hayek and William Szabo be declared trustees of $7000 and directed to return it to the estate and (3) that the Mellon Bank be restrained from permitting access by anyone to the safe deposit box.'</p>

The answers of Irene Hayek and Stephen Szabo, although separate, were substantially the same: that Stephen Szabo did not take any money without decedent’s authority; that decedent, prior to his hospitalization and in his own room, delivered to Stephen Szabo an undetermined sum of money, wrapped in a package, with instructions that he hold the package for decedent until his return from the hospital, or, in the event of his death, “to divide it as he, Stephen Szabo, saw fit”; shortly after receiving this package Stephen Szabo informed his brother and sister that he was holding this money and the three children agreed that it should be kept in a safe deposit box in the names of William Szabo and Irene Hayek and for that purpose a safe deposit box was rented at the Mellon Bank and the money placed therein; almost a year later Irene Hayek had the box transferred into the names of her husband and herself and the money, now amounting to $6000, is in that box; they categorically deny plaintiff’s right to this money, alleging that decedent made a gift causa mortis of this money to Stephen Szabo.</p>

(3) does the amount in the box represent all or only a part of the original money, and, if only a part, what happened to the rest? Appellants contend that $6000 passed from the decedent to Stephen Szabo, that decedent made a gift causa mortis of that money to Stephen Szabo, and that the amount in the box represents all the money' that was transferred. Appellee contends that $10,000 passed from the decedent to Stephen Szabo, that it was taken by him from the decedent’s possession without the latter’s knowledge and consent, and that $3000 was kept by Stephen Szabo and $7000, originally, by Irene Ilayek and William Szabo but, now, by Irene Hayek.

Under the theory of the two individual defendants who put in a defense — Irene Hayek and Stephen Szabo— while Irene Hayek has possession of the money, yet <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>ownership thereof is in Stephen Szabo, either as a donee of a gift causa mortis, or, as a trustee to divide as he sees fit; if, therefore, the individual defendants prevail the money would belong to Stephen Szabo to keep for himself or divide as he chose and Irene Hayek would share only if Stephen Szabo saw fit to do so. The fact that Irene Hayek might <em>possibly </em>share the money, depending upon Stephen Szabo’s generosity, does not render adverse her interest to the decedent’s estate within the terms of the statute, but merely affects her credibility and the probative value of her testimony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Standing neither to gain nor lose as the direct legal effect of a judgment against her and not subject to having the record be legal evidence against her in some other action, she was a competent witness under the statute.</p>

Stephen as to what to do with it” and that he wanted it kept out of William Szabo’s hands; eleven months after decedent’s death the witness, accompanied by her husband, went to the bank, renewed the box rental and took from the box one package containing money — all that she found — to her home where she counted it and found that it contained $2,090; this money was replaced in the box and, on January 12, 1954, in the presence of several bank officials, the box was opened and found to contain two packages of money amounting to $8000; upon cross-examination, the witness admitted that while William Szabo counted the money on February 2, 1953 she made notations which totaled $7000; Stephen had told his sister that decedent had entrusted the money to him the night before decedent ivas removed to the hospital.</p>

Mr. Helwig: I think that the evidence establishes in the packages which Stephen gave to Irene which she deposited in her box, at least on the day that the money was counted, there was $7000, if believed.
