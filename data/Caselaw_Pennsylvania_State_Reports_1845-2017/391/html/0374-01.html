The <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>case was tried without a jury, and the court found for the plaintiff in the amount of $10,053.13, the sum of amounts paid by plaintiff to the consignees for the shortages with interest from the date of payment.

Because of a strike condition in the port of New York which began March 5, 1954, plaintiff was temporarily prevented from using its own pier facilities to receive the inbound cargo of its vessel, the SS <em>Panama, </em>and to load her outbound. On the day the strike began plaintiff made arrangements to have the <em>Panama </em>call at Philadelphia, the nearest available port. Defendant, Stockard &amp; Company, Inc., which had offices in Philadelphia, undertook to act as the vessel’s agent while in Philadelphia. Stockard arranged to have its wholly owned subsidiary, Mobile Service Corporation, which operated Pier 5, North Wharves, at that time, act as terminal operator for the <em>Panama. </em>Defendant, <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>Stoekard Shipping &amp; Terminal Company, is the successor by merger to Mobile Service Corporation.</p>

The <em>Panama </em>arrived at Pier 5, Philadelphia, on Friday, March 12, 1954, and began discharging cargo on the following Monday. It was loaded outbound and departed on Friday, March 19, 1954. Sometime between April 21, 1954 and May 4, 1954 Mobile sent plaintiff a “turnover” report disclosing the dates upon which it made deliveries of the <em>Panama’s </em>cargo. Consignees under five of the bills of lading, all issued for carriage from Port au Prince to New York, received less cargo than called for by their bills. These shortages totaled four rubber tires and seventy-five bags of coffee.</p>

With respect to handling cargo, stevedores physically unload the vessel and a terminal operator takes charge of the cargo when it is placed on the pier. Customarily terminal operators supply checkers who count the cargo and sort it by mark as it is being discharged onto the pier. The terminal operator is in charge of placing the cargo at proper points on the pier, caring for it and making proper delivery of it to the consignees.</p>

We agree with the court below that plaintiff proved delivery of the seventy-five bags of coffee and four tires by showing that the entire cargo involved was loaded at Port au Prince, that no event during the voyage affected this cargo, and that it was unloaded in its entirety onto Mobile’s pier in Philadelphia. As evidence that all the cargo was loaded at Port au Prince, the plaintiff proved that the course of its business in Port au Prince is such that any shortages in the loading of cargo would have been reflected in various business documents, but that no such error appeared. From the opinion of the learned trial judge we quote his description of these documents and their preparation.</p>

The checkers inform the ship’s chief officer how many items are checked aboard, where they have been put on board ship, and whether any exceptions are taken as to the condition of the cargo. The chief officer, who supervises the loading operation, signs an Over, Short &amp; Damage Report (O. S. &amp; D. Report) made from the checkers’ inspection, and prepares the stowage plan. In the meantime bills of lading are prepared in the steamship office from the information received there from the shippers. The office is informed by the checkers what goods have been loaded and any exceptions are noted on the bills. If there are no exceptions the bills are stamped ‘all cargo on board.’</p>

Report showed sixty ‘checked complete.’ The stowage plan showed that sixty were loaded in hold <em>#7T/D </em>(’tween decks). In addition to the coffee bills of lading involved directly in this case, which called for 604 bags in all, shippers also informed the office that they were shipping an additional 285 bags of coffee.

L. 42, 28 P.S. §§91a-91d (Supp), declares: “A record of an act. . . shall, in so far as relevant, be competent evidence if the custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation, and if it was made in the regular course of business at or near the time of the act, . . . and if, in the opinion of the court, the sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its admission.” It is conceded that the three separate documents introduced to establish the loading of the missing cargo at Port au Prince, (the Bill of Lading, the O. S, &amp; I). Report, and the Stowage Plan), met the first two requirements of the act. The identity and mode of preparation of each document were established by the regular custodian thereof, and <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>each record was compiled in the regular course of business of the carrier at the time of or immediately subsequent to the loading of the cargo aboard the vessel. However, the defendants contend that the sources of information and method of preparation of these documents did not justify their admission. They argue that the O. S. &amp; D. Report, and the Bill of Lading and the Stowage Plan made up therefrom, embody inadmissible hearsay and are entitled to no probative weight. In support of their position they point out that the O. S. &amp; D. Report was made up by the head checker from unidentified sources and “second-hand” information, and therefore it does not show that the head checker whose recitals are contained therein had personal knowledge of the loading. Thus the defendants contend (1) that the individual checkers’ slips, which these records summarize, should have been introduced into evidence, and (2) that the admission of these records unfairly deprived them of an opportunity to cross-examine the checkers who actually counted the goods and made the entries. We think these arguments lack merit. No objection was made to the admission of the documents at the trial, and plaintiff was entitled to assume that it would not be necessary to introduce the records of the individual checkers or to produce corroborating testimony from the checkers themselves. More important, “. . . the . . . [checkers] have in many cases changed and the former ones'cannot be found; in the next place, it cannot always be ascertained accurately which . . . [checker] was concerned in each one of the transactions represented by the hundreds of entries; in the third place, even if they could be ascertained, the production of the scores of'. . . [checkers], to attend court and identify in tedious succession the detailed items of transactions would interrupt and derange the work of the . . . [car<a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>rier], and the evidence would be obtained at a cost practically prohibitory; and finally, the memory of such persons, when summoned, would usually afford little real aid.” 5 Wigmore, Evidence §1530 at 378 (3rd ed. 1940); Cf. <em>Freedman v.

Involved as the checkers are in day-to-day loading of scores of ships, it would be highly improbable that they would be able to recall from actual memory any of the data recorded. For the. foregoing reasons we hold that the court below did not abuse its discretion in admitting these documents in evidence. See 5 Wigmore, op. cit. supra, §§1520, 1530a.</p>

For this reason defendants argue that the “landing” referred to in the bills of lading must include the loading, necessary storage, and delivery of the goods to the forwarding carrier, and that therefore, the bills were still in effect at the time the loss of the goods occurred.

In the present case the parties provided that the “landing” of the goods was to be considered an “accomplishment” of the contract of carriage. Giving the word “landing” its ordinary meaning, and applying that meaning to the context of the carriage contract, we believe that the term' refers to the physical placing- of-, thé cargo • upon - Mobile’s -pier: <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>Certainly, “landing” would not mean “to act as a warehouseman,” or “to hold”, and “to deliver” as the defendants suggest that it should. The defendants introduced no evidence to show that by usage, convention of the trade, or under the surrounding circumstances that “landing” had a meaning different from its ordinary meaning. In effect, the defendants attempt to create an ambiguity where no ambiguity exists, and under this guise, vary the plain meaning of clause 22. This they may not do.

Since tlie leading ease of <em>The Winkfield, </em>[1902] P. 42 (C.A.), it has also been said that the bailee may recover the full value of the lost chattel, holding in trust for the bailor the amount of any recovery beyond his own interest. <em>E.g. Rosenfeld v. Continental Building Operating Co., </em><a href="/f-supp/135/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="135 F.

But this rule should apply only to cases where the bailee, either expressly or by reasonable implication from the circumstances of the case, has the consent of the bailor to bring the action.

(Bailee agreeing to insure goods for bailor may recover full amount of policy). Otherwise, since a recovery for full value by a bailee prevents a subsequent action by the bailor, <em>Gardner v.
