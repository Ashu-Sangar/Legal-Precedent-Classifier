Attached to the application were the written consents of three adjacent property owners, Meehan, Ramsey and McClay, to the erection of a service station by Esso. Only their three properties were within one hundred feet of the main building which Esso proposed to erect. Subsequently, McClay revoked his consent. The building inspector and chairman of the borough zoning committee refused the application, and Esso appealed to the board of adjustment. The board held that since Esso had complied with all of the provisions of the borough’s zoning ordinance, it was entitled to a build: ing permit. From this decision the borough appealed to the county court Contending that the consent of the. owners in interest and number of a majority of all property within one hundred feet of the proposed structure was lacking.

    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[253,782,1146,1034]]]'>A reading of this section indicates that the phrase “the proposed structure” refers to the “gasoline service station.” A gasoline service station is, in common usage, a <em>building </em>from which gasoline and auto supplies are sold. Appellants’ position that the word “structure” was used in section 14 to denote the entire service station installation, which is itself composed of separate “structures”, is justified neither by the definition of the word given in the ordinance itself nor by common usage. We are of the opinion that the council having used the <em>singular </em>— “the <em>proposed structure" </em>— intended to refer to and contemplated only the <em>proposed main building </em>and consequently, it is from this “structure” that the hundred feet measurement must be made in order to determine the property owners from whom consent is required.

She is not the applicant for a <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>permit to construct a gasoline service station.

When a municipal ordinance commits the exertion of the police power to the option of individuals to determine whether the use of property for a purely lawful purpose offends health, safety, or welfare, such ordinance violates the fundamental principles of police power. . . .”</em>
