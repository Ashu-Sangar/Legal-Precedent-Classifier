Each week as the husband-appellant paid his rent he told the appellee’s agent of the condition of the window and glass; on several occasions the appellee’s agent <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>promised to repair the defective condition.

This rule draws a distinction between <em>averments; </em>it classifies the <em>averments </em>which do and the. <em>averments </em>which do not require responsive pleading. The clear, import of the rule is that before <em>any </em>responsive pleading is required there must be an <em>averment. </em>Failure to file a responsive pleading does not constitute an admission of an unvoiced charge; a. response or answer presupposes a charge or accusation made.. Absent an <em>averment </em>of any fact delineated by the rule as requiring a responsive pleading, a failure to respond: does not <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>amount to an admission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Did appellants <em>aver </em>that the appellee owned, possessed or controlled the “property or instrumentality” involved, to wit, the -window?</p>

However, appellants did not <em>expressly </em>aver either possession or control of the window by appellee. Appellants rely on implications from Paragraph 8 of the complaint to establish an averment of both possession and control of the window. Paragraph 8 alleges that appellants notified appellee through his named agent of the defective condition of the window, and that the appellee, through the said agent, promised and agreed to make the necessary repairs. From this, appellants argue: “Inherent in such allegation of agency is the fact that the agent was in control of the window, and, therefore, had the right to make such promise to repair or that the agent was assuming control by the fact of making such offers” and, in the absence of any denial by the appellee that his agent had the authority to be in control of the defective window, control and possession are thus admitted.

Appellants contend that a window contributes structurally to the support of the building and must be considered part of the wall. The contribution of support, if any, furnished by a window to a building is infinitesimally slight; that a windowless wall will and does support a building is self-evident. Appellants point out that in modern buildings, such as the Penn Center Plaza, glass is used extensively on the exterior portions of the structures. We can take judicial recognition of the fact that modern architecture does utilize and employ glass on .the walls and exterior portions of modern day buildings and, perhaps, such glass is so interwoven into the construction of these buildings as to justify a finding that the glass is part of, if not the whole, wall. However, that is definitely 'not the instant situation because there is no proof that this is a modern day building in which glass has been utilized as in the Penn Center Plaza. What we are dealing with in the instant situation is a regular old-fashioned window — a window placed in a building not <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>for aesthetic or support purposes, but simply and. solely for the function of transmitting light and air into a particular apartment. The glass which fell upon the wife-appellant’s hand came from a window and not from a modern glass wall or partition. The presence of this window in the building contributed nothing to, nor had it any functional use in connection with the other apartments or parts of the building; it was not <em>part </em>of, <em>but simply an opening in the wall </em>to serve and make livable this particular apartment.</p>

In that case the building was a multiple-tenancy building. Plaintiff’s employer leased from the defendant a workroom in which there was a skylight made of glass. The skylight fell and injured the plaintiff and the Superior Court sustained a recovery by the plaintiff. The theory upon which liability Avas imposed was clearly expressed by the late President Judge Kellbr (p. 23) : “It is established, therefore, that the defendant-landlord used this roof, of which the skylight Avas a part, to collect and carry away the rain water falling on the rest of her building — the four story part — and was in possession, custody and control of it for the general benefit of her building . . . She alone had authority to repair or improve it. It follows that she was responsible for any damages naturally resulting from her negligent maintenance of the roof and skylight.” The <em>Germansen </em>case is entirely inapposite. Granted that both a skylight and a window admit light and air, that both are made of glass, that the breaking of glass caused the injury in both cases, that the glass in both instances was cracked before and repaired after the accident, yet there is an essential difference between the two situations. The skylight was integrally part and parcel of the roof, as well as a medium for the entrance of light and air; it was <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>functionally a component part of the roof. The instant window was primarily a medium for the entry of light and air into this particular apartment; any function, if any, served in connection with the wall was purely incidental. It was the landlord’s duty to keep the skylight in repair; there was no duty upon the landlord to keep this window in repair: (Cf: <em>Rotte v. Meierjohan, </em><a href="/ohio-app/78/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="78 Ohio App. 387" data-case-ids="1384518" data-case-paths="/ohio-app/78/0387-01">78 Ohio App. 387</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20N.E.2d%20681" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="70 N.E.2d 681">70 NE 2d 681</a>). The roof of a multiple-tenancy building protects and acts as a common ceiling for all the separate tenements in the building; it is a part of the premises which remains in the landlord’s control for the common use of all his tenants: <em>Adler v. </em>Sklaroff, supra.</p>
    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.4",388,[235,1055,1145,429]]]'>Neither the <em>Koplo </em>case, supra, nor the <em>Adler </em>case, supra, supports appellants’ position. The <em>Koplo </em>case simply holds that a landlord exercises control over the exterior wall of a building while the <em>Adler </em>case holds a landlord responsible for maintenance of the roof of a building. The argument that because a skylight is a part of a roof a window must be considered part of a wall is a non sequitur.</p>

It does not serve as a common benefit to all occupants of the building, nor may anyone other than the tenant, in whose apartment it is located, use it. The lessees in the case at bar had complete control over the window. Only the lessees had the right or necessity to open, close or put shades on their window. The purpose of an apartment window is to give the tenant and only the particular tenant the benefit of light and ventilation. Actually, the owner of the building or any other occupant of the building could not have demanded that the plaintiffs keep the window open or closed. This window was for the sole use and convenience of the plaintiffs.</p>

The plaintiff in the cited case, Miss German-sen, was injured when glass from a skylight, hung over a room rented by her employer from the defendant-owner, fell and injured her. She sued the owner of the building, Mrs. Egan, and obtained a verdict which was affirmed by our Superior Court. In an excellently reasoned opinion, President Judge Keller, speaking for the Court, pointed out that the defendant Mrs. Egan knew that one of the panes in the skylight was cracked, she knew that snow could accumulate over the skylight, and she knew that the damaged glass would not be strong enough to bear the Aveight of the snoAV. He then Avent on specifically: “She [Mrs. Egan, the defendant] kneAV that the room under the light Avell, which she leased to the plaintiffs employer, Avas a work room occupied by people at work and liable to be injured by a broken skylight, and the duty rested on her as the OAvner in charge and custody of a building rented to various tenants to see that an instrumentality used for the general benefit of the building was in a reasonably safe condition, and when her attention Avas drawn to the cracked pane of glass in the skylight she should have been reasonably diligent in replacing it with a sound pane before the accident, as she. was immediately after it.

The Majority differentiates the <em>Germansen </em>case from the <em>Lopez </em>case by stating that a window supplies no functional support to the wall of a building but that a skylight is, in effect, muscle and sinew to a roof. But wherein is the structural difference between a skylight and á window? Viewed from above, below, or the side, a skylight is a window, and nothing móre. Webster’s In<a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>ternational Dictionary defines a skylight as “A window in a roof.” Thus, it can be correctly said that a skylight is a roof window, while a window is a wall skylight. Both the skylight and the window receive light from but one source, the sky, that is to say, the sun. If the skylight is an inseparable segment of the roof, as <em>Germcmsen </em>says, and this Court emphasizes, how can it be said that a window does not form part of a wall? A window is as much an integral part of a wall as the skylight is an integral part of the roof. They differ only in that a skylight is horizontal and a window is vertical.</p>
