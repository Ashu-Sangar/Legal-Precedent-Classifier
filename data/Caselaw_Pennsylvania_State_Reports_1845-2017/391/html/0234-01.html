The court then granted a rule to show cause why the appointment should not be made. The Borough of Shickshinny was given notice of the proceedings and filed an answer in the nature of a demurrer which set up, inter alia, that no legaí or factual reason was averred why a trustee should be appointed, that the court had no jurisdiction over this out-of-state trust, that the Shickshinny Bank was a mere depository of funds and expenditures from the funds were not by the bank as such, but b-y its directors and the Shickshinny Town Council and, lastly, if the bank were appointed trustee the borough also should be appointed trustee.

But because the public is the object of the settlors’ benefactions, private parties have insufficient financial interest in charitable trusts to oversee their enforcement.

The responsibility for public supervision traditionally has been delegated to the attorney general to be performed as an exercise of his <em>parens patriae </em>powers. See Commonwealth ex rel.

For, not only in actions involving the application of <em>cy pres </em>but in every proceeding which affects a charitable trust, whether the action concerns invalidation, administration, termination or enforcement, the attorney general must be made a party of record because the public as the real party in interest in the trust, is otherwise not properly represented.</p>

With that position we disagree. Under the will the bank is a mere depository of the income turned over to it from time to time by the trustee, without any power of investment or discretion in the expenditure of the money which it receives. The decedent did not say in his will that the income was to be “judicially expended” <em>by the bank; </em>rather, the expenditures are to be made <em>by the directors </em>of the bank and <em>by the members of the Town Council </em>of the borough. Decedent’s choice of words in this carefully prepared will clearly indicates that the power of expenditures was placed in those individuals who occupied the status of bank directors and in those individuals who occupied the status of borough councilmen. Any doubt as to such conclusion is resolved by that clause of the will which refers to a possibility of disagreement between the “directors” and “Town Council”, not the bank and the “Town Council”. Even if it be construed that the decedent contemplated that the bank act through its board of directors in connection with the expenditures, the bank has not been acting any more as a trustee de facto than has the Town Council of the borough. The decedent placed the power of determining the manner and mode of expending the trust income in both the directors and the Town Council, each group having an equal voice.</p>

It is self-evident that the directors and the Town Council and the bank are <em>all </em>accountable to the West Virginia trustee and such trustee has the right to come into our courts and require an accounting of these parties. Furthermore, even though the situs of the.trust be in West Virginia, the Attorney General, under his supervisory authority over the expenditures of this money for governmental purposes in Pennsylvania, could call upon all these parties to account for their expenditures.</p>
