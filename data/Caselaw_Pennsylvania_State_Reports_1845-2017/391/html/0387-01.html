      <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>On August 28,1953, Samuel Moyerman and Ms wife, the appellants, conveyed to Jules Glanzberg and his wife a vacant lot in Cheltenham Township, Montgomery County. This lot had a frontage of 80.38 feet, a depth •of 175 feet and a rear width of 58.89 feet. At the same time the appellants granted to the Glanzbergs an easement or right of way over a 25 foot wide driveway which ran the length of the westerly side of the lot. The title to the driveway was retained by the appellants. Apparently the Glanzbergs were acting as straw parties in this transaction and they conveyed title to the lot and rights to the easement to Theodore I. Goodman,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the appellee in both these appeals.</p>

From that misstatement of the dimensions of the lot arises the present controversy.</p>

Had the lot dimensions actually been as represented in appellee’s application for a building permit, the dwelling as located could not have been the subject of objection. However, the lot was actually 25 feet less in frontage and 21.85 feet less in rear width. As a result the completed dwelling — located in accordance with the incorrect dimensions — was built so close to the boundary —between the westerly side of the lot and the driveway — that for a distance of approximately 10 feet it encroached on the driveway to a depth of from 14 to 16 inches. In addition to this admitted encroachment, the location of the dwelling so close to the lot boundary violates §406 of the Cheltenham Township Zoning Ordi<a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>nance of 1929 which requires that dwellings built in “A” Residence Zoning Districts have two side yards, “one On each side of the main building, together having an aggregate width of not less than 30 feet but neither having a width of less than 10 feet”.</p>

After a hearing, at which appellants and their counsel appeared and strenuously objected, the Board granted the variance. At about the same time the appellants filed a complaint in equity seeking an injunction against the appellee’s continued encroachment upon the easement together with damages therefor. The appellants appealed from the decision of the Board of Adjustment and the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County heard both that appeal and the equity action at the same time.</p>

The chancellor thereupon concluded that “the granting of an injunction in this case would be inequitable, doing more harm than the wrong sought to be redressed”; accordingly, he dismissed the prayer for an injunction and certified the case to the law side of the Court for the assessment of damages resulting from the permanent trespass to the appellants’ land.</p>

Such an examination readily discloses adequate evidentiary support for the chancellor’s findings that appellants were not guilty of laches, that, even though appellants knew of the zoning ordinance violation, they took no action until the dwelling was practically completed and that the encroachment did not materially interfere with the use of the easement. The chancellor’s finding of an absence of laches is not inconsistent with the finding that appellants had notice of a zoning ordinance violation. The husband-appellant was present on several occasions while the dwelling was under construction and had sold several lots in the area. That he did not notice the encroachment is understandable; the amount of debris inevitably surrounding a dwelling in the course of construction could well have hidden an encroachment as slight as the one here involved. On the other hand, the juxtaposition of the location of the dwelling to the lot boundary would have rendered obvious a violation of the side yard requirement of the zoning ordinance. Moreover, the evidence is clear that the encroachment does not materially affect the use of the easement. The cartway of the 25 foot driveway is approximately 18 feet wide and on each side is a concrete gutter; the encroachment thereon of slightly more than 1 foot could not seriously affect the purpose for which the easement was intended, i.e. ingress and egress to a lot owned by the appellants which is located directly to the rear of the lot in question.</p>

At that time the lot was represented as having a frontage of 105.38 feet subject to a driveway of 18 feet. Appellants’ subsequent reduction of the width of the lot was neither approved by nor brought to the attention of the Township Commissioners. The 25-foot driveway reserved by the appellants when they sold the lot to the Glanzbergs consisted of the original 18-foot driveway with gutter plus a 7-foot strip of land taken from the original building lot.

When appellee applied for a building permit he examined the county plan which showed a frontage of 105.38 feet. Taking into consideration the facts that both plans examined by the appellee showed the frontage of the lot as 105.38 feet and that appellants had increased the width of the driveway from 18 feet to 25 feet — thus reducing the area of the lot which appellee could use for building — we have “confusion worse confounded”: under such circumstances we cannot say that there was no evidence to support the chancellor’s inference that the appellee incorrectly. assumed that his lot had a frontage of 105.38 feet and that it was appellants who had the easement in 25 feet of the frontage. In such a situation the chancellor did not err, on the basis of this inference, in finding that the encroachment was the result of an unintentional mistake rather than a wilful and intentional trespass. In the absence of a wilful and intentional encroachment; since the ihcoñvéñ<a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>ience suffered by appellants is slight in comparison to the extreme hardship which the granting of an injunction would impose upon appellee, the action of the court below in dismissing the injunction request should be affirmed.</p>

The husband-appellant testified that the remaining lot owned by the appellants, because of the appellee’s trespass and violation of the zoning ordinance, “ought to bring five thousand dollars less as a result of not having an opening of twenty-five plus ten, thirty-five feet on this side”. Appellants argue that if they are to be limited to damages, they should be awarded $5,000 because there is no evidence in the record to rebut this testimony. We find no merit in this contention. The appellants have the burden of proving the damages they have suffered and the uncertain and equivocal testimony quoted above is insufficient to satisfy this burden; any finding based thereon or inference drawn therefrom would have been mere conjécture upon the part of the chancellor and would have constituted error.

In summarizing its findings, the Board stated: “Since the [appellee’s] property is located along a 25-foot driveway this driveway can never be obstructed by buildings of any kind but must always remain open and clear. There, in fact, exists between his existing house and the westerly edge of the driveway which separates the driveway from the adjoining property owner more than 23 feet of open ground. The purpose of the Zoning Ordinance in providing side yards is to protect the property owners from a hazard of fire and to provide light and air. This protection exists as far as the [appellee’s] property is concerned because there is 38 feet separating [appellee’s] dwelling and the dwelling located upon the property abutting on the west. Compelling the <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>[appellee] to locate Ms building a further 8 feet to the east would afford no more protection to the public and would have no relation to the general welfare and safety of the community.

It nevertheless remains true that the Board of Adjustment, the agency which both saw and heard the witnesses and in the best position to pass upon their credibility, fully accepted the appellee’s explanation that he believed, when he applied for his building permit and when he built his building, that he held title to the 25 foot wide driveway and that he consequently was complying with the side yard requirement of the zoning ordinance. We see no need to re-examine the testimony at length. The record contains sufficient evidence to support the findings of the Board of Adjustment regarding the appellee’s mistake as to the boundaries of his property. It necessarily follows that the Board of Adjustment committed no clear error of law or abuse of discretion which would compel us to reverse the decree of the court below affirming its grant of a variance.</p>
