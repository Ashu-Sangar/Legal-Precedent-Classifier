Finnerty and a truck owned by the defendant Carmelétta V. Darby, doing business as Darby Transfer and Storage, and driven by the latter’s employe, Harry Lloyd Cooke, plaintiff brought this action in trespass to recover for personal injuries sustained and damage done to his car. The defendant filed a counterclaim for .dámage <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>done to the truck. At the end of a lengthy trial the jury tendered a verdict which read: “Both parties were guilty of contributory negligence”. With the approval of the jury and acquiescence by counsel, the court molded the verdict so as to be read and entered: “And now, to wit: January 24, 1957, we, the Jurors empanelled in the above entitled case, find Both parties were guilty of contributory negligence and find a verdict against the Plaintiff and in favor of the defendant and with respect to the counterclaim a verdict in favor of the Plaintiff and against the defendant.” Plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial which, after argument before the court en banc, was refused and judgment duly entered on the verdict. This appeal by plaintiff followed. Defendant does not appeal.</p>

A review of the testimony is desirable for a proper consideration of these contentions, none of which we find to be well founded. The accident happened on February 11, 1953 on Route 22 known as the William Penn Highway, in Indiana County, a few miles east of Armagh near the home of one Harry Rummel. Route 22 which runs east and west was at the time a two-lane blacktop highway, the paved portion being about 22 feet in width. The accident happened on a straight, almost level stretch of the highway about 2,000 feet long, referred to in the testimony as a plateau. According to the plaintiff, the accident happened about 6 P. M. Cooke, the defendant’s driver, placed the time as 5:30 P. M. Throughout the afternoon and at the time of the accident there was a precipitation, variously described by the witnesses as rain, rain and snow, drizzle and sleet, accompanied by a high wind. As a <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>result the highway was wet and slippery. Harry Rummel who arrived at the scene of the accident very shortly thereafter, called by plaintiff as a witness, said: “The road was terribly slippery. You just couldn’t stand up on it. . . .” Albert M. Luther who operated the tow truck that removed the vehicles after the accident, called by plaintiff as a witness, said: “It was kind of raining sleet”. “It was icy out where the wreck was . . . awfully slippery”. John Y. Lyons, Jr., a witness called by the defense, who had been operating a car westwardly on the highway and had become involved in an accident at the same point very shortly after the collision between plaintiff’s and defendant’s vehicles, said: “. . . I had to stop about every mile to clean my windshield off of snow, sleet or whatever it was. It was freezing on my windshield.”, that the road was “icy”, the road conditions “were the worst I have ever driven in”. Harold R. Kuczynski, a passenger in Lyons’ car, said the rain was freezing on the road; “. . . it was icy in spots and probably very deceptive because the road was wet. You couldn’t discern just where it was icy and where it was wet”. Arthur Minarcin, a State Policeman who got word of the accident by radio and proceeded immediately to the scene, driving through Homer City to Armagh and thence about four miles eastwardly on Route 22 to the place where the accident happened, said that it was raining and when the rain hit the road it froze; that “The highway itself was a sheet of ice.”</p>

Lang, a passenger in the plaintiff’s car. The latter was a Government expediter and inspector and had been associated with the plaintiff from two to four months in connection with a Government contract in which the plaintiff was interested. <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>Earlier in the day the two of them went from Altoona to Wilkinsburg in connection with work being done on this Government contract by a sub-contractor.

When asked by his attorney as to the general condition of the highway as he drove eastwardly on Route 22 from Wilkinsburg, he testified: “The road was wet. It wasn’t icy. Some place along through there, well, not icy, it was like scum like you get on to grease, just enough to give you a movement of your automobile other than normal, other than the normal rolling or forward — it wasn’t icy.”; that before reaching the 2,000 foot straightaway or plateau above mentioned there was a dip, then a rise in the road and when he got to the top of the rise and was entering on the plateau he saw the lights of an approaching car in the distance; that he was then about 300 or 400 feet from the Rummel house, travelling in the eastbound lane; that he was in high gear but his speed was not greater than 25 miles an hour; that when he reached the Rummel house his car went into a spin counterclockwise, the rear swinging around so that after proceeding two or three car lengths the car crossed the westbound lane and continued on to the berm on the north side of the road and was facing west, the direction from which he had come. He claimed that his engine had gone dead during the spin, that his car came to a stop and that he was attempting to start it; that he pushed the starter button located on the dash and disengaged the clutch (which he said took him 15 seconds to accomplish) when there was a “terrific impact or whack to the car”. From his testimony his car at the time of impact was from 150 to <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>200 feet beyond (east of) the Rummel house, in front of which he had started to skid.</p>

M., and was returning to Pittsburgh, driving westward on the westbound lane of Route 22.. He was familiar with the road and had driven trucks over it for the same employer for 19 years. He testified that it was drizzling and turning to ice and the road was “all icy”; that after he came up a slight rise in the road and was travelling across the plateau or level stretch above referred to, he saw the plaintiff’s car about a half mile away; that it dipped out of his view and then he saw it again when it came up the rise onto the west end of the level straightaway; that when plaintiff’s car was some 20 to 25 yards away it swung crosswise on the road in a counterclockwise direction directly in the path of the truck; that he, Cooke, to avoid the plaintiff’s car, immediately drove his truck onto the right or north berm which was about 10 feet wide at that point; that plaintiff’s ear continued to swing around, went out onto the north berm and while travelling backwards,- collided into the front of the truck with its rear end; that when plaintiff’s car was leaving the icy road and coming onto the berm, Cooke applied his brakes and slid half a truck length (the truck was from 20 to 25 feet in length) to the point of impact. Before plaintiff’s car began to skid Cooke had his truck in the next lower gear to high and was travelling at 20 miles per hour while plaintiff’s car was going 50 to 60 miles per hour; that when the two vehicles collided plaintiff’s car was moving backward toward his truck. Plaintiff’s counsel made no objection to Cooke’s testimony regarding the speed of plaintiff’scar and, as said by the court below, “There could hardly have been one made since the witness was an ex<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>perienced driver and apparently had ample opportunity to observe the plaintiff’s car before it began to skid.”</p>

The testimony was conflicting as to whether the accident occurred while it was still daylight or dark. The plaintiff testified that he had to turn his headlights on when he left a gas station where he had his gas tank filled just west of Armagh and that it was no longer daylight when he got to Armagh, four miles west of the scene of the accident. Plaintiff’s passenger Lang in his deposition hereinafter more fully referred to, said that when the accident happened “. . . it was about dusk”, and he did not know whether plaintiff had his headlights on. Cooke testified that it was still daylight, that he did not have his lights on nor did the plaintiff. Mervin Ling, one of a State Highway crew which subsequently engaged in ashing the highway, testified that he saw a car which the jury was justified in finding to be plaintiff’s proceeding eastwardly at a speed of 50 miles an hour at a point about a quarter or half mile west of the point of accident; that he walked to his home about an eighth of a. mile north of the highway where he was picked up by the driver of the ashing truck and driven back to the highway; and that it was his belief that it was then “just getting dark”. Plaintiff testified that the distance from Wilkinsburg to Altoona was 90 miles and that from Wilkinsburg to the scene of the accident “not over 60 miles”. He said the stop at the gas station for gasoline took 5 minutes. Since the jury could find that the accident occurred at 5 :30 P. M. as Cooke testi<a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>fied, it appears that it took Cooke, who left Altoona at 3 P. M., two and one-half hours to travel 30 miles, while plaintiff, who left Yfilkinsburg at 4:15 P. M., covered the 60 miles to the scene of the accident in an hour and 10 minutes (deducting 5 minutes for the stop at the gas station). Route 22 was not a turnpike or limited-access highway.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[273,722,1146,654]]]'>The testimony of plaintiff’s passenger Lang contradicted the plaintiff’s statement that his car came to a stop before the collision. Both men Avere knocked unconscious by the impact. Lang testified that “When I lost consciousness the [plaintiff’s] car was still moving.” This was in accord with Cooke’s account of the collision. Lang’s testimony also established that plaintiff was driving substantially in excess of 25 miles per hour. On the morning following the accident plaintiff informed Minarcin, the State Policeman who investigated the matter, that he was travelling 40 miles per hour when his car began skidding.</p>
    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[267,1388,1150,936]],["BL_329.1",329,[223,340,1143,99]]]'>The court carefully and properly instructed the jury that skidding of itself did not establish negligence but that negligence could cause skidding and the resulting consequences; that the question for the jury to determine was whether the plaintiff was travelling at a reasonable or an excessive rate of speed under the weather and road conditions prevailing. Plaintiff’s counsel makes no complaint of the charge in this regard. Although one of the reasons assigned in plaintiff’s motion for a new trial was that the verdict of the jury as it affected the plaintiff was against the weight of the evidence, such reason is not pressed. And advisedly so, for the evidence fully justified a finding by the jury that under the extremely slippery condition of the highway plaintiff was driving at an excessive, if not indeed a reckless rate of speed. Plaintiff’s contention is that the court erred iñ admitting the testi<a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>mony of the witnesses Lang, Ling and Minarcin as to plaintiff’s speed.</p>
    <p id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[223,451,1148,1442]]]'>Before discussing the testimony of these three witnesses, we note that the statement in appellant’s brief that the jury must have relied upon the testimony of one or more of these three witnesses as to the speed at which plaintiff was travelling, is not well founded. The assertion is premised upon the fact that the jury found the defendant negligent and therefore rejected Cooke’s version of the accident that placed the plaintiff’s speed from 50 to 60 miles per hour. The jury did not have to accept the defendant’s version of the accident in its entirety. “It is perfectly reasonable for the jury to believe so much of the testimony offered by a litigant as pertains to what the opposing party did, and disbelieve that part of the testimony as tends to absolve the litigant of liability.”: <em>Antonelli v. Tumolo, </em><a href="/pa/390/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="390 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1275654" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0068-01">390 Pa. 68</a>, 73, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20A.2d%20285" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="132 A.2d 285">132 A. 2d 285</a>. Moreover, under the weather and road conditions prevailing, the jury could have found that even driving at 20 miles per hour, the speed at which Cooke testified he was travelling, was negligent. Indeed they could have found that continuing to drive on the treacherous and highly dangerous road surface that existed until it was ashed or conditions bettered, was foolhardy. Neither vehicle had chains on its wheels. Both plaintiff and the defendant’s driver had accomplished their missions and there was no compelling reason for haste on their return journeys.</p>

Lang’s testimony consisted of excerpts from his deposition<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> taken in Washington, D. C. at the instance of and offered in evidence by the defendant. A reading of Lang’s entire <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>testimony shows as the court below stated that he was a reluctant, if not a hostile witness. Appellant in his brief quotes portions of his testimony where, questioned as to the speed at which plaintiff’s car was travelling, he answered, “I don’t know”. His entire testimony makes plainly apparent that he either did not want to testify to a rate of speed that would adversely affect the plaintiff or that he was under the misconception that he must be able to testify positively to the exact speed of the car, that is, the exact number of miles per hour. Appellant also quotes the following from Lang’s testimony: “Q. What is your best estimate then, sir, of the speed of this car for a mile or so prior to the accident? A. (Pause.) Strictly as a guess I would say between 40 and 50 miles an hour.” From this appellant argues that the witness’ entire testimony was nothing but guesswork or mere conjecture. In the first place, the word “guess” does not necessarily mean mere conjecture, but may connote judgment. If a person is asked to estimate the number of people in a crowd, he may say “I guess” a certain number, or he may say “I judge” a certain number. By either term he is expressing an opinion based on observation. In the instant case the witness repeatedly made clear that he could not give the exact speed of the car, and was giving his best opinion of its approximate speed: We quote from the opinion of the court in <em>Commonwealth v. Forrey, </em><a href="/pa-super/172/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="172 Pa. Super. 65" data-case-ids="477206" data-case-paths="/pa-super/172/0065-01">172 Pa.

The defendant then proposed to introduce a portion of the deposition in defendant’s case together with the portion desired by the plaintiff. At conference with the judge in chambers the court ruled on specific objections by plaintiff’s counsel to the inclusion or exclusion of certain testimony contained in the portions of the deposition which counsel agreed should be introduced into evidence in accordance with such rulings, and the same were then read to the jury. At no time did plaintiff object to any part of the deposition on the ground that Lang was not qualified to express an. opinion on the speed of an automobile. Indeed he was not in a position to do so because when the deposition was taken, defendant’s counsel at the outset qualified the deponent as follows: “Q. Let me <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>withdraw that question and ask you this, sir. Do you drive a ear yourself? A. Yes, sir. Q. For how long have you driven a ear? A. Oh, my goodness! 24 years. Q. During those 24 years, sir, have you had an opportunity to estimate the speed of a car? A. Oh, sure. Q. Either the one you are traveling in or one that you see along the street? A. Sure.” Under the circumstances it is anything but commendable for appellant’s counsel to advance this contention in our Court.</p>

He said the automobile was either a 1950 or 1951 model, that there were two men in it and it was travelling not less than 50 miles per hour. It was not disputed that plaintiff owned and was driving a blue 1951 Mercury car when the collision occurred. Ling had driven a car from 20 to 25 years and had an opportunity to watch the car drive by and judge its speed as he stood along the side of the road. As above related, he continued to his home where he was picked up by the cinder or ash truck which returned to the highway and proceeded eastwardly, ashing the road to a point some distance beyond the scene of the accident; that when the truck passed the scene of the accident he saw the vehicles that had collided, standing off the road on the north berm, the truck at the rear of the car and both facing west. Apparently because he did not actually see the collision he would not say that the car was the same one that had earlier passed him, but said it looked to him like a blue Mercury. On <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>cross-examination counsel for the plaintiff asked him: “Did I understand you to say you thought there was a blue Mercury there but you weren’t sure?”, and he answered: “No, it looked to me like a blue Mercury.” Appellant suggests that a blue Mercury car is a common type of car and that the car which the witness saw passing him was not sufficiently proven to be plaintiff’s car. There was no evidence of any car other than the plaintiff’s proceeding eastwardly or westwardly in the vicinity prior to the approach of the car of the witness Lyons from the east, which was involved in an accident at the same point after the collision between the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s vehicles. Cooke saw only the plaintiff’s car approaching from the west. The plaintiff testified to no other vehicles passing him in either direction and Lang testified that he saw no cars ahead or in back of the plaintiff’s Car.</p>

No exact limitation of distance or time can be fixed. Where the accident occurs in a city, for instance, with intersecting streets and traffic, evidence of a speed at a comparatively short distance before the accident may be too remote, whereas in rural areas evidence of speed at a greater distance may be relevant. In the instant case plaintiff was traveling in a rural area. There is no evidence of any intersecting roads, any traffic or curves which would have caused plaintiff to lower his speed during the half mile in question. Appellant states that no case can be found that would permit evidence of speed by a witness at a point so far distant as a half mile. On the other hand, appellant cites no cases nor does our search reveal any where this Court has placed any limitation upon the distance involved or period of time that has elapsed. If the only evi<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>dence of plaintiff’s speed was that of the witness Ling that the plaintiff’s car when it passed him was travel-ling 50 miles an hour, appellant’s objection to the admissibility of such evidence might be considered well taken. But here not only was there the evidence of the defendant’s driver Cooke that plaintiff was travelling 50 miles an hour immediately before the accident occurred, but evidence from which the jury could conclude that plaintiff maintained the same rate of speed from the point where the witness Ling saw him, to the scene of the accident. Plaintiff who testified he was going not over 25 miles an hour as he entered the level straightaway which he put at 500 or 550 feet from the point of collision, did not testify to any change of speed during the half mile in question, and plaintiff’s companion Lang who was seated in the car beside the plaintiff not only testified that immediately before the accident plaintiff’s car was going between 35 and 55 miles per hour, but at another point in his testimony, when asked for the best estimate of the speed of the car <em>“for a mile or so </em>prior to the accident”, said between 40 and 50 miles per hour.</p>

It is contended that as the result of the serious injuries plaintiff received, his condition was such as to render inadmissible the officer’s testimony in this regard. In his brief counsel for appellant attacks the credibility of the officer because the latter at first mistakenly testified that he interviewed the plaintiff at the hospital during the evening of the accident. Later • Minarcin who was at the hospital both on the night of the accident and the next morning, testified that the interview took place on the latter occasion, as was testified to by Mrs. Burkhardt, a nurse and clinical instructor at the hospital. Minarcin recalled that he was not allowed to talk to the plaintiff on the evening of the accident, but got such permission the next morning. It is not disputed that Minarcin was at the hospital and did obtain a statement from plaintiff, which was reduced, to writing and signed by Mrs. Burkhardt, the nurse then in attendance, as a witness. This statement which was read to the jury by Minarcin and later introduced into evidence, was as follows: “I was traveling east on Route 22 going about 40 miles <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>an hour. I came down this grade and went into a skid on the opposite side of the highway and faced the other direction as there was a truck coming in the westbound lane and he collided in the rear of me.” Minarcin testified that the statement followed his questioning of plaintiff as to what had occurred; that he then wrote it down, requested Mrs. Burkhardt, the nurse, to sign the statement after it had been read back to and approved by the plaintiff in the presence of both Mrs. Burkhardt and the officer. Mrs. Burkhardt fully corroborated the officer in this regard.</p>

He was so severely injured that his life was dispaired of and a rosary having been found upon his person, the last rites were administered to him while unconscious. His tongue was sutured to his cheek to facilitate breathing. As stated by the court below, his recovery was almost miraculous and no doubt due to the medical care he received and a very strong constitution. Both the hospital records and the testimony of Mrs. Burkhardt were to the effect that for a number of days following he was mostly in an unconscious or semi-conscious state. He was, however, at times conscious and comprehended what was said to him and observed his surroundings. This was true, the nurse testified, when Minarcin "obtained the statement at approximately 8 o’clock on the following morning. She testified that she did not recall' whether plaintiff talked to her that morning, but said he showed “recognition of anything asked of him”; that she remembered his complaining of a pain in his chest which she reported to the doctor. She testified that anchoring the tongue to the cheek was often done to prevent suffocation. She also said that “When a tongue is secured to the cheek it is not usually secured <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>in such a way that the patient is unable to swallow, and your tongue is used in swallowing and if he can swallow he can have some motion of the tongue.” When asked on cross-examination whether the plaintiff talked clearly that morning, her answer was “No, but he could have given enough of an answer or indicated an answer to any questions that were put to him.”, and that when the officer was in plaintiff’s room “Mr. Finnerty appeared to be conscious”.</p>

Drank 240 cc’s of tea at lunch.” As Mrs. Burkhardt explained, “240 cc’s is one glass, eight ounces.” It does not definitely appear whether the plaintiff was prone or in a sitting position when the officer interviewed him. Mrs. Burkhardt who was familiar with the hospital record which stated that plaintiff “had blood in his chest and lung”, testified that for that reason the doctor “wanted him in an upright position rather than a flat position which is common for any head injury: ordinarily we keep them flat in bed.” Minarcin testified that he did not know the extent of plaintiff’s injuries nor that he had his tongue anchored to his cheek; that plaintiff had heavy breathing of which he complained, but that he, Minarcin, did not have trouble in understanding plaintiff’s words when he uttered them. Mrs. Burkhardt testified that she heard Minarcin read the statement to the plaintiff who apparently comprehended what was being said to him and after it was read, indicated his approval by nodding in the affirmative, and that at the request of the officer she signed her name to the statement.</p>

This memorandum was not signed or written by the defendant, nor is such necessary.

He had “a partial left hemaplegia, partially paralyzed with loss of his speech, taste, his vision and his auditory function, that is his senses, that is the hearing.” After enumerating these items, which I have considerably abbreviated, Dr. H. T. Kahl, the attending physician, testifying at the trial, said: “the patient was unconscious for five days, six days.”</p>

A State policeman by the name of Arthur Minarcin entered the hospital room of this wrecked human being and proceeded to interrogate him. He then wrote up a statement, presumed to have been drawn from the bleeding ruin before him. The paper read as follows: “I was travelling east on Route 22 going about 40 miles an hour.

      <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>Let us see what this case is about. On the afternoon of February 11, 1953, James W. Finnerty was driving his Mercury automobile in an eastward direction from Wilkinsburg to Altoona over Route <em>22, </em>also known as the William Penn Highway. When he arrived at a point about three miles east of Armagh in Indiana County, and in the vicinity of a house owned by a Harry Rummel, his car, because of the slipperiness of the road, due to rain and possibly some sleet, went into a skid, which took him across the highway, so that when his car stopped he had made a half turn and was now facing westwardly on the north berm of the road, five to six feet off the paved portion. He remained in this presumably safe position for about 15 seconds, endeavoring to get his car started again, when a truck belonging to the defendant, Darby Transfer and Storage, and being operated by Harry Lloyd Cooke,crashed into the rear of his car, demolishing it and visiting on him the mangling injuries already described. Finnerty sued Darby Transfer and Storage for his personal injuries, and the Darby Transfer firm sued him for the truck damages. The jury returned a verdict finding both drivers guilty of contributory negligence and thus not entitled to recover. Finnerty appealed, alleging various serious trial errors.</p>
    <p id="b346-4" data-blocks='[["BL_346.4",346,[251,1735,1145,599]],["BL_347.1",347,[204,353,1145,546]]]'>In court, Finnerty, who by a miracle did not die, testified that from the time he left Armagh he did not travel at. a. speed . greater than . 25 miles ■ per hour. Cooke, the truck driver, testified that just before Finnerty’s car began to skid, it was travelling at 55 to 60 miles per hour, while he, on the other hand, was moving only at 20 miles per hour. The jury found Cooke negligent which meant, therefore, that they. did not believe his account of the accident. Thus, had it not been for the fact that the jury also found Finnerty negligent, Finnerty could well have obtained a verdict <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>against the owners of the truck. The whole issue in the case, therefore, narrowed down to the query as to whether or not Finnerty drove his car at an excessive rate of speed under the circumstances, since <em>that </em>was the only charge of negligence against him. In this state of affairs, the Trial Judge should have* been extremely circumspect to keep the testimony within the accepted rules of trial evidence and within constitutional-limitations. Whether he did so; will be seen as the discussion develops.</p>

He proceéded to the ; point of the collision and there made an investigation. -He questioned Cooke, the driver of the defendant’s truck, and others on the scene. Finnerty had already been taken to the hospital. Minarcin then drove to the Lee Hospital in Johnstown where, he said, he obtained permission of the nurse to question Finnerty, that he put questions to Finnerty and that Finnerty orally gave him a statement, which he reduced to writing, and which he then reád back to him. lie said further that the nurse on duty, Colleen Harshberger (later Mrs. Burkhardt) witnessed the “statement.”' ■</p>

And by what possible line of physical logic can it be argued that Finnerty actually spoke the words Minarcin attributed to him?

But I must say that, if such an explanation had been presented, Minarcin would have experienced some difficulty in explaining to me what kind of a nod Finnerty made in saying that he was travelling east on Route <em>22; </em>what form of head signal he employed in relating that he was moving at 40 miles an hour; what specialty of head movement he utilized in telling Minarcin he came down a grade and went into a skid on the opposite side of the road; what manner of head gyration informed Minarcin that Finnerty faced the other direction; and with what kind of a facial grimace he went on to explain that a truck came along westbound in the westbound lane and collided with Finnerty, etc., etc. It must be kept in mind that these nods were supposed to have been made by a man with extensive brain dámage, wh'én the slightest movement <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>of the head would have created excruciating pain and dizziness; also when he was unconscious or only semi- . conscious.</p>

Finnerty is- entitled to a new trial because of another serious error made by the Trial Judge. The defendant, Darby Transfer and Storage, called to testify in its behalf a man named Mervin Ling. Ling took the stand and related how on the afternoon of the accident, while he was one-half mile away from the locale which later became the scene of the accident, he saw <em>a </em>blue Mercury automobile, with two people in it, travelling in an eastwardly direction on Route 22. After the Mercury car passed by, he walked to his home an eighth of a mile away, ate his supper, and then, being employed by the Highway Department, he went out on a cindering truck. Arriving at what has been referred to as the Rummel hoiise (in whose immediate vicinity the defendant’s truck and the plaintiff’s car had collided), he saw, he said, a blue Mercury car. With only this kind of a setting for his testimony, he was then permitted to testify that when the blue Mercury car passed him on the highway, one-half mile from the Rummel house, it was travelling at the rate of 50 miles an hour. He did not say that the car which was locked in a death grapple with the defendant’s truck was actually the car he had seen on the highway, he did not say that he identified the driver of the blue Mercury on the highway as James W. Finnerty. Yet he was allowed to convey to the jury the inference that it was Finnerty’s car he saw on the highway, that it was Finnerty who was driving that car, and that Finnerty continued to drive at 50 miles an hour on a. slippery road over a course of one-half mile leading directly to the Rummel house and disaster.</p>

Ling testified as follows: “Q. You are not able to tell this jury that the car you saw in this accident when the cindering truck went by was the very same car that had passed you about a half hour before, are you? A. <em>Wo, I couldn’t. </em>I didn’t see the accident happen.”</p>

What did you tell him? A. I told him it wasn’t, <em>I didn’t know. </em>Q. You told him it wasn’t you didn’t know? A. <em>I told him I didn’t know, there are other Mercurys the same color.”</em>

Are you able now to state to the jury what the color of the car was that was in front of the truck when you were ashing up there later? A. No, I couldn’t, <em>I am just guessing now. </em>I think it was blue.” This is indeed speculation carried into such a sea of nebulous incertitude as to amount to evidentiary phantasy. And yet, the Majority is convinced that the blue car which Ling saw on the highway had to be the plaintiff’s Mercury. Why is it so sure? Because it says that: “There was no evidence of any car other than the plaintiff’s proceeding eastwardly or westwardly in the vicinity prior to the approach of the car of the witness Lyons from the east.”</p>

If someone says that he saw a car which “looked like John’s car” on the highway, that statement will prove it was John’s car unless John can prove that there were other cars on the highway which looked like his and one of which could possibly have been mistaken for his car. This is an anomalous doctrine indeed. TJp until today identification always depended on the reliability of the identifier. Now, however, according to the Majority, the burden of proof passes to the accused. Thus, if one is accused of murder with expressions such as “he looked like the murderer”, or “it might be”, ór “I guess so”, he will be compelled to produce exculpatory evidence, or he is doomed.</p>

Suppose Finnerty <em>was </em>driving a car at fifty miles an hour, <em>one-half mile </em>from the point where the accident occurred? What does that prove? Could he not have reduced his speed within that half-mile? The Majority apparently thinks not, for it says: “There is no evidence of any intersecting roads, any traffic or curves which would have caused plaintiff to lower his speed during the half mile in question.”</p>

This is true, but another witness testified to the speed of the bus when it was only 200 feet from the point of the collision. In <em>Commonwealth v.

In the case at bar Ling was 2,640 feet from the accident and knew nothing about it until he appeared, in another connection, at the scene of the collision, a half-hour later. He only saw <em>a </em>Mercury car for an instant and then did not see it further.</p>

This Court, speaking through Justice Drew, said: “The admission of this incompetent and irrelevant testimony was error. The witnesses testified to what they did not see and what they did not know. The testimony was offered to measure the speed of the automobile that passed and identify it as the car involved in the accident, and it was insinuated that the rate of speed continued to the point of the collision.

In one part of his deposition Lang testified as follows: “Q. What is your best estimate then, sir, of the speed of this car for a mile or so prior to the accident? A.

But this Court does not brand the testimony as worthless. It is not in the slightest disturbed over so reckless and hazardous an aiming at the supposed target of truth.

Guesses as to size of crowds are notoriously fickle and untrustworthy. When the evangelist, Billy Graham, spoke on Broadway in New York City, September 1, 1957, the police estimated the crowd which heard him to number 75,000.
