However, it is undisputed that the plaintiffs were first to erect a dwelling upon the parcel and that development of the remaining lot commenced more than a year later. The plaintiffs therefore have not themselves violated the covenant and accordingly have not surrendered their right to be heard in equity. However, plaintiffs stood by and allowed the Goodwins to build their home in violation of the deed restriction, explaining that they did not realize they had the right to enforce the restrictive covenant.</blockquote>

The benefit of enforcement in this instance would be slight in comparison to the great disadvantage that would enure to the defendants, and prevent the residential use of this lot.</blockquote>
