By this change in the language of the ordinance and the significant omission of the Avord “oAvner” in the code, the legislative intent is clear that an applicant need not be the owner of the premises.

In the first place, the inconvenience to Mr. Saitto in having to take a room at a hotel once or twice a week would be slight.' In the- second place, when the appellee signed this lease he was put on notice of the risk that he might not Se<a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>cure a zoning permit and, when he spent money in renovation of the premises, he knew or should have known that he might not secure a permit for the proposed use; he entered upon this lease knowing or having reason to know that, if he did not obtain a zoning •permit, he was bound to pay the balance of rent for the term and would lose any money expended in renovation of the premises. In the third place, the court did not find the existence of, but only that there <em>“might” </em>be “unnecessary hardship” to the owner. The <em>possibility or probability of undue hardship </em>is not a sufficient ground for the grant of a variance. The court below evidently was under the impression that the owner was a party in interest (even though he had not intervened or taken any steps to join with the appellee, his tenant, in these proceedings) who <em>might </em>be harmed. The harm which the court <em>“inferred that the Board thought would cause unnecessary hardship” </em>was that the long established use of the premises as a professional office would be prohibited and the owner required to make the premises into a dwelling. Such a finding was clearly and unequivocally erroneous: (1) it found “unnecessary hardship” to one not a party to the proceedings; (2) it arrived at an inference of •what the Board “thought” on evidence which never was presented to thé board, i.e. the requirement that the owner would have to make the premises into a .dwelling instead of a doctor’s office as it had been used, up until appellee’s tenancy, and the cost thereof.</p>

In granting a variance, in addition to a finding that the proposed use was less obnoxious than the former use of the premises as a garage and that it would in no way affect the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, the Board also found that the property could not easily be converted into a residence. In reversing the court which had, in turn, reversed the Board’s grant of a variance, this Court found that an unnecessary hardship existed in the “required conversion of the premises in question from a nonconforming to a conforming use at very substantial cost, claimed by the appellants to be financially impracticable”. That case is clearly inapposite to the instant situation where appellees have failed to prove any unnecessary hardship to the owner whatsoever and nothing except a mere hardship, at best, to the tenant, and where there is no evidence that this property will have to be reconstructed to become a conforming use.
