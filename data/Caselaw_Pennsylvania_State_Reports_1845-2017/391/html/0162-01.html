Plaintiff brought an action in trespass for injuries sustained by him resulting from a collision with defendant’s automobile. Plaintiff’s testimony as to how the accident happened was both confusing and contradictory. He first testified that he was struck while on the corner by the curbstone. He testified that he first saw the ear when it was pretty close, about three feet away, and that he had taken two or three paces from the curbstone onto <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>the street when the car hit him. Several times in answer to leading pertinent questions as to how the accident happened he said he did not know, he did not remember. The defendant and his eye witness testified that the front of the car was just about in front of the plaintiff when he stepped out onto the street and walked into the front fender of the car. Defendant’s testimony was corroborated by a police officer who testified that he made an examination less than an hour after the accident, and failed to find any evidence of tire tracks in the dirt path adjoining the highway beyond the curb where plaintiff said he was standing, or any evidence that defendant’s car had goné over the curb.</p>

The only reason containing any substance which plaintiff alleges for a new trial is that counsel for defendant asked an unfair misleading question on cross-examination: “How far away from you was the car when you stepped out in the street?” The trial Judge in his opinion dismissing the motion for a new trial said, inter alia: “After a careful and complete examination of the entire record, we feel that, under all of the ■circumstances hereinbefore referred to, the question put to the plaintiff, an interested party, was not improper. Such a witness is always subject to questions <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>testing his memory or credibility.

He had said he was ‘on the corner by the curb stone’ and also ‘on the curb stone.’ He had also said he was struck on the right side, testimony virtually irreconcilable with the rest of his story.</p>

He had other incapacities, not associated with the accident, which added to his troubles in court. He was half deaf from the assault of the passing years and, then, what he did hear, he did not always understand. As an immigrant who had toiled all his life in the manual and lowly occupations, he had never acquired the schooling which would equip him to cope with the wit and learning of the lawyers with their higher education. And therein lies the melancholy mischief of this case.</p>
    <p id="b186-4" data-blocks='[["BL_186.4",186,[247,1124,1145,543]]]'>Like the stone-deaf Quasimodo who was tried before a judge who not only could not hear but who, during the proceedings, often closed his eyes to shut out the distraction of the courtroom, Párente went through a trial never able to acquaint his triers with the facts which, had they been known, would well have brought him a verdict for the injuries and the pain inflicted on him by the automobile which struck him down as he stood on or by a curb on Exeter Avenue in West Pittston on April 15, 1955.</p>
    <p id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[245,1681,1146,647]]]'>The issue at the trial developed into a factual contest as to whether Párente was standing on the curb when the defendants’ automobile collided with him, meaning, of course, that the car climbed the curb, or whether Párente stepped into the street as the car was passing. When Párente was asked where he was standing at the time of the impact with the car he replied through an interpreter: “I was here. (Pointing to position in photograph). On the corner by the curb stone.” The Court then asked him: “What caused you to fall down?” And Párente replied: “The car struck me and knocked me down.”</p>
    <p id="b187-3" data-blocks='[["BL_187.3",187,[186,354,1148,994]]]'>
      <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>At no time in tlie direct examination did Párente indicate that he was anywhere except on the curb when he was struck by the automobile. In cross-examination defendants’ lawyer asked: “How far away from you was the car when you stepped out in the street?” Parente’s lawyer objected, and properly so. Párente had never said that he stepped out in the street. Defendants’ counsel’s question was obviously a trick question. The Trial Court overruled the objection and defendants’ lawyer repeated the question as follows: “How far away was the car when you stepped out into the street?” Parente’s counsel again objected, pointing out that this was a “double question.” And it <em>was </em>a double question because it asked: “How far away was the car” and “Had you stepped out into the street?” The Court overruled the objection and required the plaintiff to answer. Párente replied: “Two or three paces.”</p>
    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[182,1361,1148,983]]]'>Defendants’ counsel had succeeded in putting across the famous “Have you stopped beating your wife?” question. He had dug a pit for the octogenarian and prepared to shove him into it. The Trial Judge now saw the pit and endeavored to prevent the plaintiff’s falling into it. But in his solicitude to avert that fall, he pushed the plaintiff in himself. The Trial Judge turned to the interpreter and said: “Now in fairness to this witness, I wish you would slowly and clearly put this question to him and make this statement that at first he said, in answer to a question on direct examination, that he was on the curb stone when he was struck by the car and then later on cross-examination he said he had taken two or three paces off of and from the curb stone onto the street. . . .

    <p id="b188-6" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[240,738,1144,425]]]'>This should have ended the query. Párente had emphatically stated he was still standing on the curb stone when the automobile ran him down, but the Court pursued him with another question: “Q. (By the Court) Now ask him can he explain what he meant when he said he was two or three paces out on the street when he was struck. Ask him if he can explain that?”</p>
    <p id="b188-8" data-blocks='[["BL_188.6",188,[242,1183,1144,489]]]'>With this question, the Court toppled Párente into the pit which defendants’ counsel had so neatly and precisely — and unfairly — excavated. It will be noted that the Court assumed that Párente had at one time said that he was two or three paces in the street when the collision occurred. Párente never once made such an assertion. When he answered “two or three paces” he was replying to the question: “How far away from you was the car — ?”</p>

The Majority Opinion lauds the Trial Judge for “leaning over backward to protect plaintiff.” I do not doubt for a moment that the Trial Judge was absolutely sincere in endeavoring to arrive at the truth, but I also believe that in “leaning over backward” he lost his equilibrium.. He ascribed to the plaintiff a posture of assertion which cannot be verified by the record. Thus, after the plaintiff had been tumbléd, wheel chair and all, into the-hole which defendants’ counsel had spaded, thére might still have béen aii opportunity for the plain<a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>tiff to get out, had it not been that in his charge to the jury, the Trial Judge buried the plaintiff and his cause completely by telling the jury that the plaintiff had said that “. . . he had left the curb and had progressed two or three paces therefrom onto the paved highway when he was struck.”</p>
    <p id="b189-3" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[154,691,1145,98]]]'>The plaintiff at no time said that he had progressed two or three paces from the curb when he was struck.</p>

    <p id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.6",189,[148,1027,1149,991]]]'>But this question was not put in cross-examination. It was put by the Trial Judge and, ívith all respect, I must say it was put very badly and unfairly. He repeated the fault of the defendants’ counsel: he threw two questions in one. It was hard enough for the plaintiff, considering his age and infirmities, to get one question at a time, without having two fired at him simultaneously by the awesome figure in black robes on the throne towering above him. It must be noted here, in passing, that Charles Párente had been adjudged a mental incompetent, and a guardian ad litem had been appointed for him seven months prior to the trial. The guardianship was lifted only two days before the trial. Thus, for this and other reasons, including a desire for specificity, the Trial Judge should have leaned not backward but forward to make certain that the plaintiff thoroughly understood what was transpiring in the Court.</p>
    <p id="b189-6" data-blocks='[["BL_189.7",189,[146,2032,1147,324]],["BL_190.1",190,[270,349,1143,216]]]'>The record clearly shows that the plaintiff had difficulty in understanding. Just before the plaintiff took the witness stand, one of the attorneys Mr. Libenson, explained to the Court that probably Párente needed an interpreter. The following ensued: “By the Court: Let’s seé. Mr. Párente — By Mr. Libenson: The <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>Judge wants to talk to you. Q. (By the Court) Mr. Párente? A. Yes. Q.

Now where did the car come from, your left or the right? A. The other side. By Mr. Fleming: He indicates his right. By the Court: If you can do better, go ahead. By Mr. Libenson: He tires very easily. We could be too extensive. By the Court: I won’t ask another question.”</p>
    <p id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[272,1202,1144,323]]]'>But the Court did ask other questions, many of them, and some of them so telescoped and double-jointed as inevitably to create misunderstanding.

I believe he is entitled to it because of the efforts intentionally made by defendants’ counsel and unintentionally made by the Trial Judge to force the plaintiff off the curbstone of fact into the street of ambiguity, confusion, and unfairness. Let us look at the matter a little further. Mr. Libenson, plaintiff’s counsel, asked the interpreter to put to plaintiff the following question: “Ask him [the plaintiff] the point where he stood when the car hit him?”</p>
    <p id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.6",191,[173,1579,1147,769]]]'>This was a sensible question, a fair question, the catalyst which would have resolved all the murky interrogation into a definitive, understandable proposition.

But the Judge did not allow Mr. Liberison’s question. He leaned backward in order to be fair and said: “We will strike that out.” He then went on to say that it was the Court’s duty , to get all the facts and proceeded to put the' blunderbuss’ .question already, quoted.
