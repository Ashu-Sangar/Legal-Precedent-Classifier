The result of the agreement was that a burden was created upon the servient estate for the benefit of the dominant estate, the burden being on the land rather than the person, which remained against the land even after it passed into the hands of the successors or assigns of the immediate parties.

Stevens Coal Co., </em>supra, 568-569: “In holding as we do that plaintiffs are bound by the contract’s terms, we are not heedless of the principle frequently recognized by this court that ‘however general the terms may be in which an agreement is conceived, it only comprehends those things in respect to which it appears that the contracting parties proposed to contract; and not others they, never thought of’: Case v. Cushman, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 544" data-case-ids="1854580" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0544-01">3 W. &amp; S. 544</a>, 546. Fidelity to this principle does not require courts to indulge in speculations as to the mental processes or expectations of the contracting parties. In interpreting contracts, as in interpreting wills, the guide to intentions is the terms used unless they are ambiguous. The respective rights and obligations which the words of a contract clearly express are the rights <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>and obligations which the courts must recognize and enforce. In Becker v. London Assur. Corp. (1918, H. L.), 117 L. T. Rep. 609, construing an insurance contract, Lord Sumner said: ‘I dare say few assured have any distinct view of their own on the point, and might not even see it, if it were explained to them, but what they intend contractually does not depend on what they understand individually. If it is implicit in the nature of the bargain, then they intend it in law just as much as if they said it in words’. Contracts that project themselves into the long future often give rise to legal relations that one or both parties may never have anticipated. ‘No one can ever see very far up the road’ but when one has unequivocally committed himself by contract to travel a certain road, he must abide by his commitment”.</p>

The owners of the surface of land released owners of mining rights from all future damage due to faulty mining and surface subsidence. The releases were held valid. And in Manius v.
