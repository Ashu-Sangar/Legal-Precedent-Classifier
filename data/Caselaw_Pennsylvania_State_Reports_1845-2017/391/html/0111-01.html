    <blockquote id="b132-6" data-blocks='[["BL_132.8",132,[257,900,1145,589]]]'>“This case is before us on appeal from the refusal of the Zoning Board of Adjustment to issue a permit for the erection of a one-story building on ground situated on the northeast corner of Moyamensing Avenue and McClellan Street, in the City of Philadelphia, better known and numbered as 1809-1818 Moyamensing Avenue, which ground adjoins appellant’s present slaughter-house and meat-packing plant. Appellant’s slaughter-house is located in a ‘general industrial’ district, and its operation constitutes a non-conforming use.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b132-7" data-blocks='[["BL_132.9",132,[254,1511,1146,821]]]'>“Appellant proposes to use the additional structure as a freezer-warehouse in which it intends to freeze and store meats produced in the slaughter-house. The plot of ground upon which the appellant seeks to erect the additional structure lies in a district zoned ‘A Commercial’. Appellant sought a use variance before the Zoning Board of Adjustment because slaughterhouses are permitted only in ‘least restricted districts’. In addition to a variance as to use, appellant’s application involves a variance with respect to the ‘open area’ requirements for ‘A Commercial’ property. Chapter 14-303 (3) (a) of the General Code of Ordinances provides that no more than 80% of the lot shall be occupied. In the instant case appellant proposes to leave only 10% of the area unoccupied.</blockquote>

Appellant presented evidence concerning the manner in which the proposed freezer-warehouse would be operated, if its construction were permitted ; the appellant’s great need for this facility; its production of meat for the United States Army, for export to foreign governments, and for wholesalers and retailers, including food chains; its estimated volume of production of 17 million pounds annually, of which approximately 6 million pounds are sold as frozen meat; and its present method of trucking its meat to a public freezer where it is frozen, stored, and thereafter returned to appellant’s slaughter-house by truck, unloaded, inspected, and finally shipped by truck to appellant’s customers.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[183,1741,1150,600]]]'>“Further, appellant, to demonstrate its need, offered evidence to the effect that trucking operations between its plant and the public freezer would be eliminated by the construction of the proposed freezer-warehouse adjacent to its slaughter-house, which would thus permit appellant to compete with other meat producers having adequate freezing and storing facilities in their plants. It is conceded that there has been a substantial growth in the production and sale of frozen meat, and that in this day and age freezing is an important phase of the meat-producing business.</blockquote>
