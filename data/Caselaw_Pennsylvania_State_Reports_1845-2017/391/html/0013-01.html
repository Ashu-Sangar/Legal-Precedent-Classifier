    <p id="b35-6" data-blocks='[["BL_35.8",35,[199,729,1147,705]]]'>In this action to quiet title the facts are undisputed. On April 14, 1919, Pulaski Hamlin and his wife owned and possessed two tracts of land — 64 acres and 20 acres, respectively — located in Exeter Township, Luzerne County, Pa. Nineteen years previously, when Hamlin purchased these two tracts of land, an exception or reservation had been made in the conveyance of “All the coal in and under said two tracts of land, with the right to mine and remove two-thirds of the same by any subterranean process . . .”. On April 14, 1919 Hamlin and his wife conveyed the land by a general warranty deed to one Sarli. The instant problem involves the construction of that deed.</p>

In addition the following pertinent language and clauses then appear in the deed: (1) “The two pieces or parcels of <em>land </em>above described are known as the J. Benedict Jones farm”; (2) a reference to “Tlie <em>land </em>above described and intended to be conveyed”; (3) another reference to the conveyance of “the said land” between predecessors in the line of title wherein a “certain cemetery lot” was reserved; (4) another reference to a conveyance of “the said <em>land” </em>by Hamlin’s immediate predecessor in title; (5) another reference to a conveyance of “the said <em>land” </em>by ITamlin to his wife; (6)' an appurtenance clause — “Together with all and singular, the . .

Subsequent to this deed, by various mesne conveyances the title to the premises became vested in the appellees.</p>

Among such rules are those providing: (1) that the nature and quantity of the interest conveyed must be ascertained from the instrument itself and cannot be orally shown in the absence of fraud, accident or mistake and we seek to ascertain not what the parties may have intended by the language but what is the meaning of the words; (2) effect must be given to <em>all </em>the language of the instrument and no part shall be rejected if it can be given a meaning; (3) the language of the deed shall be interpreted in the light of the subject matter, the apparent object or purpose of the parties and the conditions existing when it was executed.</p>
    <p id="b36-6" data-blocks='[["BL_36.6",36,[240,1583,1146,431]]]'>When the Hamlins acquired ownership of these two tracts of land they received a complete ownership of all the estates in, under and above the land except that which had been specifically excepted and reserved, to wit: the coal. Applying the rules of construction to the terms and language of this deed it is evident that the Hamlins conveyed to Sarli their entire interest in the two tracts of land, including the gas and oil rights.</p>
