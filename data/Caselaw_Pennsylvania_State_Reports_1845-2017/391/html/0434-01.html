It is these decrees which are now before us for review on the separate appeals of Foust, Felder, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia (the State and City having voluntarily become parties to the proceedings).

In <em>Holdship v. Patterson, </em><a href="/watts/7/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="7 Watts 547" data-case-ids="1846858" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0547-01">7 Watts 547</a>, 551 (1838), Mr. Chief Justice Gibson pertinently stated that a testamentary benefactor “has an individual right of property in the execution of the trust, and to deprive him of it would be a fraud on his generosity. To appropriate a gift to a purpose <em>or person </em>not intended, would be an evasion of the donor’s private dominion” (Emphasis supplied). As lately as <em>Borsch Estate, </em><a href="/pa/362/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="362 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="477347" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0581-01">362 Pa. 581</a>, 586, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="67 A.2d 119">67 A. 2d 119</a> (1949), we recognized, as constitutionally safe-guarded, the right of a benefactor to have enforced the limitations and restrictions affixed to his testamentary gift. The exercise of that right is but one of the manifestations of the right of private property which is fundamental to our social, economic and political order and whose preservation unimpaired is as vital to our Negro citizens as it is to their white brethren.</p>

However, the Supreme Court did not say that there is any Constitutional or <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>other legal barrier to the removal of the Board of City Trusts as trustee of Girard College in order that the Orphanage can be administered in accordance with all of the testator’s express directions including the qualifications for admission to the student body.

In rejecting this contention Mr. Justice Story, speaking for the Supreme Court, said: “It is true that, if the trust be repugnant to, or inconsistent with the proper purposes for which the corporation was created, that may furnish a ground why it may not be compellable to execute it. But that will furnish no ground to declare the trust itself void, if otherwise unexceptionable; but it will simply require a new trustee to be substituted by the proper court, possessing equity jurisdiction, to enforce and perfect the objects of the trust.”</p>

L. 21, which enlarged the physical area of the City of Philadelphia by incorporating therein outlying territory, Girard’s heirs renewed their attack on the trust. The case again went to the Supreme Court of the United States where it was argued that the “Consolidation Act” had “either dissolved or destroyed the identity of the original corporation [City of Philadelphia], and it is consequently unable any longer to administer the trust.” Mr. Justice Grier, who delivered the opinion of the Court, said, “Now, <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>if this were true [that the City could no longer act as trustee of the Girard Estate], the only consequence would be, not that the charities or trust should fail, but that the chancellor should substitute another trustee”: <em>Girard v.

Girard’s Heirs, </em><a href="/pa/45/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="45 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="9502081" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0009-01">45 Pa. 9</a>, 26) but for the court, which has jurisdiction of the trust and its fiduciary, to appoint substitute trustees capable of carrying out the testator’s lawful prescriptions.

What the will so clearly reveals as to the intended paramountcy of the private charity has long since been judicially recognized. In <em>Girard v.

It is erected on land OAvned by Girard and the buildings Avere constructed with his own funds. . . .

We must observe this distinction in studying Mr. Girard’s will, otherwise we run the risk of inverting the natural order of things by subordinating principles to form, the purpose to its means, the actual and executed gift for a known purpose to the prescribed or vaticinated modes of administering it, that are intended for adaptation to an unknown future, and of thus making the chief purpose of the gift dependent on the very often unwise directions prescribed for its future security and efficiency.”</p>

C. C. Pep. 241. Therefore, when a charity is established in any manner, such a slight impediment as a defect or want of power in the trustee to execute it does not stand in the way; the charity remains; the trustee is declared incapable of acting, and a competent trustee is appointed in his place.

Kraemer, </em>where a party to a racially restrictive agreement relative to private property sought equitable enforcement of the covenant against Negro purchasers of portions of the restricted property, the Supreme Court took occasion to observe, first of all, that “among the civil rights intended to be protected from discriminatory state action by the Fourteenth Amendment are the rights to acquire, enjoy, own and dispose of property” and then declared that “Equality in the enjoyment of property rights . . . [is] an essential pre-condition to' the <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>realization' of other basic civil fights' and liberties which the Amendment was intended to guarantee.” The undisputed facts in the <em>Shelley </em>case made' it clear that, but for the active intervention of the State court, the Negro purchasers would have been free to occupy the properties in question without restraint.' Thus, the State had made available to the covenantees the full coercive power of government to deny to the Negro purchasers, on the ground of race or color, their constitutional right to own and enjoy property which they were willing and financially able to acquire and which the grantors were willing to sell. As contrasted by the Supreme Court, “The difference between judicial enforcement and non-enforcement of the restrictive covenants is the difference to the petitioners between being denied rights of property available to other members Of the community and being accorded full enjoyment of those rights on an equal footing.” In the instant case, no one not possessing the qualifications prescribed' by Girard’s will for admission to the Orphanage can claim any right that entitles him to share Stephen Girard’s largesse on an equal, or any, footing with those whom Girard himself expressly made the beneficiaries of his bounty.</p>

      <em>Barrows v.

The only parties to the suit Were the signatories to the restrictive agreement. No attempt was made to enjoin the Negro purchaser from enjoying the property which he had so acquired. The State court, on the rationale of the <em>Shelley </em>casé, denied the plaintiff a recovery. The Supreme Court, in affirming the judgment of the State court, reasoned as follows: “To compel respondent to respond in damages would bé for <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>the State to punish her for her failure to perform her covenant to continue to discriminate against non-Caucasians in the use of her property. ...

This seems plain enough, for, immediately after referring to the effects of the restrictive covenant on the owner’s exercise of her property rights, the Supreme Court at once said, —“The next question to emerge is whether the state action in allowing damages deprives anyone of rights protected by the Constitution”. Thereupon, the Court concluded that the State action did so operate, saying, — “If a state court awards damages for breach of a restrictive covenant, a prospective seller of restricted land Avill either refuse to sell to non-Caucasians or else Avill require non-Caucasians to pay a higher price to meet the damages which the seller may incur. Solely because of their race, non-Caucasians will be unable to purchase, own, and enjoy property on the same terms as Caucasians. Denial of this right by state action deprives such non-Caucasians, unidentified but identifiable, of equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

To do so would be to invade <em>Ms </em>constitutionally guaranteed right of dominion over his own property. And, that would be no less true of Stephen Girard’s trust were we to hold that, because of his testamentary limitation on admissions to Girard College to “poor male white orphans”, he has been guilty of an unconstitutional discrimination by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, wherefor all <em>poor male </em>orphans, regardless of color, are eligible for admission to that institution.</p>

However, it is interesting to observe that the Orphans’ Court is. not too certain, in spite of its assertion that its course was “clearly charted”, that it is entirely confident that the course it selected actually conducts to the port it is seeking. In appointing thirteen private trustees, it chose six of them from the Board of City Trusts which it had already declared as disqualified and incompetent! It could not have believed that the Board was entirely disqualified and incompetent when it accepted almost 50% of the Board’s membership to participate in the so-called private trusteeship. And it is well to observe, as pointed out by counsel for the City of Philadelphia, that: “These six constituted a majority of the living appointed members of the Board of Directors of City Trusts and included five of the eight members of the executive committee of the Board.” .</p>

This Court had decided that Foust and Felder should not be admitted to Girard College. The Supreme Court reversed that decision. What else could have been meant than that Foust and Felder were now to be admitted? The Majority Opinion makes a point of the language used by the Supreme Court in its order remanding the cause for “further proceedings not inconsistent with this ©pinion.” What proceedings would there be other than admitting Foust and Felder to Girard College? There was nothing else pending. The admittance or rejection of the applicants was the only issue in the entire litigation. In support of its position of exclusion the Majority cites the case of <em>Sweatt v. Painter, </em><a href="/us/339/0629-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="339 U.S. 629" data-case-ids="362770" data-case-paths="/us/339/0629-01">339 U. S. 629</a>. The Supreme Court there held that the “Fourteenth Amendment requires that petitioner be admitted to the University of Texas Law School.” It also used the language embodied in the case at bar, namely, “The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.” In the case at bar the applicants are minors. There are certain preliminaries which must be attended to before they may be admitted, even following a decision which would admit them on the ground that the Girard College is a public institution: there must be certain releases from relatives, the City must become the guardian, indenturing must be considered. “Further proceedings” obviously refers to the entire operation required to get Foust and Felder into Girard College, which certainly an appellate court would not spell out in detail.</p>

    <p id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[177,616,1148,1327]]]'>The Majority says that when a charity is established, “such a slight impediment as a defect or want of power in the trustee to execute it does not stand in the way; the charity remains; the trustee is declared incapable of acting, and a competent trustee is appointed in his place.” But there is no adjudication that the Board of City Trusts labors under any want of capacity or power to administer the Girard College in accordance with the nature and purpose of the Girard will. The Supreme Court of the United States held that under the present state of the law the Board of City Trusts may not exclude Foust and Felder from Girard College. As I" have already indicated, it did not say that the trustee was incapable. It did not say that the trustee should be removed. It said that the machinery running Girard College was governmental. It did not suggest that the machinery should or even could be removed. It recognized a fact, namely, that Girard College is a public institution and that, therefore, this Court should initiate such proceedings as would be necessary to put its decision into effect. This could only mean that, once the necessary preliminaries were attended to, Foust and Felder were to be admitted to Girard College.</p>

As I have already discussed, the real questions are whether or not a private trustee may or should be <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>substituted for the Board of City Trusts, and if such substitution of trustees would make Girard College a private institution so as to take its administration out of the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Majority overlooks our statute of April 24, 1947, P.L. 100, §10, which reads: “Except as otherwise provided by the conveyor, if the charitable purpose for which an interest shall be conveyed shall be or become indefinite or impossible or impractical of fulfilment, or if it shall not have been carried out for want of a trustee or because of the failure of a trustee to designate such purpose, the court may, on application of the trustee or of any interested person or of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, after proof of notice to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>when he is not the petitioner, order an administration or distribution of the estate for a charitable purpose in a manner as nearly as possible to fulfill the intention of the conveyor, whether his charitable intent be general or specific.”</p>

Enoch Pratt of Baltimore gave to that City a library with certain conditions which were met by the Maryland Legislature and the Baltimore City Council. Funds were subsequently contributed to the institution by Andrew Carnegie. After the library had been operating some time, a Negro girl applied for admission as a trainee in the institution. The application was rejected and she appealed to the Courts, claiming that equal protection of the laws had been denied her. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals (Fourth District) upheld her <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>contention. Chief Judge Soper, speaking for the Court, said:</p>

      <em>“The donor could have formed a private corporation </em>under the general permissive statutes of Maryland with power both to own the property and to manage the business of the Library independent of the State. <em>He chose instead to seek the aid of the state to found a public institution </em>to be owned and supported by the city but to be operated by a self-perpetuating board of trustees to safeguard it from political manipulation; and this was accomplished by special act of the legislature with the result that the powers and obligations of the city and trustees were not conferred by Mr. Pratt but by the state at the very inception of the enterprise <em>... It is our view that although Pratt furnished the inspiration and the funds initially, the authority of the state was invoked to create the institution </em>and to vest the power of ownership in one instrumentality and the power of management in another, with the injunction upon the former to see to it that the latter faithfully performed its trust. We know of no reason why the state cannot create separate agencies to carry on its work in this manner, and <em>when it does so, they become subject to the constitutional restraints upon the state itself.”</em>
