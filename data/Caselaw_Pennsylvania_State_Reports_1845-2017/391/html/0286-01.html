Decedent instituted this equity action on November 16, 1953; upon her death, on April 4, 1954, her son and executor, Louis Sendick, Jr., was substituted as plaintiff.</p>

The eighth paragraph of the complaint states: “At the time the alleged Deed was signed, the Plaintiff was in her sixty-ninth (69) year, weak in-body and confined to her bed, and weak in mind, easily influenced by the Plaintiff [sic] who stood in a confidential relationship to her, and not possessed of such mental capacity to comprehend the true meaning of said instrument or to understand the effect of her act, and was told the instrument was only a Will. which she could revoke any time. The plaintiff by reason of her illiteracy could not read the instrument that was signed by her; and since the same was not read to her in her native.tongue,-she trusted representations made to her <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>that it was a Will and signed the same.” It was further alleged that the appellant promised to move into the decedent’s home, pay the taxes, maintain the property and care for the decedent and that the appellant had failed to do any of these things. In substance, the prayer of the complaint was that the appellant be compelled to reconvey the property allegedly obtained by her fraudulent acts and undue influence.</p>

The appellee offered eight witnesses, five of whom were ruled incompetent to testify under the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, §5(e), 28 PS §322. No exceptions having been taken to this ruling, the question of their competency is not before this Court. The three witnesses who were permitted to testify for the appellee were Mrs. Rose Parks, decedent’s eldest daughter, Mrs. Parks’ husband and the doctor who cared for the decedent during the period in question. The chancellor properly ruled that because Mrs. Parks did not stand to benefit under decedent’s will she was a disinterested witness and consequently competent to testify under the Act of 1887, supra. Appellant called only two witnesses, Michael W. Huron, a member of the Allegheny County Bar and Mrs. Esther Huron, his wife and secretary, who was a notary public.</p>

However, the evidence is clear that she discussed her business affairs lucidly and, as Mrs. Parks, appellee’s own witness, stated upon direct examination, intelligently. At the time of the conveyance, appellant did not reside with the decedent but did visit with her regularly on the week-ends.

After receiving this call, and without actually drawing the deed, Mr. Huron returned to the decedent’s home and again attempted to persuade her to make a will. The decedent was adamant in her insistence upon a deed but Mr. Huron did succeed in securing her assent to a provision reserving a life estate in the property for herself. In addition, Mr. Huron suggested, and the decedent consented, that a supplemental written agreement should be drawn providing that in consideration for the conveyance the appellant would agree to satisfy a lien against the property held by the Commonwealth for public assistance and to pay the decedent’s funeral bills not to exceed $800.</p>

During the course of this visit Mr. Huron again attempted in vain to persuade the decedent to draw a will instead of executing the deed. He stated that the decedent was fully competent, clearly expressed her desires, and completely understood the proceedings. Mr. Huron’s wife, who was present as his secretary and notarized the deed, corroborated his testimony completely.</p>

The chancellor ignored these averments and we agree that there is no evidentiary basis to support them. The only evidence at all concerning the preparation and execution of the deed was the uncontradicted testimony of Mr. Huron which reveals, unequivocally, that the decedent was diligently advised and fully understood the legal significance of her act in executing the document he prepared according to her instructions.</p>

In addition, there was no evidence that the decedent relied upon or trusted in the appellant’s advice and, in fact, this record is replete with instances when the decedent consulted both Mrs. Parks and her husband, as well as others- of her daughters, concerning her business affairs. There is no evidence whatever that the appellant ever made any demand of any sort upon the decedent, and it is clear, under the reasoning of the cases cited, that the evidence was insufficient and inadequate to establish confidential relationship.</p>

Russell and Co., Inc., </em>supra, pp. 323, 324, this Court said: “When does the oral agreement come within the field embraced by the written one? This can be answered by comparing the two, and determining whether parties, situated as were the ones to the contract, would naturally and normally include the one in the other if it were made. If they relate to the same subject-matter and are so interrelated that both would be executed at the same time, and in the same contract, the scope of the subsidiary agreement must be taken to be covered by the writing.” It is manifestly clear that these parties would normally and naturally have included this alleged oral agreement if there had been any such undertaking by the appellant. The .alleged oral agreement and the written agreement both relate to the identical subject-matter, i.e. the quantum of the appellant’s consideration for the convey<a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>anee.

This Court fails to find any conceivable record support for such a finding in view of the fact that the instant action was commenced prior to the decedent’s death. And finally, we have searched tlus record in vain for any evidence to support the finding that the appellant refused to satisfy the Commonwealth’s lien for public assistance. This conclusion of the chancellor, also, has no basis in fact and consequently constitutes clear error.</p>
