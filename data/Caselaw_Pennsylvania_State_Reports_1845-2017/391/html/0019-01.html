Ellis, and the appellee, lessor, Elizabethtown Lodge No. 596, Loyal Order of Moose, entered into a written lease prepared by the lessor, covering an unimproved lot in the Borough Of Elizabethtown, Lancaster County, <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>Pennsylvania. The term of the lease was for a period of 20 years from April 1, 1940, with the right of appellant to renew the lease for two additional terms of five years each. The agreed upon rental was $50 per month during the first 20 years; $60 per month for the first renewal period of five years and $75 per month for the second renewal term. The lease was silent with respeet to the place at which the rent was to be paid.</p>
    <p id="b41-3" data-blocks='[["BL_41.4",41,[208,847,1146,490]]]'>Shortly after taking possession appellant, in accordance with permission contained in the lease and the prior approval of the lessor, erected on the premises for occupancy by the American Stores Company a one-story building at a cost to appellant of $31,250. As further contemplated by the parties to the original lease, a sub-lease of the improved premises was made to the American Stores Company at a rental exceeding that payable by appellant to appellee.</p>
    <p id="b41-4" data-blocks='[["BL_41.5",41,[206,1348,1147,438]]]'>In the same year, 1940, appellant assigned his interest in the lease to Jacob Ellis Eealties, Inc., of which he was and is president and treasurer. The corporation in turn assigned its interest to the Central-Penn National Bank of Philadelphia as collateral security for a loan. Both assignments were approved in writing by the appellee. Thereafter the rent was paid by the bank to the appellee.</p>

As a result the obligation devolved upon appellant or upon the corporation of which he was president to see to the payment of rent directly to the lessor commencing July 1, 1956. At the time the appellant received the letter he was making preparations to go abroad and, consequently, hé turned over. the letter together with all other documents pertaining- to the <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>demised premises to his secretary with specific instructions to take care of the matter until his return.</p>

As previously indicated, from 1940 until July, 1956 the rent had been paid faithfully every month by the bank. However, the three monthly payments due between the time appellant turned the matter over to his secretary until his return from Europe, namely, July, August and September, ivere not paid. During these three months the lessor appellee made no demand for the payment of rent on either the appellant or Jacob Ellis Realties, Inc., but on July 31, 1956, Charles B. Sweigert, who was then Governor of the Lodge, called upon the local manager of the American Stores Company and notified him that the rent was in default and informed him to relay this information to the district manager of American Stores to see what was actually transpiring.</p>
    <p id="b42-5" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[229,1412,1156,430]]]'>With no further communication to American Stores and with no notification at all to appellant or his company, the lessor, on September 14, 1956, the day appellant returned from Europe, under a power contained in the lease, caused a dual judgment to be entered as by confession (1) for $150 arrearages of rent and (2) in ejectment for• possession of the prop-, erty.</p>
    <p id="b42-6" data-blocks='[["BL_42.6",42,[226,1862,1145,216]]]'>Inasmuch as the warrant of' attorney to enter judgment was over 10 years but less than 20 years old, a local rule of court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> required leave of the court, which was granted and the judgments entered the same day.</p>

      <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>Appellant first learned of these proceedings indirectly in the latter part of September, whereupon he immediately telephoned counsel for the lessor and offered to send a check for accrued rent with interest. Gounsel for the Lodge informed appellant it was then too late to pay the rent and followed this conversation with a letter informing appellant that the Lodge had decided to insist upon a forfeiture in spite of the tender. He stated further that the Lodge would be willing to execute a new lease at an increased rental based upon the present rental value of the premises or settle the action by requiring payment of a substantial sum to reinstate the original lease. The letter concluded by stating unless a substantial offer was made the Lodge would negotiate a new lease directly with the appellant’s subtenant.</p>
    <p id="b43-3" data-blocks='[["BL_43.5",43,[188,1237,1149,869]]]'>On October 23, 1956, appellant, through his attorney, made a formal tender of the arrears of rent with interest. This tender together with all subsequent tenders up to the time of argument on the rules was refused by the lessor. Thereafter, on October 26, 1956, appellant filed separate petitions to strike off and to open these judgments. The petition for a rule to strike off- the judgments was predicated upon the lessor’s failure to comply with the rule of court previously alluded to in that neither appellee’s original petition nor its affidavit contained any averment that the rent was unpaid and, secondly, that the judgment was entered without averment or proof of demand for rént by appellee. The first defect of record was subsequently cleared by the court’s grant of appellee’s motion' to amend.</p>

    <p id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[243,678,1149,1644]]]'>In Pennsylvania we have consistently followed the strict common law rule that unless a demand for rent is expressly waived by the terms of a lease a demand by the lessor is absolutely essential to work a forfeiture thereof for nonpayment of rent. As stated in <em>McCormick v. Connell, </em>6 S. &amp; R. 151, 152, 153, “Where there is a condition of re-entry on nonpayment of rent, several things are required by the common law, to be previously done, to entitle the reversioner to re-enter. <em>There must be a demand of the precise rent due, on the very day on which it becomes due, </em>on the most notorious place on the land, and a demand must in fact be made on the land, although there should be no person on the land ready to pay it: Duppa v. Mayo, 1 Saund. 287, note 16. This part of the common law has been adopted by us; in our ovra common law; Stoever v. Lessee of Whitman, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Binn.%20419" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Binn. 419">6 Binn. 419</a>. It may have its inconveniences; it may be said, that the demand, where there is none on whom the demand can be made, is an idle ceremony. This may be very true; we may not, at this day, be able to discover the reason of all this exactness, but it is a principle of our legal tenures, and can only be changed by the Legislature.” (Emphasis supplied).

Construed in this light we think it clear that the words in controversy have reference solely to the customary notice to quit which a landlord must provide his tenant if he intends to exercise his right of repossession for breach of one of the terms of the lease. In paragraph (9) of the lease the. words are used in conjunction with the ]essor’s <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>right to enter and repossess the demised premises. Paragraph (11), which is the only provision in the lease containing express waivers, specifically states in relevant part “Lessee hereby waives the usual three (3) months’ notice to quit and agrees to surrender demised premises ... on the termination of this Lease . . . without any notice whatsoever . . .”</p>
    <p id="b47-3" data-blocks='[["BL_47.4",47,[182,732,1148,1427]]]'>A demand for payment and notice to quit cannot be equated for they are two entirely different steps that a landlord must pursue before declaring a forfeiture of a lease. The purpose of the former is to afford the tenant a reasonable opportunity to make payment while the purpose of the latter is to give the tenant time to prepare for eviction once he has failed to respect the demand and further to evidence the fact that the landlord is exercising his option to repossess the premises. It is for this reason that under the common law rule demand must be made on the rent day whereas notice can be given several weeks after the lessee’s failure to honor the demand. This distinction is clearly recognized in the case of <em>Rea v. Eagle Transfer Company, </em>supra. In that case the lease provided for re-entry by the landlord upon default after giving 10 days notice. Despite the fact that notice was given within the prescribed time, nevertheless, we held that there could be no forfeiture in the absence of a common law demand. The distinction between notice to quit and demand for payment is further evidenced by the recent Landlord and Tenant Act (Act of April 6, 1951, P. L. 69, 68 PS §250.501), which requires a landlord seeking possession to give notice to remove after the failure of the tenant upon demand to pay the overdue rent.</p>
