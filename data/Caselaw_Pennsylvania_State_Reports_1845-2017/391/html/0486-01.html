During the course of the crime, two police officers were disarmed and held captive in the establishment. The defendant and his accomplice Worseck, fleeing the scene, compelled one Raymond R. Herschman to accompany them. Redline was the first to leave the building, behind him was Herschman and behind Herschman was Worseck. As they were departing, uniformed police officers outside bore down upon them. Redline, seeing one of the officers, shouted to him, “The man you want is in there [apparently meaning the building he had just left].” With that, Redline aimed a 45-caliber revolver at the policeman, wlio was then approximately fifteen to twenty feet distant, and fired point-blank but failed to hit his intended victim. Prior to this shot by Redline, there had been no shooting whatever. The policeman immediately returned the fire, and there then ensued a gun battle involving several policemen and the defendant and Worseck. During the course of the shooting, two policemen were seriously wounded, the defendant himself was wounded and so was Worseck. The latter’s wound, which admittedly was inflicted by a bullet from a policeman’s gun, proved fatal. It was Worseck’s death for which Redline was indicted, tried and convicted for murder. As stipulated of record at trial, no bullet from the defendant’s gun ever touched Worseck.</p>

The so-called murder statute of this State is but a categorizing of common law murder into tAVO degrees — a dichotomy still unrecognized in England whence the definition of murder as knoAvn and applied in Pennsylvania was derived. In fact, the General Assembly of this State was the first legislative body in America to divide the crime of murder into degrees (see Section 2 of the Act of 1794, supra). Since then, more of the other States of the Union have adopted similar statutes. See Needy, A Problem of First Degree Murder: Fisher v. United States, 99 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 267 (1950).</p>

Ed.) ; IV Blackstone, Commentaries, *177. The classifications of homicide at common law are (1) justifiable, (2) excusable and (3) felonious. “The first has no share of guilt at all; the second very little; but the third is, the highest crime against the law of nature that man is capable of committing”: IV Blackstone, Commen<a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>taries, *178. A justifiable homicide is such as is committed either by command or, at least, with the permission of the law, e.g., execution of a convicted criminal, <em>apprehension of an escapmg felon, </em>etc.; an excusable homicide is such as is committed either <em>per infortunium </em>(i.e., accidentally) or <em>se defendiendo </em>(i.e., in self defense) : IV Blackstone, Commentaries, *178-186; and a felonious homicide (i.e., murder) occurs when a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully and feloniously kills any human being in the peace of the sovereign <em>with malice </em>prepense or aforethought, express or implied: see IV Blackstone, Commentaries, *195; 1 Warren, Homicide, §63; 1 Wharton, Criminal Law, §419 (12th Ed).</p>

For instance, at common law an accidental or unintentional <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>homicide committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate a felony is murder, the malice necessary to make the killing murder being constructively imputed by the malice incident to the perpetration of the initial felony. Thus, “if one intends to do another felony, and undesignedly kills a man, this is also murder”: IV Blackstone, Commentaries, *200-201. This type of felonious homicide, known as felony-murder, became firmly imbedded in the common law. It had its origin in antiquity. According to Morris, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>“There is, indeed, more than a hint of the existence of such a rule in Braeton’s De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae”, circa 1256, and was developed “in its formulations through Coke, Hale, Foster, Blackstone-and East ...” A widely accepted and quite plausible explanation of the origin of the doctrine is that at early common law many crimes, including practically all, if not all, felonies were punishable by death so that it was of no particular moment whether the condemned was hanged for the initial felony or for the death accidentally resulting from the felony: see The Killer and His Victim in Felony-Murder Cases by Hitchler, 53 Dick. L. Kev. 3 (1948). But, the fact that murder continues to be the only capital offense in Pennsylvania makés the distinction as to felony-murder vitally significant. And, - the trend generally has been to restrict rather ' than to expand application of the- felony-murder doctrine: Indeed, in enacting the murder degree statute of 1794, supra, the Pennsylvania legislature constricted the penalty for felony-murder by imposing capital punishment only for such felony-murders as occurred in the-perpetration of arson, rape, robbery or burglary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

It is plain enough that neither the Act of 1794, supra, nor any of its subsequent re-enactments •made <em>all </em>homicides occurring in the perpetration of felonies murder of the first degree. Logically, therefore, the basic determination of the fact of murder is to be made according to the rules of the common law, including the felony-murder theory of imputed malice, and, upon a finding of guilt, the degree statute automatically raises the murder to first degree if it happened, inter alia, to have been committed in the perpetration of arson, rape, robbery, burglary or kidnapping: cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

The case was tried before Chief Justice Bigelow and Justices Metcalf, Merrick and Hoar of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and was prosecuted by the Attorney General of the State in person. The Attorney General requested the court to instruct the jury as follows: “That whether [the deceased] was killed by a shot from within or without the armory, all the parties unlawfully engaged in the transactions which resulted in the homicide were at common law guilty, at least of manslaughter.” The instruction was refused in an opinion for the court by Chief Justice Bigelow who said in part (pp. 544-545), “No person can be held guilty of homicide unless the act is either actually or constructively his, and it cannot be his act in either sense unless committed by his own hand or by some one acting in concert with <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>him or in furtherance of a common object or purpose. Certainly that cannot be said to be an act of a party in any just sense, or on any sound legal principle, which is not only not done by him, or by any one with whom he is associated or connected in a common enterprise, or in attempting to accomplish the same end, but is committed by a person who is his direct and immediate adversary, and who is, at the moment when the alleged criminal act is done, actually engaged in opposing and resisting him and his confederates and abettors in the accomplishment of the unlawful object for which they are united. Suppose, for example, a burglar attempts to break into a dwelling-house, and the owner or occupant, while striving to resist and prevent the unlawful entrance, by misadventure kills his own servant. Can the burglar in such case be deemed guilty of criminal homicide? Certainly not.” Coming to the facts of the particular case, Chief Justice Bigelow said (pp. 547-548) that, “If the homicide was the result of a shot fired by the soldiers or other persons in the armory, acting together in defence against the riotous assembly, the defendant cannot be held guilty of either murder or manslaughter. The jury will accordingly be instructed that, unless they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the deceased was killed by means of a gun or other deadly weapon in the hands of the prisoner, or of one of the rioters with whom he was associated and acting, he is entitled to an acquittal.”</p>

But, the principle involved is the same so far as the defendants’ criminal responsibility for the marshal’s unintentional killing of an innocent third person was concerned. At common law, a homicide committed by one acting in furtherance of a misdemeanor (at least one <em>malum in se) </em>is, by like token, voluntary manslaughter (see 1 Warren, Homicide, §74), malice not being imputed since the initial offense was not a felony. And so, the jury convicted the Butlers of voluntary manslaughter. But, the Supreme Court of Illinois reversed the judgments for the reasons above quoted, viz., that criminal responsibility is not imputable to a wrongdoer for the homicidal effect of a resisting officer’s accidental or unintentional killing of an innocent bystander.</p>

In order that one may be guilty of homicide, the act must be done by him actually or constructively, and that cannot be, unless the crime be committed by his own hand, or by the hands of some one acting in concert with him, or in furtherance of a common object or purpose. The defendants can in no sense be said to have aided or abetted John Young, for he was firing at them; and to hold them responsible criminally for the accidental death of a bystander, growing out of his bad aim, would be carrying the rule of criminal responsibility for the acts of others beyond all reason. Suppose, instead of killing an innocent bystander, Young [the proprietor of the house] had killed Moore, one of the robbers, would the [surviving robber] have been guilty of murder?” This query posed the very question present in the instant case, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals rhetorically answered it in the negative as follows: “And yet, if the principle sought to be maintained by the Commonwealth be sound, the survivor would necessarily be guilty of murder, because the owner of the house to be robbed had killed his companion, for he could just as truly be said to have aided and abetted the owner of the house in that case as in this.”</p>

As authority for this instruction, the trial judge relied upon a dictum in <em>Commonwealth v.

The jury convicted Almeida of first degree murder. In affirming the judgment of sentence, this court declared that an accidental or unintentional killing occurring during the perpetration of a robbery rendered those feloniously engaged in the robbery guilty of murder in the first degree even though the fatal wound was not inflicted by any of ,the felons or some one acting in their behalf. The rationale of this pronouncement lay in an adaptation of the doctrine of proximate cause (as known to the law of torts) to the common-law requirement of felony-causation as a prerequisite to the applicability of the felony-murder rule. Thus, this court’s opinion specifically avowed that “Our decision in the <em>Moyer-Byron </em>case was an application of the long established principle that he whose felonious act is the <em>proximate </em>cause <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>of another’s death is <em>criminally </em>responsible for that death and must answer to society for it exactly as he who is <em>negligently </em>the <em>proximate cause </em>of another’s death is <em>civilly </em>responsible for that death and must answer in damages for it.” As we have already seen, the “causation” requirement for responsibility in a felony-murder is that the homicide stem from the commission of the felony. Obviously, the assumed analogy between that concept and the tort-liability requirement of proximate cause is not conclusive. If it were, then the doctrine of supervening cause, which, for centuries, courts have recognized and rendered operative on questions of proximate cause, would have to be considered and passed upon by the jury. But, that qualification, the <em>Almeida </em>case entirely disregarded.</p>

And, in addition, the court <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>affirmed without qualification the defendants’ second, point for charge as follows: “The defendant is entitled to an acquittal unless the commonwealth has produced evidence of such a quality as to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the bullet causing the death of the deceased was fired from the gun of either of the defendants.” Furthermore, at the conclusion of the charge and after reading to the jury the above-mentioned point as affirmed, the trial judge, at the insistence of counsel for the defendants, repeated to the jury verbatim this same requested instruction. Naturally, neither Moyer nor Byron charged the trial judge with any error in regard to his instructions on the law concerning what was necessary for the jury to find, relative to who fired the fatal shot, before the defendants could be convicted of murder. Nor did the district attorney at any time argue or even intimate that the trial judge had charged the jury more favorably to the defendants than he should have. The indisputable fact is that the contention that it was <em>immaterial </em>who fired the fatal shot was never raised in the court below in the <em>Moyer and Byron </em>case. Consequently, the point required no discussion by this court. What was said in the <em>Moyer and Byron </em>opinion in such connection was, therefore, no more than an expression of the opinion writer’s individual view concerning a matter <em>coram non judice. </em>In the light of the trial court’s charge, the jury’s verdict in that case cannot be taken to mean otherwise than that the fatal bullet was fired by one of the felons in furtherance of their criminal conspiracy.</p>

Under the evidence, Flynn was either (1) an accomplice of Bolish who allegedly had planned the arson or (2) he was Bolish’s weak-minded tool who acted under the impulse of Bolish’s influence and domination. Thus, the malice essential to charging Bolish with murder Avas present either (1) <em>by imputation </em>under the felony-murder theory, if the death Avas found by the jury to haAe occurred as a result of confederate Flynn’s act in furtherance of the criminal conspiracy or (2) <em>expressly, </em>if Flynn was found to be merely a pliant dupe who acted on Bolish’s order in performing the criminal act Avith highly dangerous means which threatened grievous bodily harm to the actor.</p>

Fortunately, no one has suffered any penalty as a result of the holding in that case. Following our remand of the record in the <em>Thomas </em>case, the district attorney moved the trial court for leave to <em>nol pros </em>the murder indictment. The court approved the motion, and a <em>nolle prosequi </em>was duly entered. At the same time, the court accepted the defendant’s plea of guilty to an indictment charging him Avith armed rob<a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>bery of which he was unquestionably guilty and for which he was immediately sentenced and committed to the penitentiary where he is now serving his sentence.

Almeida. </em>As already indicated, <em>Almeida </em>was, itself an extension of the felony-murder doctrine by judicial decision and is not to be extended in its application beyond facts such as those to which it was applied. In short, the <em>Almeida </em>case was concerned with the killing, during the perpetration of a felony, of an innocent and law-abiding person by someone other than the felons or ones acting in aid of their criminal conspiracy. The evidence warranted a finding that it was an accidental killing by an officer of the law, but the felons were held accountable nonetheless on the basis of proximate causation regardless of who fired the fatal shot. In the present instance, the victim of the homicide was one of the robbers who, while resisting apprehension in his effort to escape, was shot and killed by a policeman in the performance of his duty. Thus, the homicide was justifiable and, obviously, could not be availed of, on any rational legal theory, to support a charge of murder. How can anyone, no matter how much of an outlaw he may be, have a criminal charge lodged against him for the consequences of the lawful conduct of another person? The mere statement of the question carries with it its own answer.</p>

Morris, <em>op. oit. supra? at </em>p. 56. In other words, if a felon can be held for murder for a killing occurring during the course of a felony, even though the death was not inflicted by one of the felons but by someone acting in hostility to them, it should make no difference to the crime of murder who the victim of the homicide happened to be. However, the factual difference, so noted, admits of a recognizable distinction with respect to a felon’s responsibility for an incidental killing (which another has committed), depending upon whether the homicide was justifiable or excusable, and such distinction serves the useful purpose of thwarting further extension of the rule enunciated in <em>Commonwealth v. Almeida </em>that it is immaterial who fires the fatal shot so long as the accused was engaged in a felony.</p>

However, even Blaekstone furnishes no authority for the majority’s opinion or conclusion. For example,, Blaekstone says that an accidental or unintentional homicide is an excusable homicide (§182, page <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>1580 et seq.). But Blaekstone then gives examples which demonstrate — and the majority opinion admits— that this statement or proposition of law did not mean then, and certainly does not mean today, that <em>all </em>accidental or unintentional, homicides are excusable. An excusable, i.e. an accidental or unintentional homicide was interpreted, even in Blackstone’s day and many times' since then in Pennsylvania,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_14" id="ref_footnote_3_14">*</a> not to mean or include an accidental or unintentional death <em>which arises out of or results from a homicide committed during a felony. </em>For example, Blaekstone says: “. . . if one intends to do another felony, and <em>undesignedly </em>kills a man, this is also murder”: IY Blackstone’s Commentaries, §§200-201, page 1599. lie then gives the classic illustration which has become hornbook law to every student, lawyer and Judge: “Thus, if one shoots at A. and misses him, but kills B., this is murder, [even though the killing of B. was unintentional and accidental] because of the previous felonious intent, which the law transfers from one to the other.” In other words, as Blaekstone points out, if A intends to shoot B but misses him and unintentionally kills a stranger, or if A, intending to commit any one of the crimes which were felonies at common law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_15" id="ref_footnote_3_15">**</a> accidentally and unintentionally kills a man, he is guilty of murder. This type of felonious homicide became known as felony murder, and as the majority opinion admits, was firmly imbedded in the common law even before Blackstone’s day.</p>

The majority, attempting to escape these inescapable facts, bases its opinion upon the syllogism: Blackstone holds that no one can be convicted for a justifiable killing and since it is justifiable for a policeman to kill a robber during the perpetration of a robbery, no one can be convicted of murder for killing one of the robbers.

      <em>results from the initial criminal act. </em>For any individual forcibly to defend himself or his family or his property from criminal aggression is a primal human instinct. It is the right and duty of both individuals and nations to meet criminal aggression with effective countermeasures. Every robber or burglar knows when he attempts to commit his crime that he is inviting dangerous resistance. Any robber or burglar who carries deadly weapons (as most of them do and as these robbers did) thereby reveals that he expects to meet and overcome forcible opposition. What this court said in Commonwealth v. LeGrand, <a href="/pa/336/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="336 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="1195614" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0511-01">336 Pa. 511</a>, 518, about burglars, applies equally to robbers: “Every burglar is a potential assassin and when his felonious purpose encounters human opposition his <em>intent to steal </em>becomes an <em>intent to Mil </em>and any weapon he finds at hand becomes a weapon of murder.” Every robber or burglar knows that a likely later act in the chain of events he inaugurates will be the use of deadly force against him on the part of the selected victim. <em>For whatever results follow from that natural and legal use of retaliating force, the felon must be held responsible. </em>For Earl Shank, the proprietor of a gas station in Eidley Township, Delaware County, which at 11 P.M. on July 13, 1946, was being attacked by armed robbers, to return the fire of these robbers with a pistol which he had at hand was as proper and as inevitable as it was for the American forces at Pearl Harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, to return the fire of the Japanese invaders. The Japanese felonious invasion of the Hawaiian Islands on that date was in law and morals the proximate cause of all the resultant fatalities. The Moyer-Byron felonious invasion of the Shank gas station on July 13, 1946, was likewise the proximate cause of the resultant fatality.</p>

In the first place, going all the Avay back to Blackstone, Blackstone says: “If a man, however, does such an act of which the probable consequence may be, and eventually is, death; such killing may be murder, although no stroke be struck by himself and no killing be primarily intended.” IY Blackstone’s Commentaries, §197, page 1594.</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[167,1648,1146,253]]]'>The second convincing answer is that a homicide may be justifiable qua a policeman or one defending his life or home, and felonious qua another person, for, as even Blackstone points out, it is murder to wantonly kill a felon.</p>

If the majority opinion is correct that a person cannot be guilty of murder in Pennsylvania, <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>for a so-called justifiable homicide, how can anyone be guilty of murder, as all authorities from Blackstone’s day until today agree — and the majority opinion admits — they can, for an accidental or unintentional homicide? All authorities, including the majority opinion, agree that malice is the essential, indispensable ingredient, the hall-mark of murder and that without the doctrine of implied or transferred malice there could not be any felony murder. It is absolutely indisputable that during a robbery <em>legal malice is present in all the robbers, irrespective of who fared the fatal shot or who was hilled! </em>That is one of the crucial touchstones which the majority have completely overlooked and without which the majority cannot build its house. How then, we repeat, is it possible to draw a logical or realistic or sound or legal distinction — so far as the crime of murder is concerned — between an unintentional or accidental killing in the perpetration of a robbery and what the majority opinion calls a justifiable killing in the perpetration of a robbery since in each case every robber possessed malice during the robbery and the attempted escape!</p>
