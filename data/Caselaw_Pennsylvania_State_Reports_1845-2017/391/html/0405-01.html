His gross estate exceeded $2,600,000 and had a net worth (after debts and administration expenses but before death taxes) of $2,450,000 which the decedent disposed of by a will executed approximately six months before Ms death.</p>
    <p id="b427-4" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[183,616,1146,824]]]'>The primary object of Mr. Wright’s testamentary bounty is Miss Ruth S. Spence, who served him as secretary for the last 31 years of his life. Under his will she is to receive a cash legacy of $75,000, stocks of a value at the date of the decedent’s death of $33,500, a life estate in a trust of other stock worth about $14,-000, the decedent’s house in Clearfield with its furnishings, his automobile and various tracts of coal lands. The largest beneficiaries under the will, in amount, are the two residuary charities, viz., Princeton College and University of Princeton, New Jersey, and the Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia, each of which is bequeathed a pre-residuary gift of $65,000 in stocks and one-half of the residuary estate as a memorial to the decedent who, incidentally, never went to college.</p>

Both Miss Spence and the residuary charities filed exceptions to the auditor’s report. The court dismissed all of the exceptions, confirmed the report and entered a final decree accordingly from which both Miss Spence and the residuary charities have severally appealed.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[252,679,1147,1258]]]'>The apportionment for which the residuary legatees argue would place the whole of the federal estate tax burden, amounting to $118,116.43, upon the individual legatees and devisee although $54,448.72 of such taxes was generated by the gifts (pre-residuary as well as residuary) to the charities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The effect of the residuary legatees’ contention, if adopted, would be that Miss Spence, to whom the testator willed cash, stocks, and realty of a total approximate value of $152,000, would receive but $74,758, the other $77,903 going for taxes, of which amount $30,437 represents federal estate tax attributable to the charitable gifts. The same relativity is equally true of all of the testator’s bequests <em>to individuals. </em>For example, a person bequeathed a legacy of $1,000 (the will actually contains ten such legacies) would receive but $490 net. Of course, these comparisons do not of themselves determine what the testator’s intent was with respect to the charge for death duties but the highly inequitable results, Avhich they portray, are relevant and material as depicting a situation Avhich, judging from the Avill as a Avhole, the decedent can hardly be thought to have intended.</p>

He had been well acquainted with the existence of taxation during his lifetime. It is stipulated of record that he “was highly successful, being at one time the largest shipper of coal” in the region, and that, upon withdrawing from the coal business in 1937, “thereafter his chief business activity consisted of managing his investments, which were composed mostly of high grade common stocks.” The supplemental record filed with these appeals upon stipulation of all counsel shows that the decedent’s executors paid $23,330.77 as his income tax liability for the five and one-half months of the year 1951 up to the time of his death on June 15th. His liability for a whole year’s income, on its graduated basis, must have been several times that amount.</p>

Section 16 of the Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521, as amended, 72 PS §2352, expressly so provides. The tax is on the beneficiary’s right of succession to, or the privilege of receiving, either by will or under the intestate law, property possessed by a decedent at his death: <em>Shugars v. Chamberlain Amusements Enterprises, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/284/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="284 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1092009" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0200-01">284 Pa. 200</a>, 205, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.%20426" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="130 A. 426">130 A. 426</a>.

Indeed, a decedent’s relief of his beneficiary from any deduction on account of state inheritance tax on his legacy may rest <em>solely </em>upon testamentary implication. The residuary appellants do not question <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>that. The important inquiry in any instance is whether the language of the will involved implies an intent to such effect.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[241,499,1150,1255]]]'>The requirement of a like testamentary direction or indication in order to place the burden of the federal estate taxes on the residuary estate grew out of this State’s first apportionment Act (1937), which was superseded and repealed by the present Estate Tax Apportionment Act of August 24, 1951, P. L. 1405. The Act of 1951, just as its predecessor had done, provides for the apportionment of the federal estate taxes among the persons interested in the property included in the gross estate but confirms to a testator the right to determine by his will how the federal taxes on his estate are to be borne. In construing the Act of 1937, this court held that its effect was to create a presumption (and the conception continues to obtain under the Act of 1951) that a testator intends to have the Act’s provisions apply to his estate, recognizing, however, that the presumption prevails “unless there is in the terms of the will some provision which is clearly inconsistent with such construction, and, when the will is construed as a whole, will override it.” <em>Harvey Estate, </em><a href="/pa/350/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="350 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="461145" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0053-01">350 Pa. 53</a>, 56, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20A.2d%20262" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="38 A.2d 262">38 A. 2d 262</a>; <em>Edwards Estate, </em><a href="/pa/377/0606-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="377 Pa. 606" data-case-ids="1249635" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0606-01">377 Pa. 606</a>, 608, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.2d%20312" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="105 A.2d 312">105 A. 2d 312</a>.</p>

It is a charge upon and is payable out of the general revenue of the estate.” Such was the applicable rule at the time of the creation by the Act of 1937 of the presumptive testamentary intent with respect to apportionment. Estate taxes had uniformly been paid out of and charged to the general funds of the decedent’s estate in the absence of testamentary direction otherwise: <em>Edwards Estate, </em>supra.

By Item 56 the testator empowered his executors “to borrow money to pay any debts or pay any taxes if [the executors] decide the time is not right for the selling of [testator’s] securities in paying [his] bequests and debts.” Finally, by Item 60, he devised and bequeathed his residuary estate in equal shares to the Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia, and Princeton College and University. The other numbered Items (57, 58 and 59) and the two unnumbered Items and concluding paragraph, have no bearing on the question of testamentary intent relative to the payment of death duties in the settlement of the decedent’s estate save for one of the unnumbered Items to which reference will hereinafter be made.</p>

Spence, his secretary, the sum of Seventy Five Thousand ($75,000.00) Dollars. By Item 2 he gave to a named bank in trust, 200 shares of Allied Chemical and Dye Co. common stock to pay the dividends therefrom to Miss Spence quarterly, for the duration of her life, with remainders over in the corpus <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>to tlie children of two. named individuals. The testator also devised to Miss Spence (Item 47) his one-half interest in certain coal lands; bequeathed to her (Item 48) his stock and all of his interest in a specified coal company; devised to her (Item 49) his other coal lands in Clearfield County; gave her (Item 52) his house and lot in Clearfield and by Item 53 all of the furnishings of his house, his automobile, and silverware of all kinds; by Item 54, he ordered and directed his executors to employ Miss Spence for a period of three years to do the clerical work in connection with the management and settlement of his estate at a salary of $200 per month and expenses; and, by Item 55, he gave and devised to her all his coal lands in Decatur Township, Clearfield County, and his lots in Hyde, Pennsylvania. It is not open to reasonable question that Miss Spence, was indeed, the primary object of Mr. Wright’s bounty. His concern for her and her future welfare, following her 31 years of faithful service in his employment down to the time of his death, stands out in the will in bold relief. Yet, although the decedent’s testamentary gifts to Miss Spence aggregated all told approximately $152,000, the residuary charities would take from that amount slightly more than half -toward paying the state and federal death-taxes including even the federal taxes on the gifts to the charities. As the will clearly indicates, that is not what the testator intended.</p>

Such was the form of the testamentary gift in no less than 21 separate Items including a legacy of $65,000 “in stocks at the market value at the time of [testator’s] death” to the Presbyterian Hospital of Philadelphia and a bequest in like amount and like terms to Princeton College and University. It was, moreover, the form of bequest utilized by the testator in his pre-residuary gifts to a number of other charities as well as in sixteen bequests to individuals in amounts ranging from $2,000 to $25,000. However, a bequest of so many dollars “in stocks at the market value at the time of [testator’s] death” was not the exclusive form of gift used by the testator. There are eighteen Items containing bequests to individuals of <em>sums </em>of money ranging variously from $1,000 to $4,000 in addition to the $75,000 bequest to Miss Spence in Item 1.</p>

He well recognized what he had done in such regard and had so intended. In the first unnumbered Item, immediately following Item 60, he expressly directed that “In every bequest of stock hereinabove contained, my Executors shall have the sole right to determine the nature and kind thereof to be delivered to the beneficiaries.” It is clear, therefore, that the bequests “in stocks” in fixed amounts were to be paid <em>in stocks </em>at a market value on a date certain. What, then, did the donative scheme of bequests “in stocks” <em>necessarily </em>import? It meant, for example, that, in the case of a gift of “Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars in stocks at the market value at the time of [testator’s] death”, the number of shares actually received by the beneficiary would be $5,000.00 worth, appraised according to the price and at the time testamentarily specified, <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>and not $4,500.00 worth of stock after deduction for the state inheritance tax or, even worse yet (in the case of an individual beneficiary), merely some $2,400.00 worth of stock, after further deduction for an apportionment charge for federal estate taxes.</p>

In its first 55 Items, the will contained the testator’s pecuniary legacies and specific bequests and devises with provisions which made impossible in many instances deductions therefrom if the testator’s clearly expressed benefactions were to be given the effect which his plain language contemplates. Following that, in Item 56, he correlated the payment by his executors of his debts and any taxes. The important thing here is the ascription of taxes to debts in the testator’s thinking. After the pecuniary legacies aud specific bequests and devises had been segregated, impliedly free of taxes, in the first 55 Items of the-will and payment of the'estate'debté; including <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>taxes, had been reckoned with in the 56th Item, what then remained of the testator’s property constituted the residue which he forthwith devised and bequeathed to the Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia and Princeton College and University, in equal shares.

In that case the testator’s will provided for (1) pecuniary legacies aggregating $235,000, each “subject to the payment of the Pennsylvania State Inheritance Tax”, (2) specific legacies in which it was provided that the tax thereon was to be paid out of residue, and (3) a residuary <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>legacy in trust, the income to be divided by the trustees after deducting taxes and legal expenses. The pecuniary legatees contended that since their legacies were expressly made “subject to the payment of the Pennsylvania State inheritance tax”, they were impliedly relieved from all other tax including the Federal estate tax. The Court rejected this contention, directed an apportionment of the Federal estate tax, and said (pages 56-57) : “. . .

With this contention we have no disagreement, but the statute creates a presumption which can only be overcome by clear language. When the statute is applied in this case, requiring each pecuniary legacy to pay its pro rata share of the federal tax, there appears no expression in .the will of any intent by the testator to impose the the full buiden of the federal tax on the residuary legatees in contravention of the statute.”</p>
