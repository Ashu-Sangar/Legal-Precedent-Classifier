The principal asset of the estate was an apartment house located at 3425-29 Powelton Avenue, Philadelphia, which was sold during the administration of the estate by order of the Orphans’ Court.</p>
    <p id="b605-9" data-blocks='[["BL_605.12",605,[161,1496,1146,601]]]'>During decedent’s lifetime the appellants managed the apartment house and collected the rents as decedent’s agents and they were continued in this capacity by the administrators.

The auditing judge <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>refused to compel an accounting upon the ground that the rents never came into the possession of the personal representative and were not registered in the name of the decedent or his nominee, hence the- Orphans’ Court had no jurisdiction. In a supplemental adjudication the auditing judge affirmed his prior ruling. Thereafter a unanimous court en banc, speaking through President Judge Charles Klein, while agreeing with the auditing judge’s conclusion that the question was not properly before the court on audit because the rents were neither included in the account nor received by the administrators, nevertheless concluded that the Orphans’ Court did have jurisdiction to compel the appellants to turn over the rents collected and directed the appellees to petition the court for a citation to issue to show cause why the rents should not be turned over to them.</p>
