    <blockquote id="b196-5" data-blocks='[["BL_196.7",196,[261,530,1144,319]]]'>“Plaintiff sued his employer’s compensation carrier: (1) for breach of his statutory duty to provide him with proper medical care, (2) for breach of its agent’s promise to provide him with proper medical care, and (3) for negligently breaching its duty to provide him with proper medical care.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b196-7" data-blocks='[["BL_196.9",196,[331,1089,845,47]]]'>“Defendant filed preliminary objections.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b196-8" data-blocks='[["BL_196.10",196,[259,1157,1145,373]]]'>“Plaintiffs sued once before, eodem nomine, at Common Pleas Court No. 7, September Term, 1955, No. 716, on the theory that defendant’s failure to provide medical care was malpractice, a tort independent of the original injury. Judge Sloans sustained preliminary objections and was affirmed by the Supreme Court- in 385 Pennsylvania 464 (1956).</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b196-9" data-blocks='[["BL_196.11",196,[259,1551,1144,368]]]'>“The only difference between the suit' in Common Pleas No. 7 and the instant suit is that counts in assumpsit have been added, the theory now being that defendant breached a contract to provide proper medical care. All three counts of the complaint, however, are expressly founded upon the compensation insurance.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b196-10" data-blocks='[["BL_196.12",196,[258,1948,1145,209]]]'>“We think that the effort to shift from trespass to assumpsit does not change the situation.
