The agreement provided for the continuation of the partnership for a term of five years and for a renewal term of five years should the partners mutually agree in writing to such extension. Although no agreement extending the original five year term was executed by the parties, Mancini and DeMarco continued to operate the pharmacy as if the agreement had been extended. It was on this theory that this case was argued before the court below and before us.</p>
    <p id="b179-4" data-blocks='[["BL_179.4",179,[161,957,1148,710]]]'>The agreement contains the folloiving paragraphs which are pertinent to this litigation: “16. Partners agree that they will each take out insurance upon their respective lives in such amount and with such companies as said partners shall mutually determine. The premiums to carry said insurance shall be paid for by the partnership out of the net income arising from the said partnership, and the said premiums shall be a liability of the said partnership.

Mancini died in 1956, and DeMarco continued the operation of the pharmacy by himself. The executrix of Marcini’s estate, Romana Cerceo, demanded an accounting from DeMarco for the decedent’s interest in the partnership. Upon DeMarco’s refusal, the executrix brought suit. DeMarco contended that by reason of paragraph eighteen of the agreement, the entire business became his property free from any duty to account to the Mancini estate. The lower court construed the partnership agreement as providing that the surviving partner was to acquire the partnership business only in the event that insurance was taken out in conformity with the agreement. Since no insurance was' purchased the court held that the defendant had a legal duty under the Uniform Partnership Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to account to the executrix of the estate of the deceased partner. From the <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>accounting decreed by the court below the defendant has appealed.</p>

Since there has been a failure of consideration, the defendant cannot obtain the partnership business under those provisions. HoAvever, the defendant asserts his claim under paragraph eighteen alone of the agreement which contains an unconditional statement that upon the death of one partner the partnership assets become the absolute property of the survivor.</p>
    <p id="b181-6" data-blocks='[["BL_181.6",181,[162,1295,1147,702]]]'>This claim is not well-founded. The insurance arrangement was designed to provide a method whereby the surviving partner and the heirs of the deceased partner would be protected in the event of a death. The first partner to die. would have provided benefits for such persons as he might wish by naming them beneficiaries of the insurance proceeds. The survivor would receive the assets of the partnership as the sole oAvner thereof. Having thoughtfully provided for mutual financial protection against the hazards of death it should not be. assumed that in the event no insurance were purchased the partners intended to gamble on who would die first.</p>
