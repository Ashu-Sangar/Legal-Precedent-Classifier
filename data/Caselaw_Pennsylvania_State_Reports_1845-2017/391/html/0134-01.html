There is no natural or vested right to seniority. Seniority arises only as a result of a contract express, or clearly implied: <em>Madera v. Monongahela Rwy.

    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[262,738,1145,1379]]]'>The lower Court found there was no contract for seniority, and even if there had been it would not prevent employer from discharging employee. However, the Court below overlooked the fact that plaintiff, in his amendment to his original complaint, averred: “Said employment contract between the plaintiff and defendant was oral in nature and the plaintiff does not recall the person employing him on behalf of the defendant, but avers that such hiring was done on or about October 16, 1939, as a member of the Group No. 2 Poster, and <em>it was then and there agreed between the parties that his seniority should begin to accrue on such roster from that date.”</em>

      </a>
      <em> </em>Plaintiff then averred a similar oral agreement when he was promoted from Group No. 1 to Group No. 2, and when he was promoted on June 5, 1953 to the Yard Masters Roster. Plaintiff attached as exhibits to his amended complaint rosters of employees with his name thereon, one of whose headings was “Seniority Standing”. These' averments, being averments of fact, are admitted by the preliminary objections, although plaintiff should have averred the position which the person who employed him occupied, especially since he could not recall his name, and that that person had authority from the defendant to promise and agree to seniority.</p>

These facts are very important because of defendant’s contention (a) that a Court of Common Pleas does not have jurisdiction of this suit, and (b) that the jurisdiction is under and limited to the Railway Labor Act, and (c) that plaintiff is clearly barred from bringing the present suit under the provisions of that Act, and under the relevant provisions of the Union’s collective bargaining agreement.</p>
