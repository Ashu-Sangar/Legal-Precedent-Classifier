      <em>Manning v. Yokas </em>was significant because, while many cases arising under the Act of 1854 had been heard by this Court during the past hundred years, <em>Manning v. Yokas </em>was the first to apply the Act to a situation where an accident occurred and the negligent driver of an automobile involved had been served intoxicants by the defendant sought to be held liable. <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>In that case, like this, a minor had been served intoxicants at the defendant Yokas’ hotel and afterward, while driving away from the hotel, the minor negligently drove across the center line into the opposite lane of a highway, crashing into the plaintiffs’ car. The court below similarly granted judgment n.o.v. as to the hotel proprietor, and on appeal we reversed. The tenor of our opinion made clear that an accident which occurred following the furnishing of intoxicants to the negligent driver, could properly be found by a jury to have resulted “in consequence of such furnishing”, and that the responsible tavern keeper could be held civilly liable under the Act of 1854. Clearly implicit in that opinion is the common knowledge that great numbers of persons, minors as well as adults, drive automobiles (too many of them, unfortunately, while intoxicated), and that it was well within the realm of foreseeability that one illegally served with intoxicants might negligently drive an automobile and cause injury to persons or property.</p>

Yokas </em>opinion, the trial court in the instant case opined: “The injury must be the natural and probable consequence of the negligence — such a consequence as under the surrounding circumstances in the case might or ought to have been foreseen by the wrongdoer as likely to follow through his act: . . . Theré is no evidence whatsoever that Foster showed any signs of intoxication while in the Besnecker Restaurant. There is not the-slightest evidence that Besnecker knew that Foster owned an automobile, or had a motor vehicle which <em>hej </em>would be likely to drive. After careful consideration of all of the evidence we are of the opinion that it could not be reasonably anticipated or foreseen when the sale of the beer took place that Foster would become intoxicated, drive áñ automobile, and become <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>involved in a fatal accident more than an hour later and six miles away from the premises. To hold otherwise would, in effect, make the restaurant keeper an insurer against all accidents which might happen subsequent to the sale of the intoxicating beverage. It, therefore, appears that the accident is too remote from the alleged illegal act to cause civil responsibility to arise.”</p>
    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[280,795,1148,1428]]]'>It is clear from the above portion of the trial court’s opinion, that the reasons for which it granted judgment n.o.v. were reasons which we found insufficient in <em>Manning v. Yokas, </em>supra. Factually this case is almost indistinguishable from <em>Manning v. Yokas. </em>A minor was served intoxicants in violation of the Pennsylvania alcoholic beverage laws, and while intoxicated drove his automobile negligently, causing an accident. In the <em>Manning </em>case, it is true, the time between the minor’s departure from the hotel until the accident, was only the short time it took to go nine blocks; while in the instant case (considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, which we must do upon motion for judgment n.o.v.) the accident took place about an hour and a half after the minor had his last drink at the restaurant. This time difference does not make the cases distinguishable. It is common knowledge that one often has much less control over his faculties in the hours following alcoholic imbibing than at the time the drinks are actually consumed. It takes some time before the alcohol “hits”. It certainly cannot be said as a matter of law that as to an accident which is found to have been caused by the intoxication of a driver, a jury could not find that the intoxication resulted from drinks taken one or two hours before the collision.</p>

      <em>v. Yokas </em>ruling, arguing that in that case we did not consider whether the serving of the minor had been a <em>wilful </em>violation in terms of Section 1 of the Act of May 8, 1854, supra, which reads: “That wilfully furnishing intoxicating drinks by sale, gift or otherwise to any person of known intemperate habits, to a minor, or to an insane person for use as a beverage shall be held and deemed a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof the offender shall be fined not less than ten nor more than fifty dollars, and undergo an imprisonment of not less than ten nor more than sixty days, and the wilful furnishing of intoxicating drinks as a beverage to any person when drunk or intoxicated shall be deemed a misdemeanor, punishable as aforesaid.” This contention is based on the view that the violation which is a prerequisite to civil liability under Section 3 of the Act of 1854, must necessarily be a violation of the aforestated Section 1. This is not the case, as a reading of the Act will make obvious. Section 3 clearly states: “That any person furnishing intoxicating drinks to any other person in violation <em>of any existing law, </em>or of the provisions of this acts [sic], shall be held civilly responsible . . .”</p>

Section 3 obviously intended to permit a civil recovery to persons injured as a result of the unlawful furnishing of intoxicating drinks, in addition to whatever criminal penalties might be imposed therefor. The terms of the Act contemplate that statutory changes would be made from time to time. The last clause of Section 3 provides that recovery may be had by action on the case, “instituted in any court having jurisdiction of such form of action in this Commonwealth.” There <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>is no doubt that the Legislature was fully cognizant of which courts had jurisdiction in actions on the case in 1854, but, understanding that the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth’s courts is changed from time to time, the Legislature in these terms showed its intention to malee this remedy available to future litigants regardless of jurisdictional changes. And Section 6 of the Act of 1854, wherein provision is made for a payment not exceeding twenty dollars to persons prosecuting offenses under the Act, states: “. . . such allowance to be exclusive of compensation to such prosecutor as a witness <em>under existing laws. . </em>(Emphasis supplied). Here obviously, the section means to award a special allowance in the nature of a reward to encourage prosecutions, and intends that allowance to be in addition to whatever compensation the prosecutor would be allowed as a witness under the laws governing the appearance of witnesses <em>at the time the section is invoked, </em>and not at the time of enactment.</p>

While this general rule of statutory construction is well settled and recognized by judicial decisions as well as by text writers, yet it is equally well established as a rule of statutory construction that where the reference in an adopting statute is to the law generally which governs the particular subject, and not to any specific act or part thereof designated in the adopting act, the reference means the law at the time the exigency arises as to which the law is to be applied. We have frequently recognized this distinction and applied the rule that where the reference in an adopting statute is to the law generally upon any subject, the adopting statute means the law in force on the subject at the time it is invoked: In re Yernon Park, <a href="/pa/163/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="163 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="859063" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0070-01">163 Pa. 70</a>; Kugler’s App., <a href="/pa/55/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="55 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1470721" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0123-01">55 Pa. 123</a>____”</p>

Foster’s account of the accident was that he was driving along the highway at about twenty-five or thirty miles per hour straddling the white line, and that the first thing he knew about the accident was when he saw the victim on the hood and fender of his car.
