Phelps met in Philadelphia in April, 1951 and discussed the possibility of jointly engaging in an enterprise to secure leases upon lands in Pennsylvania for the purpose of drilling thereon for gas and oil. This discussion led to the formulation of the following plan: (1) a search would be made by them for lands having gas and/or oil potentialities; (2) in the event such lands were located, then they would negotiate with the owner or owners thereof for a lease for a limited time period within which to drill for gas and oil; (3) upon negotiation of a lease, then they would secure a drilling company to perform the actual drilling on the lands; (4) in the event that gas and/or oil were located, then the landowner and the <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>drilling company would enter into an agreement under which the landowner would share with the drilling company on a percentage basis the royalties realized from the production of gas and/or oil. Oldham and Phelps would receive for their services from the drilling company a cash bonus plus an “override” royalty, i.e., a share of the royalties received by the drilling company. To execute this plan, Oldham and Phelps agreed to form a group to be known as the Phelps Prospecting Company (herein called Phelps Prospecting), and to finance Phelps Prospecting, at least initially, Phelps was to solicit funds from his family and their friends.</p>

Oldham, having learned of this advertisement, wrote a letter to an Attorney Silhol, the Club’s attorney, inquiring about a possible lease.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Subsequently, Phelps, at Oldham’s suggestion, met with Attorney Silhol. Negotiations between Old-ham, Phelps and Attorney Silhol culminated in the execution of a lease between the Club and Phelps Prospecting. The principal provisions of this lease, <em>executed by Oldham on behalf of Phelps Prospecting, </em>were: (1) Phelps Prospecting received the right to enter upon the Club’s land “to explore upon said land for the possibility of oil and/or gas production” for a six month period, with the right of renewal for an additional like period; (2) Phelps Prospecting agreed to secure responsible parties to lease the land to drill for oil and/or gas; (3) from such drilling company the Club would receive one-eighth (%) of all royalties realized from gas and/or oil produced from the land; (4) the drilling company was to drill a minimum of three wells; (5) Phelps Prospecting would secure com<a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>pensation for its services from the drilling company and not from the Club.</p>

Negotiations between Keta, Phelps, Oldham and Attorney Silhol finally resulted in the execution of an agreement between Keta and the Club.

Great Eastern contends that throughout all the negotiations, both with the Club and Keta, Oldham and Phelps acted as its agents, that the “override” royalty belonged to it, that appellees knew that Great Eastern owned the “override” royalty and, by their actions, confirmed Great Eastern’s acquisition of it from Keta. On the other hand, appellees contend that they, as the group constituting Phelps Prospecting, were entitled to the “override” royalty, that Oldham and Phelps acted as <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>their agents and that they neither knew of, consented to nor ratified the acquisition of this asset by Great Eastern.</p>

An examination of the record indicates an affirmative answer to this question. When Oldham and Phelps conceived the formation of Phelps Prospecting they contemplated the inclusion of other persons in the enterprise. They solicited monetary contributions from appellees — other than Phelps himself — in the name of Phelps Prospecting and deposited these contributions in an account from which expenditures were made in that name. It was appellees’ money which paid for all the outward indicia of the existence of Phelps Prospecting — an office sign, stationery, etc., —as well as Phelps’ salary and the traveling expenses of both Oldham and Phelps during the negotiations with both the Club and Keta. The Negotiations with the Club by Oldham and Phelps were conducted in the name of Phelps Prospecting and concluded in an agreement to which Phelps Prospecting was stated to be one of the contracting parties. The negotiations conducted by Oldham and Phelps with Keta resulted in <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>the payments of a $3000 bonus to Pbelps Prospecting. A review of all the actions of Oldham and Phelps from April to November, 1951 clearly indicates that both not only acknowledged the existence of an enterprise known as Phelps Prospecting, but also that both acted under its aegis. While both Oldham and Phelps contributed their services it was the capital contributed by the appellees — with the exception of Phelps — which paid the former’s traveling expenses and the latter’s traveling expenses and salary. The exclusion of appellees from the enterprise known as Phelps Prospecting would place their monetary contributions in the category of loans or gifts- — a status without basis on this record. The acts and conduct of the parties establish the required intent and contractual basis for inclusion of appellees in a joint venture; the record justifies the conclusion that there was both an expressed and implied understanding that appellees were to share in the profits of the venture; the fact that the active operation of the enterprise was in the hands of Oldham and Phelps did not detract from the proprietary interest which appellees had in the venture. The evidence is clearly sufficient to justify the chancellor’s finding that appellees were members of a joint venture known as Phelps Prospecting. Appellants’ contention in this respect finds no support of record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a>

In all the negotiations with the Club and Keta these men held themselves out as representing Phelps Prospecting. The agreement between the Club and Phelps Prospecting was executed by Oldham for the latter. Part of the negotiations, at least, were carried on by correspondence on Phelps Prospecting stationery. Insofar as the Club and Keta were concerned Great Eastern was unmentioned until the time came for the assignment of the “override” royalty. Particularly significant is Oldham’s letter to Phelps dated September 3, 1952: “As you know I have done nothing to help out as far as Phelps Prospecting Co. goes since the first of the year [subsequent to the date of securing the Club land and the override agreement] as you and I could not agree on the actual leasing of properties. I did not feel that we should lease properties unless we were in a position to drill. <em>I felt that we should just act as agents as we started out to do </em>... . I don’t like the idea of going out and acting as Agents of the Great Eastern Gas Corp., but I have taken some acreage that way just lately, but <em>it toas much better the way we started to take it under the name of the Phelps Prospecting Co.” </em>(Emphasis supplied). These two men held themselves out, by their acts, conduct and writings, as agents acting for the enterprise known as Phelps Prospecting: no other rational explanation of their conduct during the period from April to November, 1951 can be given.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">21</a> A reading of this record reveals the lack of any merit to this contention.</p>

The master plan of this joint venture — -formulated by Oldham and Phelps— was to secure land leases, arrange to have the land drilled and, in the event gas and/or oil were located, to secure from the drilling company both a bonus and an override royalty. For this purpose, Avith Oldham’s full knowledge, appellees — Avith the exception of Phelps —contributed their money; Oldham and Phelps, their services. The only transaction of the venture which came to fruition was the Club lease followed by the Neta agreement; throughout the negotiations Avhich led to the successful conclusion of this transaction Great Eastern was unknown and not within the contemplation of the parties — Avith the exception of Oldham. When the negotiations were complete, the most valuable acquisition of the venture — the “override” royalty — Avas turned over to a stranger to the transaction, Great Eastern, in which Oldham was the largest stockholder and controlling figure. <em>That this was done at Oldham’s suggestion and without the hnowledge or consent of the appellees </em>— with <em>the possible exception of Phelps </em>— is <em>beyond dispute. </em>By this assignment Old-ham’s OAvn company acquired a valuable asset toward the acquisition of Avhich it had made no contribution. Oldham, occupying a dual capacity, was under a duty to fully disclose and reveal to the appellees that Great Eastern, rather than Phelps Prospecting, had acquired the “override” royalty, particularly when the assignee was a corporation under his control; his failure in this respect stigmatizes not only the action but the entire transaction. A review of this record reveals á clear violation of Oldham’s fiduciary duty to appellees and fully justifies the chancellor’s finding that Old-ham perpetrated a fraud. That Oldham is not a party to this record is immaterial; he was the instrument <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>through which misappropriation of this valuable asset took place and his actions vitiate the entire transaction.</p>

The record furnishes no support for this argument. In the first place, appellants take the position that Oldham was not acting as appellees’ agent in the Phelps Prospecting venture; if that be true, then the doctrine of ratification is inapplicable because the act to be ratified must have been done at its inception on behalf of the principal: <em>Edwards v. Heralds of Liberty, </em><a href="/pa/263/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="263 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1047503" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0548-01">263 Pa. 548</a>, 554, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20A.%20324" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="107 A. 324">107 A. 324</a>; Restatement, Agency, §85; 2 Am. Jur. Agency, §222; Mechem on Agency, §386 et seq. Even if the doctrine of ratification were applicable, ratification can only have taken place if the appellees were in possession of all the material facts and if they acted with such knowledge. Mr. Justice Chtdsey, speaking for the Court, in <em>Schwartz v. Mahoning Valley Country Club, </em><a href="/pa/382/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="382 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1259946" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0138-01">382 Pa. 138</a>, 142, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20A.2d%2078" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="114 A.2d 78">114 A. 2d 78</a>, stated: “The question of ratification could not arise in the absence of proof that the members had full knowledge of all the material facts and circumstances attending the transaction intended to be ratified, for the doctrine presupposes knowledge of such facts. . . .” The burden to establish ratification and thus knowledge on the part of appellees of all the material facts was upon the appellants, a burden which they have failed to sustain: <em>Baldwin, to use, v. Loesel, </em><a href="/pa/333/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="333 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1187877" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0026-01">333 Pa. 26</a>, 32, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20389" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="3 A.2d 389">3 A. 2d 389</a>. To establish knowledge of the material facts on the part of appellees appellants relied on certain evidence arising out of the relationship of appellees as stockholders of Great Eastern: stockholders’ notices, actions taken and statements made at stock<a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>holders’ meetings, ownership and voting of stock by appellees, etc. There is no evidence that knowledge of the fact that Great Eastern rather than Phelps Prospecting owned the “override” royalty was brought home to the appellees. Absent proof that appellees knew of the assignment of the “override” royalty by Neta to Great Eastern there could be no ratification of such assignment. The chancellor heard and saw the witnesses and reached the conclusion that appellees neither ratified the assignment of the “override” royalty nor were they estopped from questioning this assignment. There was sufficient evidence upon which to justify his findings and conclusions in this respect.</p>
