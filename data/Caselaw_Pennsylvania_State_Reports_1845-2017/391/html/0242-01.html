The basic allegations supporting this contention as set forth in the complaint are: (1) that the Domino Lane site would cost in excess of $300,000 more per year to construct, maintain and operate than an equivalent incinerator at the Fox Street location; (2) that the City would be compelled to expend substantial sums to purchase the Domino Lane site, whereas it already owns the Fox Street site; (3) that by acquiring private land in the Domino Lane area a loss of tax revenue now received from that land would occur to the detriment of the City; (4) that in order to utilize the Domino Lane site the City would be compelled “to widen, relocate and improve the streets in the vicinity” in order to provide adequate access to it; and (5) that funds would have to be expended by the City for contracts, drawings, etc., in connection with the proposed construction of the incinerator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

John S. Byrne, the owner of a tract of land amounting to slightly over twenty-nine acres, of which some twenty-threé are to be condemned by the City for the proposed Domino Lane incinerator, testified that he purchased the entire tract early in 1956 for $25,000, and that the real estate taxes for the entire tract are “around $600”. The plaintiff Parker testified that several of the roads in the area were not paved, that there is a house in the vicinity of 2,000 feet from the proposed incinerator, and that there are two other homes, which are in bad condition, closer to the proposed site, “. . .

The City had considerable misgivings as to the probative value of this evidence — the statistical basis being several years old and the contemplated collection areas in the two cases being somewhat dissimilar-- — but the court below assumed arguendo that operation of the Domino Lane site would be somewhat more expensive than the Fox Street site, and this assumption may also be made for ■purposes of this appeal. The chancellor determined that the only evidence of waste in the record was this disparity in operating costs, and decided.that this factor alone was insufficient to permit the grant of a preliminary injunction against a presumptively valid city ordinance.

Standing alone, a mere showing of a higher prospective operating cost of one incinerator site as compared to another, in the absence of fraud or similar impropriety, provokes the conclusion that there were other presumably valid reasons for the selection of the approved site by the responsible City officials and the enactment- of the necessary legislation by the City Council. Prospective land utilization, contemplated neighborhood developments, anticipated population shifts, estimated traffic congestion, the effect of incinerator construction on the existing neighbors — all these — are pertinent considerations for the City Council, and indeed it would probably be remiss if those factors were not considered by it in the enactment of the ordinance. It is, of course, to be presumed that municipal officers have properly acted for the public good, <em>Campbell et al. v.

There is no allegation, nor even an implication, in this case that the City officials acted from some improper or fraudulent motive. This case is wholly unlike the waste and misappropriation eases cited by appellants in their brief. There is no conspiracy “to defraud the city into paying an excessive <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>price for the property” as was alleged in <em>White et al. v.

In the instant case there is no question but that the City is authorized to build necessary incinerators, and purchase land and materials therefor from the proper owners, nor is there the slightest implication that fraud or other unlawful gain or conspiracy has motivated the City Council’s action. It is not sufficient that appellants disagree with the <em>wisdom </em>of the City Council’s action. A court of equity will not substitute its determination of what may be wise for the decision of the appropriate governmental body, absent a showing of bad faith, abuse of power, etc. See <em>Blumenschein v.

The <em>Blumenschein </em>case, supra, is particularly apposite here, because in that action to enjoin the Housing Authority from taking certain properties for a public housing project it was alleged, among other things, that the selection of one site was “arbitrary and constituted an abuse of discretion on the part of the Authority” because another site would be more appropriate for several reasons, among them that the other site would involve a lower cost. Chief Justice Horace Stern's language at pp. 572, 573, is especially appropriate here:</p>

      <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>“. . . Indeed, whatever may be said of the merits or demerits of the site selected by the Housing Authority, plaintiffs wholly misconceive the extent of the judicial power to review the exercise of the Authority’s discretion confided to it by the Legislature of the Commonwealth. The selection of a site for a large housing project necessarily involves many considerations; it is largely a question of practical judgment, common sense and sound discretion. By a host of authorities in our own and other jurisdictions it has been established as an elementary principle of law that courts will not review the actions of governmental bodies or administrative tribunals involving acts of discretion, in the absence of bad faith, fraud, capricious action or abuse of poAver; they Avill not inquire into the wisdom of such actions or into the details of the manner adopted to carry them into execution. It is true that the mere possession of discretionary power by an administrative body does not make it Avholly immune from judicial review, but the scope of that review is limited to the determination of whether there has been a manifest and flagrant abuse of discretion or a purely arbitrary execution of the agency’s duties or functions. That the court might have a different opinion or judgment in regard to the action of the agency is not a sufficient ground for interference; <em>judicial </em>discretion may not be substituted for <em>administrative </em>discretion. . . .”</blockquote>

Furthermore, it is quite possible that its retention by the City for other civic purposes would result in a substantial long-run saving to the City. A publicly owned housing development and a reservoir and water treatment plant stand very near to the Fox Street site. It is idle for us to speculate as to the use City Council contemplates for that tract, but certainly an expansion of the water or housing use, or the erection of a playground or other facility on that land would be a determination for Council to make and one • with which this Court will not interfere.</p>

To a contention that the City already had land for airport and allied purposes, Mr. Justice Sadler answered, p. 275: “The amendment to the bill, filed since the argument, requires but a brief notice.

Indeed plaintiffs’ evidence indicates, that street improvements are needed in the Domino Lane area, regardless of the proposed incinerator construction. This is borne out by <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>the City’s answer which alleges that this street construction would be undertaken regardless of the incinerator site “to remedy a presently inadequate system of streets and highways in the area. This program is long overdue and is necessary to the residential and industrial growth of the area.” . At any rate, such street construction is merely ancillary to the proposed incinerator construction. Certainly if the City may properly locate an incinerator in the Domino Lane area, it not only may, but properly should provide the needed access to the site. A portion of the expense of such construction might well be considered in connection with the total cost of the incinerator, but absent an evidentiary showing of the cost of such street construction and the proportion of that cost which should properly be allocated to the incinerator, and absent a showing that the construction of streets in the area is in some way improper, a court cannot be called upon to declare that a civic project should be enjoined simply because the streets in the area may have to be improved or extended as a result of the proposed project. Furthermore, it is again a complete answer to this contention that in the absence of a showing, of fraud, bad faith, etc., the determination of the proper location for streets and the necessity of improvements thereto are decisions well within the City Council’s discretion.</p>

It must be obvious that these expenses would be incurred wherever an incinerator were located, and it cannot be seriously contended that such expenses, when necessary to valid civic projects, are improper.</p>
