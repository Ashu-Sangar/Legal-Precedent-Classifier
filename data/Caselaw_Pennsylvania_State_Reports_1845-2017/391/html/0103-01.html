The County of Allegheny brought in, pursuant to petition and order of the Court, the Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland, which was surety on the bid bond.

On June 27, 1950, A. J.

The bond was to remain in effect (1) in the event of the witlidraAval of. the bid within the sixty (60) days, and (2) upon failure of Colella to enter into a contract with the County, accompanied by a performance bond (in a much larger amount), and (3) upon failure of Colella to pay the difference betAveen the bid amount and the amount which the County would be forced to pay for the Avork if Colella defaulted.</p>

The County refused this request and on July 11, 1950 awarded the contract to Colella at its bid price of $144,900; and by letter dated July 12, 1950 the County notified Colella of the award and- requested Colella to enter into the contract and execute all other documents in accordance with the requirements of the bid.</p>

The Chancellor further found, and we believe correctly, that when the sealed bids were opened the County of Allegheny was not aware, nor did it have any knowledge of any clerical mistake in Colella’s bid. Two questions arise: (1) was Colella entitled to a withdrawal of its bid and cancellation of its bid bond, and (2) if not, is Colella’s liability and its surety’s liability limited to the amount of the bond, namely, $17,500 as liquidated damages, or <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>to the actual loss suffered by Allegheny County as a result of the bidder’s default, namely, $89,100.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a>

What is the use or purpose of a sealed bid if the bidder does not have to be bound by what he submits under seal? What is the use or purpose of requiring a surety bond as further protection for the public, i.e. the municipality, if a bidder can withdraw his bid under plea of clerical mistake, whenever he sees that his bid is so low that he must have made an error of judgment?</p>

Pomeroy thus states the law, page 388: “However, equitable relief by way of rescission may be given if the mistake relates to a material feature of the contract; if it is of such grave consequence that enforcement of the contract as made will be unconscionable, if it occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary diligence by the party making the mistake, and if the other party can be put in status quo, Equity will grant relief.” The latter two conditions are not present in the instant case.</p>

In other words, it is clear and we believe it is conceded by the County that the amount of recovery <em>on the bid bond </em>is limited to the amount of the bid bond, and not to the amount of loss resulting from failure to execute and perform a contract.</p>

On this important issue, the Court below found: “In the letting of contracts such as were proposed and here involved two bonds are required — first, a bidder’s bond which the bidder files in connection with his bid. -If a contract' <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>is awarded to the bidder in connection with the execution of his formal contract for the performance of the work, <em>a second bond in a much larger </em>amount, which is called a <em>performance bond, </em>is then filed.” What would be the use and purpose of requiring a <em>performance </em>bond in a much larger amount than the bid bond, <em>if the contractor’s bid </em>and/or his accompanying bid bond were intended by the parties to subject him to <em>all </em>losses which were sustained by the County as a result of re-letting a contract for the work in question? Because these two bonds were required — covering apparently the exact situation which has arisen — isn’t it more reasonable and equitable (because of possible clerical or human errors which would result in losses far beyond the contemplation of the parties) to hold that the parties <em>intended </em>the bid bond to constitute liquidated damages and limit the County’s recovery thereto, if the contractor failed to subsequently enter into a formal contract and give a performance bond for the work in question?</p>
