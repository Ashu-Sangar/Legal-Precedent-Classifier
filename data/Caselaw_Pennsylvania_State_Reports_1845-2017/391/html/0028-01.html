The sub-basement extended under the building to a depth of approximately 20 feet and was divided into four separate rooms. One side of each room was unenclosed, and the rooms could be entered only from the unenclosed sides. Finished lumber and building materials were stored in these rooms and in the rear of the basement which was partitioned from the rest of the basement.

All the companies refused their claim. Plaintiffs on March 11, 1955, instituted separate suits, (consolidated for trial), against the several insurance companies in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County. The cases were tried on the following theories: (1) that the word “sheds” is broad enough to encompass within its meaning the basement structures at the bottom of the concrete block and frame building; (2) that though the contracts of insurance are apparently clear, when an attempt is made to apply their terms to the existing situation an ambiguity arises in that the word “sheds” could apply equally to the basement structures or to the small building in the open yard or to both; that a latent ambiguity having thus developed, evidence is admissible to denote the exact reference intended by the parties to be attributed to the word “sheds”; (3) that through fraud, accident or mistake coverage of the materials in the basements was not included in the insurance contracts and that, therefore, the contracts should be reformed to include such coverage.</p>

Simple words of common usage in a policy of insurance will be construed in their natural, plain and ordinary sense. <em>Blue Anchor Overall Co. v. Pennsylvania Lumbermens Mutual Ins. </em>Co., <a href="/pa/385/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="385 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1267085" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0394-01">385 Pa. 394</a>, 397, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.2d%20413" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="123 A.2d 413">123 A. 2d 413</a> (1956). It has not been suggested that the word “sheds” is a word of art or that it is not a simple word of common usage. We therefore construe it in its natural, plain and ordinary sense. The trial judge in his charge to the jury, quoting from numerous standard dictionaries,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> stated: “the word ‘shed’, is defined as ‘a <em>slight </em>structure built for shelter or storage; ... a lean-to, or separate building open in front, an outbuilding, a hut, as a wagon shed.’ ... ‘A small building <em>slightly </em>constructed and of simple form, usually one story high, and often <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>with front or front and sides open; also a lean-to, as a wagon- shed.’ <em>... ‘A slight </em>or <em>temporary </em>building; a large open structure for <em>temporary </em>storage of goods, as a shed on a wharf, a railway shed, a sheep shed, cattle shed.’” (Emphasis supplied). The dictionary’s definition is consistent with the general usage of the word “sheds” and both are denotive of an unsubstantial structure created for a temporary purpose. Such a definition is wholly inapplicable to the basements of a permanent concrete block and frame two-story warehoiise. Aside from the literal definition the word “sheds” is in no sense suggestive of the basements of a concrete and frame building even though the basements may be open on one side.</p>

    <p id="b55-5" data-blocks='[["BL_55.4",55,[188,566,1146,544]]]'>The second theory of the plaintiffs is that the insurance contracts contain a latent ambiguity arising from the fact that while the original policies issued in 1951 used the plural “sheds” there, in fact, existed at that time only <em>one </em>shed in the open yard. From this circumstance the plaintiffs contend that the court below properly admitted evidence showing whether the word “sheds” was intended by the parties to cover the basement store rooms and correctly submitted this issue to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b55-6" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[183,1124,1149,933]]]'>We are unable to agree. A latent ambiguity arises from extraneous or collateral facts which make the meaning of a written instrument uncertain although the language thereof be clear and unambiguous. <em>Metzger’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/222/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="222 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="959417" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0276-01">222 Pa. 276</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20A.%2096" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="71 A. 96">71 Atl. 96</a> (1908).

The effect of the policies is simply to insure the one existing shed and, further, to cover any other sheds which might be erected during the life of the policies to a total value of $60,000. If a policy of insurance were drawn to cover “horses” and the insured had but one horse at the time, certainly no such ambiguity would arise as would permit testimony that the policy was meant to cover the insured’s cow as well. Simply because the plural “sheds” was used when- only one shed existed is not a sufficient reason for permitting evidence to be introduced in order to show that a structure which is clearly not a shed is a shed within the meaning of the contract on the theory that latent ambiguity exists.</p>

Certainly there are not that many differences between a shed as described by the Majority and the basement stalls described by the plaintiffs’ witnesses. Cows and horses have no similarity except that they are both quadrupeds, they have no common feature except that they are equally exploited by man, they have no social resemblance to each other except that they both feel at home in a stall or shed.

A high wall obstructs movement along this path of reasoning. When the policies were written, there was, as already mentioned, only one outside shed in existence. Why, then, it is necessary to ask again, did the policies speak of sheds? The Majority Opinion attempts to surmount and pass over this wall by explaining further: “The meaning of the policies is simply that the one existing shed was insured and, further, that any other sheds which might be erected during the life of the policy would also be covered to a total value of |60,000.”</p>

If a man has one natural child and one stepchild and takes out insurance on two children, the obvious conclusion would be that he meant to insure the lives of both the natural child and the stepchild.

Under such a construction the insurance company could find itself in a serious actuarial predicament if the man and wife were healthy and prolific procreators and capable of bringing into being another dozen offspring. Similarly, would the defendant companies in the case at bar, as the Majority Opinion suggests, have insured blindly all sheds that Easton might have erected <em>after </em>the signing of the contract? Isn’t it more likely, more reasonable and more in keeping with business regularity to assume that the insurance companies contracted to cover what was in existence <em>at the time of the signing of the </em>contract?
