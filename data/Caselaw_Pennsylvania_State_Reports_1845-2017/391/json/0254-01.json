        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nWe are called upon to determine the validity of an order of Common Pleas Court No. .4 of Philadelphia affirming a decision of th\u00e9 appellee Philadelphia Zoning Board of Adjustment (hereinafter called Zoning Board) which granted a us\u00e9 v\u00e1riane\u00e9 to appellee, Sait-. to Company, permitting it to use the first floor of a property located at 1809-1811 Spruce Street, Philadelphia \u2014 an \u201cF\u201d residential district- \u2014 as an interior decorator\u2019s office. This property \u2014 owned by Sirdav Realty Company and leased to appellee Saitto \u2014 consists of two four-story row buildings, the upper three stories of which \u00e1re used for residential purposes. The first story was \u00fcsed as a dentist\u2019s office up until 1936, then as a doctor\u2019s office, and, since February 1956, appellee Saitto has used it as an interior decorator\u2019s office.\nThe area may be termed \u201cresidential-professional\u201d. The buildings in the block are three or four story, the upper stories being used for residential purposes and approximately fifty per cent of the first stories being used as professional offices. At the northwest and northeast corners of the block, respectively, ar\u00e9 a one-story delicatessen store and a multi-story medical building and drug store. At the southeast and southwest corners of the block are \u00e1 multi-storied apartment house and a church. In the 1700 and 1900 blocks of Spruce Street the buildings have both a commercial and/or office usage.\nAppellee Saitto leased the instant premises on February 1, 1956. The written lease, providing for a monthly rental of $125.00, is for a five-year term and contains a clause expressly stating that the lessor does not., warrant that lessee will .be able to obtain a zoning permit for the proposed use . and that, even though a permit e\u00e1nnot be obtained, the lease will not be terminated.- Appellee Saitto spent.-approximately $1300-$1400 making repairs on the premises; on the outside of the building is a sign reading \u201cThe Saitto Co., Interior Design, Antiques, Furniture\u201d.\nAppellee Saitto applied for a permit to use the premises as an interior decorator\u2019s office but its application was refused.\nOn appeal to the Zoning Board where a use variance was requested, the Zoning Board, after a hearing, granted \u201ca permit for Use of the premises for an eight-family dwelling and \u2018A Decorator\u2019s Office for Consultation only and Flush Wall Sign not to exceed 100 sq. in.\u2019 \u201d Appellant, representing himself and other property owners on Spruce Street, appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. After taking additional testimony, the Court below affirmed the Zoning Board\u2019s decision on the ground that the Board had not committed any abuse of its discretion. From that decree this appeal was taken.\nEven though additional testimony was taken, the Court below considered that the question before it was whether or not the Zoning Board had committed an abuse of its discretion. With that position we cannot agree. Having taken additional testimony it was the court\u2019s duty to determine the case on its merits rather than on the issue whether the Board had committed a manifest abuse of discretion: Garbev Zoning Case, 385 Pa. 328, 335, 122 A. 2d 682; Volpe Appeal, 384 Pa. 374, 121 A. 2d 97. On our review, since additional testimony was taken before the court, the test- is not whether the Board, but whether the court, abused .its discretion: Archbishop O\u2019Hara\u2019s Appeal, 389 Pa. 35, 51, 131 A. 2d 587; Volpe Appeal, supra, p. 379.\nAlthough the court should have decided this matter de novo we will consider this appeal as though the court, on the basis of all the testimony, based its decision on what appeared just and proper under the evidence and applicable principles of law.\n' Appellant first questions the status of a -tenant to apply for a use variance, especially where- the property owner does not join in the application. The statute provides that an appeal to the Zoning Board may be taken by \u201cany person aggrieved\u201d and that an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas may be taken by \u201cany person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s action. (Act of May 6, 1929, P. L. 1551, \u00a78, 53 PS \u00a714759).' Although appellant'points to the language of \u00a729(3) of the Philadelphia-Zoning Ordinance of August 10, 1933, which requires that an application for a zoning permit and use registration permit shall be made in writing upon certain forms and that such forms \u201cshall be- filled in by the owner or authorized agent\u201d, yet the' present Zoning Code of Philadelphia, \u00a714-1801, provides that no permit shall issue unless \u201c(a) The applicant or his authorized agent files a plan . . .\u201d. By this change in the language of the ordinance and the significant omission of the Avord \u201coAvner\u201d in the code, the legislative intent is clear that an applicant need not be the owner of the premises. We are of the opinion that a tenant occupies a status which permits him to apply for a use variance. His interest is such that, Avhether considered as the owner\u2019s agent or in his own right, he may be seriously aggrieved and affected by any action taken- by a zoning officer in connection with the premises which he bccupies under a lease. Appellant\u2019s objection in this respect is meritless.\nWhat appellee Saitto sought and that which was granted was a variance \u2014 termed'by former Chief Justice Steen a \u201ckind of dispensation, also permitted by the [zoning statute]\u201d. A variance is a departure from the letter, but not the spirit, of the zoning statute. It is not to be considered that a rezoning may be accomplished under the guise of the grant of a variance.\nThe sol\u00e9 justification for the grant of a variance is that a strict application of the terms of the zoning statute will result in an \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d, and, even then, the variance can be granted only if \u201cthe spirit of the ordinance shall be observed; the public health; the public safety; and the general welfare secured ; and substantial justice done\u201d. He who seeks a Variance has the burden of proving justification for its grant. The \u201chardship\u201d which must be proven must be an \u201cunnecessary\u201d, not a \u201cmere\u201d hardship, as well as \u201cunique or peculiar to [the property involved] as distinguished from the impact of the zoning regulations on the entire district\u201d. The fact that an increase or decrease in value will result from the grant or refusal of a variance will not, standing alone, constitute a sufficient hardship.\nOn an appeal from the grant or refusal of a variance we examine the record only to ascertain whether the action taken was clearly arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable or in clear violation of positive law. The grant of a variance depends on the circumstances of each particular case and evidence of the grant of similar variances in similarly zoned areas is not admissible.\nIn examining this record we bear in mind that which the late Mr. Justice Linn stated in Imperial Asphalt Corporation of Pennsylvania Zoning Case, 359 Pa. 402, 405, 406, 59 A. 2d 121: \u201cWhat were the \u2018grounds of the decision\u2019 which moved the zoning authorities? Neither the officer nor the board gave any facts pertinent and material in any inquiry into pos: sible reasons for the conclusion reached. They should have made from the evidence a statement of facts sufficient to show that a judicially exercised discretion, applied to the facts, justified the action taken; a property owner\u2019s constitutional right to the use of his property is not satisfied by arbitrary refusal. Nor is it sufficient merely to say the refusal resulted \u2018after due consideration\u2019. Enough must be stated to enable the court to see that there was due consideration and a weighing of evidence in its legal relations. It is not sufficient to say, as the board did in its return to common pleas, that the change is prohibited . . ., or that appellant is not entitled to a variance . . ., or that the variance \u2018would be contrary to the public interest\u2019 . . ., or that the board reached \u2018a correct and just decision\u2019 . . .,without something to show on what those legal conclusions are based. It must appear that the constitutional right to the use of property has not been infringed by the zoning regulation: . . . [citing cases]. There should be sufficient discussion to enable the court, on appeal, to see that the officer and board appreciated the legal questions raised by the facts\u201d.\nWherein has appellee Saitto proven the existence of an \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d? The evidence before the Board simply indicated that the premises had been used as a dentist\u2019s office up to 1936 and., subsequent thereto and until appellee\u2019s occupancy, as a doctor\u2019s office, that 50% of the buildings in this block housed professional offices and that a zoning permit was granted in 1936 for a doctor\u2019s office. There was no evidence \"before the Board, whatsoever, of any hardship, either to the tenant or the owner, unique or peculiar to this property. Significantly, the Board, although it concluded as a matter of law that a denial of the variance \u201cwould cause an unnecessary hardship and would place an unreasonable restriction on his use of these properties\u201d, made no finding of fact as to unnecessary hardship.\nThe additional testimony taken before the court may be summarized as follows: appellee, lessee under a 5 year lease expiring January 1, 1961, has spent approximately $1300-fl400 in repairs and renovations on the premises; Mr. Saitto, a heart victim, spends one or two nights each week sleeping on the premises rather than travel to his home in Moylan, Rose Valley; the premises will simply be for consultation and no other purpose; the only inconvenience which Mr. Saitto would suffer in moving into an office building would be that it would cost him money to stay overnight in a hotel twice a week; Mr. Saitto did not know when he signed the lease that under its terms, in the event a permit under the zoning ordinance could not be obtained, the lease would remain in full force and effect and he would be bound to pay the rent for the balance of the term.\nThe court concluded that a denial of the variance would constitute unnecessary hardship on three grounds: (1) that Mr. Saitto, because of his heart condition, must sleep on the premises one or two nights each week; (2) that appellee has a long term lease and has spent $1300-f1400 in making repairs; (3) that unnecessary hardship \u201cmight\u201d be caused to the owner.\nThese grounds, separately or taken together, do not spell out the \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d required to grant a variance under our decisions. In the first place, the inconvenience to Mr. Saitto in having to take a room at a hotel once or twice a week would be slight.' In the- second place, when the appellee signed this lease he was put on notice of the risk that he might not Secure a zoning permit and, when he spent money in renovation of the premises, he knew or should have known that he might not secure a permit for the proposed use; he entered upon this lease knowing or having reason to know that, if he did not obtain a zoning \u2022permit, he was bound to pay the balance of rent for the term and would lose any money expended in renovation of the premises. In the third place, the court did not find the existence of, but only that there \u201cmight\u201d be \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d to the owner. The possibility or probability of undue hardship is not a sufficient ground for the grant of a variance. The court below evidently was under the impression that the owner was a party in interest (even though he had not intervened or taken any steps to join with the appellee, his tenant, in these proceedings) who might be harmed. The harm which the court \u201cinferred that the Board thought would cause unnecessary hardship\u201d was that the long established use of the premises as a professional office would be prohibited and the owner required to make the premises into a dwelling. Such a finding was clearly and unequivocally erroneous: (1) it found \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d to one not a party to the proceedings; (2) it arrived at an inference of \u2022what the Board \u201cthought\u201d on evidence which never was presented to th\u00e9 board, i.e. the requirement that the owner would have to make the premises into a .dwelling instead of a doctor\u2019s office as it had been used, up until appellee\u2019s tenancy, and the cost thereof.\nGreat reliance is placed by appellee on. O\u2019Neill v. Philadelphia Zoning Board of Adjustment, 384 Pa. 379, 120 A. 2d 901. In that case an application was made for a variance to permit the. use of property in an \u201cF\u201d Residential district as a ballet school in which, although the permissible uses were limited essentially to single aid multiple family dwellings, \u201chotels, police and fire stations and telephone exchange buildings\u201d were included. In granting a variance, in addition to a finding that the proposed use was less obnoxious than the former use of the premises as a garage and that it would in no way affect the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, the Board also found that the property could not easily be converted into a residence. In reversing the court which had, in turn, reversed the Board\u2019s grant of a variance, this Court found that an unnecessary hardship existed in the \u201crequired conversion of the premises in question from a nonconforming to a conforming use at very substantial cost, claimed by the appellants to be financially impracticable\u201d. That case is clearly inapposite to the instant situation where appellees have failed to prove any unnecessary hardship to the owner whatsoever and nothing except a mere hardship, at best, to the tenant, and where there is no evidence that this property will have to be reconstructed to become a conforming use. On the contrary, there appears no reason of record why these premises could not be used as a doctor\u2019s office as they had been used over a number of years prior to appellee Saitto\u2019s occupancy.\nAn examination of this record leads to but one conclusion: that appellees have failed to prove any hardship, substantial, serious or compelling in nature, so as to justify the grant of a variance. Even though we consider, arguendo, that the proposed use will not downgrade this neighborhood and that there was a sufficiency of evidence to justify such a finding, yet unnecessary hardship must arise from and be justified by the evidence. In the instant situation the conclusion reached by the court in this r\u00e9spect was not justified by the evidence of record. .\nOrder reversed.
