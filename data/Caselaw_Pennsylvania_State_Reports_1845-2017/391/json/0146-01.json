        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones,\nThe plaintiff sued in trespass to recover damages from the defendants for their alleged defamation of him, both orally and in writing, during an election in June, 1956, in an industrial union whereof all parties to the suit were members. The suit was instituted Avith the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint in February, 1957, Avhich Avas duly served. A month later the defendants filed their answer containing neAV matter and a counterclaim wherein they sought damages of the plaintiff for his alleged libel of them by circulating copies of the complaint which he had filed in court some eight months after the original transactions, involved in his suit. The plaintiff filed preliminary objections to the defendants\u2019 counterclaim.\nThe court below correctly concluded that the libel pleaded by the defendants could not be asserted by way of a counterclaim since its grievance did not arise out of the same matters which constituted the gravamen of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Rule 1046 of the Pennsylvania. Rules of Civil Procedure, applicable to trespass actions, provides that \u201cA defendant .may plead a counterclaim which arises from- the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrenc\u00e9s from which the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arose;\u201d Goodrich-Amram, in their commentary on Rule 1046, state, \u201cCounterclaim in trespass is narrowly limited. There is no general right of counterclaim under any circumstances. No counterclaim may be filed unless it arises from the same transaction upon which the plaintiff is suing. All other counterclaims ar\u00e9 forbidden.\u201d The court below, after concluding as above. stated, mistakenly went ahead and considered and discussed the merits of the counterclaim and, in the end, entered an order sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s preliminary objections and dismissing the defendants\u2019 counterclaim without prejudice. It is that order which' is now before.us for review on the defendants\u2019 appeal.\nThe action of the court below in \u2022 discussing the' merits' of the counterclaim need not do' the defendants any harm. The counterclaim was not properly befor\u00e9 the court, hence the court\u2019s discussion with respect thereto is to be treated as surplusage. \u201cThe rights of the defendants are in no way impaired for they may assert their claim in a separate action\u201d \u2014 as the opinion-for the court below expressly Recognized. The statute\u2019of limitations'lias not 'jet rum If \u00e1nd when\" a' separate action is instituted, tlie two actions can then be joined for trial if the court of its own motion or on motion of a party so decides. See Rule 213(a) Pa. R. C. P.\nAppeal dismissed.",
