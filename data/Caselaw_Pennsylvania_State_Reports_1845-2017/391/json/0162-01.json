        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal from a judgment entered on a verdict in favor of defendant. Plaintiff brought an action in trespass for injuries sustained by him resulting from a collision with defendant\u2019s automobile. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to how the accident happened was both confusing and contradictory. He first testified that he was struck while on the corner by the curbstone. He testified that he first saw the ear when it was pretty close, about three feet away, and that he had taken two or three paces from the curbstone onto the street when the car hit him. Several times in answer to leading pertinent questions as to how the accident happened he said he did not know, he did not remember. The defendant and his eye witness testified that the front of the car was just about in front of the plaintiff when he stepped out onto the street and walked into the front fender of the car. Defendant\u2019s testimony was corroborated by a police officer who testified that he made an examination less than an hour after the accident, and failed to find any evidence of tire tracks in the dirt path adjoining the highway beyond the curb where plaintiff said he was standing, or any evidence that defendant\u2019s car had gon\u00e9 over the curb.\nPlaintiff on cross-examination was asked the question \u201cDid you step off the curb before you were hit, and if so, how many steps had you taken?\u201d To which plaintiff answered \u201cTwo or three feet and it grabbed me by the coat and it drug me.\u201d The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant; we believe it was the only just verdict that could have been rendered under the evidence in this case.\nJudge Lewis, the trial Judge in this case, deserves credit for leaning over backward to protect plaintiff, because of his age and his difficulty in speaking English. The only reason containing any substance which plaintiff alleges for a new trial is that counsel for defendant asked an unfair misleading question on cross-examination: \u201cHow far away from you was the car when you stepped out in the street?\u201d The trial Judge in his opinion dismissing the motion for a new trial said, inter alia: \u201cAfter a careful and complete examination of the entire record, we feel that, under all of the \u25a0circumstances hereinbefore referred to, the question put to the plaintiff, an interested party, was not improper. Such a witness is always subject to questions testing his memory or credibility. When the question was asked of him on cross-examination, he had already beclouded the issue by two versions as to where he was when struck. He had said he was \u2018on the corner by the curb stone\u2019 and also \u2018on the curb stone.\u2019 He had also said he was struck on the right side, testimony virtually irreconcilable with the rest of his story.\n\u201cIt is therefore apparent that plaintiff\u2019s own responses on direct examination raised inferences inconsistent not only with the allegations of his complaint, but possibly inconsistent also with his right to recover. \u2018Cross-examination is not confined to the precise facts elicited upon direct examination, but may be extended to all inferences, deductions and conclusions which may be drawn therefrom. The scope of cross-examination rests within the trial court\u2019s sound discretionary power.\u2019 . . . Lester v. Century Indemnity Co., Aplnt., 356 Pa. 15, 18.\nWe believe under the evidence in this case the question asked on cross-examination was perfectly proper and its allowance was undoubtedly within the sound discretionary power of the trial Judge. It is clear that the plaintiff had a fair trial and that there was no basic or fundamental error therein.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen dissents.\nItalics, ours.\nThe law pertaining to cross-examination is amplified in Kline v. Kachmar, 360 Pa. 396, 61 A. 2d 825; Short v. Allegheny Trust Co., 330 Pa. 55, 59, 198 A. 793, and cases cited therein.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno:\nCharles Parente, the plaintiff in this case, 83 years of age at the time, and sitting in a wheel chair, entered the courtroom in Wilkes-Barre, his left hand disabled and his right leg crippled from the accident which ia the subject of this litigation, to tell the judge and jury the story of the happening which brought him to this sorry pass in his old age. He had other incapacities, not associated with the accident, which added to his troubles in court. He was half deaf from the assault of the passing years and, then, what he did hear, he did not always understand. As an immigrant who had toiled all his life in the manual and lowly occupations, he had never acquired the schooling which would equip him to cope with the wit and learning of the lawyers with their higher education. And therein lies the melancholy mischief of this case.\nLike the stone-deaf Quasimodo who was tried before a judge who not only could not hear but who, during the proceedings, often closed his eyes to shut out the distraction of the courtroom, P\u00e1rente went through a trial never able to acquaint his triers with the facts which, had they been known, would well have brought him a verdict for the injuries and the pain inflicted on him by the automobile which struck him down as he stood on or by a curb on Exeter Avenue in West Pittston on April 15, 1955.\nThe issue at the trial developed into a factual contest as to whether P\u00e1rente was standing on the curb when the defendants\u2019 automobile collided with him, meaning, of course, that the car climbed the curb, or whether P\u00e1rente stepped into the street as the car was passing. When P\u00e1rente was asked where he was standing at the time of the impact with the car he replied through an interpreter: \u201cI was here. (Pointing to position in photograph). On the corner by the curb stone.\u201d The Court then asked him: \u201cWhat caused you to fall down?\u201d And P\u00e1rente replied: \u201cThe car struck me and knocked me down.\u201d\nAt no time in tlie direct examination did P\u00e1rente indicate that he was anywhere except on the curb when he was struck by the automobile. In cross-examination defendants\u2019 lawyer asked: \u201cHow far away from you was the car when you stepped out in the street?\u201d Parente\u2019s lawyer objected, and properly so. P\u00e1rente had never said that he stepped out in the street. Defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s question was obviously a trick question. The Trial Court overruled the objection and defendants\u2019 lawyer repeated the question as follows: \u201cHow far away was the car when you stepped out into the street?\u201d Parente\u2019s counsel again objected, pointing out that this was a \u201cdouble question.\u201d And it was a double question because it asked: \u201cHow far away was the car\u201d and \u201cHad you stepped out into the street?\u201d The Court overruled the objection and required the plaintiff to answer. P\u00e1rente replied: \u201cTwo or three paces.\u201d\nDefendants\u2019 counsel had succeeded in putting across the famous \u201cHave you stopped beating your wife?\u201d question. He had dug a pit for the octogenarian and prepared to shove him into it. The Trial Judge now saw the pit and endeavored to prevent the plaintiff\u2019s falling into it. But in his solicitude to avert that fall, he pushed the plaintiff in himself. The Trial Judge turned to the interpreter and said: \u201cNow in fairness to this witness, I wish you would slowly and clearly put this question to him and make this statement that at first he said, in answer to a question on direct examination, that he was on the curb stone when he was struck by the car and then later on cross-examination he said he had taken two or three paces off of and from the curb stone onto the street. . . . Take it slowly and easy and ask him if he was still on the curb when the car hit him or had he taken two or three steps from the curb stone when it' hit him.\u201d\nThe transcript shows the answer as follows: \u201cBy the interpreter: I asked him about the curb stone. He said Yes, he was on the curb stone, he was standing still on the curb stone.\u201d\nThe Trial Judge now asked him again through the interpreter: \u201cQ. When the automobile struck him, was he still on the curb stone? A. Sure.\u201d\nThis should have ended the query. P\u00e1rente had emphatically stated he was still standing on the curb stone when the automobile ran him down, but the Court pursued him with another question: \u201cQ. (By the Court) Now ask him can he explain what he meant when he said he was two or three paces out on the street when he was struck. Ask him if he can explain that?\u201d\nWith this question, the Court toppled P\u00e1rente into the pit which defendants\u2019 counsel had so neatly and precisely \u2014 and unfairly \u2014 excavated. It will be noted that the Court assumed that P\u00e1rente had at one time said that he was two or three paces in the street when the collision occurred. P\u00e1rente never once made such an assertion. When he answered \u201ctwo or three paces\u201d he was replying to the question: \u201cHow far away from you was the car \u2014 ?\u201d\nThe jury returned a verdict for the defendant which was affirmed by a majority of this Court. The Majority Opinion lauds the Trial Judge for \u201cleaning over backward to protect plaintiff.\u201d I do not doubt for a moment that the Trial Judge was absolutely sincere in endeavoring to arrive at the truth, but I also believe that in \u201cleaning over backward\u201d he lost his equilibrium.. He ascribed to the plaintiff a posture of assertion which cannot be verified by the record. Thus, after the plaintiff had been tumbl\u00e9d, wheel chair and all, into the-hole which defendants\u2019 counsel had spaded, th\u00e9re might still have b\u00e9en aii opportunity for the plaintiff to get out, had it not been that in his charge to the jury, the Trial Judge buried the plaintiff and his cause completely by telling the jury that the plaintiff had said that \u201c. . . he had left the curb and had progressed two or three paces therefrom onto the paved highway when he was struck.\u201d\nThe plaintiff at no time said that he had progressed two or three paces from the curb when he was struck.\nThe Majority Opinion says: \u201cPlaintiff on cross-examination was asked the question \u2018Did you step off the curb before you were hit, and if so, how many steps had you taken?\u201d\nBut this question was not put in cross-examination. It was put by the Trial Judge and, \u00edvith all respect, I must say it was put very badly and unfairly. He repeated the fault of the defendants\u2019 counsel: he threw two questions in one. It was hard enough for the plaintiff, considering his age and infirmities, to get one question at a time, without having two fired at him simultaneously by the awesome figure in black robes on the throne towering above him. It must be noted here, in passing, that Charles P\u00e1rente had been adjudged a mental incompetent, and a guardian ad litem had been appointed for him seven months prior to the trial. The guardianship was lifted only two days before the trial. Thus, for this and other reasons, including a desire for specificity, the Trial Judge should have leaned not backward but forward to make certain that the plaintiff thoroughly understood what was transpiring in the Court.\nThe record clearly shows that the plaintiff had difficulty in understanding. Just before the plaintiff took the witness stand, one of the attorneys Mr. Libenson, explained to the Court that probably P\u00e1rente needed an interpreter. The following ensued: \u201cBy the Court: Let\u2019s se\u00e9. Mr. P\u00e1rente \u2014 By Mr. Libenson: The Judge wants to talk to you. Q. (By the Court) Mr. P\u00e1rente? A. Yes. Q. (By the Court) Can you hear me? A. Yes. Q. (By the Court) Can you speak English? Can you speak English? A. What he say.\u201d\nEven after the interpreter had been mustered into service, there were still some difficulties, i.e.,: \u201cQ. Now which direction was the car coming from when it hit you? A. From this side. Q. From the right? By the Court: I couldn\u2019t interpret. Could you? By Mr. Fleming: I couldn\u2019t.\u201d . . . Q. Now where did the car come from, your left or the right? A. The other side. By Mr. Fleming: He indicates his right. By the Court: If you can do better, go ahead. By Mr. Libenson: He tires very easily. We could be too extensive. By the Court: I won\u2019t ask another question.\u201d\nBut the Court did ask other questions, many of them, and some of them so telescoped and double-jointed as inevitably to create misunderstanding. We have quoted the one where the Court asked: \u201cDid you step off the curb before you were hit, and if so, how many steps had you taken?\u201d\nTo this two-pronged question the interpreter answered : \u201cHe answered two or three feet and it grabbed me by the coat and it drug me.\u201d\nNo one can state with conscientious certainty that this \u00bfnswer was made to the second part of the Judge\u2019s question. Why did the Judge not put a simple question, namely, \u201cDid you step off the curb before you were hit?\u201d\n.And then, if the plaintiff answered this question in the affirmative he could have been asked. the second question: \u201cHow many steps had you taken?\u201d\nOne cannot but be impressed with the fact that when questions were put simply, the plaintiff \u2022 understood, through the interpreter,, and replied; Thus at the very end of the trial he was asked by the Court: \u201cAnd how far out from the curb stone were you when you were hit?\u201d\nIt will be noted here that although the question is clear, it is very leading, and seeks to persuade the witness to say how \u201cfar out\u201d from the curb stone he was when hit. The witness had never said he was out from the curb stone. The witness, however, did not succumb to the persuading question and replied definitively, categorically, and unequivocally: \u201cI was standing on the curb.\u201d\nAs already stated, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant and the plaintiff has asked for a new trial. I believe he is entitled to it because of the efforts intentionally made by defendants\u2019 counsel and unintentionally made by the Trial Judge to force the plaintiff off the curbstone of fact into the street of ambiguity, confusion, and unfairness. Let us look at the matter a little further. Mr. Libenson, plaintiff\u2019s counsel, asked the interpreter to put to plaintiff the following question: \u201cAsk him [the plaintiff] the point where he stood when the car hit him?\u201d\nThis was a sensible question, a fair question, the catalyst which would have resolved all the murky interrogation into a definitive, understandable proposition. If, after the plaintiff had stated he was on the curb when he was hit, the Court believed- the plaintiff' was somewhere else, the question put by Mr. Libenson would have clarified where the plaintiff was actually standing, even though he had already twice stated he was on the curb. But the Judge did not allow Mr. Liberison\u2019s question. He leaned backward in order to be fair and said: \u201cWe will strike that out.\u201d He then went on to say that it was the Court\u2019s duty , to get all the facts and proceeded to put the' blunderbuss\u2019 .question already, quoted. '\nThe Majority Opinion here quotes and affirms the Trial Court\u2019s Opinion wherein it is stated: \u201cWhen the question was asked of him on cross-examination, he had already beclouded the issue by two versions as to where'he was when struck.\u201d (Italics in original)\nThere was no beclouding on the part of the plaintiff, except where he failed to understand because of the way questions were put. The Trial Judge said further, and this Court approves his statement: \u201cHe the plaintiff had said he was \u2018on the corner by the curb stone\u2019 and also \u2018on the curb stone.\u2019 \u201d '\nWhere is the \u201cbeclouding\u201d here? Whether the plaintiff was \u201con the corner by the curb stone\u201d or \u201con the curb stone,\u201d it is clear that he was where no automobile had the right to be!\n\u2022 In his charge to the jury, the Trial-Judge said to the. jury that the plaintiff had given two versions:.of the .accident and he then directed them: \u201cCarefully weigh all of the testimony and then decide which -of those two stories is correct.\u201d\n- I have already pointed out that the plaintiff gave only one version. Nevertheless, the two supposed alternatives of his testimony were advanced so ingenuously, so persuadingly, and so convincingly by the robed figure who guides the deliberations of the jury that the twelve trusting men and women decided in the secrecy and sanctity.of the jury room, to follow the path which the Judge had told them existed but which, of course, had no reality, and as a consequence they came out with a verdict which at once challenges the impartial student.\nOn the central issue in this appeal, the right of defendants\u2019\u25a0 counsel to ask a misleading question of a sickly, disabled, wheel-chaired octogenarian, the Majority says , that \u201cthe scope of cross-examination rests within the trial court\u2019s sound discretionary power.\u201d That is true, but I submit that here the Trial Court abused his \u201csound discretionary power.\u201d Chief Justice Maxey spoke wisely on. this matter in the case of DiBona v. P. T. C.; 356 Pa. 204, when he said: \u201cOn cross-examination, leading questions can be properly asked a witness but misleading questions cannot be. Setting verbal traps for a witness is not a legitimate branch of the art of crossrexamination.\u201d\nWhere a. witness is sly and evasive and where the cross-examiner has reason to assume that the witness is lying, I agree that ample latitude should be allowed the cross-examiner in ferreting out the truth. But we do not have any such situation here. I am convinced from reading the record that the Trial Court erred grievously in permitting misleading questions and, to a certain extent, indulging in them himself without realizing that, they w\u00e9re misleading.\nAnd I believe further that this Court, in refusing to grant a new trial on the demonstration of such palpable error,. .compounds the error, \u2022 accentuates the injustice, and'gives Charles P\u00e1rente much to ruminate over as to what constitutes a fair trial \u2014 as he pushes himself forward and backward in his wheel chair \u2014 at 85 years of age.",
