        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nThis case presents a very narrow issue: does an Orphans\u2019 Court have jurisdiction to compel realtors, who have been acting as agents of the administrators, to turn over to the administrators rents which they have collected from decedent\u2019s realty since decedent\u2019s death?\nWhen John Webb, the decedent, died, intestate, on April 25, 1953, his estate was insolvent. The principal asset of the estate was an apartment house located at 3425-29 Powelton Avenue, Philadelphia, which was sold during the administration of the estate by order of the Orphans\u2019 Court.\nDuring decedent\u2019s lifetime the appellants managed the apartment house and collected the rents as decedent\u2019s agents and they were continued in this capacity by the administrators. Since decedent\u2019s death appellants have collected rents totalling $4914.05, which they have refused to turn over to the administrators, claiming that the decedent owed their partnership $961.78 and that the decedent owed Morris Seidman, one of the co-partners, $4000, evidenced by an unrecorded judgment note; they have applied the amount of rents collected to the payment of these obligations.\nThe administrators did not include the rent in their, account; at the audit objection was made to this omission from the account and efforts were made to compel an accounting for the rent. The auditing judge refused to compel an accounting upon the ground that the rents never came into the possession of the personal representative and were not registered in the name of the decedent or his nominee, hence the- Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction. In a supplemental adjudication the auditing judge affirmed his prior ruling. Thereafter a unanimous court en banc, speaking through President Judge Charles Klein, while agreeing with the auditing judge\u2019s conclusion that the question was not properly before the court on audit because the rents were neither included in the account nor received by the administrators, nevertheless concluded that the Orphans\u2019 Court did have jurisdiction to compel the appellants to turn over the rents collected and directed the appellees to petition the court for a citation to issue to show cause why the rents should not be turned over to them.\nThe administrators then filed a petition for a citation which recited, inter alia, the ownership of the apartment house by decedent during his lifetime, that appellants were his agents for collection of rents and, subsequent to his death, \u201cwere continued in this capacity by the [Administrators of the Estate of John Webb, deceased]\u201d, that they have $4914.05 collected between the date of death and the sale of the property which, after demand, they have refused to turn over -to the administrators. After issuance of the citation, preliminary objections were filed which squarely raised the question of the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court-. The preliminary objections were dismissed and from the order of dismissal this appeal was taken.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court possesses the power of a court of chancery in aid of an exercise of its jurisdiction over and above the power vested in it by statute.\nPrior to the Orphans\u2019 Court Act of 1951, the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court to adjudicate the title to personalty depended on whether the personalty was, actually or presumptively, in decedent\u2019s possession at the time of death, or thereafter came into the possession of his personal representative: Starz Estate, 353 Pa. 612, 46 A. 2d 486; DiPaola Estate, 350 Pa. 408, 39 A. 2d 519; Brown\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 230, 22 A. 2d 821; Crisswell\u2019s Estate, 334 Pa. 266, 5 A. 2d 577; Keyser's Estate, 329 Pa. 514, 198 A. 125; McGovern\u2019s Estate, 322 Pa. 379, 186 A. 89; Williams\u2019 Estate, 236 Pa. 259, 84 A. 848; Cutler\u2019s Estate, 225 Pa. 167, 73 A. 1111; Balok Estate, 151 Pa. Superior Ct. 592, 30 A. 2d 664; 7 U. of Pitt. L. Rev. 163; 47 Dick. L. Rev. 1.\nThe present jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court is determined by section 301(13) of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act of August 10, 1951, P. L. 1163, art. III, 20 PS \u00a72080.301, reading as follows: \u201cThe Orphans\u2019 Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of: . . . (13) Title to Personal Property. The adjudication of the title to personal property in the possession of the personal representative, or registered in the name of the decedent or his nominees, or alleged by the personal representative to have been in the possession of the decedent at the time of his death.\u201d This statutory provision was \u201cintended to obviate, whenever possible, a preliminary dispute as to whether the Orphans\u2019 Court has jurisdiction to determine the title to the disputed property\u201d.\nThis section considerably broadened the scope of the court\u2019s jurisdiction and jurisdiction now exists where the following situations arise: (1) If the personalty was in decedent\u2019s possession, actually or presumptively, at the time of death; (2) if the personalty came into the possession of decedent\u2019s personal representative subsequent to his death; (3) if neither (1) nor (2) exist, but if the personalty was \u201cregistered\u201d in the name of decedent or his nominee; (4) if there is an allegation by the personal representative that the personalty was in possession of the decedent when he died.\nAn examination of the petition for citation \u2014 the basis upon which appellees seek to recover the rent money \u2014 indicates that situations (1), (3) and (4), supra, do not exist and that if appellees\u2019 position is to be sustained it must be on the basis of situation (2), supra. Did the rent money come into the possession of the administrators subsequent to decedent\u2019s death?\nActually the rent money never came into the hands of the administrators but it did come into the hands of appellants who were acting as the agents of the administrators. Was possession of this money possession by the administrators so as to entitle the Orphans\u2019 Court to assume jurisdiction? For the purpose of this review and on the basis of the pleadings we must assume the agency in existence between the parties and that the money was collected by appellants in pursuance of that agency.\nThe right of the administrators to collect the rents is clear: Fiduciaries Act of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, art. Y, \u00a7501, 20 PS \u00a7320.501. Armed with the authority to collect the rents the administrators authorized their collection by appellants as their agents. No attack upon the authority of the administrators to appoint agents for the collection of rents has been made. When the rents came into appellants\u2019 hands, their possession was that of their principal, the administrators, and it then became their duty to account for and pay over such rent money to the administrators.\nWe agree Avith the folloAving analysis of the situation by the court below: \u201cFrom earliest times possession of property in the hands of an agent of a fiduciary has been regarded as being in possession of the fiduciary. Both Williams on Executors, Vol. 11, p. 1442, and Schouler on Wills, Executors and Administrators, 6th Ed., Vol. 3, p. 2246, two of the leading textbooks on this subject, cite the following quotation from Jenkins v. Plombe, 6 Mod. 92, an English case decided more than 160 years ago: \u2018And if an executor appoint another to receive a debt of his testator, and he receive it, it is now the same thing as if he had actually received it himself, and will be assets in his hands; . . .\n\u201cIn Watts\u2019 Estate, 158 Pa. 1 (1893), the Supreme Court held that an attorney who has received money belonging to a decedent\u2019s estate, from an administrator Avhom he represented, Avas amenable to the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court. To the same effect see: In Wanamaker\u2019s Petition, 25 D. & C. 694. (1936).\n\u201cIn Jeffries\u2019s Estate, 16 D. .& C.-808 (1932), this court, in an opinion by Gest, J., held that the Orphans\u2019 Court has jurisdiction to follow a fund belonging to a decedent\u2019s estate and to require its repayment by an innocent third party from a defaulting executor.\n\u201cIn Freed Estate, 86 D. & C. 592 (1954), we compelled the respondent who received an asset of a decedent\u2019s estate from the administratrix, allegedly in payment for services rendered the estate, to return the asset t\u00f3 a successor administrator, without prejudice, however, to the recipient\u2019s right to present a claim for the alleged services against the estate.\n\u201cThe administration of the estate of a decedent is one indivisible judicial proceeding, from the grant of letters appointing the administrator until his discharge. The administrator while functioning is at all times under the control and direction of the orphans\u2019 court. He is, in a sense, an officer of the court and any property received by him as administrator may be regarded as in the custody of the court.\n\u201cMorris Seidman and Sons, the real estate agents, knew of the death of John Webb, the decedent, and of the appointment of the two attorneys, Harvey N. Schmidt and Leon Sobel, as administrators. In collecting the rents from the apartment house, they knew they were dealing with property forming part of the estate of a decedent subject to the jurisdiction of this court. They cannot defy the authority of this court and thereby create for themselves a preferential position over decedent\u2019s other creditors.\u201d\nComerford Estate, 388 Pa. 278, 130 A. 2d 458; Patterson\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 177, 19 A. 2d 165; Foulke\u2019s Estate, 334 Pa. 186, 5 A. 2d 179; Crisswell\u2019s Estate, supra; Keyser\u2019s Estate, supra; and Appeal of the Harrisburg National Bank, 84 Pa. 380, relied on by appellants, are clearly distinguishable.\nThe moment the rent money came into appellants\u2019 hands it came into the possession of the administrators because appellants received it for and on behalf of their principals. Such possession is sufficient to enable the Orphans\u2019 Court to exercise jurisdiction in this situation.\nDecree affirmed. Costs on appellants.\nUnaffected by the amendments of 1953 and 1955-56.\nExplanatory Comment' to \u00a7301(13) from the Report of the Joint State Government Commission' of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania.\n\u201cRegistered\u201d is a synonym for \u201cto record formally and exact-' ly\u201d, \u201cto enter precisely\u201d or to \u201center formally on a record\u201d: Words and Phrases, vol. 36, p. 648.-\nAllegation is a synonym for \u201ccharge\u201d, \u201cstatement\u201d, \u201cclaim\u201d dr \u201cdeclaration\u201d.
