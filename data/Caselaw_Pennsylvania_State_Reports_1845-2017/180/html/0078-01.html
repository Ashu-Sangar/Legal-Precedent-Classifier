    <p class="summary" id="b101-7" data-blocks='[["BL_101.7",101,[225,619,1168,1375]]]'>[Gentlemen : Ordinarily there would be little more to say, but something has happened here, a piece of testimony given and alluded to by counsel in their remarks, to which I wish to call your attention. The assessor of the district was called upon the stand, and I think he said the property was worth $4,000 an acre before the street was opened through it, and then said under cross-examination, as the assessor of the district, he assessed it at $1,000 an acre, and when further pressed, said it was the custom to assess these properties low, 25$, I think. Counsel argued to you that custom made a law, and that many of the old laws were the result of custom; but let me say to you, gentlemen, that no customary violation of the law can make good law. No official by constantly and incessantly violating a law can overcome it, and no number of years of violation of an act of assembly or an act of legislature can wipe out that act of legislature. Now, that assessor who was on the stand, when he went into office, took tins oath: “ I will justly and honestly to the best of my judgment, assess and value every property, lot, piece or tract of land, with the improvements thereon, by the rate or price which I shall, after due examination and consideration, believe the same would sell for after a full public notice.” That is the oath he took when he went into office, that he would assess that property at what he believed it would bring at a fair public sale after due notice. Now, after having sworn to do that, he assesses it at $1,000 per acre, and swears to you at the same time it was worth $4,000 an acre. He either violated his oath of office, or did not tell the truth here.] [2]</p>
