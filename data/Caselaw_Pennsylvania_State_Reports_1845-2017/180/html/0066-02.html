Eckels sold an undivided half interest in a drug store in German-town to Walter S. Froelich, and received the pay for it. He sold the remaining undivided half interest to Henry W. Wellensieck, but did not receive the pay for it, and by agreement it reverted to Eckels on May 3, 1894. May 4, 1894, Eckels sold and delivered this half interest to John Harlow, his father-in-law. In the following June, Charles A. Eckels, upon an execution against John Harlow, sold this half interest at sheriff’s sale as the property of said Harlow, and bought it at said sale. In August, 1894, George M. Smyser made affidavit that Howard S. Eckels was indebted to him in the sum of $2,000 upon two promissory notes, and that said Eckels was about to remove his property out of the jurisdiction of the court with intent to defraud his creditors; that he had property, rights in action, and evidences of debt which he fraudulently concealed; that he had assigned, disposed of and removed, and was about to assign, dispose of and remove such property, money, rights in action and evidences of debt, with intent to defraud his creditors. By virtue of this affidavit he obtained a writ of attachment under the act of March 17, 1869, and attached this one half interest in the store as the property of said Eckels, and named Charles A. Eckels as garnishee. Howard S. Eckels filed an affidavit denying these allegations, and obtained a rule to dissolve the attachment. Depositions were taken and the court discharged the rule and refused to dissolve the attachment. Judgment was then entered against the defendant on the claim. By agreement of all the interested parties this one half interest was sold to Walter S. Froelich, who already owned the other one half interest; and the proceeds' of sale, $2,045.61, were deposited with the Commonwealth Title, Insurance &amp; Trust Company to abide the final determination of a feigned issue granted on the petition of Charles A. Eckels who claimed said fund as his sole property, and prayed that an issue might be <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>granted between himself and the said George M. Smyser to test the ownership of said fund. Exceptions were filed by Smyser to the granting of the issue.</p>
