These instructions were given in the absence of his brother, Percy A. Jones, the other defendant, just before the auctioneer began to auction the sale. The auctioneer mentioned specially that the property would be sold without reserve, that it was no sham sale, it would be sold to the highest bidder without reserve. Both Howard and Percy Jones were present during the entire bidding; neither one of them personally put a bid upon the property, but the auctioneer, the uncle of Howard Jones, did the bidding for said Howard Jones without the knowledge of those attending the sale or the bidders. The manner in which the bidding was done was this. The auctioneer started the sale at $8,400; then said “ $3,500, thank you, sir; $3,600, thank you, sir; $3,700, thank you; $3,800,” and then stopped, and John A. Flannery called out in a tone of voice loud enough to be heard by all the bidders, and actually heard by the defendants, “ I will give you $5 more for it.” The auctioneer used this language, “ Thank you, sir,” as if he had actually received these different bids, with the intention of creating the impression in the minds of those attending the sale that various parties were bidding, whereas, in truth and in fact, the only person bidding was the auctioneer himself bidding secretly for Howard W. Jones, the owner. I find the stranger, alleged by the auctioneer to have made one bid, was a myth. When the bid of $3,805 was put upon the property, the auctioneer and both the defendants and their wives, had a consultation among themselves, and then the auctioneer came back and, securing no further bid, knocked the property down to John A. Flannery, the plaintiff. The defendants in their “ answer ” swear that the instructions given by Howard W. Jones to the auctioneer were to bid on the same for Jones as high as $3,800, and to knock it down to him at that figure should that be the highest bid for the same. “At the hearing,” Howard Jones and the auctioneer swear that the instructions were to bid it up to $4,000.</p>

This offer was not agreed to by Percy, because he thought the property, as a whole, should bring not less than $5,000, and that not agreeing upon the price at which the property should be sold at private sale, decided to offer the same at public sale and sell to the highest bidder, both of us to have the privilege of bidding and buying at said sale should we so desire.”</p>

Christie, Cowper, 895, affirmed by our Supreme Court in Staines v. Shore, <a href="/pa/16/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="16 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="410127" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0200-01">16 Pa. 200</a>; Pennock’s App., <a href="/pa/14/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="14 Pa. 446" data-case-ids="405993" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0446-01">14 Pa. 446</a>, is so pertinent to the subject, that I quote from it as follows: “ The question then is, whether the owner can privately employ another person to bid for him. The basis of all dealings ought to be good faith; for, more especially in these transactions, where the public are brought together upon a confidence that the articles set up to sale will be disposed of to the highest real bidder; that could never be the case if the owner might secretly and privately enhance- the price by a person employed for that purpose; yet tricks and practices of that kind daily increase, and grow so frequent that good men give in to the ways of the bad and dishonest, in their own defense. But such a practice was never openly avowed. An owner of goods set up to sale at an auction never yet bid in the room for himself. If such a practice were allowed no one would bid. It is a fraud upon the sale and upon the public. The disallowing it is no hardship upon the owner. For if he is unwilling his goods should go at an under price, he may order them to be set up at his own price and not lower; such a direction would be fair; or he might do as was done by Lord Ashburnham, who sold a large estate by auction; he had inserted in the conditions of sale that he himself might bid once in the course of the sale, and he bid at once ¿615,000 or ¿620,000. Such a condition is fair, because the public are then apprised, and know upon what terms they bid. In Holland it is the practice to bid downwards. The question then is, is such a bidding fair ? If not, it is no argument to say it is a frequent custom. Gaming, stock-jobbing, and swindling are frequent. But the law forbids them all. Suppose there was an agreement to abate so much, which is the case where goods are sold by one person in the trade to another; they abate sometimes 10 or 15 per cent. Such an agreement between the owner and bidder, at a sale by auction, would be a gross fraud. What is the nature of a sale by auction ? It is, that the goods shall go to the highest real bidder. But there would be an end of that if the owner might privately bid upon his own goods. There is no contract with the auctioneer. He is only an agent between <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>the buyer and seller. He may fairly bid for a third person who employs him, but not for the owner.” In Wheeler v. Collier, 1 Moody &amp; Matldn, Lord Tenteejden, chief justice, said: “ If the owner of an estate put up for sale by auction employ a person to bid for him, the sale is void, although only one such person be employed, and although he is only to bid up to a certain sum; unless it is announced at the time that there is a person bidding for the owner.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[226,786,1173,444]]]'>An excellent review of these various authorities appears in the case of Towle v. Leavitt, 23 New Hampshire, 360, wherein the court adopted the remarks of chancellor Kent, 2 Kent Co., *539, as the true doctrine, to wit, that “ in sound policy no person ought in any case to be employed secretly to bid for the owner against a bona fide bidder at a public auction. It is a fraud in law on the very face of the transaction, and the owner’s interference and right to bid ought to be intimated in the conditions of sale.”</p>

The fallacy of the principle is in assuming that there is a standard of value independent of the wishes and wants of the bidders, and that every man is willing to buy by it. ... A man is defrauded whenever he is incited by artful means to bid more than he otherwise would. He has a right to buy at an under value, where the necessities of the owner compel him to sell; and whenever the price is ever so little enhanced by a secret contrivance, he is cheated. A sale by auction presupposes a sacrifice, or at least a willingness to sell for what can be had; but should the vendor stick for the last penny, it would be idle to set the property up, because his price could be as readily obtained at private sale. ... If the owner proposes to sell without reservation as to price, let him openly reserve a right to bid. For no fair purpose is the employment of a puffer necessary; and it must vitiate every sale in which recourse is had to it.”</p>

It decided that one of four executors, under the will, interested in the distribution of a decedent’s estate, had a right to bid and buy at the sale held by all of the executors, subject to the power of disaffirmance in the heirs or creditors. It was not the case of an actual owner selling his own real estate. The parties were trustees.

In the present case the parties are the actual owners, and, as we have seen from the above authorities, if the owner employs a person to bid for him, although he is only to bid up to a certain sum, the sale is void; and to employ one secretly to bid for the owner against a bona fide bidder at public auction is fraud in law on the very face of the transaction.
