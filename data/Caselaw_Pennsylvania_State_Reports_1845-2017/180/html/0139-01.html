He directed that after the death of his daughter, the trustee should set apart for the benefit of his daughter’s child a certain fund which was to be paid to the child when he reached the age of twenty-one. He further directed that after the death of the daughter and during the lifetime of the widow one half, and at the death of the widow, the entire income of his residuary estate, less that of the fund set aside for the daughter’s child, should be paid to the son for life; but if the son should die in the lifetime of the widow, his share of the income should be paid to his wife and children until the death of the widow, and thereupon the principal of the residue, less the fund set aside for the daughter’s child, should be divided between the son’s wife and children. The son survived the widow of the testator, and left surviving him a wife and children. <em>Held, </em>that although the will did not provide specifically for the contingency of the death of the son after the death of testator’s widow, no intestacy occurred as to the residue, since it was the manifest intent of the will that upon the death of testator’s widow and son, the principal of the residue was to go to the son’s widow and children.</p>

Potts, the son of a daughter, at her death, an event which has happened, the will directed that on the death of a daughter (who predeceased the testator), one half, and at the death of testator’s wife, the whole income of the residue should be paid to the son for life; but if he should die in the wife’s lifetime, then his share of income should be paid <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>■to his wife and children until the death of testator’s widow, and thereupon the principal of the estate should be divided among them. The son survived the widow, and left at his death a widow and two children. It was argued that the omission to provide specifically for the event which actually occurred, the death of the son after the widow, necessarily created an intestacy in the residue. This narrow notion of what constitutes an intestacy, it must be conceded, will, if adopted, so simplify the interpretation of wills that very much of the learning which has been lavished in the effort to ascertain the testamentary purpose may hereafter be dispensed with. But it cannot be tolerated, for the reason that the principle has always been recognized that no testator contemplates an intestacy, and hence that any reasonable construction will be made whose effect will be to avoid such a miscarriage — a thing which would be impossible if he must be held to have intended nothing which he did not literally express. Here the testator provided for a contingency, which, in the table of chances, was less likely to happen than the contingency about which he was silent. Can it be possible that, in minutely caring for the lesser object, he had no thought for the greater ? His primary regard was for his son, and his gift, in the event of his son’s death before the widow, showed beyond speculation what his gift would be if the son should outlive the widow. The death of the widow was the period at which the principal of the estate was to be distributed. Up to that time, if he lived, the son was to be paid one half of the income of the estate; after that time, the corpus of the estate, if he should be dead, was to be paid to his widow and ■children. This gift to the wife and children, on the theory of the son’s death before the widow, was the measure of the estate which was intended for them if he should survive her. On the opposite theory of an intestacy, inasmuch as the son had the misfortune to survive his mother, as in the order of nature it was likely he would, both he and his wife and children were cut out of the gift altogether, and this although he was the ultimate object of the testator’s bounty. That an absolute gift to a beneficiary who dies after a given event will be implied from •a disposition over of his share, if he should die before the event, has been often decided.</p>

His only fault is that the expression is ungrammatical. His meaning is to dispose of the income of his estate during the joint and several lives of his wife and son, and at the death of the survivor to give the corpus to the son’s widow and children. By inserting the disjunctive “ or ” between the two members of the clause this will become clear. The reading, stripped of verbiage, will be: “ Upon the decease of my said wife, if my son, Abram R., should survive her, then to pay the whole of such net income to my said son for life; <em>or, </em>in case my son should die, leaving my wife surviving, then, during the life of my said wife, the widow of my son is to receive one third of my son’s share of said income, and the issue of my son two thirds; and upon the decease of my wife, then the widow of my said son is to receive one third of the principal of the trust fund, and the issue two thirds.” Grammatically and logically, the gift over refers to both members of the sentence, an'd is to take effect at the death of the surviving life tenant; that is to say, at the death of the testator’s wife, if she shall survive the son, or at the death of the son, if he shall survive the testator’s widow. Our power to substitute “ or ” for “ but,” which words are in reality almost identical here in meaning is unquestionable: Dodson v. Hay, 3 Bro. O.

N. C. 171</a>. In Holland’s Estate, supra, the testator bequeathed $600 to A., and, in a later clause, he gave whatever should remain, after payment of his debts, to B. It was contended that the gift of “ whatever remained after payment of debts ” was grammatically, a gift of the entire estate, and wiped out the legacy. The court, however, added the word “and ” after the former gift, and the Supreme Court, on appeal, held that even this was needless, and that although, in terms, the two clauses were repugnant, the meaning of the testator was self-evident.
