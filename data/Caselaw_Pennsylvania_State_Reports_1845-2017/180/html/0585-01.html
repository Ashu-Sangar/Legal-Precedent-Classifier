There was evidence that the husband had previously sold some real estate, and that some of the money which he had received for it had. been paid to the relative from whom the wife claimed that she had borrowed the money used by her in the purchase of the land in controversy. The court instructed the jury that the burden was upon her to show that the purchase was made with her own money, and that if she made the purchase with her own money exclusively she acquired thereby a title good against her husband and his creditors; that if her hands were clean, she was not responsible for her husband’s misdeeds, even though he may have sold his property for the purpose of hindering and delaying his creditors, but that if she connived or colluded with him in the purchase of the property by using any of the money which he received from his other land, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. <em>Held, </em>that a judgment and verdict for the wife should be sustained.</p>

Upon that judgment an execution was issued, and this property now in dispute was levied upon by the sheriff, an inquisition was duly held, and the property was condemned. After the condemnation of the property a writ of venditioni exponas was placed in the hands of the sheriff, and this property was sold by the sheriff to Ambrose Mulley, the plaintiff, for the sum of §46.20, on January 6,1894, and the deed was properly acknowledged on January 18, 1894.</p>

Upon the part of the defendants it is claimed the property belonged to Ellen F. Shoemaker, George II. Shoemaker’s wife. It appears that when Mr.' Mulley instituted proceedings to obtain possession of this property under the act of assembly, before an aider-man in this city, Ellen F. Shoemaker, wife, the other defendant, made an affidavit claiming title and possession to be hers and not in her husband, George H. Shoemaker, and gave bond for appearance to defend this action of ejectment. In that proceeding she claimed the title was in her. When a married woman seeks to defend property which she claims to be hers as against creditors of her husband, whoever levies upon it and sells it by virtue of a judgment against her husband, the burden of proving title in herself is upon the wife. The relation of husband and wife is very close; and whenever property is sold as the property of the husband at the instigation of a creditor, and the wife claims the title to the property, the burden of proving that the title is in her is upon her. A sheriff’s sale of the property as the property of the husband is, prima facie, a sale of the property of the husband. Of course it was a sale of the property of the husband if he had title to it, and as against creditors of the husband, prima facie, the title to the property is in him and not in the wife. . . .</p>

The burden of proving that she paid the consideration for this lot, that she obtained this money in her own right, and not from or through her husband, is upon her, and she must prove it by the fair weight of the evidence. She must prove it by evidence that is full and clear and satisfactory. She alleged she did borrow this money. She alleges that about the time she bought this lot from Beale and Clark that she borrowed $725 of her sister, Mrs. Adams, and that her sister and she had some arrangement by which she was to pay the money back to her sister within five years or furnish her a home, and that $500 of this $775 was paid for this lot, paying this purchase money in full. She also testifies that she obtained none of it from or through her husband. The contract for the building has also been offered in evidence. That is in her name, and the burden of proving that she paid for that with her own money, or with money she raised on her own credit is upon her. She seeks to meet that burden by offering in evidence the mortgage to the Trust and Safe Deposit Company of Scranton, for the sum of $1,250, purporting upon its face to have been given by her upon her property, she having the deed from Beale and Clark, and given for her own debt. This mortgage has been offered in evidence. The defendants have also put upon the stand Mr. Shoemaker, who testified that at the time this property was purchased he was insolvent; that he had nothing himself, and that he does not know where his wife got the money except what was told him.</p>

The action is ejectment by a purchaser at sheriff’s sale upon a judgment against George H. Shoemaker. The defense alleges that the title to the lot in controversy was in Mrs. Shoemaker, the wife of the defendant, and that it was never in the defendant. In support of this line of defense, evidence was given tending to show that Mrs. Shoemaker negotiated the purchase, and borrowed the money which she paid upon it from a relative. The good faith of this purchase was attacked by the plaintiff, who showed that Shoemaker had sold his own house and lot just before the judgment was recovered against him for $1,600, which was paid to him in cash, and that some of this money had been paid to the relative from whom Mrs. Shoemaker claimed to have borrowed the money used by her in the purchase of the lot now in question. The question in the case was whether Mrs. Shoemaker had shown a title obtained in good faith by the investment of her separate moneys, or whether she held for her husband, having used directly or indirectly his money in effecting the purchase. Upon this question the learned judge instructed the jury that if she made the purchase with her own money exclusively she acquired thereby a title good against her husband and his creditors, but that if she connived or colluded with him in the purchase of the property by using any of the money which he received for his house in Green Ridge, in payment of the purchase money, then the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. “ If on the other hand you find the wife’s hands are clean, even though the husband may have sold his property for the purpose of hindering and delaying his creditors, then your verdict should be in her favor, because she is not responsible for his misdeeds unless she joins in them.” But he said much more upon'this subject, and, omitting all reference to collusion between the husband and wife, told the jury plainly that if the husband’s money went into the purchase of this lot the plaintiff <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>ought to recover, and that the burden of showing that it did not was upon her. He said: “ She must show she obtained the money from some other source than from him or through him. If she fails to overcome that burden, then prima facie his money paid for it. But if you fail to find from the evidence in the case that his money went into it, then even if he sold his property at Green Ridge for the purpose of cheating his creditors, the wife might still be entitled to recover.” When we consider all the learned judge said to the jury upon this subject, we do not feel that they were misled, or left without adequate instructions. The good faith of the purchase by the wife with her own property or credit was properly made the turning point in the cause. This was correct. The jury may have erred, but it does not seem that any responsibility for such error, if error there was, rests upon the learned judge.</p>
