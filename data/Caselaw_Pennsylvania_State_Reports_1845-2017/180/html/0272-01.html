The evidence showed that he had been instructed how to work the machine. The machine was fastened to the floor in the manner which is customary to fasten machines to floors in factories. On the day of the accident, while the machine was in operation, the belt which communicated the power to the machine slipped off the shaft pulley, was caught on the set screws, and pulled the machine from its fasten<a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>ings, causing it to fall over on the plaintiff, seriously injuring him.

Plaintiff was a Pole and could not speak English. He was placed at the machine at his own request, and was instructed how to run it, not only by the foreman, but also by one of the workmen. The machine in question was made of iron, and was fastened to the floor by iron screws. Several witnesses testified that it was fastened to the floor in the manner customary to fasten machinery in factories. The machine is described by the appellant in his “ History of the Case ” as follows: “ The barrel machine is a heavy iron machine weighing about one half of a ton. There is a pulley at the right end of the machine where the workman stands to work at it, which is driven by a belt from a line of shafting back of the workman. The direction of the belt was such that the pull of it tended to draw the machine toward the workman. It is what is called a windlass machine. The workman pushes a lever with his feet by which a friction pulley is pressed against the belt pulley, and thereby the machine is started to work to compress the barrel so that the workman can put a hoop upon it. The legs of the machine are made so that at the bottom the feet extend out horizontally about two inches, and through the feet there is a hole in the castings for the insertion of a lag screw, a half of an inch in diameter and five inches long.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.14",295,[194,2142,1167,298]]]'>The accident was caused by the plaintiff putting too great a pressure upon the lever which pushed the friction pulley against the loose pulley, thereby causing the belt to slip from the pulley on the shafting above. The belt caught on the set screws and pulled the machine from its fastenings, when it fell over on the plaintiff, breaking his leg so that it had to be amputated.</p>

For it is negligence alone that causes that, and as our law now says, the duty is upon the plaintiff to show that there was some negligence upon the part of his employer. [He seems to have given him all the instructions he could.] [4] He is an adult man. He does not speak the language, but the evidence is that he understands it a little; and as I said before, anybody that knows anything about foreign languages knows that you can distinctly comprehend a language without being able to speak it; and a man who has been in this country for a year or two, mingling with business men and tradesmen, would probably understand the language, though he might not be able to speak it or to be examined in it. [The defendant appears to have done all that was necessary to instruct this man in the use of this machine at which he was put to work.] [5] It was his duty, therefore, to protect himself against any danger. The only question upon which I have had any doubt is the manner in which the machine was fastened to the floor. [If it was put down as the witness Kiesal first testified, or according to the impression that he gave by his testimony, it would, it seems to me, have then been improperly secured. But upon his reexamination, and upon the examination of the other witnesses who were familiar with the manner in which the machine was put down, it seems to have been attached or fastened to the floor, just as other machinery of that nature usually are in all factories, or in most of the factories at least, in which they are used.] [6] An employer is not bound to employ the best means; he must employ the usual ordinary means for the preservation of the life and limb of his employee, and if a manufacturer employs the usual means, if he has his machinery set up in the usual way, then he is not liable for an accident, because, as I said a moment ago, our world is full of accidents that constantly are happening, and it will not do to say that the man who is hurt must be paid for every accident. .Men must <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>be careful when they go to work at a machine, must be careful how they use it. After hearing all the testimony I cannot find sufficient evidence of any negligence here upon the part of the defendant to warrant you in giving the plaintiff a verdict.] [7] Nor do I find any evidence of contributory negligence. [It seems to have been an accident, one of those things that occur at any time, without our exactly knowing why they occur. It seems to me that it was a pure accident, resulting, perhaps, from something that was done; we do not know what it was.] [8] [I, therefore, under the evidence, direct you to find a verdict for the defendant, and to this charge I give a general exception.] [9]</p>
