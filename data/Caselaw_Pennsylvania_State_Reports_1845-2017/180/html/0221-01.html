She rented a house, furnished it and took up her residence in it. Her husband requested her to return to him, stating that if she did not return to him, he would have to break off housekeeping. She refused to return, although on several occasions she went to his house, taking her food with her. She told several witnesses that her purpose in going to her husband’s house was to “ raise the devil.” The respondent testified that she always regarded the libellant’s house as her home, and after January 21, 1893, helped in the household work. She stated that she went away to learn to sew on a sewing machine, and that she had rented a house so that she would have a place to go to, as the rest of the family were doing all they could to get her out.
