Counsel for the accountants, alleging that the decedent was surety only, and that Nelson Bros. &amp; Co. were the principal debtors in the transaction out of which the judgment obtained as above by the Commercial National Bank had its origin, asked to be allowed to make an investigation of the accounts of the alleged principal debtor and the bank.

    <p class="summary" id="b254-5" data-blocks='[["BL_254.6",254,[257,739,1165,1117]]]'>In this case a claim was presented to the auditing judge upon a judgment obtained in the court of common pleas, which judgment was subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court: Bank v. McClain, <a href="/pa/171/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="171 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="985598" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0132-01">171 Pa. 132</a>. It was alleged that this estate had a defense to the judgment. It is immaterial for the purpose of this decision to state what the defense was. It is sufficient to say that the auditing judge very properly overruled the offer, upon the ground that the validity of the judgment could not be impeached collaterally. When the parties and the cause of action are the same here as in the court of common pleas, the presumption is that the questions presented for decision were the same. But this case rises much higher than a presumption, for the claim is attempted to be defended against here upon the very same ground that it was defended there. The subject of the controversy is, therefore, res adjudicata, and would not again be considered and tried by the court which has jurisdiction in the matter, much less by another court which might have had jurisdiction originally. Every question which properly belonged to the subject, and which the parties might have brought forward at the time, must now be considered as settled, and the judgment in the court of common pleas conclusive between them.</p>

The fund was raised by the settlement of an account by the executors, the appellants. Among the claimants upon the fund was the Commercial National Bank of Philadelphia, the appellee. Its claim was upon a judgment m its favor and against the estate of the decedent, regularly entered in the court of common pleas No. 1, upon a verdict rendered by the jury 'after a trial had in due form. The payment of this judgment was resisted, not by reason of anything happening since the judgment was rendered, but for reasons that were used as a defense to the claim on the trial in the common pleas which resulted in the judgment. It was an ingenious effort to retry the cause in the orphans’ court, and thereby to reach a different result from that reached on the trial in the common pleas. The learned judges of the orphans’ court declined to hear the defense so set up, holding that they were without power to retry the cause or to attack the judgment collaterally. The correctness of this ruling is really the only question raised by this appeal. The general doctrine affirming the conclusiveness of a judgment as an adjudication upon the questions covered by it does not seem to be denied by the appellants. It is too well settled to be successfully attacked. The effort appears rather to be to persuade the orphans’ court that, although the evidence in relation to the accounts between the bank and McClain and the bank and Nelson Bros. &amp; Co. was all before the jury on the trial in the common pleas, it could not have received the attention it deserved at the hands of the jury, or the amount of their verdict would have been less by about $2,000 than that which they returned. Even if this was true, the remedy of the appellants would be in the court in which the trial took place. In the orphans’ court the judgment is not subject to correction, nor can the mistakes of the jury be considered. A judgment may be corrected for mistake and impeached for fraud, but it must be done by the court in which it was rendered, and on a proper application. It cannot be done in a collateral proceeding : Hamilton v. Seitz, <a href="/pa/25/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="25 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="975776" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0226-01">25 Pa. 226</a>; Philadelphia v.
