    <p class="summary" id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[251,640,1177,1273]]]'>It is by no means clear that the question of the validity of the judgment is an open one as between the attaching creditors and the estate of the testator. The record shows that under the levy upon the real estate of Robert Sheppard upon the execution issued by them on their judgment, the proceeds of sale were paid by the sheriff oil the judgment of the estate as first lien. This involved a determination by the proper authorities that as between the execution creditors and the judgment the latter was not only prior in lien, but, necessarily, that it was valid and unimpeachable. Treating it, however, as still open, the auditing judge is of the opinion that the validity of the judgment has been fully established. That there was an actual indebtedness — assuming that the admission of the debtor was not sufficient to establish it — was clearly shown. The firm of Avhich Robert Sheppard was a member made an assignment for the benefit of their creditors, and the account of their assignees ivas referred by the court of common pleas, No. 4, to an auditor Avhose report shows that the meeting before him was attended by counsel for Halsey &amp; Smith and by Robert Sheppard; and •that among the claims presented and admitted to be correct were those of Halsey <em>&amp; </em>Smith for $3,054.88, upon which a dividend of $187.81 was awarded, and Furman Sheppard (the testator) for $21,513.18, the dividend on which was $1,322.

But, it was contended by Mr. Bliss, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations at the time of the confession of judgment, and Halsey &amp; Smith, by reason of their prior attachment had acquired a lien upon the share of their debtor in the estate which deprived him of the power to waive the statute even as against a claim the validity of which, with the legal and moral obligations thus implied, he himself fully recognized. It is not easy to see how the attachment could confer such a right. The attachment binds only the interest of the debtor in the estate of the testator, and the interest does not arise until it has been ascertained how much of the estate has already been received by him. The lien does not extend to the conscience of the debtor. If instead of obtaining the confession of judgment the executrix had brought suit for recovery of the debt, nothmg short of the pleading of the statute could have prevented an adverse judgment. It can scarcely be pretended that an attachment creditor of the defendant to the suit would have the right to intervene and make defense. The judgment so obtained could not be impeached collaterally except on the ground of fraud, and it is a maxim of the law that whatever a man may be compelled to do, he may do voluntarily, as in this case, he may confess judgment if judgment can be obtained against Mm by due process of law: Co.

Nor is the failure to set up the statute as a defense to an honest claim available as a ground for contesting the validity of a judgment on the part of the persons having a lien on the fund, which, by reason of such judgment would yield them a smaller dividend. This was decided in Woods v. Irwin, <a href="/pa/141/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="141 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="974918" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0278-01">141 Pa. 278</a>, which in principle, in the opinion of the auditing judge. <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>rules the present case. There an executor of an insolvent estate confessed judgment for a bona fide debt, barred by the statute, and creditors sought on that ground to have the judgment opened and set aside, but the Supreme Court, overruling the court below, sustained its validity. Creditors, at the death of their debtor, acquire a lien upon his estate, and their rights by reason of this are no less sacred than the rights which are obtained by judicial proceeding; as was said by Judge Agnew in Nice’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/54/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="54 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1006279" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0200-01">54 Pa. 200</a>, “ Death casts the estate into an unchangeable mould, the law then fixing its condition and prescribing its management and its distribution.” See also Kater v.

The objection to the confession of judgment and the waiver of the statute in Wood v. Irwin had, therefore, quite as much force as it has when urged by a creditor who has attached the interest of his debtor in an estate to which the latter is indebted, and this being the case, it is unnecessary to refer in detail to numerous authorities, largely from other states, cited by Mr. Bliss, or to show how they are distinguishable.</p>
