The property had been used by the lessor as a soap factory, and this use was continued by the defendants. The only new appliance which the defendants used was a rendering tank which exploded and caused the injuries for which suit was brought. It was claimed by the plaintiff that the explosion was caused by the vent pipe of the tank becoming clogged. It was also averred by him that the tank was not strong enough to withstand the pressure of steam that was put upon it.</p>

[The building, while in the possession of the defendants, was seriously injured and for that injury the plaintiff seeks to recover damages here. The position of the counsel for plaintiff is that even if Arbogast &amp; Bastían were not in fault; that if, even without any negligence on their part, this building was wrecked, the owner can recover damages for'the injury to the building. He contends that the law is that when one becomes the tenant of a building, and nothing is said as to returning it to the owner in the same condition in which the tenant receives it, the tenant must nevertheless restore it in the same condition in which he receives it, and that if he does not do so he is liable for any injury the building may have sustained. We rule that point against the plaintiff and say that the defendants are not liable for the injury to this building unless it is proved that it was wrecked or injured by the negligence or default of the defendants.] [4] It appears from the testimony that the explosion which caused the injury to this building occurred on February 8, 1895. It further appeared that on that day the defendants, through Mr. Eastman, who was employed by them, were engaged in the business of trying fat in this building; that he put the scraps into this tank, and had steam in the boiler, which, by means of a pipe, was connected with the tank, and that the steam was turned on and into the tank, and that between 12 and 1 o’clock of that day the head of the tank — the tank, it seems, stood on end — blew out, and the flying pieces did some injury, and the concussion and force of the air did other injury, and according to the testimony the building was seriously damaged. As I have already said to you, Arbogast and Bastían are not required to pay for the injury to the building, although the building was in their possession as tenants, unless it is proved that they were negligent in its use. I may mention here in passing that it is an admitted fact in the case that after the explosion Arbogast &amp; Bastían abandoned the building and did not occupy it thereafter.</p>

The tank has been ■described to you as a tubular iron construction, some 42 or 43 inches in diameter, and that it stood about 48 inches in height; ■one of the witnesses said that the sides were of wrought iron, ■of a certain thickness, and that the head was of cast iron about three quarters of an inch thick. Was the defendant guilty of negligence in having that tank of the strength it was, and operating it as he did? It appears that this tank had a manhole in the top which was used to throw in the material, and that it had a hole in the bottom which was used to take out the refuse ■after the fat had been fried; it also appears that at the time it was in operation there was a vent or escape pipe leading out from the tank of half an inch in diameter, and which was used to relieve the pressure of the steam in the tank — the steam, as I have already stated to you, came through a pipe from the boiler, which was 12 or 14 feet from the tank. . . .</p>

[It has been stated to you that this vent, or half-inch escape pipe, might have been closed. But there is no proof that it was •closed, or that it got clogged up, and you cannot guess that it was closed or clogged up. The man in charge left for five or :seven minutes. There is, however, no evidence from which you could find that if the man in charge had his eyes off the tank for five or seven minutes that that would be negligence. Therefore, gentlemen, I discover no evidence from which you •could find that there was negligence in the manner in which the tank was used.] [8] [There is still, of course, the question as to whether this tank was strong enough to withstand the pressure ■ of steam that was put upon it; and that, in the <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>end, resolves itself into a question as to the construction of this tank. Nobody has testified that 45 or 50 pounds pressure of steam is too much to turn into a tank used for trying fat. But, of course, it ought to be strong enough to stand the force that is applied to it. So we say to you, gentlemen of the jury, that the only question of negligence that you can consider, and which you could possibly find against the defendant, will be as to whether this tank ivas too weak — whether it was defectively constructed — and that inquiry must be confined to the head of the tank, because nothing else broke.] [9] ....</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b435-3" data-blocks='[["BL_435.5",435,[218,896,1174,1532]],["BL_436.1",436,[269,380,1171,355]]]'>[It has been argued to you that the pressure on the head of the tank was different because there was this material in 'the tank. Nobody, however, has said that the steam coming in contact with this fatty material creates any gases which would make a greater pressure, and it is for you to determine whether that does make any difference. If you throw into a tank different materials, and the combination does not work any chemical changes evolving powerful gases, it strikes me that the fact that those materials are in the tank will not affect the pressure; the pressure might in fact be a little less than if the whole space were occupied by steam. If it fits you can apply this kind of reasoning when you come to pass upon the testimony of Mr. Collum, or to that of any other witness who has testified that he has knowledge about boilers but does not know anything about tanks.. Mr. Collum said, I think, but I will not state it as a fact that he did say so, as I may not remember correctly, that a tank with a head such as this was said to have been, would in his opinion stand a pressure of 75 pounds, and I think he said that the safe working pressure would be 18 or 20 pounds. Gentlemen of the jury, that is all a matter for you, but there is some danger that you might be misled as to this matter. If prudent and careful inspection and examination finds that a construction is strong enough to withstand a pressure of 70 pounds ought it to be said then that the party using it was negligent in putting on a pressure of 45 or 50 pounds? When a witness says that although it will stand a pressure of 75 pounds a pressure of 18 or 20 would be a safe pressure you ought to take that expression as the witness made it; if it withstands a pressure of 70 pounds it will not burst under a pressure of 20 ; it would not burst with a pressure of 30; it would not burst with <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>a pressure of 60. But to be on the very safe side better not raise the pressure above 18 or 20; if you were using a rope and you had tested it and found that it would carry 70 pounds, and you then put a strain of 50 pounds upon it, it strikes me that no one could say justly that you were reckless and negligent, even though some one might think that in order to be on the extreme safe side you ought only to put on a strain of 20.] [10]</p>

The statute of 6 Anne, chap. 31, which relieved the tenant from liability for the consequences of accidental fires has never been in force in this state, and it has been formally adopted by few if any of the other states, except New Jersey. Chancellor Kent, 4 Kent’s Com. 82, says : “ Perhaps the universal silence of our courts upon the subject of any such responsibility of the tenant for accidental fires is presumptive evidence that the doctrine of permissive waste has never been introduced and carried to that extent in the common law jurisprudence of the United States.” In U. S. v. Bostwick, <a href="/us/94/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="94 U.S. 53" data-case-ids="5644516" data-case-paths="/us/94/0053-01">supra,</a> it was held that the implied covenant of the tenant is not to repair generally, but so to use the property as to make repairs unnecessary as far as possible, and that it is a covenant against voluntary waste only.

    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[237,566,1173,1170]]]'>There could be no recovery without proof of the defendants’ negligence, and the burden of proof rested upon the plaintiff. The lease was in parol, for one year, with no agreement to repair or to deliver the premises in good order and condition at the end of the term. No new or different use was made of the building by the tenants. It was used by them for the purpose for which it had been leased, and for which it had been fitted with machinery and used by the lessor. The only new appliance used was the rendering tank which exploded. In the use of the property leased the defendants were under an implied duty not to negligently injure it. The standard of their duty was reasonable care. The mere fact of the explosion did not throw upon them the burden of proving that they were not negligent. The burden of proof was with the plaintiff throughout the trial. He was not bound in the first instance to prove more than enough to raise a presumption of negligence on the part of the defendants. Proof of the explosion and of the attendant circumstances might have furnished sufficient ground for a reasonable inference of negligence to have made out a prima facie case, but he could not rest his case upon a bare presumption based only upon the fact that the explosion occurred. The answers to the third, fourth and fifth points affirmed these propositions and are free from error.</p>

An inadequate presentation of the case, when the omission to charge leaves the jury without direction on important questions involved, or plainly tends to mislead them, is ground for reversal. In this case the charge was clear and full. The omission now complained of was in not calling the attention of the jury to some features of the case which counsel at the time did not deem of sufficient importance to mention, and which may have been discovered only by a critical analysis of the charge made since the trial.</p>
