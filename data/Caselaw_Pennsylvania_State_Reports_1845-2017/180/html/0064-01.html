The only witness called by defendant was John Rodgers, who had been a clerk in the office of Richard C. McMurtrie, and who produced books and testified that the payments had been made on account of two or three mortgages, and had been properly apportioned among them. The defendant also offered in evidence the record of an equity proceeding in Delaware county for an account, in which Mary M. Black, administratrix of Edgar N. Black, is the plaintiff, and the trustees of Bohlen’s estate are the defendants; also joined by the executrix of Richard G. McMurtrie, for an accounting of the interest moneys' and the principal of the mortgages, and to show that in that proceeding a judgment was entered pro confesso. . The offer was objected to, objection sustained and bill sealed for defendant. [3]</p>

It seems there was not only one mortgage, but two or three mortgages, and the amounts that were paid according to his books were apportioned among those mortgages. I cannot see that there is any defense in this case, therefore your verdict ought to be for the amount that is due.</p>
