Is there in this case any infringement of the rule ? The will gives the estate to the executors in trust to pay the net income to the daughters for life, with direction that “at their decease” it shall “be equally divided among their children who may be then living, and the issue of any deceased child or children, whether herein named or not, as they arrive at legal age.” Whether the division at the death of the daughters is, in terms, of the principal of the estate 'or of income only, is immaterial — a gift of income for an unlimited period is the equivalent of a gift of the estate from which it issues: Garret v. Rex, <a href="/watts/6/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Watts 14" data-case-ids="1846076" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0014-01">6 Watts, 14</a>; Pennsylvania Co.’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/88/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="88 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1061208" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0312-01">88 Pa. 312</a>; Sproul’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="105 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="454249" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0438-01">105 Pa. 438</a>. The real question is, When does the gift take effect? The answer to this is found in the express provision of the will that the division is to be “ at the decease ” of the daughters, among their children then living and the issue of any (then) deceased child or children. It is contended, however, that the subsequent words “ as they arrive at legal age ” must be understood as deferring the vesting of the interests until such arrival, and as this might not occur within the limits of the rule, the gift falls as being in contravention of it. But the direction as to the time of the division is explicit, and no rule of construction requires that controlling effect shall be given to the words relied upon to defeat the direction. On the contrary, they are to be understood simply as indicating the time of payment and not in a sense which would render the previous provision meaningless and nugatory. Where no violence is done to the words of a testator, a construction which sustains a will and prevents an intestacy — either as the result of a failure to dispose, or by reason of the alleged illegality of the disposition — is to be preferred <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>to one that makes it invalid: Gray on Perpetuities, sec. 638.

N. 538; Stivers’ Estate, 21 W. N. 335, etc. Of course, if the will contained a limitation over in case of the failure of issue of the ténant for life to attain full age, as in Seibert’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/13/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="13 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="964927" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0501-01">13 Pa. 501</a>, the construction would be different — the question in such case not being affected by the rule which seeks to avoid intestacy or invalidity; but, as was said in McClure’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20Pa.%20415" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="72 Pa. 415">72 Pa. 415</a>, and in many other cases, if the limitation is by way of remainder after a life estate, and the arrival of the time of payment is not absolutely necessary before the gift can attach in the legatee, it will be regarded as vested with postponement of payment only; vesting rather than contingency being favored, and doubts being resolved in its favor. Upon this point see further, Judge Shabswood’s remarks in Provenchere’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20Pa.%20466" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="67 Pa. 466">67 Pa. 466</a>. We think the estates in the present case will vest at the expiration of the estates given to the daughters, and that the will creates no perpetuity. The trust, therefore, must be preserved for the protection of the future interests.</p>
