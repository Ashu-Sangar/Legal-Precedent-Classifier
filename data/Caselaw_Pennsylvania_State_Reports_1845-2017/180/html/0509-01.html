On May 7, 1890, a contract <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>was entered into between the borough of Rochester and the Valley "Water Company, its successors and assigns, whereby it agreed to supply the borough of Rochester with water for fire protection and for domestic use, and the borough was to pay the company $45.00 per annum for each fire plug, for five years, with the option to continue the contract five years longer. On May 8, 1890, the borough granted to the company, its successors and assigns, the right to use the streets, and required the water company to begin work within six months, and to be readj’ to supply water within eighteen months. All the property and franchises of the Valley Water Company were duly transferred to the plaintiff company. The finding of facts shows, among other things, in substance, that the plaintiff proceeded, in good faith, to construct a plant adequate for the purpose of supplying water to the borough and the public within its limits, in a manner satisfactory to the borough authorities; that it has since continued to supply water, reasonably fit for use, and in good faith to carry out the purposes of its incorporation.</p>

The referee’s finding shows that the works theretofore constructed by the plaintiff company were superior to that contemplated by the borough under its contract, and that the quality of water supplied by the plaintiff is superior to that proposed to be supplied by the borough.</p>

When his report was completed and ready for filing, the parties were invited to examine the same, and except to anything therein that either of them might consider erroneous. Availing themselves of this invitation, both parties filed exceptions, five (5) on behalf of the plaintiffs, and sixty-nine (69) on behalf of the defendants. Fifty-three (53) of the latter are to questions of fact. This necessitated a careful revision of his report by the referee, with special reference to said exceptions, the net result of which was the amendment of his fourth (4) and ninth (9) findings of fact by adding to the end of each the words, “ as <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>may desire the same ” — employed in the charter of each of the water companies.</p>

In view of the careful consideration that has been given by the referee to the questions involved, and the satisfactory manner in which they have been disposed of in his report, further discussion of them or either of them has been deemed unnecessary.
