It further discloses that this was an altercation arising out of and provoked by alleged abusive epithets and wrangling, and it did not take place on the defendant’s car, nor on any property or premises of the defendant, but on the public highway, the person who was employed, acting as motorman at the time, having left his post without permission, and thereby left the employment and service of the company and engaged in this alleged quarrel and assault and battery on the public highway, it being his own wilful and independent act. The altercation and assault and battery were clearly, not in the line of the duty of the motorman, and, therefore, the defendant corporation is in no way responsible. If the facts set forth and alleged are true, it was the independent, wilful act of the person who, although at the time employed as a motorman of the defendant, was manifestly not acting in that capacity in committing this assault, and the testimony is therefore irrelevant and immaterial.</p>

This for the purpose of showing that the car had come so close (probably within six or eight feet of the wagon) that the motorman or servant of the ■defendant company considered it necessary to remove the plaintiff and his wagon so as to operate the car of the defendant company, which was in the direct line of his employment; and for the further purpose of showing that when the said motorman undertook to remove the plaintiff and his wagon, he did it with a view to further his master’s interest, and not on account of any grudge or spite that he had against the plaintiff.</p>
