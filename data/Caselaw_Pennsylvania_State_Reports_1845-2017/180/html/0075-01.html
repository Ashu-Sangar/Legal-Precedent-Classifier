The plaintiff tripped on a pile of dirt, and as he did so he stumbled and fell immediately in front of the wheels of an omnibus which ran over him. The omnibus at the time was on the west or left hand side of the street. The plaintiff and one witness testified that at the time the boy fell, the driver was looking towards the east side of the street. The driver sat on a high seat with a dashboard at the top of the omnibus. <em>Held, </em>that a nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

I was more to the curb — between the middle of the street and the curbstone ; I was more towards the gutter. Q. Do you mean the west side ? A. Yes, sir; the west side of the street. Q. Have you any idea about how many feet you were from the curbstone ? A. No, sir; I can’t tell you about that. Q. In stumbling you say you turned around? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you go down on your hands?
