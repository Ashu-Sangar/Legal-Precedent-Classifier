Along the part of Front street here in question there is a public sidewalk extending back from the curb 11 feet all along the east side, and a like public sidewalk on the west side extending as far south as about 4 feet beyond the north side of said Rolling Mill alley — said sidewalks are part of the highway; (all the property owners set their buildings back at least 11 feet from where the curb now is, the borough authorities assumed and exercised control of said sidewalks.)

Shortly before the filing of this bill, defendants began the work of constructing a railroad (which it seems was completed at the time of the hearing) along the east side of their said establishment (from tracks to the south of their premises) to a point to the north of a point opposite to the north line of plaintiff, to be used for the purposes of their said business, including the carrying of scrap-iron to said scrap-house, and it was used for said purposes; cars were moved upon it by a locomotive, and on several occasions quantities of scrap-iron were unloaded <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>from the cars and thrown into said scrap house; the noise caused by the operation of said railroad and the unloading of the scrap-iron at times affected plaintiff’s dwelling injuriously — but only to a slight degree. The operation of the said railroad renders plaintiff’s premises less desirable as a living place than it would be if there were not such operation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b223-3" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[244,682,1170,918]]]'>7. Said railroad is in part on said highway; its original location is shown by the draft appended to defendants’ answer, which draft is found to be a correct representation of matters here in issue; for several hundreds of feet south of plaintiff’s premises the east rail is 2 feet nearly outside of the curb, or theoretical curb line; at a point opposite to plaintiff’s south line it curves to the west, crosses said alley, and where the curb on the west side begins as aforesaid, the track is entirely on the sidewalk space — and a few feet north of the scrap-house it again curves to the west, so that opposite plaintiff’s north line it is entirely on defendants’ land — inside of the building or line 11 feet back from the curb. The president of the defendant company testified that after said draft was made (and answer filed) said track was moved farther in (west) in the vicinity of a point opposite plaintiff’s south line, so that there the outside rail is on the curb, or theoretical curb line; opposite plaintiff’s premises the outside rail is on or within such curb line now; the fact on this point is as testified as above stated.</p>

Defendants are not vested with the right of eminent domain. Even if the borough authorities had granted leave to put the track where it is, such action would have been void and would affect no one. That this is so is conceded by defendants’ counsel. Defendants’ contention is that plaintiff’s premises have not been injured and, even if injured that he has not shown that he is specially damaged, that if he is affected, it is only as the public generally is affected; that he is entitled to no relief in this proceeding. .</p>

Citizens Railway <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>Company, <a href="/pa/151/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="151 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="836709" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0138-01">151 Pa. 138</a> and Thomas v.

Said act declares that in all proceedings in law or equity in which it is alleged that the private rights of individuals, or of other corporations are injured or invaded by any corporation claiming to have a right to do the act by which such injury results it shall be the duty of the court to ascertain whether such corporation does possess the right to do such act, and if such rights have not been conferred upon such corporation the court, if exercising equitable power, shall by injunction, at the suit of private parties or other corporations, restrain such injurious acts; and if the proceedings be at law it shall be lawful therein to recover damages. In said Germantown railway case the two companies plaintiff sought to enjoin the Germantown company from laying railway tracks on Germantown avenue. The Supreme Court said that there was no merit in the contention, that the companies plaintiff had no standing to contest defendant’s right; that said act of 1871 recognized the plaintiffs’ right to be heard. Said case of Thomas v. Railway Company was a proceeding in equity wherein it was sought to restrain the defendant from building a street railway on Ridge street in the borough of Lansford. Plaintiff was the owner of property abutting on said street. The court below granted the injunction. The Supreme Court affirmed the decree. In the opinion of the higher court by Justice Williams it is said that defendant was in the street in front of plaintiff’s premises without municipal consent and was committing a nuisance; that the abutting owner was not debarred from proceeding in such a case because there were other lot owners on the same street who suffered in the same manner that he did; that the plaintiff had what was called a general interest in the streets as a citizen and a special interest in that street as an abutting owner who must use it as a means of access to his property; he therefore had a right to object to its obstruction by a mere wrongdoer. In this case defendant company is a corporation; it, like the defendant in the case last alluded to, by occupying the street, is a trespasser. Defendants’ counsel’s argument that the railroad is not on plaintiff’s side of the street, and that it cannot be found that it obstructs access to his property, must be answered by saying that plaintiff’s right to the use of the <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>highway <em>on </em>which his property is located is not confined to a path to drive or walk to and from his house, but consists of the right to the whole highway — all of the driveway and all the sidewalks on both sides of the street.</p>
