Presumably he was endeavoring to save himself the trouble of getting off the bicycle by keeping it running while he was waiting. To the left of him was a toolhouse, which toolhouse, according to the testimony of the only witness who has said anything about it, was about twenty feet from Smith street. Between the toolhouse and the track was a space of seven feet. Directly after the freight train had gone by the decedent rode out from behind the toolhouse, where he could <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>not see the approaching train, and went directly across the track. One witness says that he did not stop. The other witness tells us that just as the freight train left he started and went across. As I have said, between the toolhouse and the track was a space of seven feet. Not a very large space, it is true, but still enough so that if a man had stopped within it it would have enabled him to save his life.</p>

No doubt seven feet would have been ample for one who was walking, and we may assume that one riding a bicycle has it within his own control, not, perhaps, to the extent of a man who is walking, but certainly very much more so than one who is driving horses where it may be dangerous to stop within so short a space. Had he stopped within seven feet he could have seen for some distance westward along the track. Just how far we do not know, but Howell has said he could have seen for one hundred feet.</p>

He was riding a bicycle, and when he came to defendant’s road, which at that point had four tracks, a freight train was passing, for which he had to wait. He did not dismount, but made what the appellant calls a “ bicycler’s stop ” by circling on his wheel round and round at a distance of fire to ten yards from the track, and when the freight train had passed he started across without dismounting, and was struck by a train coming in the opposite direction on another track. Passing by the questions raised as to Iris ability to see the coming train from other points, it is admitted that before reaching a position of actual danger there was a space of not less than seven feet between the toolhouse and the nearest track, from which an unobstructed view of the train could have been had. It was the duty of the deceased to stop there and to dismount in order to make his stop effective for the purpose of looking and listening. The real contention of the appellant is embodied in the proposition that the circling round and round constituted a legal as well as a “bicycler’s stop.” No such proposition can be entertained for a moment. In so circling the rider must to some extent have his attention fixed on his wheel, and at parts of the circle must have his back to the track which he is professing to watch. The law requires a full stop, not only for the sake of time and opportunity for observation, but to secure undivided attention, and the substantial and not merely perfunctory performance of the duty to look and listen. Riding round and round in large or small circles, waiting for a chance to shoot across, is not a stop at all, either in form or substance. Considering the ease of dismounting and the control of the rider over his instrument, a bicycler must under all ordinary circumstances be treated as subject to the same rules as a pedestrian. We do not say that there may not be cases of accident by broken gearing, or steep grade or other casualty which will require a modification of the application of such rules, but these cases will be exceptional, and must be decided on their own facts when they arise. The <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>general rule to be applied requires that a bicycler must dismount, or at least bring his wheel to such a stop as will enable him to look up and down the track and listen, in the manner required of a pedestrian. It is plain that the deceased in the present case did not do this, and that his failure to do it was an efficient element of the unfortunate accident by which he lost his life.</p>
