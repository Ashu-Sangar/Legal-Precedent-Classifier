      <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>The opinion of the orphans’ court by Ashman, J., was as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[248,472,1175,1889]]]'>The petition for the appointment of a trustee assumes that there is an active and subsisting trust. The will gave to the widow “ in trust ” all of the estate, “ the net income ” of which was, with certain exceptions, to belong to her for life. At her death, which has occurred, the personal estate was given to the children absolutely, and the real estate to them, naming them, “ in trust, the net income of which shall belong to them, share and share alike, and at their death, I give, devise, and bequeath the same to their heirs, administrators, and assigns. In the event of any one of my children dying without heirs, then his share shall be given to the survivors or survivor.” An analysis of the.cases in Pennsylvania, which have settled the distinction between active and dry trusts, will show that, in the former class, the duty to be performed by the trustee must not only involve some positive action on his part, but an action attended with some discretion. The automatic function of merely receiving for the cestui que trust and immediately paying over to him the trust fund or its income will not make a trust active. The •cestui que trust could perform the act as well, and he has no protection in the superior judgment of the trustee, because the trustee is not empowered to exercise his judgment. The cases properly describe him as a mere conduit. But when the trustee is invested with a discretion however slight, he takes the place of the donor, and the trust committed to him is active. A trust for the protection of the beneficiary, who may be a spendthrift, or a married woman, or a party in remainder, stands, of course, on a different footing, and is equally valid, whether the duties of the trustee are active or passive. That this testator intended to create a trust in his real estate is clear, because he said that much when he devised it “in trust.” That he intended the trust to be active is equally clear, because he directed the trustee to pay over the “net income.” But the net income of real estate is only that portion which remains after the payment oi taxes, repairs, and commissions, and a large measure of discretion is incident to the payment of at least one of these charges. If the trustee should pay over the gross income to the cestui que trust, he would be liable for mismanagement.</p>
