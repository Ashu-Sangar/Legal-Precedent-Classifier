While some hold that it is permissible to use the articles prohibited by the general printed clause, provided they are such as naturally pertain to the stock of, goods or property described in the written part of the policy, this court has refused to go so far. In Birmingham Fire Ins. Co. v. Kroegher, <a href="/citations/?q=83%20Pa.%2066" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="83 Pa. 66">83 Pa. 66</a>, where petroleum was kept for sale in a country store in violation of a printed clause very-similar to that above quoted, this court said: “ If the question were whether tins kind of oil was an article of merchandise ordinarily included in the stock of a country store, or if it were only an inquiry as to the increase of risk, it might well be referred to the jury. But it is nothing of the kind: it is an express stipulation that petroleum or its <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>products shall not be kept on the premises, and if it be so kept the policy is void. It matters not that it was part of a customary stock of goods, for by express contract it was excluded.” This case was followed in Lancaster Fire Ins. Co. v. Lenheim &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/89/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="89 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1063210" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0497-01">89 Pa. 497</a>, and must be accepted as the settled construction of such conditions. In the first of these cases, however, —Birmingham Fire Ins. Co. v. Kroegher, supra — a qualification was suggested which has since been adopted, and which the learned trial judge in this case sought to carry to a length not warranted by any of our cases. It was there said by Mr. Justice Gordon: “It is probable that this provision would not apply to the oil used in lighting the premises, for such a use has, in these days, become a necessity for all buildings in the country in which light is required during the night.” This suggested distinction, in principle, has since been adopted in Mears v. Humboldt Fire Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/92/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="92 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="490969" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0015-01">92 Pa. 15</a>, Lancaster Silver Plate Co. v.

In the latter, our Brother Dean, speaking for the court, said: “ If the fact were that the use were a necessary one in conducting the business, then it must be presumed the intent of the parties was to insure the subject of the contract as it then was, and as it would continue to be during the life of the policy, notwithstanding the printed condition.” A further and fuller discussion of this subject will be found in the next preceding case, — Lancaster Silver Plate Co. v National Fire Ins. Co., supra. These cases rest on the necessary and contemplated use of the property, and cannot be supported on any other ground. They furnish no warrant for the advanced position taken by the plaintiff in this case. There is no ground for a presumption that the parties here contemplated even the temporary presence of fireworks in the insured building in the face of an express contract to the contrary.</p>
