In 1882, they duly executed a mortgage on the premises to secure a debt of the wife, upon <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>which mortgage the property was sold to the defendants, and a ■conveyance by the sheriff made to them on Feb. 20,1893. The mill, which' was an old One, had been run entirely by water power until 1886, in which year the'plaintiff at his own expense placed upon the property a boiler and engine, with suitable connections, for the purpose of furnishing steam power when the water was low. The walls of the mill were of brick and stone, and the engine and boiler were set upon a brick foundation in a small frame building which was built up to and against one of the mill walls. Necessary shafting passed through one of the mill windows, and the belt worked through an opening which was cut in the brick wall for that purpose, whilst people went from one building to the other beneath the ground floor. The engine was never run except when the dam was very low, consequently at the time of the sheriff’s sale it had been actually used only about seven months. Notice was duly given at the sale that the plaintiff claimed title to the articles in dispute. The defendants took charge of the premises immediately after the deed was given, and in the following month put in an additional pump in order that the steam machinery might be properly operated. In April, the plaintiff moved away, leaving the machinery in place at the' buildings, and the present action is for the purpose of recovering its value, upon the theory that it was improperly taken and used by the defendants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[278,1595,1170,707]]]'>The right of a tenant for years to remove what are called trade fixtures during his term, although affixed to the freehold, has'been generally recognized both in this country and in England. In all the recent cases, however, the true criterion has been held to be the intention on the part of the tenant to remove the fixtures during his term, at the time he placed them upon the property. The manner of their annexation is no longer the test: Carver v. Gough, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20Pa.%20225" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="163 Pa. 225">163 Pa. 225</a>. Yet if fixtures, which the tenant might rémove during his term, be suffered to remain after its expiration, they become inseparable from the freehold, and an action will not lie by the tenant to recover damages for their conversion. Whilst they remain attached, they are part of the realty: White v. Arndt, <a href="/whart/1/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Whart. 91" data-case-ids="1829009" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0091-01">1 Whart. 91</a>; -Overton v.

Indeed, we are of opinion that he would have had no right to remove the boiler and engine even prior to the sale. Whilst the business was being run by him for the wife, and in her name, he attached to the freehold certain articles which forthwith became part of the milling' plant. If they had been put there by a tenant during his term, a lack of intention to convert into realty would have been presumed in his favor: Hill v. Sewald, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20Pa.%20271" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="58 Pa. 271">58 Pa. 271</a>; Watts v. Lehman, <a href="/pa/107/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="107 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="8856435" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0106-01">107 Pa. 106</a>; yet no such presumption can properly arise in behalf of a husband who voluntarily places fixtures on his wife’s land which he is managing as her agent. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we may conclude that he intended to make the articles a permanent improvement to the premises. In this respect he comes within the operation of the general principle that where one fixes his own chattels on the land of another,' such act is in legal effect a gift of them to the owner of the soil. We are of opinion, therefore, first, that as against the mortgagee plaintiff did not have the right at any time to remove the fixtures in controversy; and, second, that if such right had existed in him, his failure to take them away, prior to the sheriff’s conveyance, left him powerless thereafter either to remove them, or to recover from the purchasers damages- for their conversion.</p>
