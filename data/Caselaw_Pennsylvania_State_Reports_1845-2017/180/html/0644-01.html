A person shown not to have been heard of for seven years by those who, if he had been alive, would naturally have heard of him, is presumed to be dead, and the burden of proof is upon those who deny the death. <em>Answer: </em>I affirm that proposition as an abstract proposition of law, but it must be considered with reference to the domicile or permanent home of the absent party. A man may leave his home and be absent from that home, but if he establishes a home in another community or countr]'-, and that becomes his permanent home, it cannot be said that he is absent from his known domicile.

The presumption of death arising from the absence of the person for seven years unheard from stands as competent and satisfactory proof until it is successfully rebutted by competent evidence to the contrary. <em>Answer: </em>I affirm that proposition. Of course, if this man Watkins had left Providence, left his home, without saying where he was going, or if he had left his home on a business trip or pleasure trip, and nothing had been heard of him for the period of seven years, then the presumption would arise that he was dead. But if he went away for the purpose of establishing a permanent home somewhere else, and he was known to be alive there, then the presumption would not arise until he would be absent from that home and unheard of there.</p>

The contestants denied the validity of the will, alleging that Rachel Francis, the testator, was a single woman when it was made in 1884, and that it was revoked by her subsequent marriage in 1886. She had been married to Thomas Watkins in 1870, who prior to 1876 had left his home in Scranton and gone with a colony to settle in Patagonia. The colony was established. Watkins as a member of it was heard from in 1876. He was at that time residing with the other colonists and engaged in labor with them. Since that time he has not been heard from, and the contestants invoke the presumption of his death; and it is upon this presumption that the contestants rely to establish the fact that the testatrix was single at the date of her will in 1884. Do the foregoing facts' raise the presumption of the death of Watkins ? A presumption of death is raised by. the absence of a person from his domicile unheard of for seven years. Absence in this connection means that a person is not at the place of his domicile, and that his actual residence is unknown. It is for <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>tliis reason that his existence is doubtful, and that after seven years of such absence his death is presumed. But removal alone is not enough. The further fact that he has disappeared from his domicile and from the knowledge of those with whom he would naturally communicate, so that his whereabouts have been unknown for seven years or upwards, is necessary in order to raise the presumption. But where a person removes from his domicile in this state to establish a home for himself in another state or country, at a place well known, this is a change of residence, and absence from the last domicile is that upon which the presumption must be built. If alive when last heard from at his new domicile the presumption is that life continues : 1 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 37.
