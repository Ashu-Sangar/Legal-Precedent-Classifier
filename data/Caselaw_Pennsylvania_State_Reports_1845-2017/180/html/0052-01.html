On February 13,1895, the said McCullough Iron Co. went into the hands of receivers by order of the United States circuit court for the district of Delaware. At this time, and for a long time previous, the McDaniel &amp; Harvey Co. had owed the McCullough Co. a large sum of money, amounting, at the date of the receivership, to $45,046.48. The McDaniel &amp; Harvey Co. made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors on February 13, 1895, which assignment was duly recorded the same day.</p>

This writ was served on M. E. Walker, the secretary of the McDaniel &amp; Harvey Co., on February 14, 1895, one day after the assignment of the McDaniel &amp; Harvey Co. for the benefit of creditors, and one day after receivers had been appointed for the McCullough Iron Co. in Delaware.</p>

This claim was contested on the ground that the attachment was too late — that the McDaniel &amp; Harvey Co. having assigned for the benefit of its creditors, the assignees were bound to carry •out the deed of assignment and pay those creditors — not a creditor of a creditor — that, as a receiver had been appointed for the McCullough Iron Co., in Delaware, before the issuing of the attachment, the creditor of the McCullough Iron Co. must look to that receiver for the payment of his claim. ...</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-4" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[226,996,1183,454]]]'>As has been said, th'e writ of attachment was served on the ■secretary of the McDaniel &amp; Harvey Co., the assignees of same not having been made parties to the suit. The claimants contend that it is against the law to .garnish assignees, and that service on the assignors was sufficient to bind the fund. Although assignees are’ frequently made garnishees in this city, .and often both the assignors and assignees are served, it seems to be against the policy of the law to bind the fund in the hands of an assignee by attachment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-5" data-blocks='[["BL_75.6",75,[227,1460,1183,391]]]'>In the American and English Encyclopedia of Law, vol. 8, p. 1137, title “Garnishment” it is said: “An official whose ■duties are prescribed and regulated by law cannot be garnisheed in respect to property held by him in his official capacity, unless expressly authorized by statute. His possession in such case is merely as the agent of the law, and to interfere with his possession is to interfere with the jurisdiction of the court whose officer he is.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-6" data-blocks='[["BL_75.7",75,[228,1871,1181,560]],["BL_76.1",76,[250,382,1173,552]]]'>“Receivers, assignees under a general bankrupt law and under the insolvent laws of the different states, and trustees appointed by the court, are likewise within the doctrine above .stated. So assignees in bankruptcy cannot be garnisheed in respect to claims upon the funds in their hands. And this is .so even after a dividend has been declared, and the assignee has been ordered to pay a specific sum to the principal defendant. Likewise assignees, under the state insolvent laws are not ■chargeable, nor are assignees under voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors.” In Colby v. Coates, 6 Cushing (Mass.), -558, it was decided that an assignee, under the insolvent laws <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>of that commonwealth, could not be charged by the trustee process (foreign attachment) as the trustee of a creditor of the insolvent, for money in his hands as such assignee. Among other things the court said: “Dividends, d.ue to a creditor, from the assignees of a bankrupt, are not attachable undér the law of foreign attachment by the custom of London.” See Ashley on Attachment (2d ed. 29). In Dewing v. Wentworth, 11 Cushing, 499, it was held that, “ money in the hands of an assignee, under the insolvent laws of this commonwealth, cannot be attached upon writ of foreign attachment, as the goods, effects, or credits of a creditor of the insolvent debtor.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b76-4" data-blocks='[["BL_76.5",76,[249,946,1175,969]]]'>The claimants argue from these decisions that their service of the attachment on the firm, although made after the assignment for the benefit of creditors, would bind the fund, because it is against the policy of the law to garnish assignees. The auditor cannot agree with them. The assignees are trustees for the benefit of the creditors. “ The effect of a valid assignment is to vest the assigned estate in the assignee, so as to put it out of the reach of creditors not secured by liens, and even of the assignor himself: ” 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 871, title, Assignments. It is said in Sergeant on Foreign Attachment (page 91), “ Money held by a person as assignee under a commission of bankruptcy (which is an assignment in law), cannot be attached for a debt due by the bankrupt, it not being the property of the bankrupt, but the assignee holding it in trust for the creditors in general.” And in Sharpless v. Welsh, 4 Dali. 279, it is decided that an assignee for creditors becomes a trustee for those creditors; and that the creditors thereupon acquire such an interest as cannot be divested or affected by an attachment: Haust et al. v. Burgess et al. &amp; Hughes, 560.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b76-5" data-blocks='[["BL_76.6",76,[248,1922,1172,347]]]'>It would be inconsistent for the law to exempt assignees from the service of attachments, and yet allow the fund to be reached by garnishing the assignors.
