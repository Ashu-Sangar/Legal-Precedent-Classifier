An affidavit of defense was filed in which it was averred that the deceased was a member of a partnership, all of the members of which belonged to the exchange; that notice had been served upon the exchange by the surviving partners that the deceased was indebted to their firm at the time of his death for an amount in excess of the claim in the suit, and that the arbitration committee had awarded the whole amount of the proceeds of sale to the surviving partners. There was nothing in the affidavit of defense to show that the claim of the surviving partners was “ for transactions arising in, or relating to the business of banker or stock exchange broker,” or that the claim was “contracted during the existence of the copartnership.” <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit of defense was insufficient to prevent judgment.</p>

The maxim, inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, is clearly applicable.

The nearest approach thereto is a possible inference that the claim was of the kind contemplated by the constitution. It is stated in the affidavit that, “ It was in consequence (of the notice) determined by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange that the aforesaid claim of Lewis H.

As already stated, it is nowhere averred that the claim was for indebtedness “ contracted during the existence of the copartnership ” of Lewis H. Taylor and Co. as required by section 10 of article XI., supra. Even if that section indicated an intention to enlarge the class of claims to “ all indebtedness ” without regard to the character thereof (which it does not), it must have been contracted “ during the existence of the partnership,” and that fact should have been distinctly averred.'</p>
