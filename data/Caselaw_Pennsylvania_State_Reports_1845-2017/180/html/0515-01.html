To be entirely safe, and without any fraud wliatever, they might have set apart an amount which, calculated at one per cent per annum, would realize §2,500, but which,, as a matter of fact, might easily earn five times as much. In that case, if the income was the measure of the gift to the widow and not simply the pledge for her annuity, she would be entitled to §12,500 instead of §2,500 per year. The testator might have said that the retained sum must yield at least §2,500 annually, and then his intention to give his wife any excess of income beyond that limit might be plausibly argued. But he did not so say; and when he directed his executors to pay over u the whole of said net yearly income,” he meant the net yearly income §2,500 of which he had just spoken.</p>

The evil which the statute sought to avoid was the capitalizing of income, an evil which existed <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>in Carson’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=99%20Pa.%20825" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="99 Pa. 825">99 Pa. 825</a>, and Grim’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/109/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="109 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="542287" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0391-01">109 Pa. 391</a>, where the donor, in one case, and the testator, in the other, distinctly directed the interest to be invested. But in this case no thought of an accumulation was in the mind of the testator, and it was equally foreign to the purpose of the executors. The latter set apart a fund of $41,729.25, which, at a lower rate than six per cent would not have yielded the annuity, and so close was their estimate that in forty years the net accumulations amounted only to $6,058.14, a yearly average of $121.16. Indeed, a deficit of $1,815.66 actually occurred. Unless the act is too rigid to bend, some play ought to be allowed to the discretion of the accountants, and a fraction of income might be retained, as a matter of prudence, to meet the contingencies of reinvestments and of temporary declines in values. These small savings, which are liable at any time to be absorbed in maintaining the fund, cannot with propriety be regarded as accumulations such as the act was intended to destroy. The case cannot be compared with McKee’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/96/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="96 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="494646" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0277-01">96 Pa. 277</a>, because there the annuity was based upon a fund which was so inordinately large that its surplus income amounted in fifteen years to $100,000. The exact point, however, has been decided. In Eberly’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/110/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="110 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="543765" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0095-01">110 Pa. 95</a>, the trust had run for fifteen years, and the accumulations were in excess of $5,000. Sterrett, J., said: “ If the estate is disposed of so or in such manner that accumulations clearly beyond what may be reasonably required to fully and effectually carry out the provisions of the trust must necessarily exist, it amounts to an implied direction to accumulate. But in determining whether the excess of income over and above disbursements and expenses at any given time is an accumulation within the meaning of the statute or not, regard must be had to the trust property and the duties imposed upon the trustees. . . . Care must be taken not to strip the trustee of a contingent fund, upon which he may be required to draw to meet the exigencies of the trust.” The force of this reasoning was exemplified in the case before us, when the court ordered $1,800 to be paid out of the surplus income to make good a deficit in- the revenues of previous years. We think that the accumulations were not within the prohibition of the act.</p>

We have little doubt that they fall into the residue. The residuary clause carried with it whatever had not been already given by the will; and this was true of the excess of income above $2,500 in any year. Respecting this, as the testator must have known that it would be likely to accrue, he could not have intended to die intestate.</p>

As accumulation except within the limits fixed by the act is prohibited, any direction to accumulate, or any provision or plan by which it is sought to accomplish it directly or indirectly, is unlawful. There cannot be an intent to accumulate beyond the prescribed limits in order to increase the corpus of the estate, or of a trust fund carved out of it, which is not an unlawful intent. When by chance or design the income is increased to an amount in excess of present demands the surplus is retained only in order to provide for future deficiences. The intent to provide for these contingencies within reasonable limits may be sustained, but the intent to add the increase to a permanent fund cannot be. It is therefore unimportant to consider whether there was an actual intent which, if found, could not be carried into effect.</p>

They were to receive nothing until her death, and they were not themselves ascertained. An intention to provide after the death of the widow for the devolution of the whole fund, principal and accumulated income, held by the trustees to secure and protect her annuity, is within the prohibition both as to time and as to parties, and any such attempt, as was said in McKee’s Appeal, supra, “ is so diametrically opposed to the intent and spirit of the statute that it cannot be sustained.” The right to the surplus income vested as it accrued in the testator’s grandchild, subject to the right of the widow to have it retained by the trustees for the judicious protection of her annuity. The facts in this case so closely resemble those in Rhodes’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/147/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="147 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="829834" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0227-01">147 Pa. 227</a>, that in the application of the principle under consideration the cases may be considered as identical. In the opinion in Rhodes’ Appeal filed in the orphans’ court and adopted by this court it was said by Penbose, J., in speaking of the distribution of surplus income which accumulated during the life of the widow: “ It could not go to the residuary legatees, for their rights do not begin, nor indeed are they themselves ascertained, until the death of the tenant for life; it could not be held in the meantime, for accumulation, directly or indirectly, is forbidden by the act of assembly, except during an existing minority and for the benefit of the minor.
