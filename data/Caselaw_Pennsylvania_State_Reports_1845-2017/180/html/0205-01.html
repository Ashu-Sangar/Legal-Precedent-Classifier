    <p class="summary" id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.6",228,[208,1072,1173,1005]]]'>This is an action by the administratrix of Fidel Tritschler, deceased, to recover from the Keystone Mutual Benefit Association of Allentown $5,000 which it.is alleged is due under a policy insuring said deceased. The policy provides that it is declared to be the true meaning of the policy, and the same is accepted by the assured upon the express condition, that in case the person whose life is insured shall die by suicide, feloniously or otherwise, sane or insane, or in consequence of an attempt to commit suicide, the policy shall be null, void and of no effect. Plaintiff’s statement avers that Fidel Tritschler, upon whose life the policy was granted, died on May 10, 1896, by his own hand, by shooting himself while insane, and while by reason of such insanity he was not responsible for his acts and conduct; further that he, by reason of said insanity, was unconscious of the moral and physical consequences of his acts and conduct at the said time of his shooting himself. To this statement defendant has demurred, alleging that the statement shows that the insured violated the essential provisions of his contract; that no sufficient legal cause of action is set forth in the statement.</p>

The ground upon which said conclusion rests is that in, legal acceptation <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>and in popular use the word suicide is employed to characterize the crime of self-murder; that self-destruction under insane impulses so strong as to be beyond the control and restraint of the will is a result produced by disease, for which the victim of it is no more morally responsible for it than he would be for any other of the maladies of which men die: Connecticut Life Insurance Co. v. Groom, <a href="/pa/86/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="86 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1056635" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0092-01">86 Pa. 92</a>. The rule recognized in said case prevails in perhaps all the states of the Union where the question has arisen, and also in the United States courts : Newton v. Mutual Co., <a href="/ny/76/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="76 N.Y. 426" data-case-ids="539858" data-case-paths="/ny/76/0426-01">76 N. Y. 426</a>; Life Ins. Co. v. Terry, 15 Wal. 580 ; Bigelow v. Berkshire Ins. Co., <a href="/us/93/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="93 U.S. 284" data-case-ids="5646196" data-case-paths="/us/93/0284-01">93 U. S. 284</a>. The reason for the rule elsewhere has been expressed thus: “ Self-destruction of a fellow being bereft of reason can with no more propriety be ascribed to the act of his own hand than to the deadly instrument that may have been used by him for the purpose: ” Breasted v. Farmers’ Trust Co., 4 Hill (N. Y.), 73; Manhattan Ins. Co. v. Broughton, <a href="/us/109/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="109 U.S. 121" data-case-ids="8235" data-case-paths="/us/109/0121-01">109 U. S. 121</a>. And as illustrated by an English chancellor: “ The deceased was subject to that which is really just as much an accident as if he had fallen from the top of a house: ” Horn v. Australian Ins. Co., 30 Law Jour. Ch. 511. That rule was applied to cases where the policies did not stipulate for non-liability if the insured committed suicide while sane or insane. Where there is such stipulation the authorities are almost uniformly to the effect that such provision is binding even if the act of self-destruction was the result of insanity: Pierce v. Travelers’ Ins. Co., <a href="/wis/34/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="34 Wis. 389" data-case-ids="8707463" data-case-paths="/wis/34/0389-01">34 Wis. 389</a>; DeGogorza v. Knickerbocker Ins. Co., <a href="/ny/65/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="65 N.Y. 232" data-case-ids="1953064" data-case-paths="/ny/65/0232-01">65 N. Y. 232</a>; Travelers’ Ins.

As was said in said case of Pierce: “ The intention here manifested is so plain as to seem incapable of further explanation, and unless there is something in the policy of the law which forbids _ such stipulation we have nothing to do but to give it effect.” Neither in that nor any other adjudicated case that this court is aware of, nor in the learned and exhaustive argument of plaintiff’s counsel, has it been demonstrated that such limitation of liability contravenes any rule that the good of the public requires. As has been said, if a man, by reason of irresistible impulse the result of mental aberration, takes his own life it is as much an accident and a matter beyond his control as if his death was caused by smallpox, scarlet fever or the accidental fall from the top of a house. But what plaus<a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>ible argument could be advanced that a stipulation in a policy-excluding liability for death owing to said specified diseases or cause was invalid? Who doubts the validity of the very frequent exclusion from the risk of death occasioned by employment on railroad trains, the high seas, about explosives, dwelling in tropical countries and the like ? A sane person, while contracting for insurance upon his life or against accident not resulting in death, may agree to any limit of causes of death or injury he sees fit, so long as no immorality is involved. It is to be presumed that the price of insurance is affected by the extent of the risk of the insurer. Where the consequences of certain maladies, whether mental or physical, aré excepted from the insurance, naturally the premium, dues or assessments are lower.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[251,1080,1168,557]]]'>The able argument of plaintiff’s counsel, fortified by citation of many legal authorities, has for its object the establishment of the principle that where the self-killing was unintentional because of insanity, where by reason of insanity the suicide was unconscious of the moral and physical consequences of his acts and conduct, there the insurer shall be liable notwithstanding a covenant that the policy shall be void in the event of suicide, while the insured is insane. It is urged that it would be contrary to the policy of the law to uphold a contract for non-liability under those conditions. The court cannot assent to said contention for reasons already indicated.</p>
