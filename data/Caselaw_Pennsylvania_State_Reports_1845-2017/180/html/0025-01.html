It is the ownership of this patent which is in controversy. Letters patent on this bar were issued under date of April 8, 1888, in the name of Jonathan Cone. In the meantime, Jonathan Cone, on October 10, 1887, had died. Immediately after the receipt of the letters patent, Lorenzo H. Cone and Rebecca C. Cone, executors of J onathan Cone, by formal assignment dated April 23, 1888, assigned the said patent to Frank J. St. John. From the date of the assignment of the second patent to January 1,1893, the plaintiff and defendant continued in their intimate and friendly relationship. St. John had entire control and management of the business of the. grate bar, and during that time the plaintiff knew nothing definite of the progress, if any, that St. John was making. He never received a statement of the business or any of the proceeds thereof. The wife of defendant had died in September, 1890, and about January 1, 1893, the defendant had either married again or was about to do so, and the plaintiff and defendant had a serious disagreement at the time as to the proper management of defendant’s child, the merits of which dispute having no connection with the case. Though of no importance as to its merits, it is easily conceived how on such a subject, if firmness was displayed on both sides, a wide breach could readily result. It happened so in this case, and the feelings engendered became bitter, as they are only too apt to become, between old and tried friends when an incurable <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>breach, occurs between them. This feeling was doubtless imparted to intimates on both sides, and it is not difficult to imagine that in a litigation between two such persons, the evidence of partisans would be colored with prejudice. As above mentioned, this disagreement happened on January 1, 1893. On March 21, 1893, the plaintiff demanded of defendant a full accounting of the affairs of the second grate bar and an assignment to him of a half interest therein. The fact that the plaintiff and defendant together owned a patent for a grate bar given to them by Jonathan Cone in 1886, which patent expired in 1887, and that Jonathan Cone at once applied for another patent, which now is in the possession of the defendant, adds presumptive strength to the plaintiff’s case. It, however, served to mislead the witnesses very much, for they testified concerning conversations made, in which “ the grate bar ” was mentioned, without a clear comprehension of the fact that there had been two patents, and frequently by their testimony showing conclusively that the first patent was the one they had in mind.</p>

Under the first division, it is admitted as a fact that Jonathan Cone presented the first patent to the two young men. It presumably had little value, for there was no evidence of any great success that Jonathan Cone had with it in the sixteen years of his ownership, and the young men certainly fared no better. Unfortunately, Jonathan Cone is dead, and cannot now enlighten us as to what was said and <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>done by him with regard to the second patent, so far as the plaintiff and defendant are concerned. The plaintiff can give us very little evidence. He states (on page 4 of the printed testimony) that when his father applied for the second patent, the understanding between the three of them was that the new patent was to stand in the same relationship and ownership as the old one. On page 12, he states, on cross-examination, that his father said that he would get up another bar and give it to plaintiff and defendant. Plaintiff plainly showed by his evidence that he knew very little about this second patent, except the fact that an application had been made for it. He knew nothing about the plans or work that had been done on it, and was in entire ignorance on the subject, except to the bare fact of the intended application. There was no person present on any occasion mentioned except defendant and himself, and there was no person who testified as to anything said by Captain Cone to these two men or either of them concerning this second patent.</p>

Cone plaintiff’s mother, testified that in May, 1887, her husband told her he had an improved patent grate bar which he intended for the plaintiff and defendant. Also, in the summer of that year, he expressed surprise that he had not received the patent for the grate bar, saying he intended it for the plaintiff and defendant. Witness then asked him why he should give a half interest to defendant, “ a comparative' stranger,” and Cone replied that it was in substance compensation for the trouble defendant would be put to in working the patent up. Mrs. Cone’s testimony was clearly given and remained unshaken, and but one comment can be made on it, and that is in the fact that she twice spoke of St. John on that day as a comparative stranger. This is perhaps an illustration of the extent to which the feeling of the witness, at the time of testifying, colored the words which she quoted. Defendant was not at that time a comparative stranger. He was an intimate friend of her son, of many years’ standing, so much so that he sat up with Captain Cone when he was sick, and on the night on which he died, and therefore must have been a frequent visitor at her home. Thomas McNamara heard Captain Cone say in 1885 or 1886, to St. John, “ See what you can do with it,” meaning the bar. This certainly referred to the first patent. <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>■J. Henry Edmunds, a gentleman who was a very intimate friend of Captain Cone and the representative of his interests at Cape May, testified that, in the summer of 1887, he heard Captain Cone say he wanted to go to Washington about a patent grate bar; that he had given it to plaintiff and defendant, and some day they would make a great deal of money out of it. The witness only knew of one patent, which the captain had given to the two young men, and had heard him speak of it often several years before.</p>

He replied, “ So am I; if you will give me your •drawings I will pick out the good qualities and get it patented for you in my name,” etc. (Page 57.) Defendant did so. He saw Mr. Hunter, the patent solicitor, with Captain Cone, about the application many times ; that plaintiff told defendant (page 58) that he knew his father was getting out the patent for defendant; that there was never any understanding, express or implied, that the new patent was to be held by himself and plaintiff, and that plaintiff never had any interest in the second patent; that he knew the captain went to Washington in reference to obtaining an act of congress for a sidelight patent, and never heard of his going to Washington in reference to the grate bar. Rudolph M. Hunter, the solicitor who obtained the patent, gave what is, to the mind of the master, the most valuable evidence of statements made by Captain Cone. He stated that the patent was applied for by Captain Cone for the benefit of defendant; that Captain Cone so stated to him ; that he did not know that Captain Cone had a son until after the patent issued; that Captain Cone had no occasion to go to Washington in reference, to the application, and he did not think Captain Cone ever went to the patent office in reference to this patent, and he knows that he never stated that he did. . . .</p>

How <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>could such evidence alter an existing absolute estate? If, for the sake of argument, we assume that Captain Cone had the patent in his possession, and had formally assigned it to St. John in his lifetime, could it be argued that the evidence just considered would be sufficient to establish a trust imposed by him in St. John for his son for one half the patent ?

An assignment was prepared by Mr. Hunter at the instance of defendant, and taken to plaintiff, who had it duly executed by his mother and himself, and it was delivered to the defendant. Plaintiff says the assignment was made at his own suggestion, because he did not want the patent to become involved in his father’s estate, which was pretty well “ mixed.” He says they assigned to the defendant, and defendant was to reassign one half to him, as he did not want to take title as executor, probably meaning take title from himself as executor. It was an unusual reason for a layman to give, and such prudence would seemingly suggest the necessity for a contemporaneous reassignment, or an assignment to the two, through the medium of a third party, but the question of a reassignment does not appear to have given the plaintiff at this time any concern whatever. No mention was made at that time <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>of a formal reassignment, and no promise was made by defendant to reassign. The mother was not present at the time of these conversations nor at the time of the delivery of the assignment. Plaintiff did not direct the preparation of a reassignment to him, or express any surprise that one was not produced with the first one. Defendant denies the plaintiff’s story, and says that there was no suggestion of a reassignment, and that the assignment was delivered by plaintiff without any of the reasons he stated concerning his connection with his father’s estate, and that the sole reason the patent was assigned to him was because it belonged entirely to him.</p>

Plaintiff says that at intervals during the ensuing five years he asked the defendant for an assignment of this interest, on an average, once a month — sometimes every day for a while, and then perhaps not for three months, but he gives the impression of a constant series of requests and demands for a reassignment, and a statement of the business done by the defendant. On all these occasions, he testifies, defendant would put him off with a promise or a declaration that he was doing little or nothing with the bar. Defendant replies to this with an absolute denial. He says he was never asked for an assignment or a statement, until after their quarrel in 1893, when plaintiff, in March of that year, made the formal demand already alluded to, and when that was made defendant retorted that plaintiff must be a fool. During this time these men were on the most intimate terms, spending much of their time together, and seeing each other nearly every day, and having friends in common. And herein lies the extraordinary fact. Not one person was produced on either side who ever heard these men speak of the patent to each other, although their friends seemed to know of its existence. No person ever heard plaintiff make a demand on defendant, or heard defendant promise to comply. Even Graham, the friend of both parties, and produced by both, does not speak of any conversation taking place between them concerning the bar until after January 1, 1893. Graham says he was always under the impression that St. John owned the patent, but does not say where he obtained that impression, and while impressions are not evidence, yet in this instance it serves to show that some circumstances caused this man, who was frequently with the two men, to believe that defendant was the owner. And during all these years the plaintiff persisted in his demands, and continued to receive his rebuffs without apparent indignation, and maintained at the same time a warm friendship for defendant. It was a severe test for friendship, to per<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>mit a friend to hold one’s properly and refuse to return it, to see the profits thereof go into that friend’s pocket without a complaint, and yet at the same time to have one’s regard for that friend remain unshaken; but plaintiff seems, from his •evidence, to have been equal to the test, and in all probability the same conditions would have continued until this day, but for the unfortunate quarrel on January 1, 1893, which quarrel had no possible connection with the patent. It may be argued that it was the friendship that prevented a previous break between them over the patent, but the master cannot comprehend how it could have bound them together for so long a time if the circumstances were as plaintiff alleges. Friendship is said to be “ a disinterested commerce between equals,” and nothing ■chills the warmth of regard so much as selfishness, trifling, and a disposition to overreach, for these drive out respect and esteem, without which no friendship can long endure. When the defendant positively and unequivocally denies all these statements, it requires no effort on the part of one sitting in the place of a chancellor to disregard them altogether.</p>

Mrs. Rebecca Cone, the mother of plaintiff, testified to one occasion in April, 1892, defendant visited her house, and she asked him what he had done with the grate bar “ the Captain ” gave him one half interest in. He replied that he had not worked it up — there was nothing in it. Also, she said, “We assigned that to you. Have you ever assigned one half to Lenny ? ” He replied, “Not yet.” On another occasion (the time not given), at Shappan Point, she asked him if he had done <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>anything with it. He replied, “No — there is no money in it.” Mrs. Eva Cone, the wife of plaintiff, testified that while visiting defendant’s wife in the fall of 1887, when the defendant came home and told his wife that Captain Cone had given the bar to the plaintiff and himself. In 1890 the defendant told her, in reply to a question, not to mind about the grate bar — not to worry over it — that he was going to surprise Len. She also saw in defendant’s house some letter-heads marked “ Cone’s Patent Grate Bar ” with plaintiff’s and defendant’s names. The letter heads were used by Mrs. St. John in her letters to witness. Walter E. Graham, an intimate friend of both parties, went to New York in April, 1892, with defendant, to see plaintiff and his wife off to Europe. While on the steamer, defendant showed him the grate bar and said he owned it. Witness was under that impression before. Defendant told him to say nothing about the bar. He believes he referred to plaintiff.</p>

Also William P. Thomas, the secretary of the I. P. Morris Company, testified to manufacturing the bar for defendant, and also that their company had issued a circular with the consent of defendant, advertising the bar and its merits, and mentioning defendant as the owner. Defendant also produced one of these circulars, and also a copy of an advertisement in the Public Ledger of December 18, 1888, in which the merits of the bar are displayed and defendant’s name mentioned as owner.</p>

Walter E. Graham testified that defendant told him he owned the patent, bought for a money consideration. Defendant also said after demand made by plaintiff in March, 1893, that if Len had behaved himself he would have given him a present. Clara Price testified that defendant told her he had paid |50 for the bar. He also cautioned her not to speak ,of it .before plaintiff</p>

Plaintiff says he paid this sum because he was interested in the bar, and hence in the expenses thereof. Defendant says it was a loan. Plaintiff in his testimony says that defendant repeatedly said that the bar was paying its way, and hence it was unnecessary for him to contribute, and yet if that had been the case, plaintiff never demanded the return of the money. And he never seems to have reverted to it again in all his intercourse with the defendant. It will be observed that this money was paid within one month after the assignment, and the circumstance seems to have been entirely overlooked by both parties. Defendant says that they were frequently in the habit of borrowing from each other, and plaintiff does not contradict this in rebuttal. The circumstance, in view of defendant’s explanation, cannot be considered of much weight, or of throwing much light on the controversy.</p>
