Nichols and George Nichols, both of whom reside in said county; that neither of said persons nor anyone else is a bona fide purchaser of said land, or has any valid title to the same or any part thereof; and prays :</p>

    <p id="b614-7" data-blocks='[["BL_614.7",614,[248,1181,1173,757]]]'>The case thus presented is one of a class in which this court prior to 1874, doubtless had original jurisdiction concurrently with the several courts of common pleas under the acts of March, 1786 and January, 1793, respectively, Pepper and Lewis’ Digest 1577-81; but since the adoption of the present constitution the latter courts alone appear to have such jurisdiction in their respective counties: Const., art. Y. sec. 3. Tins section declares, among other things, that the-judges of the Supreme Court “shall have original jurisdiction in cases of injunction where a corporation is a party defendant, of habeas corpus, of mandamus to courts of inferior jurisdiction, and of quo warranto as to all officers of the commonwealth whose jurisdiction extends over the state, but shall not exercise any other original jurisdiction; they shall have appellate jurisdiction, by appeal, certiorari, or writ of error in all cases, as is now or may hereafter be provided bylaw.”</p>

It is very clear that it has been entirely taken away in the class of cases to which the one under consideration belongs; but, if it were otherwise, we would decline to assume jurisdiction unless good and sufficient reasons were shown for not presenting the petition to the common pleas of the proper county.</p>
