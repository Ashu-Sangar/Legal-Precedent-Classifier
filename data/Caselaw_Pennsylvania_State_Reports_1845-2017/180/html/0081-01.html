Its popular meaning comprehends those who succeed to the property of an ancestor, and hence includes next of kin and those who take under the statutes of distribution as well as heirs-at-law. The courts are forced to accept this definition where a gift of personalty is to one and his heirs, or to one for his life and then to his heirs. In Comly’s Estate, <a href="/pa/136/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="136 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="820010" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0153-01">136 Pa. 153</a>; "Neely’s Estate, <a href="/pa/155/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="155 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="983260" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0133-01">155 Pa. 133</a>, and Ashton’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20Pa.%20390" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="131 Pa. 390">131 Pa. 390</a>, the gift was, after a life estate to the first taker, to his heirs, and it was held that those parties were entitled who were named in the statutes of distribution. In Eby’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/84/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="84 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1053580" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0241-01">84 Pa. 241</a>, Patterson v. Hawthorn, 12 S. &amp; R. 113, and McGill’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/61/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="61 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="428615" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0046-01">61 Pa. 46</a>, the gift was to certain persons or their heirs, and “ heirs ” was held to mean personal representatives, making the bequest equivalent to a gift to the first takers, their executors and administrators. In none of these cases could there be any doubt as to the meaning of the testator, and in each the courts adopted the word which he had inartificially applied to a gift of personalty, and gave to it that of next of kin or of personal representatives, because that was the meaning which he had evidently placed upon it. But they did that simply from necessity and in order to give effect to the testamentary purpose. Where the purpose is not clearly expressed to the contrary, authority is equally abundant to show that they will adhere to the technical meaning of the word, for the ample reason, among others, that every intendment is to be made in favor of the heir: Ivins’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/106/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="106 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="455626" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0176-01">106 Pa. 176</a>; Keys’ Estate, 4 District Reps. 281; Stewart’s Estate, <a href="/pa/147/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="147 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="829828" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0383-01">147 Pa. 383</a>. The sole question here is, what did the testator mean by the phrase “ my right heirs?” If a lawyer had written the will, and there is nothing to forbid the idea that it was the work of a professional hand, there could be no misgiving as to the answer. The bequest was of 12,500 in trust to pay the income to testator’s wife for life, and then to his sisters or the survivor for life, “ and at the death of my said wife, and sisters to pay over the same to my right heirs.” The words “ right heirs ” were as <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>plain a descriptio personarum as though he had mentioned the parties by their individual names. His right heirs were his heirs at common law, and he used the words properly as words of purchase. Indeed he could have substituted no others, because he could not know who among the class would answer to that description at his death. But we need not labor a point which has passed into text law. “ Where the word ‘ heirs ’ is used, not to denote succession or substitution, but to describe a legatee, and there is no context to explain it otherwise, it should seem that there is no reason to depart from the natural and ordinary sense of the word: ” 2 Wms. on Executors, 1195. “ A bequest of personalty to the right heirs or to the heirs-at-law or the next heir of an individual, prima facie goes to such heir as persona designata, whether the bequest be to the heirs of the testator or of a stranger : ” Theobald on Wills, 167. In Mounsey v. Blamire, 4 Russ. 384, the gift was “ to my heir ¿£4000,” and in Hamilton v. Mills, 29 Beav. 193, to “ the right heir,” and in both the heirs-atlaw and not the next of kin were held to he intended. See also DeBeauvoir v. DeBeauvoir, 3 H. of L. 524; In re Rootes, 1 Dr. &amp; Sm. 228 ; Southgate v. Clinch, 27 L. J. Ch. 651.</p>
