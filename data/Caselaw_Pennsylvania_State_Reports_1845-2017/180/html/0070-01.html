The law leans in favor of vested rather than contingent interests, and resolves doubts in favor of vesting. The postponement of a gift until the expiration of a prior estate does not imply a condition that the legatee shall survive the first taker, or that his interest shall not vest in the meantime with a mere deferring of the right of possession; estates will be held to vest, subject to opening in order to let in others of the requisite class, as soon as there is one in being who can <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>take; and once vested they will not be divested or defeated by any doubtful implication of condition — conditions wbicb defeat estates being looked upon with disfavor; when the meaning is not clear a construction as nearly conformed to the general rules of inheritance as possible will be adopted, and finally a construction which leads to an intestacy will never be adopted if, without perversion of the words of the will, it can be avoided.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[252,729,1167,1678]]]'>The question here is not affected by the direction for conveyance at the expiration of the life estate. In England this would simply continue the legal estate in the trustees until the conveyance was made; here, where equity is part of the common law, it has not even this effect, and the legal estate vests at once in the beneficiary: Renziehausen v. Keyser, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20Pa.%20851" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="48 Pa. 851">48 Pa. 851</a>; Bacon’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/57/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="57 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1010429" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0504-01">57 Pa. 504</a>. We need, therefore, only consider whether the apparently absolute gift to the grandchildren is made contingent upon survivorship because the conveyance is to be made to them “ in such manner as if the parent had died seized thereof intestate.” It may be conceded that these words can be understood as expressing, obscurely and in an unusual manner, the idea that the child must be alive at the parent’s death, though it could have been expressed much more easily by the familiar formula “ to such child or children of my said sons or daughters as may be living at the time of their respective deaths; ” but their natural meaning is that the children shall take in the proportions to which the intestate laws give them the estate of their parents; or they may have been intended to define the estate or quantity of interest, viz: an absolute interest, such as the intestate laws so give, and the testator, it will be observed, has used no other words of limitation. Understood in either of the senses last suggested, an intestacy, in an event obviously likely to have suggested itself to the mind of the testator, and which has actually occurred, is avoided, and no rule of construction or principle of law is strained or violated : understood in the sense which prevents vesting, grandchildren' of the first takers — children of children dying during the continuance of the prior estate — could have no share of the estate, since gifts to children do not include grandchildren: Hallowell v.
