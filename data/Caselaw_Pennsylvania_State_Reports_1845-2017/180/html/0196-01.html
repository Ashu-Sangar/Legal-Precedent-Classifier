Schively, was walking on Cedar street, in the borough of Jenkintown, and fell on the sidewalk, and was injured. The evidence was conflicting as to whether there was any boardwalk in position at the place where the accident occurred. The evidence showed however that there was a wet, muddy place where a board had been placed to enable persons passing to keep out of the mud. The plaintiff stepped upon this board which slipped from under her and threw her down. She testified that she did not previously know the condition of the sidewalk. Hugh O’Neil, one of plaintiff’s witnesses, described the condition of the sidewalk as follows :</p>

      <em>“ </em>Cedar street has existed there beyond my recollection. It has always been very much traveled. On the west side of Cedar street from Greenwood avenue to West avenue was a boardwalk about three feet wide. It was a mud street through there. The boardwalk varied in height above the street. At the time of this accident it was eighteen inches above at the point where the accident occurred. There had been a boardwalk down there I guess for twenty-five years. It had been on Cedar street between West avenue and Greenwood avenue for twenty-five years. It was all along that street, covering the place where this accident occurred. At the place in question it was very poor. For a number of feet there was no boardwalk at all. Part of the old sleepers remained, that is, the two ties that ran, one alongside of the fence and one on the gutter side, with boards nailed crosswise. The boards had been removed or rotted away and got scattered, and along there it was very bad, but above at Mr. Mather’s front he kept his boardwalk in fair condition, and below it was very fair, but at this particular place it seemed no attention was given to it, and people would gather boards and bring them along with them at times, and throw them there to have a place to step on, and at the very corner of tMs property, the bank being pretty high, some eighteen inches’ above the gutter, and rounded, I have known people to step on these boards and slip. I was a member of town council from 1887 to 18931 I was chairman of the committee on streets.”</p>
