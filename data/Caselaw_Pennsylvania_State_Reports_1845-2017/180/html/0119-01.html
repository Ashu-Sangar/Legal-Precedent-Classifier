That such a trust, is lawful seems to the auditing judge too plain to admit of a. doubt. There are active duties for the trustees to perform.. There are annuities to be paid, income to be distributed and legacies in remainder to be protected. But it is contended that-the following clause of the testator’s will imports an indefinite failure of issue, and therefore the first taker has an estate tail, which under the act of assembly is enlarged to a fee simple: “If either of my said children should die without issue, or the-issue of such child should fail during the continuance of this-trust, which is to continue as long as my wife or either of my children shall remain in full life, the share which would have-been of such child or its issue shall be divided equally among-the survivors of my said four children and living issue of any deceased child, taking only by representation and never per capita.” There has been much learning expended upon the meaning of the words dying without issue and whether they import a definite or indefinite failure of issue ; but it now seems to be settled, that when applied to personal property, it means issue living at the death of the person to whom .the personalty is given in the first instance : Emma Myers’s Appeal, 49 Pa.

In this case, however, the time is fixed, as “ during the continuance of this trust which is to continue as long as my wife or either of my children shall remain in full life.” There can be no question here of indefiniteness. The persons who are to take are fixed, and the time is fixed. The rules of construction which might apply in doubtful cases have no application here. It was argued that under the rule in Shelly’s Case the children take an absolute estate. The auditing judge fails to see anything in this will that would justify the application of this rule. The balance of principal as shown by the account, after deducting the clerk’s costs and for a copy of this adjudication, will remain in the hands of the accountants for the uses and purposes of the will of testator.</p>
