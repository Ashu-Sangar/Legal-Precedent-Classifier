In December, 1894, at the conclusion of the taking of certain depositions on his part in the suit in Wytheville, Va., at which counsel for the respondents was present, Powell agreed that depositions on behalf of the respondents might be taken in the city of Philadelphia before any notary public whom counsel for the respondents might choose. Pursuant to this agreement notice was served upon Powell that depositions on behalf of the respondent would be taken January 15, 1895, at the office of counsel for the respondents in the city of Philadelphia. Powell, who at the time this agreement was made had said that he could not attend the taking of the depositions personally, but would be obliged to have his local counsel go to Philadelphia for this purpose, afterwards determined to attend the taking of the depositions. After three o’clock in the afternoon of the day, and immediately upon his entrance into the office of the counsel for the respondents, he was served with a summons in this suit. He had no other business in Philadelphia and his sole purpose in going there was to he present at the taking of depositions on behalf of the respondents.</p>

It would be an inducement to bring him within tbe jurisdiction, which should not he taken advantage of. He ought to stand in the same position, as if he came under a commission, in which case we do not think he could be served.</p>
