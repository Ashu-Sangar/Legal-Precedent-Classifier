Upon the decease of said Charles Lafferty and the grant of letters upon his estate by the register of wills of Philadelphia county to plaintiffs, they employed the said defendant to collect said rents from the real estate belonging to said estate, and forthwith deposit the same in the safe belonging to the estate in the office of the executors in the city of Philadelphia, where said money was to remain until deposited in the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company to the credit of the estate of said Charles Lafferty, deceased. Defendant entered upon said employment, collected said rents, forthwith deposited the same in the safe of the estate in the office of the executors, and from time <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>to time deposited said money in The Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company to the credit of said estate. On October 13,1888, the orphans’ court of Philadelphia county appointed defendant an executor and trustee, and defendant agreed, in addition to his duties as said executor and trustee, to continue to collect the rents from said real estate, deposit the same forthwith in the fireproof safe belonging to said estate in the office of the executors, such money to be from time to time deposited in The Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company to the credit of said estate, and in consideration thereof plaintiffs agreed to pay defendant said salary in addition to his share of commissions from said estate. Between November 1,1890, and June 1, 1894, at various times well known to the defendant, and which he refuses to disclose to plaintiffs, and which plaintiffs do not know, the said defendant having collected large sums of money from said rents and deposited said sums in the said fireproof safe, subsequently, without taking them out for deposit, took the same into his possession and converted to his own use, the sum, $10,700, so deposited in said fireproof. Defendant had no right to take said money from said safe. No part of said money was due to the said defendant upon any account whatsoever, and no part was used for any purpose of said estate or with the knowledge or consent of said plaintiffs. All of said money was taken from the fireproof and from the estate by said defendant and converted by him to his own use.

Indeed, the only apparent object in reciting the foregoing facts was as matter of inducement.</p>
    <p id="b335-6" data-blocks='[["BL_335.6",335,[236,934,1175,549]]]'>After stating that, on the day last named, “ the orphans’ court of Philadelphia county appointed the defendant an executor and trustee,” the plaintiffs aver that the “ defendant agreed, in addition to his duties as said executor and trustee, to continue to collect the rents from said real estate, deposit the same forthwith in the fire-proof safe belonging to said estate in the office of the executors, — such money to be from time to time deposited in the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company to the credit of said estate; and in consideration thereof plaintiffs agreed to pay defendant said salary in addition to his share of commissions from said estate.”</p>

That, however, is comparatively unimportant. As one of the three executors, defendant had an undoubted right to collect the rents in question — in fact it was his duty to do so — and, whether he collected them avowedly as <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>agent, or by virtue of Ms office as executor, can make no material difference. According to the averments the money went into his hands, and, as executor, he was and is undoubtedly accountable therefor to the court that had and still has exclusive jurisdiction of his accounts as executor and testamentary trustee. When called upon by that court to account for the rents so collected between Novenber 1, 1890 and June 1, 1894, it would be no answer for him to say that such rents as he did collect were received by him merely as agent under an agreement between himself and Ms coexecutors, and that he was therefore accountable to them and not to the orphans’ court. No agreement that was made or could have been made between him and his coexecutors would have the effect of relieving him from any of Ms official obligations as executor or trustee, or from accounting to the proper court, in the ordinary way, for all moneys of the estate received by him, etc. If we should hold that the common pleas has jurisdiction of the claim here presented, it would necessarily involve an inquiry as to defendant’s receipts, disbursements, etc., quite as full and complete as that required in the orphans’ court. The real issue evidently is one of accounting between the parties as eoexecutors and cotrustees, and is therefore a proper subject of inquiry in the orphans’ court which has exclusive cognizance of the matters involved. Any other practice would inevitably lead to confusion and conflicts of jurisdiction, which cannot be tolerated.</p>

Under the act of 1832 it can require executors to give additional security; and on their failure to do so, it can remove them from office, require them to transfer the trust property, etc., and, if need be, enforce its mandates by proceedings for contempt. On proper showing that an executor is about to abscond, etc., or is wasting the trust property, ample remedy by attachment etc., is provided.</p>
