When the hind wheels of the wagon were about six feet beyond the bridge, the horse stopped, and the deceased extended his left hand with the lantern beyond the dashboard, flashing the light ahead ; the horse immediately backed upon and over the unguarded side of the bridge. The bridge was nineteen feet wide, twenty-six feet long and four feet six inches above the water. It was unprovided with guard rails. There was evidence that the deceased knew the road, and that the horse had an aggravated propensity to take fright, and that this was known to the deceased. <em>Held, </em>that the case was for the jury.</p>

    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.10",381,[206,1316,1176,806]]]'>. The only assignment of error in this case is the refusal of the court below to direct a verdict in favor of defendant. When the ease was here last year on plaintiff’s appeal from the refusal of the court to take off the judgment of nonsuit, we held that the evidence adduced on the former trial was sufficient to carry the ease to a jury, and the judgment was accordingly reversed with a procedendo. While the evidence on the last, may have differed slightly from that on the first trial, there does not appear to be any such difference as would have justified the court in entering a judgment of nonsuit on the last trial. The learned trial court evidently thought so, and the case was accordingly tried on the lines indicated in the opinion referred to, <a href="/pa/177/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="177 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="883730" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0213-01">177 Pa. 213</a>. We think, moreover, that this case is ruled, in principle at least, by Yoders v. Amwell Township, <a href="/pa/172/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="172 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="874131" data-case-paths="/pa/172/0447-01">172 Pa. 447</a>.
