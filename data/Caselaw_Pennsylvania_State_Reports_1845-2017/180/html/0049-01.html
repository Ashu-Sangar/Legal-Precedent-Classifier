What did you do as you turned into Baltimore avenue ? A. I looked up the street for a car and I saw no car within a square, and then went on going slowly. I went around the turn and pulled right to the south side of the track. I got my horse off and the two front wheels, and before the back wheel left the track, this car caught the back end of the wagon.”</p>

In view of this it would have been manifest error for the court to have withdrawn the case from their consideration by affirming any such request for instructions as that above referred to. As to that, there is no room for any difference of opinion.</p>

The result was a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, impliedly establishing the fact that defendant company’s negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s in juries, and that he himself was not guilty of any negligence that contributed thereto. That verdict was clearly warranted by the evidence and should not be disturbed. Indeed it is difficult to conceive how the jury could have done otherwise than find in favor of the plaintiff, without ignoring the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>
