The case was fairly submitted to them on sufficient evidence and with instructions of which the defendant company has no just reason to complain.\nTwo requests for instructions were submitted to the learned trial judge, both of which were rightly refused. If additional instructions, on other subjects, were desired by the defendant company, it was its privilege as well as its duty to make the request. Having omitted to do so, it is not in a position to complain that none were given.\nJudgment affirmed.",

The Electric Traction Company, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Street Railways \u2014 Repairs of streets.\nIn an action against a street railway company for damages for personal injuries a judgment on a verdict for plaintiff will be sustained where it appears that the plaintiff in driving on the tracks of the defendant was thrown from his wagon by the front wheel of the wagon slipping from the tracks and falling into a hole made by employees of the defendant, some weeks before the accident, in removing paving blocks and not replacing them.\nPractice, G. P. \u2014 Request for instructions.\nIn a negligence case where the court has given instructions to the jury, a party who desires further instructions should make the proper request for them, and if he fails to do so cannot complain in the Supreme Court of the lack of such instructions.\nArgued Jan. 26, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 461, Jan. T., 1896, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Pbila. Co., June Term, 1895, No. 453, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Steerrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries.\nAt tbe trial it appeared that on March 9, 1895, plaintiff was injured by being thrown from his wagon on Third street near Thompson, in the city of Philadelphia. The evidence tended to show that at the time of the accident plaintiff\u2019s wagon dropped off defendant\u2019s rail and went into a hole alongside of the track. The hole had been made about three weeks before by a motorman and conductor in the employment of the defendant tearing out a number of Belgian blocks which had been raised by the frost sufficiently to come in contact with the wheel guard of a car.\nDefendant presented two points as follows :\n1. Under the contract made between the said the Electric Traction Company and the Mack Paving Company, dated March 21, 1894, the Electric Traction Company is not responsible for the accident in this case, and therefore your verdict must be in favor of the Electric Traction Company.\n2. Under all of the evidence your verdict must be in favor \u201e \u2022of the Electric Traction Company.\nBoth points were refused. [1]\nVerdict for plaintiff for $6,000. Judgment was entered for $8,000, all above that sum being remitted.' Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1) above instructions, quoting them;\n(2) that the court below erred in its charge to the jury in that it failed to fully call the attention of the jury to the law relating to the measure of damage as applicable to the facts in this case ;\n(3) that the court below erred in its charge to the jury in that it failed, after having been requested to do so, to state to the jury, as bearing upon the question of the measure of damages, that it appeared from the uncontradicted testimony that the plaintiff was away from his employment for nine weeks, and that after that time he returned to the same employment, with the same employers, at the same weekly wages, and was still so engaged at the time of the trial; (4) that the court below erred in its charge to the jury in that it failed to say anything to them .about any actual or constructive notice having been given to or received by the Electric Traction Company of the alleged defect in the street; (5) that the court below erred in its charge to the jury in that considering the importance of the case it was an inadequate presentation of it, and that the law relating to-the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, the measure of damage, and notice, was not stated to the jury with sufficient clearness and fullness.\nWm. Henry Lex, for appellant.\nThe plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in notTooking out for the hole: Bruch v. City, 53 Leg. Int. 472; Robb v. Borough on Connellsville, 26 W. N.
