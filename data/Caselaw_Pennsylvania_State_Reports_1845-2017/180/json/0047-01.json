On appeal to the Superior Court (1 Pa. Superior Ct. 578), it was held that the act is constitutional; that \u201c the judgment was properly entered on the question raised by the motion in arrest, and is therefore affirmed.\u201d\nIt thus appeared that the only question in the trial court, as well as in the Superior Court and here, was and is the constitutionality of the act of July 2, 1895.\nWe have considered the provisions of the act, and are all of opinion that the Superior Court was clearly right in holding that it is constitutional. It is so obviously constitutional and valid that discussion of the subject is unnecessary.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is therefore affirmed with costs to be paid by the defendant.",

L. 428, entitled \u201cAn act to regulate and license public lodging houses in the different cities in this commonwealth,\u201d does not violate article III, see. 8, of the constitution, relating to title of acts, nor impose a license or tax lacking uniformity, nor offend against the bill of rights forbidding unreasonable searches: See Com. v. Muir, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 578.\nArgued Jan. 8, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 416, Jan. T., 1896, by defendant, from judgment of Super. Ct., Nov. T., 1895, No. 67, affirming judgment of Q. S. Phila. Co., Oct. T., 1895, No. 216.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nIndictment for keeping a lodging house without a license.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nError assigned was in affirming judgment of the court of quarteT sessions.\nC. Oscar Beasley, for appellant.\nThe act in question is unconstitutional, because it contains subjects not covered by its title: Sewickley Borough v. Sholes, 118 Pa. 850; Road in Phoenixville, 109 Pa. 44; Beclcert v. Allegheney, 4 W. N. C. 530; Allegheny City v. Moorehead, 80 Pa. 118; Ridge Ave. Pass. Ry. v. Phila., 23 W. N. C. 324.\nThe bill under consideration is unconstitutional because the license or tax required is not uniform upon the same class of subjects: Dwrach\u2019s App., 62 Pa. 495.\nThe 4th section of the act offends against the bill of rights forbidding unreasonable searches.\nThe act in question is in reality an amendment of the act of June 1, 1885, commonly known as the Bullitt bill, and that it is such an amendment is not stated in the title.\nThe police power is limited by the constitution: Com. v. Alger, 7 Cush. 84; State v. Noyes, 47 Me. 211; In re Jacobs, 88 Hun, 374; Toledo R. R. v. Jacksonville, 67 111. 37; 1 Dillon\u2019s Munc. Corp. 142; Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim.
