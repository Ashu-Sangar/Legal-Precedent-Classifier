T., 1896, by plaintiffs, from decree of C. P. Schuylkill Co., May T., 1895, No. 1, dismissing bill in equity.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity to restrain interference with the possession of land.\nThe case was referred to F. W. Bechtel, Esq., as examiner and master.\nThe testimony in the case covered one thousand and sixty-nine printed pages. The master\u2019s report-covered one hundred and sixty-eight pages. After a lengthy discussion of the evidence and law the master made the following findings :\n1. That the Summit Branch Railroad Company was the owner of all of the land described in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill at the time it was filed, with the exception of that portion of the John Huber which interferes with the Casper Lengel tract of land, and about which there is no controversy in this case.\n2. That the Summit Branch Railroad Company, the defendant, was in possession of all of the land described in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill at the time it was filed, except said portion lying on the Casper Lengel, and about one fourth of an acre, used as a garden, appurtenant to a house, eighteen by twenty feet, one story high, occupied by Daniel Young, its tenant, one half - of said house being within the lines of the John Huber survey.. That the entry of the plaintiffs and the erection of said house and enclosing of said garden constituted a trespass upon the lands of the Summit Branch Railroad Company.\n3. That the plaintiffs\u2019 bill is an ejectment bill.\nThe master recommended that the bill should be dismissed. Exceptions to the master\u2019s report were dismissed, and a decree-entered dismissing the bill.\nError assigned was decree of the court.\nW. F. Shepherd, with him F. P. Dewees, for appellants.\nA bill in equity is the proper remedy in this case: Leininger\u2019s.
