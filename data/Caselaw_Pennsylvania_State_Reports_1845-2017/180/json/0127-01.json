    "head_matter": "Estate of Catharine H. Siddall, deceased. Appeal of Annie W. Kratz.\nWill \u2014 Perpetuities\u2014Tested estate \u2014 Trusts and trustees.\nA will gave an estate to executors in trust to pay the net income to the daughters for life with direction that \u201cat their decease\u201d it shall \u201cbe -equally divided among their children who may be then living, and the issue of any deceased child or children, whether herein named or not, as \u25a0they arrive at the legal age.\u201d Held, (1) that the estates to the grandehildren vested at the expiration of the estates given to the daughters;\n(2) that the will created no perpetuity; (3) that the trust should be preserved for the protection of the future interests.\nArgued Jan. 20, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 202, Jan. T., 1896, by Annie W. Kratz, from decree of O. C. Pbila. Co., dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that decedent died on July 21r 1894, leaving two daughters, Mary C. Davis and Annie W. Kratz. The material portion of the will is as follows :\n\u201c Seventh. \u2014 All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate,, whether real, personal, or mixed, I give and bequeath unto my executors hereinafter named, to have and to hold the same, in trust nevertheless to invest the same, and keep invested, and to collect and receive the income, rents, issues and profits thereof, and after paying all proper charges, to pay said income, rents, issues and profits unto my two daughters, to be divided equally between them, share and share alike, viz: Mary C. Davis, wife of W. Harmer Davis, of Frazer, Chester County, State of Pennsylvania, and Annie W. Kratz, wife of Cornelius T. Kratz, of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, during the term of their natural lives, and at their decease, to be equally divided among their children, who may then be living, and the issue of any deceased child or children, whether herein named or not, as they arrive at legal age.\u201d\nThe auditing judge directed that the balance of the estate. amounting to $15,035.49 should be held in trust by the accountants, the Philadelphia Trust, Safe Deposit and Insurance Company who were the executors and trustees under the will.\nExceptions to the adjudication were then dismissed. Pen-rose, J., filing the following opinion:\nIf the disposition which the testatrix has made of her estate at the death of her daughters infringes the rule against perpetuities, it would, of course, be invalid; and as the daughters, it is said, are themselves the only persons to whom the estate would go under the intestate laws, it would follow that they would thus become entitled to an absolute estate in reversion in the real and personal property held in trust for them, under the will, for life; and hence, the sole purpose of the trust being to sustain future interests which have failed, the life estates would merge in the reversionary interests, and the daughters have the right to present possession of the legal estate: Culbertson\u2019s Appeal, 76 Pa. 145; Sharpless\u2019s Estate, 151 Pa. 214; Oldmixon\u2019s Appeal, 147 Pa. 229 etc.\nThe limitations are void unless the estates given must vest within twenty-one years, etc., after the end of a life or lives in being at the death of the testatrix; and since the question of perpetuity depends upon possibilities, not actual results as they may be manifested at the termination of the life estates, it must be decided now. Is there in this case any infringement of the rule ? The will gives the estate to the executors in trust to pay the net income to the daughters for life, with direction that \u201cat their decease\u201d it shall \u201cbe equally divided among their children who may be then living, and the issue of any deceased child or children, whether herein named or not, as they arrive at legal age.\u201d Whether the division at the death of the daughters is, in terms, of the principal of the estate 'or of income only, is immaterial \u2014 a gift of income for an unlimited period is the equivalent of a gift of the estate from which it issues: Garret v. Rex, 6 Watts, 14; Pennsylvania Co.\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 312; Sproul\u2019s Appeal, 105 Pa. 438. The real question is, When does the gift take effect? The answer to this is found in the express provision of the will that the division is to be \u201c at the decease \u201d of the daughters, among their children then living and the issue of any (then) deceased child or children. It is contended, however, that the subsequent words \u201c as they arrive at legal age \u201d must be understood as deferring the vesting of the interests until such arrival, and as this might not occur within the limits of the rule, the gift falls as being in contravention of it. But the direction as to the time of the division is explicit, and no rule of construction requires that controlling effect shall be given to the words relied upon to defeat the direction. On the contrary, they are to be understood simply as indicating the time of payment and not in a sense which would render the previous provision meaningless and nugatory. Where no violence is done to the words of a testator, a construction which sustains a will and prevents an intestacy \u2014 either as the result of a failure to dispose, or by reason of the alleged illegality of the disposition \u2014 is to be preferred to one that makes it invalid: Gray on Perpetuities, sec. 638. See also McBride\u2019s Estate, 152 Pa. 192; Ferry\u2019s Appeal, 102 Pa. 207; Striewig\u2019s Estate, 169 Pa. 61; Ashhurst\u2019s Estate, 17 W. N. 538; Stivers\u2019 Estate, 21 W. N. 335, etc. Of course, if the will contained a limitation over in case of the failure of issue of the t\u00e9nant for life to attain full age, as in Seibert\u2019s Appeal, 13 Pa. 501, the construction would be different \u2014 the question in such case not being affected by the rule which seeks to avoid intestacy or invalidity; but, as was said in McClure\u2019s Appeal, 72 Pa. 415, and in many other cases, if the limitation is by way of remainder after a life estate, and the arrival of the time of payment is not absolutely necessary before the gift can attach in the legatee, it will be regarded as vested with postponement of payment only; vesting rather than contingency being favored, and doubts being resolved in its favor. Upon this point see further, Judge Shabswood\u2019s remarks in Provenchere\u2019s Appeal, 67 Pa. 466. We think the estates in the present case will vest at the expiration of the estates given to the daughters, and that the will creates no perpetuity. The trust, therefore, must be preserved for the protection of the future interests.\nWe are also of opinion that the commissions allowed to the accountant would not be excessive, in view of the size of the estate, even if the trust should be inoperative. See Eshleman\u2019s Appeal, 74 Pa. 42.\nThe exceptions are dismissed and the adjudication confirmed absolutely.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nC. Tyson Kratz, for appellant.\nThe will created a perpetuity: Gray on Perpetuities, 629 ; Coggin\u2019s App., 124 Pa. 10; Davenport v. Harris, 3 Gr. 164; Perry on Trusts, sec. 383 ; Hawkins on Wills, 226 ; Moore v. Smith, 9 W. 403 ; Smith on Executory Interests, 281; Knight v. Knight, 2 Simons & Stewart, 490 ; McBride v.
