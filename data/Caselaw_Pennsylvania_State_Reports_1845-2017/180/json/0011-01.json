Inasmuch, however, as some misapprehension appears to have arisen, as to whether the injunction should issue from this court or from the court below, it is now, January 18, 1897, ordered that the words following, be added to our decree, viz:\n\u201c It is also ordered that the record be remitted to the court below for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion of this court.\u201d",
