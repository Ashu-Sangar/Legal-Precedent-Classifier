    "head_matter": "Estate of Joel Barlow Moorhead, deceased. Charles H. Moorhead\u2019s Appeal.\nWills \u2014 Trusts and trustees \u2014 Life estate.\nTestator gave his residuary estate to trustees in trust to pay certain annuities to his wife and children, during their respective lives, and in case of the death of any of the annuitants, leaving issue, the annuity to pass to the children and issue of such deceased annuitant; and in case of their death without issue, the annuities were to be divided equally among the survivor or survivors of his four children; after the death of the last survivor of his wife and four children, the principal of his estate was to be divided among his grandchildren. The will further provided: \u201cIf any other children should be born to either of my children, then in such event, I direct that my trustees shall pay to such additional grandchildren, living at the time of distribution, to each the sum of \u201d'. . . . Subject to the payment of the foregoing, the will proceeds: \u201c If there be anything remaining of my estate after payment of all the annuities, bequests, devises and legacies and just claims against my estate as hereinbefore specified and directed to be paid, I give and bequeath the same to my own right heirs. .... If either of my said children should die without issue, or the issue of such child should fail during the continuance of this trust, which is to continue as long as my wife or either of my children shall remain in full life, the share which would have been of such child or its issue shall be divided equally among the survivors of my said four children and living issue of any deceased child, taking only by representation and never per capita.\u201d As to the children the will contained a spendthrift trust clause. Held, (1) that the trust was an active one; (2) that the cestuis que trust did not take an estate tail or fee simple under the will; (8) that the cestuis que trust were not entitled to the corpus of the estate.\nArgued Jan. 19, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 468, Jan. T., 1896, by Charles H. Moorhead, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., Jan. T., 1890, No. 298, overruling exceptions to adjudication.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, J J.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication. Before Ferguson, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that Joel Barlow Moorhead died on October 25,1889, leaving to survive him his widow who has since died, one son, Charles H. Moorhead, the appellant, and three daughters- \u2014 all of whom were of full age. He also left surviving him the following grandchildren:\n1. George C. Thomas, Jr. 2. Sophy Thomas; and 3. Leonard M. Thomas, children of Ada, daughter of testator. 4. Caroline C. Cooke; and 5. Jay Cooke, Jr., who are children of Clara, daughter of testator. 6. J. Barlow Moorehead, Jr., who was the only child of Charles H. Moorehead, appellant, only son of testator. 7. Joseph Earlston Thropp. 8. Clara H. Thropp. 9. Amy S. Thropp. 10. Francis M. Thropp; and 11. Barlow Moorhead Thropp, who are children of Caroline, daughter of testator.\nWhen testator died, all of his four children were of full age; the appellant was then a widower and has since remarried. Since testator\u2019s death J. Barlow Moorhead, Jr., appellant\u2019s son (By his first wife) and grandson of testator, died on October 3, 1892, after reaching the age of twenty-one years. There now remain, therefore, living, the four children and ten grandchildren of the testator. No living grandchild has been born since testator\u2019s death.\nOther facts appear by the adjudication which was as follows:\nThe provisions of the will of the testator were fully recited in the adjudication upon the account of the accountants, as executors, and it is not necessary now to repeat them further than may be required by the consideration of the question raised by the counsel for Charles H. Moorehead, and which is that the trusts declared by the will of testator, are invalid, that the cestuis que trust take an estate tail under the will which under the act of April 27, 1855 is enlarged to a fee simple, and that therefore they are entitled to the corpus of the estate so held in trust. The questions involved were elaborately argued, not only orally, but in a voluminous written brief, which shows great industry upon the part of counsel.\nIn the interpretation of wills, technical rules of construction are only applicable in cases of doubt. This is not such a case. The intention of the testator is perfectly clear. He gives his residuary estate to the accountants in trust to pay certain annuities to his wife and children during their respective lives,' and in case of the death of any of the annuitants, leaving issue, the annuity passes to -the children and issue of such deceased annuitant; and in case of their death without issue, the annuities to be divided equally among the survivor or survivors of his four children; after the death of the last survivor of his wife and four children, the principal of his estate to be divided among his grandchildren, as follows:\n1. Children of daughter Ada, to wit: George, Sophy and Leonard Thomas, each $100,000=$300,000.\n2. Children of daughter Clara, to wit: Caroline and Jay Cooke, each $125,000=$250,000.\n3. Child of son Charles, to wit: J. B. Moorhead, Jr.,\n$100,000. (Now deceased, legacy has lapsed.)\n4. Children of daughter Caroline, to wit: Clara, $45,000; Amy, $55,000 ; Francis, $55,000; Barlow, $80,000=$235,000.\nThe will further provided: \u201c If any other children should be born to either of my children, then in such event, I direct that my trustees shall pay to such additional grandchild or children, living at the time of distribution, to each the sum of $25,000.\u201d Subject to the foregoing legacies, the will provided legacies of $5,000 each to seven nieces and nephews, to wit: Emily H. Russell, Julia E. Montgomery, Sarah E. Minor, Lydia G. Mc-Cleane, Thos. W. Veazey, Wm. F. Hirons andJ. B.M. Hirons, $35,000. Total legacies $820,000, subject to increase of $25,000, for each additional grandchild to be born. '\nSubject to the payment of the foregoing, the will proceeds: \u201c If there be anything remaining of my estate after payment of all the annuities, bequests, devises and legacies and just claims against my estate as hereinbefore specified and directed to be paid, I give and bequeath the same to my own right heirs.\u201d\nAs before stated, there can be no doubt as to the intention of the testator, which was that his whole residuary estate should be held in trust to pay certain annuities, and then after the death of all the annuitants, to pay the legacies above mentioned which aggregates upwards of $800,000 and subject to be -increased bj\u201d- the birth of other grandchildren. That such a trust, is lawful seems to the auditing judge too plain to admit of a. doubt. There are active duties for the trustees to perform.. There are annuities to be paid, income to be distributed and legacies in remainder to be protected. But it is contended that-the following clause of the testator\u2019s will imports an indefinite failure of issue, and therefore the first taker has an estate tail, which under the act of assembly is enlarged to a fee simple: \u201cIf either of my said children should die without issue, or the-issue of such child should fail during the continuance of this-trust, which is to continue as long as my wife or either of my children shall remain in full life, the share which would have-been of such child or its issue shall be divided equally among-the survivors of my said four children and living issue of any deceased child, taking only by representation and never per capita.\u201d There has been much learning expended upon the meaning of the words dying without issue and whether they import a definite or indefinite failure of issue ; but it now seems to be settled, that when applied to personal property, it means issue living at the death of the person to whom .the personalty is given in the first instance : Emma Myers\u2019s Appeal, 49 Pa. Ill; Francis\u2019s Estate, 4 Dist. Rep. 694; McCoy\u2019s Estate,.. 16 W. N. C. 248; Duffy\u2019s Estate, 36 W. N. C. 199, and Eachus\u2019s Appeal, 91 Pa. 105.\nIf the words used by the testator were only \u201c without issue \u201d they would, with regard to real estate (and this estate embraces both realty and personalty) import an indefinite failure of issue, as there would be no time fixed for the estate to vest and the devise would be void for remoteness. In this case, however, the time is fixed, as \u201c during the continuance of this trust which is to continue as long as my wife or either of my children shall remain in full life.\u201d There can be no question here of indefiniteness. The persons who are to take are fixed, and the time is fixed. The rules of construction which might apply in doubtful cases have no application here. It was argued that under the rule in Shelly\u2019s Case the children take an absolute estate. The auditing judge fails to see anything in this will that would justify the application of this rule. The balance of principal as shown by the account, after deducting the clerk\u2019s costs and for a copy of this adjudication, will remain in the hands of the accountants for the uses and purposes of the will of testator.\nExceptions to the adjudication were overruled.\nFrrors assigned were in not awarding the whole of the residuary estate to the four children.\nUood Grilpiu, with him Frank H. Cheyney and John G. Johnson, for appellant.\nAn heir at law can only be disinherited by express devise or necessary implication. Testator desired to protect by a trustee each grandchild\u2019s future enjoyment and possession of a part of his share at law, not to discriminate and prefer one to another: Bender v. Dietrick, 7 W. & S. 287; Bell\u2019s App., 147 Pa. 387; Grim\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 335; Lipman\u2019s App., 30 Pa. 180; Smith\u2019s App., 23 Pa. 9; France\u2019s App., 75 Pa. 220; Hitchcock v. Hitchcock, 35 Pa. 393; Hoffnerv. Wynkoop, 97 Pa. 130; Minter\u2019s App., 40 Pa. Ill; Horwitz v. Norris, 60 Pa. 280; Finney\u2019s App., 113 Pa. 18.\nWhere the meaning of a will is doubtful, the rule of equality among children may be taken as a guide of interpretation: Malone v. Dobbins, 23 Pa. 296; Bender\u2019s App., 3 Grant\u2019s Oases, 210.\nThere is no remainder to be protected as to the quarter interest of the appellant in this estate. Appellant\u2019s share in the principal is limited over to his issue, who will then be testator\u2019s right heirs, which requires no trust to protect it as it is executed by the statute, and becomes a fee in appellant by the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case: Kinsel v. Ramey, 87 Pa. 248; Philadelphia Trust Co.\u2019s App., 93 Pa. 209; Dodson v. Ball, 60 Pa. 492;' Tucker\u2019s App., 75 Pa. 355 ; Kay v.
