    "head_matter": "Estate of William K. Hemphill. Appeal of Clement M. Hemphill and A. Julian Hemphill.\nWill \u2014 Trusts and trustees \u2014 Active and continuing trusts.\nTo establish an active trust in Pennsylvania the duty to be performed by the trustee must not only involve some positive action on his part, but an action attended with some discretion. A trust to pay the \u201cnet income\u201d of realty to the cestui que trust involves the exercise of discretion by the trustee.\nWhere by the terms of the will the real estate, after the death of the widow, is left to certain children named, \u201cin trust, the net income of which shall belong to them share and share alike, and at their death, I give, devise and bequeath the same to their heirs, . ...\u201d an active, continuing trust is created, and a trustee will be appointed, upon petition, after the death of the widow.\nArgued Jan. 15, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 110, July T., 1896, by Clement M. Hempliill and A. Julian Hemphill, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., July T., 1896, No. 110, appointing trustee.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for the appointment of a trustee.\nFrom the record it appeared that testator died on April 1, 1874, leaving to survive him a widow and three sons. By his will he gave his widow all of his estate in trust for certain purposes. The material portion of the will as far as the present case is concerned is as follows:\n\u201c After the death of my said wife, Sarah Jane, I give and bequeath to my children above named, all of my personal property to be divided among them share and share alike. And my real estate I leave to them my said children, Clement M., William J., and Alexr. Julian, in trust, the net income of which shall belong to them share and share alike, and at their death I give, devise, and bequeath the same to their heirs, administrators, and assigns. In the event of any of my children dying without heirs, then his share shall be given to the survivor or survivors.\u201d\nThe widow of the decedent died without having married again on June 22,1896. The three sons are still living and are parties to this proceeding.\nThe opinion of the orphans\u2019 court by Ashman, J., was as follows:\nThe petition for the appointment of a trustee assumes that there is an active and subsisting trust. The will gave to the widow \u201c in trust \u201d all of the estate, \u201c the net income \u201d of which was, with certain exceptions, to belong to her for life. At her death, which has occurred, the personal estate was given to the children absolutely, and the real estate to them, naming them, \u201c in trust, the net income of which shall belong to them, share and share alike, and at their death, I give, devise, and bequeath the same to their heirs, administrators, and assigns. In the event of any one of my children dying without heirs, then his share shall be given to the survivors or survivor.\u201d An analysis of the.cases in Pennsylvania, which have settled the distinction between active and dry trusts, will show that, in the former class, the duty to be performed by the trustee must not only involve some positive action on his part, but an action attended with some discretion. The automatic function of merely receiving for the cestui que trust and immediately paying over to him the trust fund or its income will not make a trust active. The \u2022cestui que trust could perform the act as well, and he has no protection in the superior judgment of the trustee, because the trustee is not empowered to exercise his judgment. The cases properly describe him as a mere conduit. But when the trustee is invested with a discretion however slight, he takes the place of the donor, and the trust committed to him is active. A trust for the protection of the beneficiary, who may be a spendthrift, or a married woman, or a party in remainder, stands, of course, on a different footing, and is equally valid, whether the duties of the trustee are active or passive. That this testator intended to create a trust in his real estate is clear, because he said that much when he devised it \u201cin trust.\u201d That he intended the trust to be active is equally clear, because he directed the trustee to pay over the \u201cnet income.\u201d But the net income of real estate is only that portion which remains after the payment oi taxes, repairs, and commissions, and a large measure of discretion is incident to the payment of at least one of these charges. If the trustee should pay over the gross income to the cestui que trust, he would be liable for mismanagement.\nThe trust is a continuing trust for another reason. The estate in the children was an equitable estate for life, and the estate in remainder to their heirs was a legal estate. The two estates being of different qualities could not coalesce, and the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case did not therefore apply, and the trust was essential in order to protect the remaindermen: Little y. Wilcox, 119 Pa. 439.\nAmong other authorities establishing these plain propositions, McIntosh\u2019s Estate, 158 Pa. 528, decided that a devise to trustees with a direction to pay the rents, after deduction of taxes and repairs, to testator\u2019s grandsons, was an active trust. In Kountzleman\u2019s Estate, 21 W. N. 467, an active trust was implied from the direction to pay over the rents and profits. In Eley\u2019s Appeal, 103 Pa. 300, the devise was in trust to pay the income for life to A., and on his death to convey the fee to the proper heirs of A., and it included a power of sale in the trustee. The trust was held to be active and continuing. See also Livezey\u2019s Appeal, 106 Pa. 201.\nThe prayer of the petition is granted, and counsel will submit a decree specifying the trustee for whom they ask the appointment.\nDECBEE.\nAnd now, to wit, November 7, 1896, on motion of Charles E. Pancoast, Esq., the prayer of the above petition is granted, and A. Julian Hemphill is hereby appointed trustee under the will of William K. Hemphill, deceased, in place of trustees therein named who have renounced as set forth in said petition.\nError assigned among others was decree of the court, quoting it.\nAlbert B. Weimer, for appellants.\nNo ease can be found in Pennsylvania in which the mere use of the words \u201c net income,\u201d without more, has been held to create an active trust. If the decision of the orphans\u2019 court is sustained, this case will go further than any reported case on the subject.\nEven if an active trust were created by the will, as the gift is of the net income to the heirs, a trust is created in the heirs of the body for an equitable estate in fee tail, which under the act of 1855 would be an equitable estate in fee, and the two equitable estates would coalesce, and there would be created an equitable estate in fee, which would violate the rule against perpetuities. The word \u201c same \u201d grammatically refers to the words \u201cnet income,\u201d and not the word \u201cshare.\u201d To avoid such a result the will should be construed \u2014 as it very properly may \u2014 to give the first takers a legal estate in fee simple.\nHeirs will be held equivalent to \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d if there is a limitation over in default of heirs to a person who may be, or to several persons, some of whom may be, collateral heir or heirs to the first taker, the limitation over to collateral heirs showing that by \u201c heirs \u201d the testator meant \u201c heirs of the body: \u201d Theobald on Wills, 207; Harris v. Davis, 1 Collyer, 416; Webb v. Hearing, 2 Cro. 415; Seely v. Seely, 44 Pa. 484.\nCharles E. Pancoast, for appellee.\nThe trust for the life of the sons is active: Perry on Trusts, sec. 59; Forster v. Abraham, L. R. 17 Eq. 351; Stambaugh\u2019s Est., 135 Pa. 585.\nThe remainder over is of the legal estate: Bacon\u2019s App., 57 Pa. 504; Livezey\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 201.\nJanuary 25, 1897:"
