Subsequently the controller made a motion in the Supreme Court for leave to amend his return, so as to set forth as one of his reasons for refusing to countersign the warrant, the fact that he had made an investigation, and found that the relator was charging buyers of like quantities of dictionaries a lower price than that charged the board of education.

In support of the motion for leave to amend, the affidavit of John M. Walton, city controller, was filed.\nJames Alcorn, assistant city solicitor, with him John L.
