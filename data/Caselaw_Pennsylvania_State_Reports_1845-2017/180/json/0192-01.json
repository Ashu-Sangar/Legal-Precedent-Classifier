        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nWhen this case was first argued, 176 Pa. 809, the contention was over the corpus of the estate, for which there were five sets of claimants, and the claim of George Lodge for services was treated in the argument as collateral to the case of the English claimants and naturally failing when that failed. Our attention having been called more particularly to the situation of Lodge with regard to the property, we allowed a reargument on that point and are now satisfied that our previous decision did him injustice. It appears that for several years before the death of Capt. Bryant, Lodge was his man of business for the collection of rents and the management of his real estate, as well as his confidential adviser in other matters. The sudden death of Capt. Bryant without known heirs left Lodge in charge and quasi possession as an agent without a known principal, and therefore with at least a moral duty to look after the property for the real owner whoever he might prove to be. This duty the orphans\u2019 court found that he had performed in good faith, and was entitled to be compensated for. That he accepted the English claimants as the true heirs and endeavored to forward their claim may be excused in view of the fact that the learned court below took the same view. One of the items which seemed most strongly to cast doubt on his good faith was his failure to mention the English heirs at the time the register was considering the subject of administration, but our attention has been called to the material bearing of the rest of his language on that occasion which was that William and David Bryant, stepsons of the decedent, were the nearest of kin and there were \u201cno other heirs until further investigation.\u201d The reticency of Capt. Bryant about his early history and family connections, might fairly excuse a witness in being cautious about answers on that subject.\nAs the result of further consideration of this subordinate part of the case we are not satisfied that the learned court below committed any error in holding that Lodge had rendered services to the estate for which he was entitled to be compensated, and in fixing the amount.\nSo much of the order of this court heretofore entered, as reverses the decree of the court below upon the claim of George Lodge is now rescinded, and the decree as to that item is affirmed. This order however to be without prejudice as to any intervening rights or action of the administrator, and in case the latter has accounted fully for the assets in his hands, the said George Lodge shall be entitled to retain the amount allowed him by the orphans\u2019 court and also the costs of this reargiiment out of any moneys of the estate in his hands from rents or other sources.",

That the orphans\u2019 court awarded the said estate to Mary Ann Ferris, et al., the English claimants; that George E.

Bussinger, grand-nephews and nieces of Charles Bryant, deceased, claimants to the estate, from decree of the orphans\u2019 court of Philadelphia county, awarding the estate to Ann Chance, et al., English claimants; \u201d that the said appeal has been decided by your honorable court sustaining the said appeal, and that a petition for a rehearing was filed by and on behalf of the said Mary Ann Ferris, et al., who were the English claimants and appellees, but your petitioner is informed that the said petition has been refused.\nYour petitioner is not named as one of the appellees in the said appeal, was not served with notice of said appeal, and was not before your honorable court as one of the appellees, nor was the said claim of or award to your petitioner in any way considered, except indirectly in connection with the said award to the English claimants, in which award your petitioner has no interest; but your petitioner is advised that the said appellants refuse to admit the said award or claim of your petitioner on the ground that the said award and claim were not allowed by your honorable court, and that the decision of your honorable court against the appellees was in effect a decision against your petitioner.\nYour petitioner avers, that at the time of the death of the said Charles Bryant your petitioner was in charge of the real estate owned by the said decedent, and had in \u2022 his possession certain moneys received from the rents of said real estate; that it was the duty of your petitioner to take every precaution to see that the said real estate and moneys passed into the possession of the lawful heirs of the decedent; that in the honest and faithful discharge of said duty, as your petitioner understood it, your petitioner expended the said sum of $968 in hunting for the lawful heirs of the decedent and investigating their claims, and promised and agreed to pay to William W. Ker, Esq., the said sum of $500 for his professional services in assisting your petitioner in said investigation, and for which amount your petitioner is personally responsible, and which investigation occupied thirty-three days of the time of your petitioner, which time was of the full value of $20.00 a day, as claimed by your petitioner.\nYour petitioner has never appeared in your honorable court in the said case either as appellant, appellee, or petitioner for reargument, and he therefore prays that your honorable court will consider his said claim, and grant him a rehearing or reargument, or make such order and decree in regard to his said claim that justice may be done him in the premises.\nWilliam W. Ker, for George Lodge, petitioner.\nJohn G. Johnson, with him Samuel W. Cooper, for appellants.\nJ. Howard Gendell, for administrator.\nFebruary 22, 1897:"
