He also covenanted \u201c for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, that he will not suffer or permit to be filed.....any mechanics\u2019 lien or liens against the said building for the period of six months after its completion.\u201d\nThe sole question is whether the contractor by his covenant waived the right to file, or authorize a lien to be filed in his own favor. We think he did. While the phraseology of the stipulation is different from that in Long v. Caffrey, 93 Pa. 526, the legal effect of both is the same. The lien under consideration was necessarily filed by the plaintiff below himself, or by his sufferance or permission. In either case, it was as clearly a violation of his covenant as if he had suffered or permitted any mechanic or material-man to file a lien.\nThe defendant\u2019s point should have been affirmed, and a verdict directed in his favor.\nJudgment reversed.",

    "head_matter": "VALENTINE SCHEID v. DIONIS RAPP.\nERROR TO THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF LANCASTER COUNTY.\nArgued May 14, 1888\nDecided October 1, 1888.\nThe covenant of a contractor for work and materials to be done and supplied for the erection of a building, that he will not suffer or permit any mechanics\u2019 lien or liens to be filed, is a waiver of the right to file or cause to be filed a claim for a lien in his own favor: Long v. Caffrey, 93 Pa. 526, followed.\nBefore Gordon, C. J., Paxson, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ.; Trunkey and Williams, JJ., absent.\nNo. 87 July Term 1887, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 72 September Term 1885, C. P.\nOn September 8, 1885, there was issued a scire facias sur mechanics\u2019 lien, filed byDionis Rapp against Valentine Scheid. The defendant pleaded, \u201c nil debet, payment, payment with leave, set-off, and no lien.\u201d\nAt the trial on January 25, 1887, the plaintiff read in evidence the claim, dated March 10,1885, filed of record as a mechanics\u2019 lien the same day, wherein was claimed by the attached bill of particulars the sum of $3,310.77, due to the claimant for work done and materials furnished in the erection of a building, \u201c under and in pursuance of a contract between the said D. Rapp and Valentine Scheid, dated March 3, 1884, for the erection of said building, a copy of which contract is hereto annexed and made part of this claim.\u201d The contract annexed to the claim read, contained the following provision:\nAnd the said Dionis Rapp hereby for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, [covenants] that he will not suffer or permit to be filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster county any mechanics\u2019 lien or liens against the said building for the period of six months after its completion.\nThe plaintiff was called as a witness in his own behalf.\nThe defendant objected to the reception of any evidence on the part of the plaintiff, as the contract, made a part of the claim, provided that no mechanics\u2019 lien should be filed.\nBy the court: This is not a case parallel with Long v. Caffery, 93 Pa. 526; objection overruled.1\nThe plaintiff then testified to facts immaterial upon the question here decided, when the defendant withdrew all his pleas except that of nil debet, and asked the court to charge the jury as follows:\nBy the contract entered into for the erection of the building, a copy of which is annexed to the claim filed, plaintiff agreed that no mechanics\u2019 lien should be entered against the said building, and he is therefore estopped from filing a lien, and cannot recover in this case.3\nThe court, Patterson, J., refused the defendant\u2019s point, and instructed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff for $478.27.\nA verdict for the plaintiff having been returned as directed, a rule for a new trial was subsequently discharged and judg-\u2019 ment entered, when the defendant took this writ, assigning as error:\n1. The admission of plaintiff\u2019s offer.1\n3. The refusal of defendant\u2019s point.3\nMr. Jno. A. Coyle and Mr. J. Hay Brown, for the plaintiff in error:\nThe plaintiff covenanted that he would not suffer or permit any mechanics\u2019 lien or liens to be filed. A covenant must be construed most strongly against the covenantor, and when one covenants not to suffer or permit a thing to be done, he covenants not only against the acts of others, but against his own acts : Commonwealth v. Curtis, 9 Allen 271; Cowley v. The People, 83 N. Y. 471; Hobson v. Middleton, 6 B. & C. 295, 303; Selleck v. Selleck, 19 Conn. 505. What essential difference can be found between the stipulation of this contract and that of Long v. Caffrey, 93 Pa. 526 ?\nMr. B. F. Davis and Mr. S. H. Reynolds (with them Mr. W. H. Roland), for the defendant in error:\nThe only case passed upon by this court that is parallel with the one at bar, so far as we have found, is Young v. Lyman, 9 Pa. 449. In the contract in that case there was this clause: \u201c All materials to be paid for, four months after the completion of the job, and Young to give security in $500 that no liens shall be entered on the houses.\u201d It was ruled, that the stipulation was that no other person, or sub-contractor, should file a lien, and that the lien filed by the contractor was valid. In Mubrey v. Barrow, 11 Allen 152, it was held that a lien might be enforced for labor performed under the employment of one who agreed with the owner to erect the house, and to pay and discharge all claims for labor and materials furnished, so that there should be no liens upon the premises. And in all the cases, when it was stipulated that no liens should be filed, it has been held that, unless the agreement specifically included the contractor as a person who should not file a lien, as in Long v. Caffrey, 93 Pa. 526, the stipulation did not bind the contractor not to file a lien himself, but simply held him to prevent the filing of liens by material-men and sub-contractors."
