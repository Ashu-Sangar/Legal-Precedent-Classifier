The plaintiff became a holder of stock at or soon after the organization and served as a director, but on December 23, 1872, he sold and assigned his shares and retired. The association became insolvent and closed its doors on November 14, 1873. Suits were afterwards brought by depositors and other creditors against the plaintiff, with other copartners, and to these suits the plaintiff made defence that hé had withdrawn from the association as stated, and was not liable for debts contracted before he became a member, or after the date of the sale of Ms <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>shares. The judgments of the Common Pleas were for the plaintiffs, upon both positions. One of the suits was taken to this court on writ of error, when the judgment therein was reversed, this court deciding that while an incoming partner was not liable for antecedent partnership liabilities, unless he had agreed to assume such liability, yet, on the sale of his shares and his retirement without notice thereof, his liability to subsequent creditors remained: Shamburg v. Ruggles, <a href="/pa/83/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="83 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1050826" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0148-01">83 Pa. 148</a>.

    <p class="summary" id="b477-6" data-blocks='[["BL_477.5",477,[123,1184,1187,1225]]]'>The Citizens Bank of .Titusville was a partnership association ; not a corporation, nor anything of that sort; but a huge partnership association, organized in 1870 for the purpose of doing a banking business. They issued certificates of stock to members, and it was provided in the articles of association that the stock should be divided into equal shares, and that persons would become members or copartners by virtue of subscribing to them, or becoming purchasers of certain shares of stock in the association..... Its business management seems to have been confined to a board of directors; the number I do not recollect, nor is it of any importance. It was provided that a person could become a member of the association, either by subscription, or otherwise by purchase of stock and signing the articles of association, but when he sold his interest, he should assign it on certain assignment books, and that assignment should be approved by the board of directors..... This was done for the protection of the remaining members, so that a solvent person, a good business man, a member of the firm, would not be permitted to sell his interest in the firm to some worthless, insolvent person, and thereby injure the chances of success, or render the liability of those in it greater. Therefore, it was well provided that in the going in and coming out of a person, they should follow the provisions set forth in the articles of association.</p>

Mr. Jackson testified that he was an original member, not an original subscriber to the stock, but that certain shares of stock had been secured for him, and awaited his pleasure, and the evidences of the stock were issued in the name of William H. Abbott, and when the plaintiff paid his money the stock was transferred by Abbott to Shamburg, and the money he paid went into the association account, and he was to all intents and purposes an original member of the firm. Whether he was an original member, or became so by purchase, is of very little importance.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b478-5" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[280,973,1192,560]]]'>It is certain he did not sign the articles of association. There is evidence he had them in his hand and some minutes of the proceedings of the directors, whether few or more, I do not know. The evidence of Mr. Jackson is for you upon that point. He had the opportunity to see, read and make himself acquainted with the contents of those articles of association. He did not sign them, but paid his money and took his certificate of stock. He had that certificate of stock ten months, until December 28, 1872, when he sold out to Mr. Abbott, his original vendor. Thereby he claimed to have retired from the association, and to remain no longer liable for the debts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.5",478,[274,1539,1191,663]]]'>Thus things remained until September or October, 1873, when the bank closed its doors in consequence of the panic of that year and ceased to do- business. The creditors undertook to pursue various members of the association, and amongst others pursued Dr. Shamburg, this plaintiff. Dr. Shamburg was held by this court and by the Supreme Court to be a partner of the association, so far as the creditors were concerned, because he did not avail himself of the requirements of the law upon the subject of a retiring partner, by giving notice of his retirement. You will bear in mind he was a director and advertised as such in the. Titusville papers, but he neglected to have his name taken from the list of directors, and was held by the various creditors as one of the partners.....</p>

The relation of principal and surety you understand. In ordinary language it is called bail. The plaintiff claims to be surety, or in other words, bail, for these persons. If he claims to have paid debts to persons, which the remaining partners were liable for, he has a right of action. The Supreme Court has held that, as to the remaining members of the firm, he did stand as surety if he paid debts he was not legally liable for, and went out according to the terms of partnership, or effectually went out from a legal point of view..... The plaintiff therefore brought this suit on March 10, 1888, and under no circumstances, the statute of limitations having been pleaded, can he recover in this case for any claims or debts that he paid, even of his own showing, prior to- March 10, 1877, and they are substantially withdrawn.</p>

Wm. H. Abbott, George O. Moody, J. J. Holden, George K. Anderson, Frederick Bates, F. W. Ames, W. W. Davis, Lyman Stewart are defendants. All of them have been discharged in bankruptcy by the United States District Court. That being the case, they are free from any debt .which was provable prior to their applications; these being some of those debts they are discharged from them, and your verdict will be for them in any event. James B. Kerr, Jacob Cadwalader and H. B. Porter claim to have been released by the plaintiff by Virtue of a paper writing, which was executed <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>by the plaintiff on October 18, 1879, wherein this present plaintiff releases and discharges these persons, together with certain other persons, Purdon, Bronson and Archbold, who have not been sued, from liability on account of their alleged copartnership with the other defendants and the plaintiff, as the Citizens Bank of Titusville, from charges against them in the bill filed in this case. Therefore they claim to be released from any liability to the plaintiff, and this is a release from liability, and it is sufficient to discharge them, and your verdict will be in favor of Kerr, Cadwalader and Porter. This leaves of the defendants only one unfortunate individual, W. W. Thompson, upon whom the burden of this suit falls. He defends, not by any reason of discharge in bankruptcy or release. He claims to be discharged of these debts by the statute of limitations, and for part of the debts because the plaintiff discharged these persons and Purdon, Bronson and Anderson, not sued, plaintiff releasing them, they being the owners of about $85,000 stock of this bank, and defendant Thompson claims it releases him from or thirty-five per cent, of the indebtedness claimed against him by this plaintiff. And this, we say to you, is an effective claim. But the defendant claims more than that, and this, after all, gentlemen, together with one other point, are the impinging points in the case, so far as clearing W. W. Thompson from any liability to the plaintiff in this case is concerned.</p>

It is the act of March <em>22, </em>1862, P.

Also, that the compromise was made before the payments were made by the plaintiff. If that be true, we say to you that it is an exoneration of this defendant from these debts. If there was no debt existing against W. W. Thompson in favor of these creditors at the time Dr. Sham-burg paid them, the principle sought to be invoked by the defendant is available. [When a certain person is legally bound to pay a debt for his principal, he occupies the position of surety, and if the surety pays the debt, he has a right of action.

Mr. Thompson testifies he was a member of the association, and he knew nothing of the fact or allegation that Dr. Shamburg left the firm at the time he is alleged to have done so, and he did not know anything about it until the bank closed business. Mr. Bates and Mr. Holden, members of the firm, also testified substantially the same thing There is no evidence the directors knew of it; he says he did not know of it as a matter of fact; that the plaintiff did become a member, <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>but there was a paper writing whereby persons became members, and no person should come in or go out of the firm without following the provision made necessary by the firm itself.</p>

If he remains in the partnership he cannot claim in this suit, because the very gist or gravamen of his action is that he is out of the partnership. If you find he did go in and come out by a sort of common consent, not being required to do what the paper requires, you come to the other matter, whether these debts, which Dr. Shamburg claims in this case, were paid by Thompson ; and did he receive a release in accordance with the act of assembly of 1862, giving the debtor the privilege to compromise with his creditors; if he did, Dr. Shamburg could pay no debt for him, and did not stand in the relation of surety to him. . . .</p>

And in Shamburg v. Abbott, <a href="/pa/112/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="112 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="546720" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0006-01">112 Pa. 6</a>, it was further determined, that, though as between the creditors and the plaintiff the latter was liable as a principal, yet as be<a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>tween him and his former partners he stood in the relation of a surety, and that it was the duty of his principals, now the defendants in this case, to indemnify that surety against their debts. That duty was not performed by Thompson by obtaining releases of himself from creditors which retained in full vigor their rights against the plaintiff. The, plaintiff may show the truth, that as between himself and Thompson, he was not a partner, and therefore a principal, and the act of March 22, 1862, P. L. 167, has no application. The object of the act was to enable creditors to hold out inducements to joint debtors to do equity with each other; not to work such iniquity as is involved in casting the burden of the debt upon the surety and releasing the principal. Moreover, in the part of the charge assigned for error, the learned judge told the jury that Thompson was a <em>surety. </em>This was undoubtedly a slip of the tongue, but how were the jury to know that ?</p>

Other assignments raise the question whether the plaintiff could go out of the partnership by the door he had entered it, if, indeed, as between himself and the defendants, he was ever a member thereof. The plaintiff was not one of the original members, and never signed the articles of association, but, sometime after the (Organization, had purchased shares through the cashier as his broker, from some person unknown to him. On his retirement, he sold his shares to Abbott, the president of the association, a member thereof and of the board of directors, but, as in the case of his purchase, there was no formal assent to the transfer by the board. Under these circumstances, as well as under the testimony of Jackson, tending to show an abandonment of the articles of association: Grove v. Donaldson, <a href="/pa/15/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="15 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="408769" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0128-01">15 Pa. 128</a>; McKinney v. Reader, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%20123" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 W. 123">7 W. 123</a>, it would seem clear that after the plaintiff’s sale of his shares to Abbott, he was not a member of the partnership, whatever his relation to it may have been before.</p>

L. 167, Shamburg paid a part of the residue of some of the same debts and obtained his release. But he paid nothing for Thompson, he was not surety for Thompson in any sense. Moreover, if a creditor who had released Thompson had brought suit against the partners upon his claim, he could not have recovered against Thompson, and, if the creditor, suing in his own name, could not so recover, then the plaintiff, having paid the balance of the creditor’s claim could not.</p>

It seems reasonably certain that all of the defendants, with the single exception of W. W. Thompson, were entitled to a verdict in their favor, by reason of either releases from the plaintiff or by their discharge in bankruptcy. And even as to Thompson, the jury have found in his favor upon sufficient evidence, and, for anything that appears, under proper instructions from the court. The plaintiff claims to have paid certain liabilities for Thompson, for which he, plaintiff, was surety. We are not furnished with the pleadings in the case, and can therefore only judge of the issue in a general way.
