The evidence establishes this, and it is admitted by the prisoner. There are two versions of the circumstances accompanying and surrounding this homicide. The case as presented by the commonwealth, in the evidence <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>of Lafayette Crandall, is briefly and substantially this: On July 15, last, Crandall and Hocum were living together in a house not far from Stephen Tiffany’s. Crandall had married Hocum’s daughter. Not far from one o’clock in the afternoon, they went to Stephen Tiffany’s, where they remained until near three o’clock, when each took a small pail, and together they went into the field of Judson Tiffany, to pick berries. When they got to the upper side of the field, near the brush, they saw Judson Tiffany, who ordered them out of the lot, when they came within a few feet of him. Hocum was nearer to the prisoner than Crandall was. Crandall heard no talk between Hocum and the prisoner until they were ordered out of the lot by him. Crandall and Hocum started to leave the lot, Crandall saying to Hocum, “ this is no place for us, let us get out.” And as they started to go out of the lot, Crandall was ahead, Hocum following him, and the prisoner following Hocum. Crandall got nearly to the road, and some 80 or 40 feet below where Tiffany and Hocum were, when he heard Tiffany say, “ Hurry up, get there damn you, or I will hurry you with a bullet; ” and Hocum then turned around and replied, “You have got to give me a reasonable time to get out, and if you want to shoot, why shoot; ” and Tiffany got up close enough and slapped him once or twice in the face, with his fist or his flat hand, and he threw his hand up to ward the blow off. Then Crandall started back towards them, and when he came within six or ten feet of Tiffany, he hauled out a revolver and shot, and Hocum fell. And Crandall then seized Tiffany by the right wrist and by the neck and brought him to the ground. Tiffany said to him, “ Let me up, I Avont shoot you,” and Crandall said to him, “ Give up your revolver,” and Tiffany replied, “I will never do it.” Crandall then choked him until he gave it up, and then got off from him and went to Hocum, and turned him over to see how badly he was hurt, and he only gasped tAvice, and Tiffany was then running toAvards the orchard, by a downward course, towards the road. This is substantially the evidence of Lafayette Crandall, in chief, as to the circumstances attending and illustrating this homicide. It is the evidence of the only witness on the part of the commonwealth, Avho was present or very near the place or scene of the homicide. In the cross-exami<a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>nation of Crandall, there may be some modifications of this statement, but not in any very material matters.

Hocum said to him, “ Why don’t you let Steve alone ? Why do you meddle with his distillery ? ” To this the prisoner replied “ That is my business ” and Hocum said “We will make it ours, and if you don’t stop informing against him we will fix you in a way that you will wish you never had.” That Tiffany said in reply “ Gentlemen, get off from my premises, I willnotbe abused on my land. You shall not pick berries here.” And Crandall said “ Lick him, Sam, you can do it without my help, and I will go and sit down and see the fun.” And Crandall then started away, slowly, and Hocum called the prisoner names,' and used hard language ; that the prisoner told the deceased to get off, and that the deceased put his hand in the prisoner’s face, and then the prisoner told him that he didn’t want any quarrel, that he had never struck a man in his life ;• that the deceased then struck the prisoner on the stomach and on the right cheek; that the prisoner requested to be let alone; that he told the deceased that if he wanted to quarrel he could have his drunken quarrels with his son-in-law, as he did the other night, when he got his face marked; that the deceased picked up a stone and struck the prisoner on the left side, stunning him; that the deceased then, with a stone in his hand, sai,d “I will smash your brains out, you son of a bitch,” and at that moment the prisoner saw Crandall running towards him, with his fist doubled up; that the prisoner was frightened and called “ Help; ” that Hocum said, “ I will help you with a bullet,” and Crandall said, “Shoot him, Sam, shoot him;” that Hocum, with a stone in one hand, put his other hand towards his hip pocket and stepped towards the prisoner; that <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>the prisoner, having heard that Crandall and the deceased were desperate characters and quarreled among themselves and 'threatened to shoot each other, and threatened to kill each other, suddenly thought of his revolver that he had in his pocket, and jerked it out, and was so excited and scared that he could hardly realize when the revolver went off and killed Hocum; that just then Crandall caught hold of him, and jerked him down, and placed one hand upon the prisoner’s throat, and the other on the revolver; that then the prisoner heard a voice saying, “ Keep the revolver, Lafe,” and that Crandall then let the prisoner go, and he got away, and that he can hardly tell how he got home.</p>

Whenever the act evidences a deadly revenge, and not the mere heat of blood; whenever it is the result of a devilish disposition, and not merely the frenzy of rage, it is not manslaughter, but murder. To excuse homicide by the plea of self defence, it must appear that the slayer had no other possible, or at least probable, means of escaping, and <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>that his act was one of necessity. The act of the slayer must be such as is necessary to protect a person from death or great bodily harm, and must not be entirely disproportionate to' the assault made upon him. If the slayer use a deadly weapon, and under such circumstances as the slayer must be aware that death will be likely to ensue, the necessity must be great, and must arise from imminent peril of life or great bodily injury. If there be nothing in the circumstances indicating to the slayer, at the time of his act, that his assailant is about to take his life, or to do him great bodily harm, but his object appears to be only to commit an ordinary assault and battery, it will not excuse a man of equal, or nearly equal strength in taking his assailant’s life with a deadly weapon. In such cases it requires a great disparity of size and strength on the part of the slayer, and a very violent assault on the part of his assailant to excuse him. The disparity, on the one hand, and the violence on the other, must be such as convinces the jury that great bodily harm, if not death, would follow, unless the slayer had thus defended himself, or that the slayer had reasonable ground to think it would be so. The burden lies upon the prisoner in such a case, of proving that there was an actual necessityfor taking life, or a seeming one, so reasonably apparent and convincing to him as to lead him to believe he could only defend himself in that way. This principle and right of self defense applies although it should afterwards appear that the apprehended imminent danger was not actual. When one who is without fault is attacked by another in such a manner, or under such circumstances, as to furnish reasonable ground for apprehending a design to take away his life oído him great bodily harm, and there is reasonable ground for believing the danger imminent that such design will be accomplished, he may safely act upon appearances and kill his assailant, if that be necessary to avoid the apprehended danger, and the killing will be excusable, although it may afterwards turn out that the appearances were false and that there was in fact neither a design to do him serious injury, nor danger that it would be done. It is the reasonable apprehension of imminent danger to life, or of great bodily harm, based upon the appearances existing at the time, that the law regards as sufficient, when acted upon, to excuse a homicide.....</p>

      <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>It is a general rule that all homicide is presumed to be malicious, that is, murder of some degree, until the contrary appears in the evidence. Therefore, the burden of reducing the crime of murder to manslaughter, where it is proved that the prisoner committed the deed, lies on him. He must show all the circumstances of alleviation or excuse, upon which he relies to reduce his offence from murder to a milder .form of homicide, unless the facts already in evidence show it. But though the homicide without circumstances of alleviation or excuse is presumed to be murder, it is not presumed to be murder of the first degree. The presumption against him rises no higher than murder in the second degree, until it is shown by the commonwealth to be murder in the first degree. It therefore lies on the commonwealth to satisfy the jury of those facts and circumstances which indicate a deliberate intention to kill, and the cool depravity of heart and conscious purpose which constitute, as before stated, the crime of murder in the first degree.....In deciding upon the case or any material part of it, it is the duty of the jury to give the prisoner the benefit of any reasonable' doubt arising out of the evidence, which prevents them from coming to a satisfactory conclusion.. But this doubt must fairly arise out of the evidence, and not be merely fancied, or conjured up. The jury must not raise a mere fanciful doubt, to escape the consequences of an unpleasant verdict. It must be an honest doubt, such a difficulty as to fairly strike a conscientious mind and cloud the judgment. [If there be a reasonable doubt that any offence has been committed by the prisoner, it operates to acquit. But if the evidence clearly establishes the killing by the prisoner, purposely, with a deadly weapon, an illegal homicide of some kind is established, and the burden then lies upon the prisoner to show that it w'as excusable, or an act of self defence.] 4 In connection with these general instructions 1 will read to you the points submitted in behalf of the prisoner, and answer them.</p>

Lord Holt lays down this ancient law in Regina v. Mawbridge, Kelyng 122, to wit: “ If a man was found to be slain, it was always intended, (1) that he was a Frenchman ; (2) that he was killed by an,Englishman;. (3) that the killing was murder; (4) if any one was apprehended to be the murderer, he was to be tried by fire and water, though he killed him by misfortune; which was extended beyond reason and justice in favor of the Normans.” At all events, the doctrine of the presumption of malice, was confined to cases of secret homicide, and does not apply, to those cases'where the facts and circumstances are proved, and the existence of malice from- the whole evidence left in doubt.</p>

(2) The burden is then upon the defendant to show excuse or extenuation. (3) His guilt or innocence depends upon the preponderance of evidence. The doctrine of Commonwealth v. York, has been much questioned. “ Generally there are attendant circumstances, e. g., the place, the character of the attack, the relative position or strength of the parties, etc., from which some inference may be logically drawn by the jury, as to whether the accused did or did not commit the homicide with felonious intent; and when such circumstances are proved in the case, the presumption of felonious intent, <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>if indeed there is such a presumption, disappears, and the whole question of felonious intent lies open to the jury, who must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt from all the facts of the ease that the homicide was with such intent before they can legally convict the accused: ” 3 Greenl.

It is permitted only in particular cases and under certain circumstances. The only ground on which the character of Crandall could have been proven, is on the theory that Tiffany would have been justified had he killed Crandall. But the conduct of Crandall, as described by the defendant himself, in his testimony, would hardly have justified a simple assault, much less the taking of his life.</p>

Considerable evidence was introduced for the purpose of showing that the prisoner was assaulted on his own premises by deceased and his companion Lafayette Crandall; that the attack was so fierce and violent as to warrant him in believing he was in danger of great bodily harm or loss of life unless he used the pistol in defending; <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>himself.

If' he wanted to quarrel he could have his drunken quarrels with his son-in-law, as he had the other night, when he got his face marked. He picked up a stone and struck me in the left side, stunning me. He had another stone, and says, ‘ I will smash your brains out, you son of a bitch ; ’ and just then I saw Crandall running.

In that portion of his charge recited in the third specification, the learned judge, after reminding the jury that he had “ refused to affirm two of the prisoner’s points with reference to the crime of murder in the second degree,” said, “ I refuse to say, as requested in those points, that if the circumstances in evidence, put there either by the prisoner or the commonwealth, raised a reasonable doubt of that crime, that those facts and circumstances would operate to acquit of it.” Again: 66 If the facts and circumstances are in evidence, no matter by whom produced, which make the extenuation that reduces it (grade of the crime), they have the effect to reduce it, but those facts and circumstances must be more than sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt.” This was misleading and erroneous; and the error is not cured by what he said in immediate connection with the first quoted sentence.</p>

In other words, it is not a presumption juris et de jure — an irrebuttable presumption. Malice, for example, is an essential ingredient of murder, either of the first or second degree,- and while its existence may be presumed from certain proved or admitted facts, the presumption is not necessarily conclusive. There may be rebutting evidence for the consideration of the jury.

Hence, according to the distinction just stated, the burden is on the defendant to prove provocation in all cases where he opens this defence ; yet, when the evidence on both sides is closed, he is entitled to an acquittal if he has offered proof enough to cast a reasonable doubt on the averments of malice and premeditation, when thus essential.”</p>
