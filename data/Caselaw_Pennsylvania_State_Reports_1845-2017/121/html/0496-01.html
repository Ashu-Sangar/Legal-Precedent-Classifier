They run this pipe up to the upper floors of the <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>court house where they took from it a supply for the court house, and from there it conducted the surplus water to the box at the corner of the public grounds; the citizens of Ridgway take water from this box by seven pipes laid to different parts of the town. This state of affairs remained until the summer of 1885, when the commissioners erected and constructed a large and expensive jail and sheriff’s residence, and a much larger supply of water was needed for the county buildings, they being arranged with urinals, water closets, bath tubs, laundry and steam heating apparatus. For some reason, in the summer of 1885, the supply failed to a considerable extent and there was for a month or two prior to the filing of the bill in this case, not enough water for court house or jail, and the supply to the citizens of Ridgway also failed. The county buildings would become unfit for use without a supply of water. This spring is located about fifty-six feet above the level of the ground at the court house. It is shown to be a large spring, that would probably fill a 5-inch pipe, and, if economically used for domestic purposes, would in all probability supply the people of Ridgway, besides the county buildings. There is no other source from which a sufficient supply could be obtained without great expense.</p>

The court held this mere denial of the right did not constitute a disturbance of the exercise- of that right. But between that case and the one at bar there is, it seems to me, a clear distinction of importance, upon the facts. In this case the plaintiffs set out to exercise the right claimed, and were met by the defendants at the place of entry on their lands, and were forbid entering thereon, and were threatened with arrest if they did enter. There was something in this on the part of the defendants that was active in its nature, and from which it could be implied that they intended to resist the exercise of the right claimed. It was an act opposing the plaintiffs, accompanied by a threat.

The authority of this case I fully recognize. There is a long line of cases to the same effect, among which may be mentioned: Brown’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/62/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="62 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1017274" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0017-01">62 Pa. 17</a>, and Mining’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/82/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="82 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="1047862" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0373-01">82 Pa. 373</a>, and their authority remains undoubted; but it does not seem to me that the doctrine of those cases is applicable to the facts of this case. In Rhea v. Forsyth, there was no writing witnessing the right claimed, and there was much conflict in the testimony relating to both the grounds on which the plaintiff rested his claim. In Brown’s Appeal, there was a serious dispute about the very terms of the contract that had not been reduced to writing. In Minnig’s Appeal, the plaintiff’s rights had been made more than doubtful by the finding of the master, and an action of ejectment was pending. In the case in hand the plaintiff’s title is by deed, about the due execution of which there is no dispute. There appears to be no serious conflict in the testimony upon any material point in the case. There is no contention that requires to be settled by a jury. A chancellor may declare the rights of the parties upon the construction of writings and upon facts not seriously controverted. Under such circumstances the right is clear, and it would seem to me that, as it was held in Hacke’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/101/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="101 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="500867" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0245-01">101 Pa. 245</a>, “It need not first be established by a suit at law, nor is it necessary that the owner should prove special damage to entitle him to a decree.

The .arrangement made with Earley in 1874, as the master correctly found, was only of a temporary character, not made with the view of surrendering any of the rights of the county to the spring. The appellants, in possession of and claiming title to the lot on which the spring is located, had no occasion to interfere with the appellees in the exercise of their right “to freely use and enjoy......without limit, so much of the water” of the spring in question, as might be necessary or convenient to supply the public buildings of the county, etc., according to the true intent and meaning of the grant. In the deed of July 7,1859, conveying said lot, the right of the county to the use of the spring, acquired sixteen years before, is distinctly recognized and reserved by the grantor thus : “reserving the right for the water from the large spring to be brought to the public square in such way as may be desired, and of repairing or relaying said conveyance at any time without molestation.”</p>

When the supply of water through the pipes failed and the commissioners went to the premises occupied by defendants and on which the spring is located, for the purpose of examining the ground and ascertaining what was necessary to be done, they were forbidden to enter and threatened with arrest if they attempted to do so. As public officers, intrusted with the care and management of the public property, and acting clearly within the line of their duty, the commissioners were not bound to wait until some overt act of violence was committed by the defendants, nor to provoke a breach of the peace by ignoring the threats that were made and proceeding to discharge their duty. The situation was one that required prompt and efficient action. The continued lack of water at the public buildings might have been attended with serious consequences, especially in case of fire. It would have been unwise to wait until the termination of an action of trespass or even of a criminal action. Under the cir<a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>cumstances, they acted discreetly as well as legally in promptly appealing to the court for protection from threatened injury and interference with the proper discharge of their duty. Nobody doubts the soundness of the principle that equity will not assume jurisdiction where there is a full, complete and adequate remedy at law. In this ease no legal remedy that could have been resorted to would have been either full, complete or adequate. As was said in Bierbower’s App., <a href="/pa/107/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="107 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="8856062" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0014-01">107 Pa. 14</a>, 17, “ Jurisdiction in equity depends not so much on the want of a common law remedy as upon its inadequacy, and its exercise is a matter which often rests in the discretion of the court; <em>in </em>other words, the court may take upon itself to say whether the common law remedy is, under all the circumstances and in view of the conduct of the parties, sufficient for the purposes of complete justice, or whether the intervention of chancery may not for that purpose be required and beneficially applied: Bispham, Eq., § 484.”</p>
    <p id="b543-5" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[163,1213,1180,344]]]'>But, as already intimated, it is not our purpose to elaborate subjects that have been so fully and ably discussed by the learned master, and correctly disposed of by the court below. The unjustifiable interference of the defendants would perhaps have warranted the court in going a step further than it did, and imposing the costs on them, but that question is not before us.</p>
