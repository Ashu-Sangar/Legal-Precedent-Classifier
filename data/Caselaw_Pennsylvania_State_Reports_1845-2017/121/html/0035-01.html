The law provides, that where property is actually taken there may be azi application made to court by either the railroad company or the person whose property it has taken, for the appointment of seven disinterested freeholders, who value the property and who znake report to couz’t, but from their award of damages there can be an appeal by either side, and then the case comes, as this has, before a jury in court for the final determination. But that law applies only-where land is actually taken by the occupatiozr of the railroad, except in one particular case. [When a railroad is cozrstructed upon a street iza a borough, damages in this way cazi be assessed ozrly where there is a change in the grade of the street by excavatiozi or embankmezit, and where such excavation or embankznezrt causes the injury to the property.] 1 In such a case as that, although no land is actually taken by the railroad company, they are still responsible in damages for the injury to the market value of the property abutting upon the <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>street, so far as it is caused by any excavation or embankment in the street. The law reads as follows: “ That whenever any company shall locate its road in and upon any street or alley in any city or borough, ample compensation shall be made to the owners of lots fronting upon such street or alley, for any damages they may sustain by reason of any excavation or embankment made in the construction of such road, to be ascertained as other damages are authorized to be ascertained by this act.” Therefore injuries to property, although the property itself be not taken, are to be compensated for in the manner which I have explained to you; but where the injury is not caused by an embankment or an excavation made in the construction of the railroad, there, although property may be injured which fronts upon the street, this particular remedy does not apply. The person injured, however, still has his remedy. Before the late constitution was framed, a person, as the law formerly stood, who had property abutting upon a public street, but none of which was taken by the railroad, could recover no damages against a railroad company which constructed its road directly in front of the property, so long as it did not take any part of the land of the sufferer, however much he may have been injured by the railroad. But the present constitution provides that no property can even be injured without compensation by any corporation which constructs a railroad in front of it upon the street on which it abuts; no property can be <em>injured </em>though not <em>taken </em>for public use without adequate compensation ; and therefore, those who are thus injured have their remedy by an ordinary action at law. But they cannot proceed in this way unless they can show that there has been a change of grade in the street upon which their property abuts, which causes the injury either by an excavation or embankment. Therefore, whether you will enter upon the calculation of damages which have been suffered in this case, will depend upon whether you find that the injury to the property of the plaintiff has been caused by any excavation or embankment made by the railroad company on Washington street. [It is said on the part of the plaintiff, a siding leading into his property was destroyed. That siding was destroyed because it was necessarily constructed upon an embankment made by the owner of that property, leading from the Reading railroad by an elevated track on to his prem<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>ises. . That was an artificial embankment in the street, and so far as it was an artificial embankment made in the street for this purpose, I charge you that no excavation of it, although it did destroy the siding, would be the subject of damages in this case, because this was a regularly laid out public street, and although it had not been opened by lawful authority, no property owner along it had the right under the law to build upon it, or to put any obstruction there which would interfere with the ultimate opening of the street, or, if he did so, he could not recover damages because of their abatement afterwards. The laying out of the street, according to the law under which it was laid out, was notice to all persons owning property fronting upon it that it was a public street, and that at some future time it would be opened and used as such; and therefore every man who put any obstruction into it, did so at his own risk, and he could hold no person responsible for its removal afterwards, when the space where it stood came to be used as a lawful public street. Therefore I instruct you, that you must find, apart from the excavation made through this artificial embankment, that the grade of Washington street in front of the plaintiff’s property was changed either by an excavation or by an embankment; and, if the general level of the street along there, as it originally existed, was not altered, but, after the completion of the railroad, the level was about as it existed before the artificial bank which supported the plaintiff’s siding was constructed, there can be no recovery of damages in this case. Nor would an infinitesimal elevation or depression of the street avail the plaintiff. It must be a substantial alteration by excavation or embankment, and it must have been of a character so as to cause the injury alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff. I leave the- facts entirely to you. If you can find in this case evidence to justify you in finding such change of grade, and further that that change of grade caused the injury to the plaintiff’s property, then, and then only, will you take into consideration the question of what his damages amount to. If you find they were not caused by such change of grade, your verdict will be for the defendants; and the plaintiff will be left to pursue the other remedies which the law affords him.] a For he is entitled, if not in this form, in another form of action, to recover for all the damages which he has sus<a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>tamed. If you find that the injuries to his property were caused in the manner in which I have explained, by excavation or embankment, apart from the removal of the artificial embankment which the owner of the property himself placed in the street, you will award the plaintiff such damages as you find he has sustained, measured by the depreciation in the market value of his property, with interest upon it from the 15th of September, 1883.</p>

The street was located on the town plot with the view of its being thereafter regularly opened by the' borough authorities for public use as a street of the borough, and not for the purpose of securing a right-of-way for defendant’s benefit. Subject to the rights of the borough authorities, to be exercised when they saw fit to do so, the property in question belonged to plaintiff. The mere location of the street, and noting it on the borough plan gave the railroad company no control over the land embraced within its lines. The siding and connection with the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company had been maintained and used by plaintiff and his predecessor in title for many years without objection from any one who had a right to interfere with his enjoyment thereof. The right of plaintiff, as owner in possession and enjoyment of the premises, is recognized by the company itself in its petition and appropriation bond filed in court; and, if the trial had been conducted on that theory, the errors complained of would not have occurred. Whatever may have been the right of the borough authorities, on the one hand, to open and prepare the plotted street for public use, and the right of plaintiff, on the other hand, to demand compensation for the use thus made of his property, it is very clear that defendant company has no right to locate and construct its road on the premises in question without liability to make compensation according to the terms and conditions of the bond which it tendered and obtained permission to file for his use and benefit.
