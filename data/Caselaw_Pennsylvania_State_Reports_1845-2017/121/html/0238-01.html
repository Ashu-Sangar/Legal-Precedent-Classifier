Yomwill <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>•recollect that the plaintiff, in his testimony, says, “I was invited to go back in the building with him and point out the trunk. I followed him; nothing particularly occurred. I saw the elevator when I went in. I saw the elevator when I went into the back part of the place, and when I got near to the elevator something came down and struck me and scraped down my face and I fell on my back.” He was asked “ Did you know anything about that before?” and he answered “No, sir. It struck me on the head.” Then he was asked “ What did it do ?” and he said “It cut me and broke the bone in my nose; I do not know whether it broke my leg, but on the next day, Tuesday, 11th, I found myself in the hospital and I had my head cut open when I came to consciousness.” Then, again he was asked, “ Did you see the elevator hole ? ” and he replied, “ I did see the elevator, but I did not look down the hole.” He was asked “ Did you see the space or hole ? ” and he answered “ Yes.” He was then asked, “ Where were you standing then ? ”• and he replied “ I was on this side, and perhaps I did go around there, but when I was on the south side I wanted to say that I was south of the elevator.” He was asked “ Do you mean to say that you followed Mr. Huey through a passage-way where goods were piled on both sides of it?” and he answered “I was too busy and had my head full of other things and I did not think enough of it to commit to memory all that I saw or all that I could have seen there.” He says, “ I am sure that something fell on me.” And then lie was asked, “ How can you be so sure that something fell ■on you when you cannot remember the other things that happened ? ” and. he replied “ Something struck me and I got blinded and I know that I fell back and that I knew no more. It broke my nose.” So that he attributes the injury to the fact of something having fallen down upon him; but if it is true that instead of that, instead of something falling upon him, he fell down the elevator hole, I cannot see that that could be attributable to the negligence of the defendant, because the plaintiff knew all about the elevator being there, and if a man sees a thing which is likely to be a source of danger and does not guard against it, then he is negligent himself. There seems to have been abundance of light about the place; it was between nine and ten o’clock in the morn<a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>ing, and if the danger was easily seen and the man did see it, and, notwithstanding that, he tumbled down a hole like, then, it is his own carelessness. [If you believe as I have said, that it was caused in such a way as he says it was, that it was caused by something falling on him and striking him upon the head, through the careless handling of the goods, then the defendant would be responsible] ;3 but if he knew that the hole was there and he fell down it, then I do not see how you could attribute the fault to the defendant.</p>

The defendant’s fifth point called upon the court to instruct the jury that “ under the facts proved in this case the verdict should be for the defendant.” The court refused to affirm this point. The result was a verdict against the defendant for $2,000 without a particle of proof to convict him of negligence.</p>

The plaintiff had a number of boxes and trunks there on storage. On the morning of August 10, 1885, the plaintiff called at said warehouse to get one of his trunks. He was invited into the warehouse to point it out. He followed William H. Huey, a clerk of defendant, into the warehouse for that purpose. Whilst so engaged the plaintiff fell down the elevator hole into the cellar and was injured. About this there can be no dispute as he was found there in an injured state and taken to the German Hospital. If this were all, the plaintiff would have no cause of action, as he knew of the elevator and could and should have avoided it. But the plaintiff alleges, and so testified upon the trial below, that he was injured by something falling upon him. He said: “ I saw the elevator when I went into the back part of the place, and when I got near to the elevator something came down and struck me and scraped my face and I fell down upon my back.” The witness was not able to say what it was that struck him; he did not see anything nor did any other witness notice an article of any kind in the building out of place. There was no evidence that the boxes and parcels, with which the place was filled, had not been piled up with proper care, or that any one of them had <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>fallen down. There was not a scintilla of proof that the defendant had been guilty of any negligence; there was absolutely nothing beyond the fact that the plaintiff was lawfully in the defendant’s store, and while there, was injured by something, which no witness saw or could describe, falling upon him. Was this sufficient to convict the defendant of negligence ?</p>

Dock Company, 3 Hurlst. &amp; C. 596, cited in Wharton on Negligence, at page 701, and relied upon by the plaintiff below, differs from this in an essential particular. In that case a custom-house officer, visiting a store upon his lawful business, was injured by the fall of sugar bags from a loft over a door on the defendant’s premises. No explanation was given of the cause of the occurrence. The fact was, however, held evidence of negligence, “ as such a passage-way should be guarded from casualties that could be prevented by due care.” It will be observed that in the case cited the plaintiff was injured by a bag of sugar falling upon him. , If the plaintiff in this case had been struck by one of the boxes piled up in the store falling upon him, we would have no hesitation in saying that it was evidence that the boxes had been piled negligently. Just here is the pinch of the plaintiff’s case. He cannot say what struck him. It may have been the act of some one not in the employ of defendant; possibly a mere trespasser on the premises. The like criticism may be made of the case of Briggs v. Oliver, 4 Hurlst. &amp; C. 403, and others cited by defendant in error. The nearest approach to the case in hand is Lake Shore Railroad Company v. Rosenzweig, <a href="/pa/113/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="113 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="457600" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0519-01">113 Pa. 519</a>. In that case the plaintiff could not say what struck him; he could describe certain things around him which might have done so, and he was allowed to recover a verdict of $48,750. That case certainly went much further than any other in this country or in England, in the line of allowing a recovery without evidence. It was heard in the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>absence of two of the members of the court and those that sat were not unanimous. We are not disposed to go any further in that direction, or to follow it to the extreme length now asked of us, but we will allow it to stand upon its own facts. Aside from this case I know of no well-considered case that will sustain the one in hand. The mere fact that something fell on the plaintiff’s head, without more, is not evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. • He cannot be convicted of negligence and compelled to pay a large sum of money without proof. We are not prepared to sustain the doctrine that the owner of property is hable for every injury that may occur to another therein or thereon, in the absence of any evidence that such injury was the result of the negligence of the owner. We are of opinion that the defendant’s fifth point should have been affirmed.</p>
