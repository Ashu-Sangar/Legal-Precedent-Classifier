R. C., all the coal beneath the surface of a tract of land. The city authorities of Scranton caused the coal and the surface to be assessed separately, as the property of Sander-son. Sanderson resisted the collection of the tax on the coal in the ground, contending that the agreement with Jermyn operated as a sale or assignment of all the coal, and not merely of that mined. By the agreement, Jermyn was to pay all government imposts, United States, state, county, and local taxes upon the coal mined. The court below held that the agreement did not operate as a sale of the coal in place, and entered judgment in favor of the city. The Supreme Court reversed this judgment, holding that the agreement was a sale of the coal, and that it must be assessed to the owner, the D., L. &amp; W. R. Co. The question came up again in Del. etc. R. Co. v. Sanderson, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20Pa.%20588" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="109 Pa. 588">109 Pa. 588</a>, in which case the company sought to recover from Sanderson the taxes paid by the company, assessed on the coal in the ground, and the Supreme Court adhered to their former decision. It is contended by the plaintiffs that those cases and the case of City of Scranton v. Gilbert, 16 W. N. 28, rule the present case; that, as by the contract of August 29,1872, the railroad company became the owner of the coal in the ground, and by the conveyances in 1883 the surface was conveyed, the two estates or interests became united, and as the company is now the owner of the surface, and the underlying coal both, it is liable for the taxes; that the property <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>as a whole must be assessed to the company as land, and, as held in the City of Scranton v. Gilbert, supra, the coal cannot be separately valued and assessed. This position of the plaintiffs is certainly correct, unless there is such a contract relation between the parties as to take the case out of the general rule. I think it is beyond question that under the indenture of August 29, 1872, though that was a sale of the coal in place, the plaintiffs were bound to pay the taxes on it, for the very simple reason that they agreed to pay them. Whether the coal and surface were assessed at a single valuation to the plaintiffs, or the coal was separately assessed to the defendant, would make no difference. The form of assessment by the assessors and commissioners could not affect the contract between the parties. In Sanderson v. Scranton, and Del. etc. R. Co. v. Sanderson, there was no contract stipulation in regard to the taxes on the coal in the ground, only as to the coal mined; and of course the taxes were properly assessed to, and must be paid by the owner of the coal. If Sanderson had agreed, as the plaintiffs here have, to pay all the taxes that might be imposed upon the coal in the ground, 1 take it, the Supreme Court would have held him to his contract.</p>

It seems to me, it would be difficult, by any form of expression, to more clearly and plainly declare the intention of the parties to retain their relations and rights as respects the coal in the ground, as defined in the contract of 1872; and that the conveyance of 1888 should not, in any respect, work a change in their respective rights and obligations as regards such coal.</p>

But it is said that where the surface and the underlying coal are owned by the same person, the land and coal must be assessed as a whole in a single valuation: Scranton v. Gilbert, supra; and therefore as the defendant is now the owner of both surface and coal, no tax can be imposed upon the coal as coal. In Scranton v.

Id eertum est, quod eertum reddi potest. But, it has not been decided that where one man, for a valuable consideration, puts himself in such contract relation with another, in respect to that other’s land, by which he is to pay the taxes imposed upon it, that the land may not be assessed to him. I think where a tenant, for instance, agrees to pay all the taxes that may be imposed upon the demised premises during the term, an assess<a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>ment of the premises to him would be a good and valid assessment, and the taxes could be collected from him, and if he failed to pay, the taxes would be a lien on the land, and why may not the coal in the present instance be assessed to the plaintiffs? It seems to me, the plaintiffs being liable to pay the taxes under their contract with the defendant, there would be no impropriety in assessing the coal to them. Who could complain? The plaintiffs? What would they have to complain of? They would only be required to do what they agreed to do. The defendant would not complain. It is said, however, that where the surface and coal are owned by the same person, they cannot be separately assessed. That is so, where the owner has not <em>by contract </em>imposed the payment of the taxes on the coal upon some one else. True, perhaps, the taxing authorities could not be compelled to assess the coal and surface separately where there has not been an actual severance by sale, but where parties, as here, have by their contract, so far as taxation or payment of taxes is involved, virtually severed the surface from the underlying coal, why may not the assessment be in accordance with that contract? But, if the equities of the parties under their contract cannot be worked out through the taxing authorities, in the form of the assessment, the contract should be enforced in some other form of remedy, if, as in the case in hand, the proportion of the tax which should be borne by the coal may be ascertained.</p>

Scranton was announced, did any one suppose that the lease of 1872 operated as a sale of the coal in the ground ; and that the stipulation for payment of taxes was entered into upon the theory that the plaintiffs owned the coal. Grant this, how does it in any way change the liability or interest of the plaintiff ? They still receive their royalty, the same as if they were the technical owners of the coal. The royalty is in no way diminished, the defendant being bound to pay for the minimum quantity named in the contract, annually, whether mined or not; and the clause of forfeiture on non-payment of royalty remains intact, and when the coal shall be all mined, I take it, <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>the substratum will revert to the plaintiff.

It contains an absolute engagement on the part of the lessors to pay all the taxes imposed upon coal in the ground. The language is explicitly to that effect. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the applicability of rules and decisions which are designed to assist in the interpretation of written instruments. They are intended for doubtful cases. Here the meaning is plain. No matter how, or when, or by what means, or in what manner, taxes might be imposed upon the coal in the ground upon these premises, the lessors were to pay them, the lessees were not to pay them. The validity of such a compact is not at all questioned; its binding obligation according to its literal terms no one doubts. By the deeds of 1883 it was carefully and specially covenanted that the conveyance of the surface thereby made should in no way affect the interest of the lessors in, and title to, the coal underlying the same, nor should it affect in any way the right of either of the parties in and under the provisions of the lease, “ but the same shall remain in <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>full force and effect so far as the same relates to the coal in and under the said tract of land, notwithstanding this conveyance of the surface thereof.” It would, therefore, be a positive violation of the terms of the deeds of 1883 to permit them to effect any change whatever in the rights of either of the parties under the lease of 1872. Those deeds must, by consequence, be discarded in the consideration of the' question at issue which arises under the lease. •</p>
    <p id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[160,771,1191,1648]],["BL_390.1",390,[238,349,1192,1167]]]'>It must further be noted that the parties do not differ at all as to the'obligation to pay these particular taxes at any time prior to the origination of the present contention. We cannot think it material to regard the technical question whether the taxing authorities are at liberty to assess separately the surface and the underlying coal. That is a result purely of the union of the titles, and while it may affect the right of the taxing power to make independent assessments, it does not deprive that power of the right to impose taxation upon the coal in the ground. The right may have to be exercised by joining the coal with the surface in making the assessment, but the coal is, nevertheless, taxed, and its payment becomes the duty of somebody quite as effectively as though the surface and the coal were separately assessed. Now, the only question here, as it seems to us, is upon whom, as between the parties to this contention, does that duty devolve. It certainly rests upon one or the other. If prior to the deeds of 1883, it rested upon the lessors and if now, since those deeds, and by virtue of them, it rests upon the lessees, then those deeds do change the rights of the parties under the lease. But that cannot be, because those deeds, in terms, prohibit any such result. How then can the change of liability be accomplished ? Because, it is said, since the lease was made, and many years after its stipulations were literally performed, a decision of this court was made which affected the legal status of the parties, so that the lessors must be treated as having sold the coal and as being no longer the owners of it. Supposing this to be true in all respects, for what reason ought it to affect the question as to who should pay the taxes on the coal in the ground. Hnder the lease of 1872, regarded simply as a lease, the lessees had the exclusive privilege to take all the coal upon payment for it according to the stipulations. As long as they continued to <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>mine the coal and pay for it, this privilege continued. Its exercise excluded the lessors from every interest in the coal except the right to exact and receive the price to be paid and that right ceased only when the coal was exhausted. If the payments ceased, the right of the lessees to take the coal ceased also, and the lessors resumed title and possession of that which remained. Under our decision in the Sanderson case the obligation of-the lessees, and the right of the lessors are precisely the same. The lessees have the right to take the coal precisely as they had it under the lease. They are subject to exactly the same duties as under the lease. In fact it is still the lease and that alone which determines what that right and those duties are. So long as the coal is mined and paid for according to the stipulations of the lease, the exclusive right to take the coal continues. When the payments cease, the right to take the coal ceases, and the full right of the lessors to resume title and possession reverts to the lessors with as complete force and effect in every possible respect as if the decision in the Sanderson case had never been made. Every advantage, every beneficial interest, which the lessors held under the lease they still hold, and we can perceive no reason why they should not hold them upon the identical terms which the lease established.</p>

That agreement was not made to depend upon any technical aspect of the interest of the lessors in the coal. It was absolute, peremptory and without condition. In every matter of substance that interest is unchanged, certainly in every pecuniary respect. But to impose the duty of paying these taxes upon the lessees, is changing the contract, putting upon them a pecuniary obligation which they not only never assumed, but which they required should be discharged by the lessors. And this would result not on account of anything they have dope or omitted to do, but simply because the law declares that the contract between the parties must be regarded as a sale instead of a lease. Not that any of its terms are changed but rather its name. In certain respects, <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>of course, tbe difference of interest between a sale and a lease under this contract, may become important. But these are peculiar to the lessors and those claiming under them and with them the lessees have no concern. So far as the question of the taxes is concerned, we can see no difference in the relations of these parties. We agree entirely' with the learned court below in the conclusions reached by them, and in the reasoning by which those conclusions are supported. We cannot know, and have no right to assume, that if at the time the lease was made the parties had known that the contract would be held by the courts to be a sale instead of a lease, any different provision would have been made in regard to the payment of these taxes. This being so we would be entirely without warrant if we made a change in the contract in that respect.</p>
