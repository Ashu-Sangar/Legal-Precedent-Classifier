Their business is carried on by cutting this timber in the woods, putting their marks upon it and then casting it into the streams in the spring, and it comes down on the floods in the river. The plaintiffs allege that, while they did this in 1888-4, and put in very large quantities of logs each year, when these logs came to near Lock Haven, where the West Branch Boom Company have a structure in the river, they closed their boom and caught a large quantity of them, not only once but at different times during the year, and thus detained them on their passage down the river; and that the plaintiffs had given the notice required by law each year, as follows: [Court here reads notice] : that this continued to such an extent, that when it came to the fall of the year there still remained back a large quantity of their logs which- had been caught in this boom, and they were obliged to expend large sums of money in bringing them down; all their other logs on the same drive having come through except these that were detained; that they commenced to bring their logs <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>down, but did not succeed in getting them in their harbors until Thanksgiving Day of each year, both dates being after the sawing season, and that they were therefore required to keep them over winter. They claim here that if the defendants had not detained these logs they would not have suffered damage. They say that in 1883 they were compelled to bring these logs down, and that to drive them down from Lock Haven it cost $1,112.70, which was one dollar per thousand on 1,112,706 feet. In 1884 they were required to bring down the same way 791,603 feet, but that year had to pay but forty-five cents per thousand, amounting to $356.22. They claim here that by reason of this delay these logs did not come into their actual possession until after the sawing season. By reason of that they lost a considerable quantity of this lumber; by being exposed to the weather that length of time the sap was lost in the measurement of the lumber. This is put by some of the witnesses at such a per cent; some at two dollars per thousand. I think one witness, said one and one half to two dollars a thousand. Others put it at so much per cent, amounting to about the same.</p>

All that was alleged and all that was proved was, that the logs of the plaintiffs with thousands of others, came into defendants’ boom, constructed by legislative authority ; and, although the defendants offered to' show that they were turned out as soon as it was physically possible to do so, their offer was rejected, and the jury were told in effect that as the logs had come into the boom, it was enough to render the defendants liable in damages. Such, we submit, is not the law. “ Statutes are to be construed as best to effectuate the intention of the makers, which may sometimes be collected from the cause or occasion of passing the statute, and when discovered it ought' to be followed with judgment and discretion in the construction, though that construction may seem contrary to the letter of the statute: ” Mr. Justice Trunkey, in Improvement Co. v.

The act upon which the canal company relied for its power to construct the dam, provided that the company should not make any improvements upon their works, “unless the same shall be so constructed as to leave the channel of said river as safe or convenient for the descent of rafts as it now is.” This court said: “When the plaintiff avers that the defendants have constructed and maintained their dam in violation of their statutory rights, and in such manner as not to be the least obstructive to the navigation of the river, consistent with the use of the dam for the purpose of their franchise, and by some negligent act have caused him immediate injury, the burden is on him to prove his averments. The mere fact that the rafts were injured by the dam is not enough.”</p>

It is to be observed that there is no allegation of proof of negligence in this case; therefore, the defendants’ third point, to the effect that by the third section of the incorporating act the legislature had provided a specific mode by which damages were to be ascertained and determined, and that no other mode could be pursued. Section 2 of the act describes the powers of the company with minuteness. Immediately following this enumeration of their powers is § 3, prescribing a remedy if any person shall suffer damage by the exercise of the powers granted. That remedy is not a common law action. If in the exercise of their powers, they stop logs, and are in no way negligent in passing or securing them, why should not the remedy pointed out by the act of assembly be pursued ?

The defendant company is a private corporation, chartered to do a certain thing, and forbidden to do certain other things.

No power or authority is given “to stop and secure logs” of owners who have mills below and design to drive their logs there to be sawed, if notice is given before March 1st, in each year as was done in the case at bar. Hence in stopping the logs of the plaintiffs the defendants were not exercising any power given by their charter, but were abusing their privileges and neglecting the performance of duties expressly commanded.

The company in that case was chartered to stop and secure logs and lumber floating on the creek. Its boom and all the attendant fixtures were but the means to this end, and hence if the company in the exercise of these powers cause any damage, the proceeding to assess the damages must be in the manner provided by its charter.

The charter clearly contemplates the several distinct classes of lumber which, floating on the river, would come in contact with or be caught in the boom, and defines the duty of the company with respect to each:</p>
    <p id="b188-5" data-blocks='[["BL_188.4",188,[284,863,1181,248]]]'>First, it was provided that rafts of logs or other lumber might be landed and fastened as theretofore, and that any staved or broken raft coming into the boom should be delivered to the owner, upon payment of a certain price in the nature of salvage.</p>
    <p id="b188-6" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[282,1120,1184,764]]]'>Second, that logs or other lumber might be driven into the boom for manufacture at Lock Haven, or to be formed into rafts and transported upon the water, in that form, to the place of their destination below Lock Haven. This would seem to have been the first and principal object in view in the construction of the boom, as it is provided in the charter as follows: “It shall be the duty of the corporation to cause the passage ways or open spaces to be carefully guarded day and night, so that no lumber be permitted to escape; to raft <em>all lumber </em>in said booms securely and faithfully, with suitable warps and wedges for rafting and securing the same below the said boom.” The corporation had the right to charge and collect toll or boomage upon the lumber thus • boomed, rafted and secured, including warps, wedges, etc., at rates in the 6th section specified.</p>

As to this there was a proviso or saving clause to the second section as follows: “ Provided that said booms shall not extend more than half way across said river, and be so constructed as to admit the safe passage of rafts, boats, logs, masts, spars or other lumber, and not impede the navigation of said river and the branches thereof;” also a fike proviso or saving clause to the 7th section as follows: “Provided at <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>all times, that no lumber of any description shall be stopped, except upon the written request of the owner or owners of the same, and no toll or expense shall accrue to any lumber designed to run, or to be driven, to any point below Lock Haven; a free and unobstructed passage shall at all times be kept open so that the navigation of the river shall be as free as it now is.”</p>

Plaintiffs’ contention is, that as their Logs were destined to points below the Lock Haven boom, and due and proper notice of that fact had been given as required by the act of May 8, 1854, P. L. 666, the defendants had no right to stop them, or to detain them, for any length of time in their boom, under any circumstances or for any purpose; and that, having done so in the years 1883 and 1884, they are answerable in damages for the loss occasioned thereby. The defendants maintain, however, that this construction of their charter would give it no practical effect whatever; that the several provisos mentioned, if so construed, are totally repugnant to the body of the act of incorporation and would wholly defeat the public purpose which the legislature manifestly had in view in its enactment. Their contention is, therefore, that the saving clauses should receive such a reasonable construction as would not practically nullify their charter. They offered to prove, in substance, that the plaintiffs’ logs, for the detention of which damages are claimed in this suit, were thrown into the river, or some of its tributaries, in the winter or spring of 1883 and 1884, to be driven into the Susquehanna boom, 22 miles below the West Branch boom; that at or about the same time a very large amount of other logs, perhaps 200,000,000 feet or more, some destined for the West Branch boom, and some for the Susquehanna boom, were thrown into the same stream indiscriminately, and that, when the spring freshets came, the whole mass of logs was driven down the stream; that the swollen stream was filled with logs from bank to bank, and as the “ drive ” approached the West Branch boom, it was absolutely impossible to ascertain to which boom the logs were destined; that they could only be known by inspection of the marks on the ends of the logs, of which there were over 100 different kinds; that some of the <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>logs were in fact destined for Lock Haven, and some for Williamsport, but that the marks could not be seen nor their destination determined; that in order to secure the logs consigned to their custody, the West Branch Boom Company thereupon opened their boom, and received into it of the mass of the logs, without distinction, until their boom was filled, and suffered the residue to pass down the stream; that as soon as practicable, and with the utmost diligence and dispatch, they passed out of their boom all the plaintiffs’ logs and all other logs destined for points below Lock Haven; that they used every appliance and means, expended large sums of money, employed a great many men, and did everything in their power, or that it was possible to do by human ingenuity and skill, to deliver the logs of the plaintiffs below their booms so that they could be driven into the Susquehanna boom; thatthe marks are on the ends of the logs and it is impossible to ascertain to whom the logs belong, until the marks can be seen, and that can only be done when the boom is opened and the logs passed out.</p>

This principle it is true will not apply in the construction of the charters of pritate corporations, where the matters contained in the saving clause are made, and intended to be made, an essential condition of the enjoyment of the charter. If private corporations accept charters under such circumstances, they take them cum onere; they must enjoy their privileges subject to the conditions, or not enjoy them at all; Dugan v.

But, even in such case, we must first be satisfied what the condition really is, and in' case of ambiguity or doubt, the intent of the legislature, in this respect, must be ascertained from a consideration of the whole instrument. In the case just cited, although the building of the bridge may necessarily have involved the erection of piers, yet it was not shown that these piers could not have been erected in such place and in such a manner as not to injure the navigation.

In the case cited, a corporation was authorized by its charter to construct a dam in a river, “provided that the same shall be so constructed as to leave the channel of said river as safe and convenient for the descent of rafts as it now is.” “ The plaintiff complains,” says our late brother Trtjnkey, in the opinion of the court in that case, “that the river is not as safe and convenient for navigation as before the erection of the dam. Unquestionably this is so. A dam in a stream is an impediment, and in some degree renders its navigation less safe and convenient. A literal construction of this provision makes it impossible to build and maintain the dam, and the conceded right vanishes.....Various statutes have been from time to time enacted authorizing public improvements, some of which would obstruct or impede the navigation of rivers, and others the use of streets and roads, which contained provisions forbidding such obstructions and impediments. The courts have uniformly held that these provisions should be liberally construed so as not to destroy the grant.” In support of this principle are cited Monongahela Bridge Co. v. Kirk, <a href="/pa/46/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="46 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="420669" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0112-01">46 Pa. 112</a> and Commonwealth v. Erie &amp; N. E. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pa.%20365" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="27 Pa. 365">27 Pa. 365</a>. In the former case the charter of the company provided, that nothing therein contained should authorize the erection of a bridge over the Monongahela river “in such manner as to injure, stop or interrupt the navigation of the river by boats, rafts or other vessels.” It was held that the proviso was not intended to prevent the erection of piers in the bed -of the river. Although piers in the bed of a navigable stream inevitably injure navigation and render it more difficult, they do not necessarily “injure, stop or interrupt the navigation ” in the sense in which these words were used by the legislature. A strict, literal meaning was not intended, and in the very nature of the case it never could have been. When the purpose of the franchise is the performance of a public act, the grant is to be so interpreted as to enable the act to be done. “ The general rule,” says Mr. Justice Read, “undoubtedly is, that <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>charters of incorporation of private companies are to be construed strictly in favor of the commonwealth — so are grants to any persons — but they are to be construed reasonably. It is very clear that when the purpose of the franchise is the performance of a public act, the grant is to be interpreted so as to enable the act to be done. The act for the provision so made in this charter was a public one. It was the extension of one highway over another. Nor was the erection of the bridge less the performance of a public function, because the agent was empowered to exact tolls from passengers. The legislature is not to be supposed to have authorized and prohibited such a public act, at the same time and by the same charter; a grant of power to erect a public bridge is not to be construed so as to make its erection impossible, and such a construction justified by the rule that private charters are to be strictly interpreted.” In the case of the Commonwealth v. E. &amp; N. E. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pa.%20365" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="27 Pa. 365">27 Pa. 365</a>, the charter of the railroad company had a provision in it, that the railroad “ should be so constructed as not to impede or obstruct the free use of any public road, street, lane or bridge now laid out, open or built.” Chief Justice Black, in the opinion of the court rendered in that case, says: “And another objection to this location is more grave, because it bases itself on a provision in the act of incorporation. It is said that the streets would be less obstructed by taking the road down to the harbor, than by locating it where the defendants propose. The company is forbidden to make the road so as to obstruct or impede the free use of any street. These words taken literally and in their strongest sense, would prevent the railroad from being made on the streets at all. But we followed authority in saying they were not to be so interpreted.”</p>

The West Branch Boom Co., argued at the January Term, 1877. The proviso to the 2d section, as we have said, provides “ That the said booms shall not extend more than half way across the river and be so constructed as to admit the safe passage of rafts, boats, logs, masts, spars or other lumber, and not impede the navigation of said river and branches thereof.” Whilst <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>the permanent portion of the boom structures was on the south side and did not extend more than half way across the stream, yet the company swung the shear from the north side of the river, and when the shear was closed the entire stream was for the time obstructed. The Susquehanna Boom Company thereupon filed a bill in equity in this court praying that the West Branch Boom Company might be enjoined from maintaining the shear; on full consideration, however, the bill was dismissed. Our brother Gordon in delivering the opinion of the court said: “ Whether the defendant has the right to the use of the shear by which, at least occasionally and for a short time, logs intended for the' Susquehanna boom must be stopped, depends altogether upon the powers conferred upon it by its charter; beyond this it cannot go; it must abide by what is written therein or what arises therefrom by necessary implication......A literal construction of this proviso utterly defeats the grant, for as we have seen the boom without a shear, and that from the north side, is worthless; but more than this, if the boom itself must be so constructed as to allow the passage of boats, rafts and lumber through it, it is wholly worthless, since in that case it would hold nothing. This however, will not do, for a proviso in a grant for a public franchise cannot be allowed to defeat the grant itself: Whitaker v. Canal Co., <a href="/pa/87/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="87 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1057835" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0034-01">87 Pa. 34</a>. . ......We are brought to the conclusion, which, after much examination and thought, we regard as inevitable, that the defendant had the right under its charter to maintain and use the shear which it did have and use at the time of the filing of this bill. Without such a structure the franchise itself is valueless; neither can the corporation answer the purposes of its creation nor perform the duties imposed upon it by the act of incorporation. It must therefore have its shear booms, and of course it must use them in accordance with the terms of the statute. The act has made ample provision for a free and unobstructed navigation, and for the earliest possible transmission of lumber <em>necessarily lodged within the booms, </em>and if in this or any other particular the defendant neglects or fails to perform its duty, it is answerable for any damages arising from such neglect or failure.”</p>
    <p id="Apq" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[256,2297,1183,98]],["BL_195.1",195,[176,348,1179,602]]]'>These cases show conclusively that we are not to adhere strictly to a literal construction of this charter, if by so doing <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>we defeat the public purpose to be subserved thereby; the provisos are to be construed so, as not to defeat the grant itself. The swinging of the boom from the north side assumes the power of the corporation for some purposes over the whole width of the river; and the right to use the shear, and to stop their own logs driven indiscriminately with the logs of others, assumes the right, under the circumstances stated in the offer, to stop the mixed mass of logs for the shortest time reasonably necessary, by the use of the utmost diligence and skill, to withdraw from that mass their own logs. To decide otherwise would be to defeat the very purpose which the legislature had in view.</p>
    <p id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[176,970,1180,974]]]'>That this was the actual legislative intent, however, is manifest upon a careful reading of the proviso to the 7th section. It is provided that “ no lumber of any description shall be stopped except upon the written request of the owner or owners of the same.” Now it is plain that the stopping referred to here, is not a mere temporary interruption of the progress of the logs for the purpose mentioned, but a stopping of the logs as at the place of their destination at the request of the owner. Further, it is provided “ that no toll or expense shall accrue to any lumber, designed to .run or to be driven to any point below Lock Haven.” If it was contemplated that such lumber was not under any circumstances to be stopped in the West Branch boom, how could any toll or expense accrue upon it ? Assuming, however, that this class of lumber might and probably would at times come within the inclosure of this boom, it was reasonable and proper, conceding the right to interrupt its passage temporarily and for a lawful purpose, to make provision that there should be no toll or expense charged for turning it out.</p>

What the precise facts in that case were does not appear ; it was an action on the case for the detention of a quantity of saw logs which ran into the defendants’ boom in the spring of 1852. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs by consent, subject to the opinion of the court whether in law the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. Under what circumstances, for what purpose, or for what length of <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>time, the logs were detained, does not appear in the report of the case. The opinion may or may not be in conflict with the views here expressed; that depends wholly upon, the facts upon which it is based. .There are some general expressions contained in it, which might appear to be in conflict, not only with the rulings in this case, but with Susquehanna Boom Co. v. West Branch Boom Co., already referred to. These expressions, however, may be made with reference to a state of facts wholly different from the facts in this case, or in the case mentioned. However this may be, we are well satisfied that the construction we have given to this charter is the reasonable and proper one, and that it is in conformity with the' rule now recognized in this state.</p>
