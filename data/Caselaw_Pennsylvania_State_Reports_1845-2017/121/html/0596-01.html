But it is claimed that power to proceed under the general road laws was conferred on said court by the act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 231. That act is a general law, and does not in express terms repeal any local or special law. All powers conferred by it upon municipal authorities and courts, were previously conferred upon the city councils of Lancaster city and the Court of Quarter Sessions of Lancaster county by the act of 1873. The act of 1874 and the act of June 8,1881, P. L. 68, are the same in their provisions, save that the former act does not contain the words “ any private or special statute to the contrary notwithstanding,” which are found in the latter act. .But to the act of 1874 is applicable the principle that a general statute without negative words will not repeal a previous statute which is particular: Brown v. Commissioners, <a href="/pa/21/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="21 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="411527" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0037-01">21 Pa. 37</a>; Dyer v.

Roberts, 11 W. N. 190.</p>

Its 13th section does not refer to any general or special law, and the general law not being in force in Lancaster city, proceedings under it would not be had “ as required by law.” If by the language, “ as required by law,” was meant the general road laws, then the provisions were unconstitutional, because not re-enacted and published at length. Lancaster was then a city of the third class ; now it is a city of the fifth class under the act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 204, which provides in § 1, article XXIII., that “ All laws or parts of laws heretofore passed, whether general or special, relating to the incorporation and government of any of the cities of this commonwealth, inconsistent herewith, or supplied by the provisions hereof, are hereby repealed,” etc. Certainly the acts of 1874 and 1881, if they ever were valid, are thus repealed, and after <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>the act of 1878, the court of Quarter Sessions was without jurisdiction under the general road laws of the state to appoint viewers to lay out a highway in the city of Lancaster.</p>

L. 811, providing for the general survey and plan of the streets of Lancaster city, the councils had no voice in adopting the plan, in the opening or vacation of a street, or in fixing the width or grade thereof. The engineer made the plan, councils had no voice in its adoption or modification, and all subsequent power was vested in the court of Quarter Sessions.

As to the sweeping character of the act of 1881, in its repeal of local and special statutes, we refer to the opinion of Thayer, P.

    <p id="b635-6" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[192,759,1182,665]]]'>The act of April 18,1873, P. L. 811, was a special act providing for the appointment of an engineer whose duty it should be to survey and mark the line of all streets and highways of the city, then opened or intended to be opened in said city for public use ; and to survey and mark all new streets or alleys that may be needed, fix the width, grades, etc., as may be necessary for a regular and convenient town plan, which plan is to be approved by city councils. Provision is then made for the assessment of damages caused by the opening of any street or alley upon said plan. It is unnecessary to refer further to the details of this act as it relates only to streets upon the city plan. The street in question is not upon the city plan, and the act of 1873 has nothing to do with it.</p>

As this section, however, is expressly repealed by the act of June 8, 1881, P. L. 68, we need not further refer to it.</p>
    <p id="b635-8" data-blocks='[["BL_635.7",635,[188,1639,1183,562]]]'>The said act of June 8, 1881, repeals, though in the most bungling manner, the 13th section of the act of 1874. The title as well as the body of said act professes to declare the meaning of the said section of the act of 1874, and if this were all, the act of 1881 would conflict with section 6 of article III. of the constitution, which declares that “ no law shall be revived, amended, or the provisions thereof extended or conferred by a reference to its title only, but so much thereof as is revived, amended, extended, or conferred shall be re-enacted and published at length.” It is for the courts to declare the “meaning” of an act of the legislature.</p>
    <p id="b635-9" data-blocks='[["BL_635.8",635,[188,2206,1181,201]]]'>But the act of 1881 goes further and amends the 13th section of the act of 1874, and we may reject as surplusage, or harmless verbiage, so much of it as professes to attach a meaning to the act of 1874. The substituted section is as follows :</p>

      <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>Section 13. “ That the municipal authorities and courts having jurisdiction in any city of this commonwealth, shall have exclusive control and direction of the opening, widening, narrowing, vacating, and changing grades of all streets, alleys, and highways within the limits of such city, and may open or widen streets, at such points and of such width, as may be deemed necessary by such city authorities and courts, any private or special statute to the contrary notwithstanding; proceedings to be had in such cases as are now required by law. Streets commenced under any special authority shall be completed, unless otherwise decided by councils ; and any of said cities may, with the consent of the court of Quarter Sessions of the proper county,' enter security for damages to private property by reason of street improvements, in such sum or sums as the said court may direct.”</p>
    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[231,1122,1185,291]]]'>We need not refer to the provisions of the act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 204, providing for the incorporation and government of cities of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh classes, etc., as we have just held by a unanimous decision in Ayars’ Appeal, that said act is in. conflict with the constitution and therefore void.</p>

By its terms the municipal authorities and courts having jurisdiction in any city, shall have the exclusive control and direction of the opening, etc., of streets; the proceedings to be had in such cases as are now required by law. The laws in force, when this petition was presented, were the general road laws, as amended for Lancaster county, by the acts of 1854 and 1857. The proceedings appear to be in strict conformity thereto.</p>
