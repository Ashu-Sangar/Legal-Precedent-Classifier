As shown by the arguments of counsel, as well as the report of the master, the first question suggested is as to the construction of the agreement of May 16, 1873 ; and after a full and careful consideration of this question, leaving out of view the subsequent acts of the parties, we think the contract, on its face and taken as a whole, clearly manifests an intention to pass a fee, not only to the trustee but also to the beneficiaries therein named. That a fee was to pass to the trustee is expressly declared in the instrument, and while this is not conclusive, it is not unimportant in determining the intention of the parties as to the quantum of estate.to be secured to the cestuis que trustent. When it is considered further that the contract was executory, that it was supported by a valuable and highly meritorious consideration, that it made no provision for the accumulation and investment of the coal rents and purchase money of lots, but <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>clearly contemplated the payment of the same in bulk to the beneficiaries ; that, while careful to stipulate, first, for the vesting of a fee in the defendant, and second, for the conveyance of a fee to the trustee, no words as “ during life ” are used in connection with the limitation to the cestuis que trustent, we think it is not to be presumed from the absence of words of inheritance that they were to take only life estates, and that the provision for the conveyance of a fee was inserted inadvertently, but, on the contrary, if the case rested here, it would come fairly within the rule that in executory contracts words of inheritance will be supplied where the consideration paid or other circumstances evince that no less than a fee was intended. This conclusion is so well sustained, and the arguments against it so satisfactorily answered, by the reasoning of the master and the authorities cited by him, as to render unnecessary a greater elaboration by us of the considerations above suggested. We, therefore, pass to the second question.</p>

Hollenback, while purporting on its face to be in pursuance of the contract and subject to its limitations and conditions, does not contain technical terms importing a fee, whereas, as we have seen, he had agreed to convey such an estate. If this were all, the simplest case for the exercise of the power of this court to reform written instruments would be presented. The mistake would be apparent on the face of the instrument, and there would be no room for presuming from the trustee’s acceptance of the deed that a new intent, different from that manifested by the executory agreement, had supervened; for, to say nothing of the rebuttal of such presumption by the recitals of the deed, the trustee had no authority to vary the agreement by the acceptance of a deed for a less estate than that called for by the agreement. This naturally leads up to an inquiry as to the action of J. M. Hollenback, in connection with the execution and delivery of the deed in question, and his knowledge of its contents and legal effect at that time. It appears from the testimony of General Osborne that the deeds from J. M. Hollenback to J. W. Hollenback, and from the latter to the trustee, although bearing different dates, were delivered cotemporaneously in December, 1873, and that, for a considerable period prior to that time, the deed from J. W. Hollenback was in the possession of J. M. Hollen<a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>back — not pursuant to a formal delivery, as has been suggested, but for examination — and for a portion of the time was in the hands of his counsel. Hence, the delivery and acceptance of the deeds are not to be regarded as independent acts, but as parts of the same act.</p>

Hollenback, executed in strict fulfilment of his covenants, stood alone, without any performance or attempted performance by J. W. Hollenback of his part of the contract. Nor are we to look at the case as if, subsequently to the delivery of the deed from J. M. Hollenback, he had undertaken, as an independent act, to release J. W. Hollenback, wholly or in part, from the performance of his covenants, upon which that deed was based as a consideration. We are to consider not only the acceptance of the deed from J. W. Hollenback, after examination by counsel, but also the cotemporaneous delivery of the deed from J. M. Hollenback. And, without attempting to follow or answer the elaborate and very learned argument of counsel upon this point further than the above suggestions are an answer, we conclude that up to this time it was within the power of the parties to vary their original agreement, without the consent of the other beneficiaries. In other words, the plaintiff’s testatrix and her sister had not such an equitable estate or interest in the land as to prevent J. M. Hollenback, their father, from revoking the proposed settlement on them altogether, much less from accepting in consummation of the contract a deed by which the voluntary provisions for them would terminate with their lives. If this be so, then the facts above stated become material as bearing upon the question of a change of intention.</p>

It will be seen, however, upon more careful examination, that such an inference from these facts alone, as against the solemn recitals of the deeds, would be unwarranted. And inasmuch as the exceptions, unjustifiably, as we think, criticise some of the master’s findings as to the purport of the deeds, it will not be out of <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>place to quote therefrom in this immediate connection. The deed from J. M. Hollenback recites the agreement in full, and then declares that it is made “ in consideration of the performance of the covenants set forth in the above recited agreement, to be kept and performed by and on the part of the said J. W. Hollenback.” The deed from J. <em>W. </em>Hollenback declares that it was made “ in consideration of the conveyance to him by J. M. Hollenback and wife of all their right, title, and interest in and to all and singular ” the lots included in the ejectment suit, “ and also subject to the conditions and limitations contained in a certain article of agreement between J. W. Hollenback and J. M. Hollenback, dated May 16, 1873, and filed in the prothonotary’s office of Luzerne county, in case No. 628 April Term 1872, in pursuance of which this conveyance is made,” etc.</p>

Unexplained by other circumstances in connection with the act, they would furnish indubitable evidence that no change had taken place in the minds of the parties, and that they contemplated nothing less than to carry out their agreement according to the original intention. But, it is argued, there was a dispute between the parties as to the form of the conveyance to be made, and after examination by counsel, J. M. Hollenback and E. S. Osborne, the trustee accepted the deed, and the former delivered his own, knowing that J. W. Hollenback contended that he was only bound to convey a life estate and would convey nothing more. If these facts be established we do not see how we can enter a different judgment from that entered in the case of Osborne v. Hollenback, No. 2 April Term 1882. Under the supposed state of facts, the deed, as to the quantity of estate granted, was precisely what J. W. Hollenback intended it to be when he delivered it, and what J. M. Hollenback understood it to be when he accepted it and consummated the agreement by the cotemporaneous delivery of his own deed. For the court, under such circumstances, to write in this deed words of inheritance upon the ground that they were omitted by mistake would be to act on a presumption contrary to the facts. In effect, it would be putting into the deed what was deliberately left out by the parties.</p>

After a far more exhaustive examination of the authorities, aided, as we have been by the most thorough and intelligent research of counsel and master, we still think it to be so. Down to the period of its consummation an executory contract is subject to modification, and when an act is done, which, without fraud or mistake, is tendered on the one side and accepted as full performance on the other, it is not competent to the party who accepted to allege that some part of the original contract remains to be performed: Seitzinger v. Weaver, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20R.%20385" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 R. 385">1 R. 385</a>. What, then, is the evidence' to sustain the defendants’ position ? In the eleventh paragraph of his answer J. W. Hollenback avers as follows: “ I 'have always and at all times insisted that by the terms and intention of the agreement of May 16, 1873, nothing more than a life estate in the said two fifths was contemplated or provided for; that I refused to execute any conveyance for a larger estate; that the deed, as executed by me, and which is conceded by the said bill to create only a life estate, was submitted to the said John Matthias Hollenback, he being sui juris and the only person interested, and the said Edwin S. Osborne, trustee, and was accepted by them, after having retained the deed for many weeks, with full knowledge of my position and of my refusal to convey anything more than such life estate.” General Osborne, while averring in his answer that the deed was submitted to J. M. Hollenback for examination, that some • objection was made to the deed, and that counsel were consulted and the matter examined, and that afterwards it was accepted' by’ J. M. Hollenback, does not say that the grounds of the objection were the quantity of estate to be conveyed, or that the delay in the final delivery of the deed was due to a dispute between the parties upon that question. On the contrary, when he came to be examined he was asked this question: “State what information you ever had, if any, during the lifetime of Catherine E. Doyle, that John Welles Hollenback had communicated any refusal to John M. Hollenback, or to any one else, to convey more than a life estate under his covenant in his contract of May, 1873?” To this question the following answer was made: “The deed was made by John Welles Hollenback to me, as I suppose, in pursuance of the contract. I never heard <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>any question about the extent of the interest conveyed by the deed until about the time of the filing of the bill in equity by Judge Harding. It was the first bill drawn by him..... Up to that time I never heard, to my recollection, any question about the estate conveyed.” It is not denied that the answer of J. W. Hollenback, in so far as it alleges a refusal on his part to convey an estate in fee, is responsive, and while the counsel have displayed great ingenuity in attempting to show that it is so inconsistent with other averments as not to entitle it to be considered as evidence of the facts alleged in this particular, we do not think their effort has been successful. Upon the principles enunciated in Eaton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/66/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="66 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="432333" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0483-01">66 Pa. 483</a>, and kindred cases, it has effect not only as a denial of the mistake alleged in the bill, but also as evidence of the facts asserted in connection with the execution and delivery of the deed. But while this is so, we do not think, in view of the above quoted testimony, that the answer stands uncontradicted. On the contrary, the evidence of General Osborne is entitled to consideration not merely as negativing the averment of his knowledge of the defendant’s contention, but also, in view of his relations to J. M. Hollenback, is entitled to some weight as affirmative evidence, that the conveyance of a life estate merely was not under discussion.</p>

Hollenback shows on its face that he had no intention of releasing J. W. Hollenback from the performance of any of his covenants; that the deed of J. W. Hollenback shows that the contract was not extinguished but was retained in full life as evidence of the conditions and limitations, subject to which the deed was made ; that after its execution and delivery up to the death of Catherine E. Doyle, J. W. Hollenback continued to pay over to the trustee, and without dissent permitted the latter, with his knowledge, to pay over to Catherine E. Doyle not only one sixth of two fifths of the coal rents but also of the purchase money of lots, we are unable to say that the master erred in holding that the averments of the answer were met by the equivalent of two witnesses. We agree, in view of the fact that this was an opened mine from which these coal rents were received, and of the conflicting opinions as to the nature thereof, that not much weight is to be accorded to the defendant’s <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>treatment of the same as part of the income. This was not necessarily inconsistent with his contention that only a life estate had passed. But his recognition of her right to receive one sixth of two fifths of the purchase money of lots is a fact of much greater significance. It indicates that the stipulation in the contract for a conveyance in fee simple was not inserted inadvertently, and that, notwithstanding these technical words were omitted from the deed, her rights to the corpus of the estate, at least so far as the surface was concerned, were understood to be the same as they would have been if the deed had literally carried out the provisions of the contract. We are unable to reconcile this fact with the theory that the deed was delivered and accepted upon the distinct understanding that only a life estate was to fie conveyed, and that, therefore, the beneficiaries were only entitled to the interest on the fund and not the fund itself.</p>

Lack of time has prevented us from discussing the other questions.

But in arriving at the intention to pass or not to pass a fee, the rules which apply to an executory trust, or a will, or a marriage settlement, cannot be used. The reason is obvious. This is an executory contract contemplating and requiring something to be done, not by the trustee, as in an executory trust, but by the parties themselves. And in a will, the fee passes as of course out of the devisor and must be taken to go somewhere. In a marriage settlement a particular intention is assumed from the outset, and the rules of construction are confessedly different. The rule as to executory agreements carrying the fee by implication, requires that the intent to do so shall be manifest: Ivory v.

They are at best weak and inconclusive, and it cannot be truly said that the facts stated in the bill necessarily imply that John Welles Hollenback intended to convey a fee and his omission to do so was the result of a mutual mistake. This defect in the bill was taken advantage of by demurrer, which the court below overruled.

The agreement of May 16, 1873, was entered into in settlement'of a pending action of ejectment in which John Matthias Hollenback was plaintiff and John Welles Hollenback defendant. This agreement was executory, and when" the parties came to consummate it, they had the right to make any modification of it they saw proper. At that time it concerned no one but the contracting parties, and was absolutely within their control. The deed from John Welles Hollenback to Osborne, trustee, .was made and delivered in pursuance of the agreement of May 16, 1873, and in compliance therewith. It was accepted by the grantees, 'and we must presume, in the absence of clear proof to the contrary that the agreement was merged in the deed. This transaction was not done hastily, nor in a corner. On the contrary, the deed was submitted to learned counsel, and was in the hands of John Matthias Hollenback for weeks for examination prior to its execution and delivery. It passed through the hands of such eminent lawyers as John W- Maynard and George W. Woodward, of counsel for the respective parties. There was, therefore, every opportunity for scrutiny, and literally no room for a mistake. Under such circumstances, after the death of one of the parties had sealed the lips of the other, and the death likewise of each of the distinguished counsel named, it would require evidence of the clearest and most reliable character to move a chancellor to reform the deed. We have looked through the evidence in vain for anything upon which we could sustain this decree. The defend<a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>ant, John Welles Hollenback, answers the bill most pointedly that there was no mistake; that he al ways claimed that the agreement of May, 1878, was intended to pass a life estate only; and that he refused to convey more than such life estate. In order that there maybe no mistake upon this point I quote the following extract from his answer: “ When the conveyance in execution on my part of that agreement came to be prepared, it was drawn so as to convey such life estate only. Insisting that this was the intention as well as the legal construction of the said agreement of May 16, 1873, and refusing to convey an estate in fee simple, I executed and delivered the deed mentioned in said section, on the 30th day of August, 1873, to the said John Matthias Hollenback, who retained the same for a long period of time (and, as I am advised, submitted it to his counsel for their opinion), and with full knowledge of the legal effect of the said deed, accepted the said deed, and executed and delivered to me his deed of release, dated and acknowledged October 24, 1873, and subsequently, to wit, on the 17th of December, 1873, caused all the said instruments to be recorded.”</p>

The learned master and the court below were of opinion that there was sufficient evidence to comply with the rule in equity and overcome the answer. Upon this point we cannot agree with them. Without going into prolix details, it is sufficient to say that we do not regard the testimony of Mr. Osborne as essentially contradicting the answer, while the circumstances relied upon for that purpose are weak and inconclusive, and do not, in our judgment, warrant the conclusions drawn from them by the master and the court below. In addition we have the fact upon this record, that in 1882, and prior to the filing of the present bill, a bill was filed against the defendant, John Welles Hollenback, to which John Matthias Hollenback and the present plaintiff were parties plaintiff, in which it was distinctly asserted and averred, not that there was a mutual mistake as to the amount of estate conveyed by this deed, but that John Welles Hollenback had always refused to convey an estate in fee <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>to the trustee, and had claimed by the agreement that he was only bound to convey life estates. This bill was demurred to, and the demurrer sustained, with leave to amend the bill. It was never amended, but subsequently dismissed upon the application of the plaintiff Doyle, who is also the plaintiff in this bill, the court refusing to add the words, “ without prejudice ” to the order of dismissal. The defendant contends that the dismissal of that bill is a bar to this proceeding, but we are not disposed to regard it as an estoppel. It is, however, important as showing that neither the plaintiff nor John Matthias Hollenback, the other party to this agreement of 1873, asserted or claimed in 1882, that there was a mistake in the deed. On the contrary the bill asserted just what John Welles Hollenback sets up in his answer, viz.: That he had always refused to convey a fee, and that he did not consider himself bound to do so under the agreement. Thus we have both parties disclaiming any mistake, and under such circumstances it is idle for this plaintiff, a stranger to that transaction, to attempt to do so.</p>
