Fifteen per cent was to be retained as security for the faithful performance of the contract on the part of the contractors; and fifteen per cent of the estimates up to the time of the making of the fifteenth estimate had been retained accordingly. The evidence is undisputed that the defendant did not pay $2,263.69, the amount of the two orders spoken of, of the amount due for October. The city did not pay because it had not the money. It is conceded that the city did not pay this amount because the payment of the order for $2,410 had taken the last of the $60,000 which had been provided for the purpose of building the reservoir and laying pipes. The legal power of the city to replenish this fund was exhausted. This was not a temporary interruption of payment, occasioned by delay'in the collection of the taxes or other like causes which time might have cured; it was a barren treasury without hope of fruitfulness in the immediate future.

You will notice that by the contract, as it was read to you, monthly estimates were to be made by the engineer..... The estimates are matters relating to the value and quantity of the work under the contract, and his decision is embodied in the estimate. Every month he made an estimate, relatively of course to the final one which was to be made on the completion of the work.

It was not necessary that it should be made in the presence of the contractors-; nor was it necessary, under the contract, that it should bo delivered to them. There is evidence here tending to show that the engineer declined to make it when requested by Mr. Drliew, but that he did make it to satisfy the other party to the contract. There is also evidence that the president of the council had notice that the contractors had stopped, or intended to stop, the work.

This rule will apply to natural persons or private corporations ; but it does not follow that it applies to municipal corporations such as the city of Altoona, under the circumstances here in dispute. The people constitute the municipality; the council, mayor, and other officers are but its agents through whom it acts. The city’s power to act is fixed and circumscribed by law. The extent of its indebtedness, and necessarily the extent of its expenditures, are limited by law. Here it is conceded that before this contract was made, a loan to the amount of $60,000 had been negotiated; the money was either in the treasury or very soon would be ; and, whether this loan was an increase of the indebtedness of the city beyond the legal limit or not, it is not disputed that there could be no further increase of the debt by law for any purpose. This loan, by resolution of council, was made for the express purpose of building water reservoirs and laying pipes. No definite division of the fund for the two purposes was made. There was no legal declaration on the part of the city as to how much <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>should be appropriated for one purpose and how much for the other. Fifteen thousand dollars was, by resolution, appropriated for water pipes; but there was no declaration that this was all that would be appropriated for such purpose, or that $45,000 was to be appropriated for the reservoir. Here was $60,000 for the reservoir and pipes, subject to future appropriation of council in such amounts as they saw proper. The council might legally have appropriated $10,000 to cover the expenses of purchasing and laying the pipes and $50,000 to the building of the reservoir; it might have appropriated one half of the $60,000 to the reservoir and the other half to the pipes; or it might legally have increased the $15,000 appropriated to pipes, to $20,000. If it had, what was left would have been all that it would have afterwards expended for work on the reservoir.

The council, perhaps, would have had the right, by ordinance, to divide the fund and thus make the city answerable to the extent of a definite portion of it; but there is no such stipulation in the ■contract; and we instruct you that up to the time they had notice that the fund was exhausted, which was on the 7th or 8th of November, when they presented their order to Mr. Lloyd, they are entitled to be paid whatever was due them under the contract.

The verdict established that the city was in default on the estimate of November 1, 1882, and by reason thereof plaintiffs were unable to proceed with the work; and it is further found that the city engineer on November 8th was requested by the plaintiffs to make a final estimate and decision, and that he refused. This refusal unquestionably opened the door of the court to the plaintiffs: Quigley v.

Assuming however, for the sake of the argument, that the estimate of December 15th, was intended as an adjudication, it clearly appears that the engineer exceeded his authority in his estimate of rock excavation. The contract stipulated for but one classification. There had been but one classification in the fifteen estimates he had made. And when the bid was made for rock excavation, it must have been on the basis of whatever could fairly be called rock.

The work was done under the terms of an agreement under seal, dated August 3,1881; it was to be performed according to certain specifications set forth in the contract agreeably and subject to the directions of the city engineer, and be completed by the 31st August, 1882, to his satisfaction and acceptance. The location and general method of construction were defined by the contract, but changes and alterations therein were provided for as the engineer might determine, and the allowance or deduction consequent thereon was to be made by him; extra work was not to be compensated unless performed upon his order, and then according to his estimate of the value thereof; the work was to be performed with such force as the engineer should deem adequate to its completion within the time specified, and if the force in his opinion was inadequate, he had the right to employ additional force; pay for the same, and charge to the account of the contractor; for any omission or neglect in the requirements of the contract on the pai't of the contractors, the engineer had authority to forfeit their rights under it, and to stop the work at any time when in his opinion the best interests of the city required it. The city agreed to pay for the different kinds or classes of work at certain rates specified in the contract; the whole amount of the compensation thus depending upon the quantity of each kind of work, which should be actually performed. Although full specifications and plans were agreed upon, and working drawings prepared in advance, it was expressly provided, that the quantities exhibited to the contractors were necessarily only approximate; they furnished in the language of the contract itself “ only general information, and will in no way govern or affect the final estimate, which will be made <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>out on the completion of the work, from actual measurements aud established facts, not determinable at the time of letting the work.” Provision was made for estimates of the work done, and for payment therefor, as follows, viz.: “ On or about the last day of each month, during the progress of this work, an estimate shall be made of the relative value of the work done, to be judged of by the engineer, and eighty-five per cent of the amount of said estimate shall be paid to the party of the first part, on or about the first day of each month. And when all the work embraced in this contract is completed, agreeably to the specifications, and in accordance with the directions and to the satisfaction and acceptance of the engineer and city council, there shall be a final estimate made, of the quality, character, and value of said work, according to the terms of this agreement, when the balance appearing due to the said parties of the first part shall be paid to them, within thirty ■days thereafter.” Every part of the work was to be executed ■“ under the direction and subject to the approval of the engineer in charge,” and it was understood, “ that in all questions or matters relating thereto, or to the work, or the contract for the same, the decision of the engineer in charge shall be final and conclusive without appeal.”</p>

Each monthly estimate therefore bore relation to and was subordinate to the final one. The estimates were approximate, for, under the terms of the contract, it was only on the completion of the whole that the absolute amount of the compensation could be computed. The final estimate was to be made “ when all the work embraced in the contract is completed,” and it was agreed that an estimate should then be made of the quality, character, and value of said work, that is to say, of the whole work according to the terms of the agreement, when the balance appearing to be due shall be paid, etc.; this was the final estimate. It was to be made from actual measurements and established facts, which the parties agreed were not determinable at the time of the letting of the work, and in the <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>nature of the case were not determinable until its completion. The contractors were, however, entitled to be paid, during the progress of the work, according to these monthly estimates, and it cannot be doubted that when the city refused to pay the estimate No. 15, made November 1, 1882, a right of action accrued to the contractors, as against the city, for recovery of the amount. The value of the work as it progressed was a matter which, by the terms of the contract, was expressly submitted to the engineer; the estimate was his adjudication of it, and that was conclusive until the final estimate was made.</p>
    <p id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[163,933,1182,1170]]]'>The work was commenced as agreed upon, but it was not completed within the period specified; no complaint is made that the work was unduly delayed; the engineer did not deem it necessary to employ additional force, and it is fair to presume that he deemed the force adequate; the delay, it is conceded, arose from the extent and difficulty of the work, beyond what had been anticipated. The reasons assigned for the refusal to pay were, first, that the work was not performed in a substantial and proper manner; this, however, was disposed of by the jury. And second, that the city had no money to pay it; that the 160,000 appropriated to this purpose was exhausted, and the city had no power under the constitution and laws of the state to provide further funds. Under these circumstances the contractors had an undoubted right to stop the work and they did stop it. They demanded the final estimate, which the engineer, at first, refused to make ; it was not an absolute refusal, however; he refused until he would see what the city would decide to do. It may be, perhaps, that the contractors were not bound to await the engineer’s convenience, or until he could see what the councils might determine in the matter, before bringing suit, for in some cases this might occasion the loss of the claim. That question is not raised on this record and we do not decide it.</p>

But we are clearly of opinion that there was not a refusal, in such, terms and for such length of time, under the circumstances, as would oust the jurisdiction of the engineer, in the adjustment of the matters involved in the contract. There was no absolute refusal, on the part of the engineer, to perform his duty under the agreement; he was to make monthly estimates, and having made one on the 1st November covering the work in October, he might, on a sudden stoppage of the work, well hesitate in making another, a few days thereafter, until he could ascertain whether the plaintiffs were justified in their action, and whether a final estimate was of right due to them; his duty did not require him to make a final estimate until it appeared to him either that the work was completed or that the contractors were justified in abandoning it. Under the conceded facts of the case we fail to find any evidence which would justify an inference by the jury that the engineer refused to perform his duty. On the trial, however, it was shown that he did make a final estimate; it does not appear when he commenced the work, but it does appear that it was completed and submitted to councils, for the inspection of the parties, on the 15th of December, 1882. This estimate, so far as it falls, within the scope of the submission, is to be treated, not as evidence merely, but as an adjudication under the contract and therefore “ final, conclusive, and binding on all parties.”</p>

It is reasonable to suppose that the bids were made, and the contract closed, upon the general terms of the specifications, and that $.75, the price agreed upon for rock excavation, was the medial or average value of the excavation of all the divers qualities of what was properly called rock, encountered in the progress of the work. The estimate clearly exhibits the fact that loose rock could not be regarded as earth, for it is set down as loose rock; a different value is allowed for it, and extra pay for picking. Any disagreement arising out of the specifications or drawings, as to the kind or quality of the work required thereby or by the contract, it is true, was to be decided by the engineer, whose decision and interpretation of the same was to be conclusive; but it must be conceded that the ehgineer had no power over the express agreement of tbe parties, the terms of which were wholly undisputed. There was no evidence of fraud, accident, or mistake through which anything was omitted from the contract ; the contract required no interpretation; its terms were fully and clearly expressed and its meaning open and obvious. The engineer simply set aside the agreement of the parties and made a new one; he determined not what the contract was, but rather what he thought it ought to be. In such a case the estimates cannot be considered conclusive: McAvoy v.

It is contended that the $60,000 was not legally applicable to the purchase of the water-pipes under the previous ordinance of councils. We do not think so. The ordinance of August, 1880, provided for the purchase of the pipe, not for payment. The fund of $60,000 was brought into the treasury for this express purpose; this money was to be “ used for the building of reservoirs for the storage of water for the use of said city, and for the purchase and laying of water-pipes throughout the city, and for that purpose only.” Although this action of the mayor and councils was prior to the raising of the money, it does not appear that any pipe was delivered, or any actually contracted for until the means of payment had beqn provided by the loan of $60,000. Now if we take the amount already received by the plaintiffs from this fund on the several monthly estimates, and add to that the amount expended in the purchase of pipes and in putting them in place, and deduct that sum from $60,000, the difference will exhibit the amount remaining. If <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>tbe jury in tbeir consideration of this case shall find the sum due to the plaintiffs for work done under contract, including the unpaid orders, equal to or greater than this difference, it is plain that the plaintiffs cannot recover damages in addition, for this would be doing by indirection what the law would not permit to be done directly.</p>
