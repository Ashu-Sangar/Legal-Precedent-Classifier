Comfort, for the land in dispute, was not recorded until long after its date and some time after her death ; and it not appearing affirmatively that the deed had ever been delivered to her in her lifetime, or that she had ever been in actual possession of the land therein described, the testimony is offered to rebut the inference of the delivery of the deed, and as tending to prove that Elizabeth Comfort had neither title nor possession; that the deed in evidence, although executed by John C. Comfort, is fraudulent and void and is now used with fraudulent intent. This testimony, we think, is admissible. When fraud is alleged a liberal latitude is permitted in the attempt to prove it. The offer in the present instance we think falls clearly within the limit. We, therefore, overrule the objections, admit the offer, and seal a bill for the defendants.4</p>

It appears from the evidence in this case that although this deed was dated and acknowledged on September 13, 1873, it was not recorded until November 3, 1879. In the meantime Mrs. Elizabeth Comfort had died on January 12, 1879. The deed, therefore, was not recorded until after six years from its date, and nearly ten months after the death of Mrs. Comfort. Mrs. Comfort had made and executed her last will on December 22, 1878, and appointed Mary A. Comfort her executrix. But it was John C.

Comfort, he was met by Mary A. Comfort, who said to him : “ Mr. Mosser, are you doing right in selling John's farm ? ” This assignment was made on April 11,1879, after the death of Mrs. Comfort. The will of Mrs. Comfort was probated on the next day after the assignment, to wit: on April 12, 1879, and it was after the date of the assignment and after the date of the appraisement made by virtue thereof (at which time John C. Comfort declared to the appraisers that the grain in the ground belonged to Elizabeth Comfort, because he had leased the farm to her on a moneyed rent paid in advance), that Mary A. Comfort asked Mr. Mosser if he was doing right in selling John’s farm; and it was on April 22, 1879, that Mary A.

It is true that the declarations of a grantor made after the delivery of his deed are incompetent to affect the estate of his grantee ; but the question we have to submit to you is whether there was any delivery of the deed of John C.

But if you are not satisfied from the evidence, that the presumption of law that tlie deed was delivered is overcome by the facts in the case, and should find that there was such delivery, then the next question of fact we submit to you to determine from the evidence is, was the deed, even if duly delivered, fraudulent and void as against creditors ? The plaiutiff claims that the deed was fraudulent and void as to the plaintiff in this case, because lie was a creditor of John C. Comfort at and before the date of the deed in question, and that the deed was a voluntary one, given without consideration and for the purpose of hindering and delaying the plaintiff and other creditors in the collection of their rightful claims. And the plaintiff relies principally on the fact that the grantee was the mother of the grantor; that she was the widow of Jacob Comfort, who was the owner of a farm containing some forty acres of slate land, subject to a dower of $483.38 in favor of the widow of Edward McKee, and without known separate estate of her own; and they claim that therefore she was without the means or ability to pay the consideration of $5,500 named in the deed; that being without the ability to pay the consideration named in the deed, the deed was a voluntary deed on the part of John C. Comfort, made without consideration by a grantor who was indebted at the timé; and that if it was received under such circumstances by a mother without consideration, it was so received for the purpose of saving the son’s real estate from being levied on and sold in satisfaction of the son’s debts; and if so received for such purpose it would operate in hindering and delaying and defrauding his creditors, and would be fraudulent and void as to them, and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.</p>

We infer, however, from his opinion overruling the motion for a new trial, that he regarded the questions, even if answered in the affirmative, as insufficient to disqualify the juror. The question appears to have been treated both by court and counsel as if the juror had been challenged for cause, and a number of our cases were cited to show that an opinion formed by a juror upon common rumor does not disqualify him. No fault is found with these cases. The error consists in their application to a different state of facts. There was no challenge for cause, the question of the disqualification of the juror was not reached. The inquiry was a preliminary one to ascertain the condition of the juror’s mind as to bias or prejudice. We cannot of course say what the result would have been had the court permitted the examination.</p>
