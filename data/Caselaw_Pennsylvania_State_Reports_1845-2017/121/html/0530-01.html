There is an attempted description of the tract or piece of land upon which the buildings and refinery are erected; even this is erroneous, however, as the land is described as being in Foster township, when in fact it is in Kendall borough; but there is no description of the structures themselves. The claim does not state whether the buildings are of brick or wood; it does not state their form, size, height, or the manner of their construction; nor does it contain any other matters of description sufficient to identify the same. It does not state whether they adjoin or are disconnected, whether they are erected as one tenement or may be separated in their use without injury; it states simply that there are several buildings and an oil refinery and that the land has buildings and machinery thereon erected, consisting of boiler and boiler-house, tanks and tank-houses, stills, warehouse and barn, and donkey-pumps, engines and fittings.</p>
