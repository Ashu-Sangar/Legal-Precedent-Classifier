We have already said, that this action is brought to recover damages for the non-payment of @1,200 royalty stipulated to be paid, according to the tenor of this agreement, on February 1, 1885. It is only one instalment that is claimed in this action. This agreement being in writing, it is for the court to construe it, and it is the duty of the jury to take the construction put upon it by the court. [I will again call your attention to the important covenant in the agreement, so that you may properly understand the question of fact that is involved in this ease. “It is further understood and agreed that if the parties of the second part do not quit possession of the said premises and surrender and give up all interest they may have in this lease, on or before the 1st day of July, 1884, the very act of their refusing or neglecting to quit possession and surrender this lease is hereby agreed on their part, that there is a sufficient quantity of iron ore on said property to pay the royalty of @1,200 on the 1st day of February, 1885.” Under that clause of the agreement, these defendants had the right to go upon this property and dig for and develop the iron ore deposited in the land. No other covenant preceding this one required them to develop the iron ore, but to dig for and prospect, in order to determine the existence and extent of the ore in the premises. This clause provides, that if on or before July 1, 1884, they fail to quit possession and surrender all their rights under the agreement, it shall be construed to be an acknowledgment on their part that there was sufficient iron ore on the premises to pay this first year’s royalty of @1,200. This occurs three times in this paragraph; the language where it first occurs is, “ that it is agreed on their part,” that is, on the part of the parties of <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>the second part, that there is sufficient quantity of iron ore on said property. Where it occurs afterwards in the same paragraph, and in the same connection with the succeeding years, it is termed an “ acknowledgment ” on their part, that there is a sufficient quantity of iron ore on the premises. Therefore, taking the entire section together, we say to you, that this clause in the agreement means that if the party of the second part fail to quit possession of the premises, and surrender to the parties of the first part all their rights under this agreement, on or before July 1, 1884, it is to be treated as an acknowledgment or an admission on their part, that there is a sufficient quantity of iron ore to pay the first year’s royalty. But it is simply an acknowledgment; it is not absolute or conclusive; it casts the burden, however, upon the defendants to show the non-existence of iron ore.] 8 The plaintiffs having shown the articles of agreement in evidence, containing this clause, this easts the burden on the defendants, to show the non-existence of iron ore: in other words it casts the burden on them to prove what is termed in law a negative, that is, that there was not sufficient iron ore in the premises to justify the mining and shipping of .that quantity annually.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[288,1441,1189,973]],["BL_463.1",463,[101,342,1183,199]]]'>The language in relation to the quantity is also embraced in another section of the agreement and reads thus: “That just as soon as iron ore is found in sufficient quantities to justify the shipping of the same;” and that same thought is incorporated in the section that I have just read; so that it is an agreement or acknowledgment on their part, that there is a sufficient quantity of iron ore to justify the mining and shipment of that quantity per annum; and, the defendants having failed to comply with that part of the agreement, that is, having failed to surrender up to these plaintiffs all their rights under this agreement, the admission exists in this cause, and the burden is cast upon the defendants to show by preponderance of evidence, that the iron ore did not exist in sufficient quantities to justify the mining and shipment of it. [This raises the only real question of fact for the jury to determine; which is, whether or not, from all evidence in the case, there existed, or there exists in these premises, sufficient quantity of iron ore that would have justified or will justify, these defendants to mine and ship annually that quantity;] 3 and in your delibera<a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>tions upon the evidence bearing upon that question, you must take into consideration the acknowledgment that exists in this agreement, by virtue of the defendants failing to surrender their rights under the agreement prior to July 1, 1884.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[102,548,1185,870]]]'>On that question a great deal of testimony has been taken; first, on the part of the defendants to prove the non-existence of the iron ore, in sufficient quantities which would justify their mining and shipping it. On the other hand, testimony has been taken by the plaintiffs in rebuttal, tending to show the existence of iron ore in these premises. As we have already said to you, the question of fact for you to determine in the case is, whether or not iron ore exists in these premises in sufficient quantities, which would justify the defendants to mine and ship it, at the rate of 2500 tons per annum. [We further say to you, that the $1,200 which is the stipulated royalty in the agreement for the 2500 tons payable as we have stated, is not a penalty. It is the price of 2500 tons of iron ore in place; that is, if the iron ore fails, the price is not payable. If there was no ore to mine, there would be no royalty to pay.

[It has been owned by the McCahans, and their father before them, for a number of years, and, during all that time, so far as the evidence shows, up to the time of making this -agreement, the McCahans themselves had not developed the iron ore, or had it worked as an ore property, except a lease which was testified to by John McCahan, that he and a man by the name of Kinney had shipped in the neighborhood of about 500 tons or or along there from this property.] 5</p>

In this connection you have the testimony of Mr. Stewart, a gentleman of very extensive experience in the iron business, who relates his information upon that subject; he has lived there for a great many years, very near to these premises; you have heard his testimony in regard to the examinations that he made, and the result of it was, that he failed to find or discover that iron ore existed there in any quantity.</p>

First, as to the plaintiffs themselves, who testified as we have already stated to you, that about 500 tons of iron ore had been mined and shipped from this property, prior to the making of this agreement. That a person mined that ore under a contract with John McCahan and Mr. Kinney, if I remember the testimony correctly, who testified that he had sunk a shaft and that he found a five foot vein of iron ore in the premises; but after finding it there, after having sunk his shaft and developed it a little while, he quit. Well why did he quit ? It is argued by counsel for the defendants and their interpretation of it is, that he quit because ore did not exist in sufficient quantity to justify its mining and shipment. The witness testifies that he quit twice; first, because royalty was too high, being $1.00 a ton; that it was afterwards reduced to 50 cents, and he quit the second time because he was stopped from loading his cars at the wharf of The Cambria Iron Co. Does that explanation satisfy you <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>why he quit ? or did he quit because of the insufficient quantity of ore ? ] 6 The plaintiffs, if I remember their testimony correctly, do not testify that this quantity of iron ore does exist in the premises. You have heard their testimony and from it you must determine as well as you can the existence or the non-existence of iron ore, in the quantity required by the agreement, which would warrant and justify the parties of the second part to ship annually that quantity. You have the testimony of the geologist, Mr. Scott, who says that this farm is geologically situated in the ore-bearing belt, but he does not undertake to say to you whether or not the iron ore does exist in a sufficient quantity to justify this annual shipment of 2500 tons; and it is very plain that no man without an examination of' the ore itself, could testify to its actual existence. It requires-examination and discovery of its existence before it is certainly known. You have also the testimony of Mr. McHugh, a, very intelligent and experienced gentleman in the iron ore business; a man of extensive information, and he does not state that iron ore does exist in this land in that quantity. He says it is impossible to tell for this reason, a reason which is also assigned by others, that this is a hematite, ore, and it does not lie in stratified form, that is, in its original bed. That its existence there might be accounted for by the ore having been washed there, or by the upheaval of the rock; that it may lie in one place in large or small quantities, and then it may disappear and be found again somewhere else, and that it is impossible to discover its existence except by practical tests.</p>

But if, after a full, fair and conscientious consideration of all the evidence in the case, you are satisfied by the weight of the evidence that it does not exist in that quantity, so as to justify these defendants to mine and ship the same according to this agreement, then your verdict should be for the defendants.

In your examination and consideration of this evidence, you begin with the admission contained in this agreement; then examine the evidence and see if this is rebutted by the testimony of the defendants, and in this connection you must also consider the plaintiffs’ testimony to determine the simple question as to whether iron ore exists or does not exist in sufficient quantities to warrant the mining and shipping of 2500 tons annually; as you determine that question, so your verdict should be, either for the plaintiffs for the amount of damages claimed, or for the defendants generally.] 7</p>

They did not dig; they did not prospect; they did not develop, nor did they surrender. Yet upon the authority of Muhlenberg v. Henning, <a href="/pa/116/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="116 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="554392" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0138-01">116 Pa. 138</a>, the court <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>admitted expert testimony to show the non-existence of ore, quoting from the words of the opinion in that case, “ If there was no ore to mine, there could be no royalty to pay.” But that case is to be distinguished <em>’ </em>the lessees had expended $8,000 to develop the ore, and the option to terminate the lease was in the lessor. Here no expenditure was made to develop and the option to terminate the lease was in the lessees. Moreover, the utter worthlessness of expert testimony in such cases is shown in Krum v. Mersher, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20Pa.%2025" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="116 Pa. 25">116 Pa. 25</a>.</p>

When the court undertook to leave to the jury the question of the existence or non-existence of iron ore, on the leased premises, it should have been done so fairly, and the duty of the defendants to dig and prospect and thoroughly develop, as the means of discovering the existence of the ore, should have been fully explained.</p>
    <p id="b467-6" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[155,1139,1185,921]]]'>The witnesses all agreed and so did the court below, that the land lay in the ore belt of the Juniata hematite ore. And the plaintiffs proved in rebuttal the existence of ore in sufficient quantities to be mined profitably, but, without referring to the three witnesses so testifying, by name, the court in the charge gave undue prominence to the testimony of the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses, and adopted the interpretation of the evidence urged by the defendants’ counsel in argument, which was error: Bughman v. Byers, 10 Cent. R. 605. Moreover, the jury were told that a solemn covenant, binding between the parties, to pay a royalty of $1,200 on February 1,1885, if they retained possession and did not surrender a ten years lease, was simply an acknowledgment, not absolute or conclusive, but easting the burden on defendants to show the non-existence of iron ore. It would seem strange that a solemn covenant engagement should be treated as so simple a matter, and that parties, bound to fulfil their contract obligations, may do nothing in the way of performance.</p>

There is the further difficulty that this was ap action of covenant, and the narr is not printed in the paper book of plaintiffs in error as required by the rules of court.

A careful examination of it as presented,,however, fails to disclose any substantial error. It is true the learned judge below fell into a slight inaccuracy in that portion of his charge in which he said that “no other covenant preceding this one required them to develop the iron ore.” This, however, was entirely harmless, as the entire covenants in the lease were submitted to the jury in a manner free frojn objection. If the defendants’ witnesses are to be believed there was not ore enough on the property to justify the defendants in expending any money upon it. There was also evidence that within the time limited the <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>defendants .abandoned tlie property and so notified the plaintiffs. It was immaterial that the notice was given to the attorneys of plaintiffs, as one of the plaintiffs admitted, when upon the witness stand, that he had been informed of the notice by the attorney in question.

The learned judge held this not to be conclusive, but an admission which threw the burden of proof upon the defendants to show that there was not ore there in paying quantities. The defendants assumed this burden and succeeded in convincing the jury that the ore was not there. And if it was not there, the plaintiffs could not be required to pay the royalty, under Muhlenberg v.
