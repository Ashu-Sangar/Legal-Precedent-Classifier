As to the nature and character of that which is commonly called a tax, and which is claimed by the state out of certain estates, before they shall pass to those who have done nothing to accumulate them, we refer any inquiring mind to the opinions of the learned judges in the lower courts, as reported in Strode v. Commonwealth, and Clymer v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/52/0181-02" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="52 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1002260,1002263" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0181-02,/pa/52/0181-01">52 Pa. 181</a>, et seq.

That a deed may not be changed, modified or explained by parol, except for fraud or mistake, is undoubtedly the settled law of this state. That the delivery and recording of a deed under our recording acts, has the same force and effect as feoffment and livery of seisin in any of the King’s courts of record at Westminster are or shall have in Great Britain, etc., is in the language of express statute. The construction and force to be given to the foi’mal words, “ grant, bargain and sell,” and the effect of a general warranty, are entirely foreign to the contention here. The whole question hinges upon a single fact, whether or not the transfer of January 17, 1884, was made or intended to take effect in actual enjoyment at the death of J ohn DuBois, the grantor. As is said by Mr. Justice Clark, in Reish v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/106/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="106 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="455546" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0521-01">106 Pa. 521</a>, “ The policy of the law will not permit the owner of an estate to defeat the plain provisions of the collateral inheritance law by any device which secures to him for life the income, profits and enjoyments thereof ; it must be such a conveyance as parts with the possession, the title, and the enjoyment, in the grantor’s lifetime.”</p>

The express power retained by the grantor to contract any debts he might see proper to contract, and also to bind the estate for his torts done thereafter, is a reservation which is wholly nugatory unless the enjoyment of the estate remained in him. The effect of this instrument, in other words, was to clothe John E. DuBois with a naked legal title liable to be defeated by the power reserved to John DuBois to create liabili<a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>ties ex contractu, and ex delicto, equal to the value of the property granted, and this is no more nor less than retaining the enjoyment of the property as fully as if no deed had been made.

The testimony is, that when the actual change in the mode of conducting the business was made, death was daily awaited and expected. A transfer ostensibly made two years and more before, unaccompanied with a delivery of possession and control of the property and effects granted or alleged to have been transferred, until the grantor is confronted with death, is not such a conveyance as the law requires. A conveyance which parts with the possession, the title and the enjoyment, in the grantor’s lifetime, alone answers the demands of the statute. We do not decide that a sale bona fide in all its purposes and intentions, might not be made, and interrupted by sudden and unexpected death before delivery of possession which would be free of the collateral inheritance law, but the evidence of the intention of the parties would have to be clear.</p>

But the answer to this is given by Mr. Justice Clark, in Reish v. Commonwealth, supra, in which he says, “ It is the value of the estate transferred which is liable to the duty, not the value of the interest or part remaining.” [We say further, that although a deed was made, which between the parties if standing alone would divest the grantor of all estate in the property granted, yet a parol agreement that the grantor shall enjoy the fruits thereof during life, or at the sufferance of the grantee, by which the grantee permits the grantor to <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>enjoy tlie use and control of the property, mates the estate apparently granted liable to the collateral inheritance law.] 24</p>

(2) All property transferred by the decedent in his lifetime, under transfers which were <em>made </em>or <em>intended </em>to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor. And the law may be briefly stated thus : All transfers or deeds, which, by their terms in the light of surrounding circumstances, leave the property for the use, enjoyment, or benefit of the grantor during his life, and all transfers or deeds, no matter what their terms may be, which are intended as a contrivance to accomplish that purpose, leave the property still subject to the tax as the estate of such grant- or. The fact that the grantor does not <em>let go, </em>is what makes it, in the eye of the law, remain his property for the purposes of the tax : Reish v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/106/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="106 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="455546" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0521-01">106 Pa. 521</a>; Seibert’s App., <a href="/pa/110/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="110 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="543771" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0329-01">110 Pa. 329</a>. The principle upon which the law is based is worthy of notice. It is, that the owner’s dominion over his property ceases at his death; that the right of succession depends upon municipal law; that, therefore, collaterals are not owners of a decedent’s estate and cannot become so except upon such terms and to such an extent as the law provides : Strode v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20182" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="52 Pa. 182">52 Pa. 182</a>; Clymer v.

DuBois is bound by every contract John DuBois might choose to make, up to the moment of his death, no matter whether it respected the property mentioned in the deed or any other. He might convey it or incumber it, or in other ways • appropriate it to his own use or to sustain his own credit. His powers were, for practical purposes, about as full and complete as they were before the deed was made. The contracts, obligations, etc., referred to are described to be those “ of every nature and character whatever;” No exceptions are made, and the words used are. as broad as the English language affords. Not only is John E. DuBois bound by the contracts of John DuBois, but all the property is bound also. John E. DuBois takes it subject to <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>the charge. If John DuBois should, sell a portion of either the real or personal property, in what way could John E. DuBois successfully resist it? Either John DuBois or his vendee, could point to the deed and say to J ohn E. Dubois, there is your deed, you are bound by the contract of John DuBois, and so is your property; you are estopped from opening your mouth against any act of this kind that John DuBois may do ; it is only upon the condition that he can do these things that you obtained a chance under the deed of eventually getting his estate.</p>
    <p id="b416-5" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[261,861,1185,1115]]]'>3. The acts of the parties under the deed are in harmony with this construction. For we find after January 17, 1884, in the years 1884 and 1885, that John DuBois made sixteen conveyances of real estate appearing of record in his own name and as his own property. Also we find four mechanics’ claims in the years 1884 and 1885, entered up by him in the same way, and twelve judgments entered, given by various parties to him alone ; also two mortgages given to him, one in 1885 and the other in March, 1886. We have also the further evidence that all the business of his mills was conducted in his name, as it had been before ; that even his general superintendent, G-. R. Yosburg, was not aware of any transfer having been made by John DuBois to John E. DuBois until April 26, 1886, when they chose to put the deed upon record. Also, that during all this time John E. DuBois occupied a subordinate position like any other employee about the establishment, and if he drew any check connected with the business he drew it in the name of John DuBois per John E. DuBois. We are therefore bound to conclude both from the deed itself and from the conduct of the parties under it, that it not only gave, but was intended to give, to John DuBois absolute power over the property as long as he lived.</p>

Dubois, a deed of conveyance, under and by virtue of which it is claimed the title to said property so vested in the grantee, during the lifetime of the grantor, that at the decease of the latter in May, 1886, it was not subject to collateral inheritance tax, under any of the provisions of our act, which declares, “ All estates, real, personal and mixed, of every kind whatsoever, passing from any person who may die seized or possessed of such estate, being within this commonwealth, either by will or under the intestate laws thereof, or any part of such estate or estates or interests therein, transferred by deed, grant, bargain or sale, made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or bargainor, to any person or persons, or to bodies politic or corporate, in trust or otherwise, other than to the use of father, mother, husband, wife, children or lineal descendants born in lawful wedlock, shall be and they are hereby made subject to a tax or duty,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[147,1235,1185,1129]]]'>The only ground on which the commonwealth can assert any right to the tax in question is that the conveyance, in the language of the act, was, “ made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or bargainor.” If it was either made or intended to take effect, either in possession or enjoyment, after his death, it follows from the very language of the act that the commonwealth is entitled to the tax. Conceding the conveyance was made and intended to take effect in possession before the death of the grantor, was it either made or intended to take effect in enjoyment before the happening of that event ? In a clear and convincing opinion, on which we might well rest our affirmance of his decree, the learned president of the Orphans’ Court held that the conveyance was not intended to take effect, nor did it in fact take effect in enjoyment until the decease of the grantor. His finding of fact to that effect was clearly warranted by the evidence; but, waiving that point, and conceding for sake of argument, that there is no competent evidence of intention dehors the instrument itself, we have no doubt the conveyance, fairly construed, according to the spirit and meaning of the act above quoted, did not take effect in enjoyment until the decease of the grantor.</p>
    <p id="b417-6" data-blocks='[["BL_417.5",417,[194,2371,1134,42]],["BL_418.1",418,[244,349,1204,1543]]]'>The manifest effect of the conditions, reservations, covenants <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>and stipulations in the deed was to clothe the grantee with the naked legal title, liable to be defeated at any time by the powers reserved to the grantor to create liabilities either ex contractu or ex delicto to the full value of the property and even beyond it. In the first place the grantee, in consideration of the conveyance, covenants and agrees to pay and fully discharge “ all debts, notes, obligations, covenants, contracts and damages of every nature and character whatsoever, whether arising or accruing from contracts or torts of said John DuBois .....and all such notes, obligations, debts, damages or contracts of the said John DuBois.....executed, made or incurred at any time in the future till the day of his death, by the said John DuBois; and, for the full and faithful performance of this covenant.....all the real estate above conveyed is hereby charged in the hands of the party of the second part, his heirs and assigns; and any and all the obligations of the above covenants, may, by the holders or owners of the rights of action which may be or are embraced in the above covenants, be sued for and recovered off the said John E. DuBois, by suit brought directly against him.” It is further provided that in case the grantee dies before the grantor, “the deed, sale, and conveyance and all the covenants therein shall be null and void, and all the property, real, personal and mixed, above sold, shall be and become fully revested in the said John DuBois, his heirs and .assigns forever, together with all increments accruing thereon .•and therefrom.” Again, it is further expressly stipulated that the grantee is to have and to hold all the property conveyed. “ subject to the foregoing conditions and charged with the foregoing covenants.”</p>
    <p id="b418-7" data-blocks='[["BL_418.4",418,[247,1899,1189,511]],["BL_419.1",419,[134,345,1185,810]]]'>According to the express terms and conditions of the conveyance, it is simply impossible that it could take effect in enjoyment, as to any of the property embraced therein, during the lifetime of the grantor. In the event of his surviving the grantee, the deed was to become null and void, and everything revert to the former. During their joint lives the grantor had the power to incur obligations to the full value of the property, for which the property itself, as well as the grantee individually was directly and specifically liable. The naked legal title acquired by the grantee was the merest shadow. The grantor <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>held a firm grasp on the entire substance, and he retained it as long as he lived. In view of all this, it is idle to contend that, in any proper or statutory sense of the word “ enjoyment,” the conveyance in question took effect or could have been intended to take effect in enjoyment prior to the death of J ohn JDuBois. In principle the case is virtually ruled by Reish v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/106/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="106 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="455546" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0521-01">106 Pa. 521</a>, and Seibert’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/110/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="110 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="543771" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0329-01">110 Pa. 329</a>. In the former, it was held that the right of the commonwealth to collateral inheritance tax. was not defeated by a conveyance or transfer of the title to the property, during the lifetime of the owner, nor by possession taken under such conveyance, if the enjoyment of the property conveyed is not intended to take effect till the death of the grantor. In this case, as we have seen, the conveyance was not intended to take effect in enjoyment during the lifetime of the grantor, nor in point of fact did it or could it do so.</p>
