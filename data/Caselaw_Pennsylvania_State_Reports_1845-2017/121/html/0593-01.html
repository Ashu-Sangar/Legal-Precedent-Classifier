    <p id="b627-10" data-blocks='[["BL_627.9",627,[149,1438,1185,1014]]]'>The only case passed upon by this court that is parallel with the one at bar, so far as we have found, is Young v. Lyman, <a href="/pa/9/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="960752" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0449-01">9 Pa. 449</a>. In the contract in that case there was this clause: “ All materials to be paid for, four months after the completion of the job, and Young to give security in $500 that no liens shall be entered on the houses.” It was ruled, that the stipulation was that no other person, or sub-contractor, should file a lien, and that the lien filed by the contractor was valid. In Mubrey v. Barrow, <a href="/mass/93/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="11 Allen 152" data-case-ids="313808" data-case-paths="/mass/93/0152-01">11 Allen 152</a>, it was held that a lien might be enforced for labor performed under the employment of one who agreed with the owner to erect the house, and to pay and discharge all claims for labor and materials furnished, so that there should be no liens upon the premises. And in all the cases, when it was stipulated that no liens should be filed, it has been held that, unless the agreement specifically included the contractor as a person who should not file a lien, as in Long v. Caffrey, <a href="/pa/93/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="93 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="442066" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0526-01">93 Pa. 526</a>, the stipulation did not bind the contractor not to file a lien himself, but simply held him to prevent the filing of liens by material-men and sub-contractors.</p>

    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[267,403,1188,406]]]'>Plaintiff below agreed to erect and' complete defendant’s building, according to plans and specifications, by August 1, 1884, for $3,090, payable $300 every two weeks during the intervening five months. He also covenanted “ for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, that he will not suffer or permit to be filed.....any mechanics’ lien or liens against the said building for the period of six months after its completion.”</p>
    <p id="b628-8" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[266,817,1187,457]]]'>The sole question is whether the contractor by his covenant waived the right to file, or authorize a lien to be filed in his own favor. We think he did. While the phraseology of the stipulation is different from that in Long v. Caffrey, <a href="/pa/93/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="93 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="442066" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0526-01">93 Pa. 526</a>, the legal effect of both is the same. The lien under consideration was necessarily filed by the plaintiff below himself, or by his sufferance or permission. In either case, it was as clearly a violation of his covenant as if he had suffered or permitted any mechanic or material-man to file a lien.</p>
