The obligor, Samuel P. Nelson, died in 1884, about twenty-nine years after the note was given, and nineteen years after the plaintiff became of age. The law is that after twenty years have elapsed from the time of the maturity of a debt, the debt is presumed to be paid. In the case of Kline v. v. Kline, <a href="/pa/20/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="20 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="972405" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0503-01">20 Pa. 503</a>, the Supreme Court says that a presumption arises “from a lapse of more than twenty years without suit or demand after the money becomes payable. Though not possessing the force of a statutory limitation, which extinguishes the debt and requires a new promise or its equivalent to revive it, the presumption of payment from lapse of time is very strong and is favored in law as tending to the repose of society and the discouragement of stale claims.” In Bentley’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/99/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="99 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="446122" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0500-01">99 Pa. 500</a>, the Supreme Court says “ a debt which has been due and unclaimed, and without recognition, for twenty years, in the absence of explanatory evidence, is presumed to have been paid. This presumption prima facie obliterates the debt, and the onus of proof is upon the creditor, not to establish a new contract as is the case when a debt is barred by the statute of limitations, but to show that payment of the debt has not been made.” Till that presumption is rebutted the defendants are not bound to open their mouths in defence. They can safely rest on the presumption. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence of facts, statements, and declarations of the debtor not consistent with such payment.</p>

William Nelson, a son of Samuel P. Nelson, was called upon to testify to alleged declarations of Samuel P. Nelson, the debtor, not consistent with the idea that the bond had been paid. The witness said that, being in the field in 1874 with his father, a conversation arose about his father’s indebtedness to the witness and to others, including the plaintiff; that the witness mentioned to his father his indebtedness to the plaintiff, Robert McCall Nelson, and then used the expression that his father sanctioned it, and on being pressed both on the second examination and the cross-examination, he said that his father didn’t utter a word in response to his statement, but that he nodded his head; that he “ sanctioned it ” he repeated. Nothing seems to have been said, at least nothing is testified to have been said, on that occasion about the amount or character of the indebtedness, and it is proper to say that the testimony of the witness is very vague. Robert Livingston, the father-in-law of the plaintiff, was called, and testified, that at the time his daughter, who is married to the plaintiff, moved to the Nelson farm, where Mr. Nelson was then living, he had a conversation with Samuel P. Nelson, the defendant, and that Samuel P. Nelson had detailed to him an alleged contract between him and the plaintiff, in regard to the farm and stock and implements he had given him, and went on to say that he owed his son Robert $500 besides this stock; he owed his son Robert $500 for money that his aunt had willed to the plaintiff, and that they would fix it up at some subsequent period.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[193,1787,1179,198]]]'>Now these two witnesses were the only ones who testified to any admissions by the defendant that this note was not paid.

    <p class="summary" id="b663-6" data-blocks='[["BL_663.5",663,[194,1993,1178,403]],["BL_664.1",664,[237,342,1187,1074]]]'>Admissions of indebtedness made to any one but the creditor, are not entitled to the same weight in rebutting the presumption of payment as those made to the creditor. As is said by the Supreme Court in Bentley’s Appeal: “ When a person in conversation with a stranger respecting the claim of another, says he will not pay it, there is not the same reason for inferring recognition, that exists when the creditor requests and the debtor refuses payment. In the latter case not to deny is <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>to admit. Besides, the debt is claimed. But it does not concern the stranger whether the claim is existing or has been paid; he has no right to ask payment.” When the creditor demands payment, or presents his claim and under such circumstances the debtor admits his indebtedness, the admission is of far more weight than such as were referred to here, to parties other than the debtor. [If the case of the plaintiff stood alone on the conversations had with the witnesses William Nelson and Robert Livingston, I would deem them insufficient to rebut the presumption of payment.] 2 But in addition to that, it is shown that the plaintiff, the son of the defendant, lived in his family until his marriage, and then lived as a tenant on his farm up to the time of his death. These are circumstances offered in this case, as tending to explain the delay of the plaintiff and his failure to demand the money of his father in his lifetime, proper to be considered in determining the question whether this bond has been paid. I cannot say that the evidence introduced by the plaintiff in chief is insufficient to rebut the presumption of' payment. The testimony, its weight, the credibility of the witnesses, the correctness of their testimony are all questions for you.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b664-5" data-blocks='[["BL_664.4",664,[235,1424,1185,974]],["BL_665.1",665,[148,344,1180,499]]]'>The defendants to show that this bond has been paid, called Miss Frances A. Nelson and Mrs. Floyd, two of the defendants. They testified first, that on the day the parties came to town to prove the will of Samuel P. Nelson, Frances A. Nelson, the executrix, asked her brother Robert Nelson, who was the. executor of the will, in the kitchen, how much her father owed him, and that he replied, “ Nothing except $100, may be not quite so much, I have it all down in a book.” And, that on a subsequent occasion in General Heiges’ office, in answer to a statement made' by Miss Frances Nelson in regard to the amount of indebtedness of her father’s estate, made in reply to a remark of her counsel, the plaintiff in this case had said that his father didn’t “ owe him much, not more than $100, and may be not that much.” These statements are denied by the plaintiff, and they are denied by his brother and witness, William Nelson. The jury heard the testimony on both sides, and it is for you to determine to which of the witnesses on this branch of the case you will give credit, whether you will believe the testimony of the executrix and her sister Mrs. Floyd, <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>to the statement that they say was made by the plaintiff, or whether you will believe the testimony of the plaintiff and his witnesses that no such statement was made. First you will readily see that if the plaintiff did on that occasion make the statement that has been attributed to him, that he is condemned out of his own mouth, his own statement of the amount of the indebtedness excluding the amount of the bond. But whether he testified truthfully, and whether he is to be believed on that branch of the case is exclusively for you to determine.</p>

[Now you will understand that where an obligation for the payment of money is found among the papers, or in possession of the obligor, he is presumed to have obtained it by payment.] 1 But you will bear in mind in considering that question that, the lips of the plaintiff are sealed as to anything that took place between him and his father in his lifetime ; that he is incompetent to testify; he is rendered, incompetent by law to testify to any such facts.</p>

Nelson, 24 June, 1855; judgment was entered upon it in favor of William Porter, guardian, etc., 29 March, 1860; Robert McCall Nelson having arrived at the age of twenty-one years, it was assigned to him by his guardian on 15 March, 1865, and this scire facias was issued 1 February, 1886. The rule of law which presumes payment of all debts by specialty, etc., unclaimed and without recognition for twenty years plainly applies, therefore, unless the facts and circumstances established by the evidence are sufficient to repel or rebut that presumption. Whether this is so or not, as we said in Gregory v. Commonwealth, a case from the Middle District, argued at this term and not yet reported [ante, 611], is a question for the court. This presumption is very strong and is favored in law as tending to the repose of society and the discouragement of stale claims: Kline v. Kline, <a href="/pa/20/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="20 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="972405" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0503-01">20 Pa. 503</a>. The testimony must therefore be of a satisfactory and convincing character: Peters’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/106/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="106 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="455684" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0340-01">106 Pa. 340</a>; Eby v.

In a case like this the defendant relies upon a presumption of law which is binding alike upon the court and jury until invalidated by proof, and the plaintiff upon a presumption of fact only, which he claims to arise out of the evidence; whether or not the matters sought to be established are true, is a question for the jury; but whether the facts and circumstances relied on, if true, would legitimately give rise to the presumption of fact referred to, is necessarily a question of law for the court.</p>

It may be said that the plaintiff was a minor and the suit was brought within twenty-one years after his minority; that he was a single man and lived with his father; yet no claim appears to have been made for six years after he was married and until two years after his father’s death. No claim appears at any time to have been made by the plaintiff against Samuel P. Nelson, in his lifetime; and after his death, and after this great lapse of time, it is certainly not unreasonable that the plaintiff shall be held to clear proof of the facts relied upon to defeat the presumption that it has been paid. Especially is this so in view of the strong <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>corroborating fact that tbe original bond, after tbe death of Samuel P.

    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[147,549,1185,1026]]]'>The first assignment of error is to that portion of the general charge in which the learned judge instructed the jury that where an obligation for the payment of money is found among the papers or in the possession of the obligor, he is presumed to have obtained it by payment. As a general principle this is undoubtedly true; it is but a presumption of fact, however, and would stand only until proof was given to the contrary. The bond was the original evidence of the indebtedness; it was the only authority that the plaintiff had for entering judgment, and the presumption is that he would not surrender it until he had received satisfaction. The presumption in a scire facias on the judgment may perhaps be slight, but the possession of the bond was certainly presumptive evidence of payment ; it was a fact in support and corroboration of the strong presumption arising from lapse of time; and, as the rebuttal of the latter in any event called for satisfactory and convincing proof of non-payment, we cannot see that the particular instruction complained of, even if erroneous, could have done the plaintiff any harm, for the proof which would sufficiently repel the stronger would certainly rebut the weaker.</p>

But in addition to that it is shown that the plaintiff, the son of the defendant, lived in his family until his marriage, and then lived as a tenant on his farm up till the time of his death. These are circumstances offered in this case, as tending to explain the delay of the plaintiff and his failure to demand the money of his father in his lifetime, proper to be considered in determining the question whether this bond has <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>been paid.” In view of tbe extraordinary length of time which had elapsed before this suit was brought, and of the fact that the bond was found to have been in the debtor's hands at his death, the court was not far wrong perhaps in saying that excluding the explanatory evidence of the kinship and family relation existing between the parties, the testimony of Nelson and Livingston, taken alone, would not be regarded as sufficient, for Nelson’s testimony was too vague to have any effect, and Livingston’s was but the recital of a casual conversation with a stranger, occurring seven years or more prior to the suit; but this portion of the charge was at all events a mere hypothesis and was so expressed, for the relation of father and son and the family relation were admitted, and the testimony of Nelson and Livingston was of course stronger when viewed in the light of these circumstances. The case was submitted to the jury on all the evidence taken together: the language of the learned judge is as follows: “ The testimony, its weight, the credibility of the witnesses, the correctness of their testimony are all questions for you.....Now the case largely depends upon the credibility to be attached to the testimony of the witnesses, and that is to be determined from their manner of testifying and the probability or improbability of what they have testified to, and those questions of the probability, of their credibility, and of the weight to be attached to the oral testimony of the witnesses are questions entirely for the jury.”</p>

Nelson. They were called to show that about thirty days after the decedent’s death, in a search then being made for a draft of the testator’s lands, the bond was found among the plaintiff’s papers.
