      <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>At the trial on. January 8, 1888, it was made to appear that in August, 1875, Charles G. Rollins, the plaintiff, was about to convey to Geo. W. Allen one acre of land from the east end of -a larger piece he owned, and the parties had Z. H. Eddy, a surveyor, to go with them upon the land to make the survey. Mr. Eddy began at the corner of D. C. Hook and first ran around a piece of ground 7 rods in width, on the public road; but, on computing the quantity he found that it made more than one acre, and that 6.7 rods in width on the road, would make exactly an acre. He then set back three tenths of a rod on the road, and at that point set a post, making the width exactly 6.7 rods on the road. From this point he ran a line to the river, parallel with the east line, and there set a post and marked three living trees as witnesses to the post. Mr. Eddy afterwards drew the deed, which by request of Mr. Allen was made to his wife Amelia Allen, dated August 27, 1875, and by mistake made the distance on the road read, seven rods to a post, instead of six rods and seven tenths of a rod to a post, as it should have read. The description in the deed as written was: “ Beginning at a post in the bank of the Allegheny river, at the southwest corner of land ownecl by D. C. Hook: thence, along Hook’s west fine, north 43 degrees, 15 minutes east, 21.8 rods to a post on the public road leading to Warren; thence, along said road, north 38 degrees, 30 minutes west, seven rods to a post; thence south 43 degrees, 15 minutes west, 26 rods to a post on the bank of the Allegheny river; thence up the river to the place of beginning, containing one acre of land.” Mr. Rollins executed the deed on August 25, 1875, without discovering the mistake. Immediately after the survey, Mr. Allen built a board fence, Mr. Rollins furnishing part of the material, exactly on the line established by the surveyor, Mr. Eddy; running from the post which was set at the road, to the post at the river witnessed by the three trees. A year or two later a stone post was set in the place of the wooden post at the road. No witness saw the stone post put there, but the witnesses who helped make the survey and build the fence, testified that the stone post was set exactly where the wooden post stood and at the end of the fence. The deed to Allen was recorded on August 26, 1875, and the land was afterwards sold at sheriff’s sale to S. T. Allen, by whom it was <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>sold to J ames Clark, Jr., who conveyed to Robert Morse, the defendant, on February 21,1879. At the date of this last conveyance, the fence, as built by Geo. W. Allen, was standing on the line established by surveyor Eddy, and the stone post was standing at the end of the fence where it had been set in the place of the wooden post. Two of the witness trees at the river were also standing. In the summer of 1885, against the protest of the plaintiff, the defendant Morse moved the fence three tenths of a rod west, upon the land of the plaintiff, when the alleged mistake in the deed was discovered and this ejectment brought.</p>

That even though the defendant had constructive notice of plaintiff’s claim to the land in dispute, he, the defendant, was not obliged to inquire beyond the deed on record, of said plaintiff to Amelia Allen, through whom the defendant claims title; an examination of said deed would have shown title in defendant for the land in dispute.</p>

The undisputed fact was that the surveyor and those with him set a post at six and seven-tenths rods from the northeast corner, instead of seven, and hence the distance in the deed must give way to the monument on the ground. Can it make any difference that the monument fixed for the corner was a stake instead of a tree ? “ On this point, there is nothing more fixed or better ascertained in the law of this state. The courses and distances in a deed always give way to the boundaries found upon the ground, or supplied by the proof of their former existence, when the marks or monuments are gone:” Agnew, J., in Lodge v.

The deed, according to the courses and distances given therein, embraces the land in controversy; but evidence was introduced by the plaintiff to prove that it was excluded by the survey made upon the ground and assented to by the parties at the time of the conveyance. The length of the line along the public road, north thirty-eight degrees and thirty minutes west, as given in the deed, is “ seven perches to a post.” According to the evidence, that line, as located on the ground, was three tenths less than seven perches, and the post called for at its terminus was. actually set there as a monument to mark and designate the northwesterly corner of the lot intended to be conveyed. On the line running thence south forty-three degrees and fifteen minutes west, the partition fence between vendor and vendee was built and afterwards maintained. The undisputed testimony of the surveyor and his assistants was, that they set the post at six and seven-tenths rods from the northeasterly corner of the lot as claimed by plaintiff below. If the jury found, as they doubtless did, that a survey was actually made on the ground, that the northwesterly corner of the lot was fixed and designated by a stake set in the ground for that purpose, and they were further satisfied that the location of that monument was at the point claimed by plaintiff, it was their duty to find in Ms favor. The evidence certainly warranted that conclusion; and, as was said in Lodge v. Barnett, <a href="/pa/46/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="46 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="420630" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0477-01">46 Pa. 477</a>, no principle is better settled in this state than <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>that “the courses and distances in a deed always give way to the boundaries found upon the ground, or supplied by proof of their former existence, when the marks or monuments are gone.”</p>
