Where land in dispute is claimed under a warrant issued in March 1785, on which there was a survey in April 1785, and there are no controlling marks for that survey to be found, resort may be had for its location, to a block of adjoining surveys purporting to have been made in 1784.</p>

As a line ran in the spring of 1785, before the growth of that year, would count the same by blocking as a line run in the fall of 1784, it may be shown that a corner, on the line in dispute, counted back by the growth of the trees to 1784, and, from the marks of surveyors and returns made by them, that there was a block of surveys of that year into which the one in dispute was located in 1785.</p>

This was followed by evidence of an assessment of taxes upon a portion of this land, as unseated land, and of treasurer’s deeds, dated September 1, 1858, and August 5, 1876, respectively, and other mesne conveyances vesting the title to tbe land in dispute, as was claimed, in the plaintiffs.

The fact that the north line calls for a post at its corners, would indicate, as 1 have said to you, that that line was not run. Therefore, when you look for a line, you will look for a line to answer the call marked upon the ground, on the south side of the warrant. If you fail to find any lines marked upon the ground, and the evidence fails to satisfy you that these lines were intended for the east line of the survey, then you will have to look to the calls for adjoiners to settle the location of this tract. It calls for the Thomas Poultney on the west and for David Lownes upon the east. You will then take up the Thomas Poultney or the David Lownes, and you will proceed to settle their location, and you will settle their location by precisely the same rules that I have laid down for the Nathan Fields, Jr.; you will examine all the evidence connected with these tracts; calls for adjoiners, courses and distances; marks upon the ground, and if you can find marks, which you are satisfied <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>from the evidence in the case, were intended as a line of the Thomas Poultney, then you will locate the tract by the marks upon the ground, being governed by them, although the marks upon the ground may compel you to disregard the calls for ad-joiners of the Thomas Poultney, and the courses and distances. And so with the David Lownes. When you come to the David Lownes you will find that the survey of that tract calls, at its southwest corner, for a beech, at its southeast corner for a post by a beech; and then run the easterly line on a course of north 80 east, you will find at about the middle of the tract it calls for a beech. On the east side of the David Lownes tract, until you get to this beech, it is marked as vacant land. Upon the other side, going further to the north, the William Atmore is marked. If that beech has been found in the center of the tract, it would be a mark of importance to determine its lotíation. As I understand the evidence in this case, that beech has not been found; and you have its calls for adjoiuers, and the calls for adjoiners, as I have already explained to you, are to be used, if they do not conflict with marks found upon the ground which you are satisfied were made by the surveyor in locating the warrant.</p>

You will find that the draft calls for the David Lownes upon its west, and that as marked upon that draft the William Atmore extends along the whole eastern boundary of the David Lownes; that is a discrepancy which we cannot undertake to reconcile. The Thomas Poultney lies immediately upon the west of the Nathan Fields. That survey calls for the Hunt .Downing upon the north. The Hunt Downing calls for another tract, and that for another, and the names of tiróse tracts will appear upon maps sent out with .you, and so from one tract to another until they reach the John Poultney. The John Poultney is described by courses and distances. The warrant of survey calls for marks upon the ground and shows certain streams of water upon it; you remember the evidence that has been given as to the waters which have been found, and as to the correctness with which the waters have been laid down upon it. Now as to streams <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>of water, tlie rule of interpretation seems to be this: that if the surveyor actually went upon the ground and ran the lines, we would expect the streams to be laid down with a reasonable degree of accuracy where the streams cross tlie lines.

    <p id="b222-7" data-blocks='[["BL_222.7",222,[253,645,1189,607]]]'>As a matter of law this is a very plain case. The plaintiffs claim the land in dispute by virtue of a warrant issued by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania on the 11th day of March, 1785, to one Nathan Fields, Jr., on which there was a survey bearing date April 8, 1785. This survey as returned to the Land Office purports to enclose 410 acres, 142 perches and allowance, and to be bo.unded on the north by Richard Thomas, south by vacant land, east by David Lownes, and west by Thomas Poultney. The only question we have to deal with is one of location, and, this being one for the jury, if it were properly submitted puts an end to the plaintiffs’ case, but if it was not so submitted, there must be a re-trial.</p>
    <p id="b222-8" data-blocks='[["BL_222.8",222,[248,1265,1190,1127]],["BL_223.1",223,[191,336,1183,719]]]'>It is scarcely necessary for us to state that if the original marks of the survey, or any of them, are found on the ground, they must govern; but if they are wanting, then resort must be had to adjoiners. The plaintiffs contended that no marks, bearing the date of 1785, having been found on the ground, resort must be had for location to a block of adjoining surveys, which, though purporting to have been surveyed in 1784, the external lines thereof date back to 1777. Of course, the hypothesis here proposed may be adopted in case no governing marks are found for the Fields survey, but not otherwise. Just here we may be permitted to say that as vacant land is called for on the south, in the absence of fixed lines and corners, or controlling adjoiners, the lines of the N. Fields, Jr., running south 30 west, must have their full measure, for in such case the presumption would be strong that the surveyor did not intend that his lines should fall short in that direction. The question then, and the material one, narrows itself down to a south line which, as we understand from the evidence, is found on the ground: Was-thisline run in the fall of 1784, or in the spring of 1785? for in either case blocking would give the same result. If the former were the fact, then it is not the line of the tract in controversy, unless there is something <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>to show that it was adopted as such; if, however, the latter be the correct date, then the presumption would be that this is the south line of the Fields tract. How then, shall this question be determined ? We know of no other method for its solution than that proposed by the plaintiffs’ witness, C. D. Eldred. He says : “ A line of 1784 run in the fall, and one in 1785, before the growth of that year, would count the same date precisely ; but from the actual work of surveyors done, and returns made by them, it is shown that this line continued, and there was a block of surveys of 1784 located on it further west, therefore there was such a line run in 1784.” This answer on motion of defendant’s counsel was stricken out, and in this we cannot but think there was error. We must therefore sustain the second and third assignments.</p>

Because it was claimed that this tract was one of a block of surveys, it was somehow supposed that he could not be allowed tcqgive his opinion as to its location, and this for the singular reason that it would be a legal conclusion. But the conclusion of a surveyor, derived from his knowledge of lines and corners found on the ground, is certainly one of fact and not of law. The question regards location, which is always one of fact, hence, one about which a surveyor who is properly instructed concerning the facts, may always give his opinion : Farr v.

The survey for the Poultney was made in December 1784, hence may well be located by the line of that year, but, as we have seen, it does not follow that that line is 4he southern line of the Nathan Fields, Jr. Adjoiners are very important in determining the location of junior surveys, and, in the absence of original marks on the ground, may be conclusive ; but, there being no call for adjoiners on the south of the tract in controversy, it is clear that in that direction it cannot be thus limited. It is true, the separate draft of the Fields <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>calls for the Thomas Poultney on the whole length of its west line, and so far, the location of that tract is important, but it by no means fixes conclusively the southern line of the former. This answer then, making, as it does, the location of the Poultney conclusive of that of the Nathan Fields, Jr., must be treated as erroneous. The remaining assignments are not sustained, but, for the errors which we have pointed out, this case must be returned to the court below for re-trial.</p>
