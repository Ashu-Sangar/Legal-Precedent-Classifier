There is no doubt of the fact that usurious interest to the amount of $300 was paid by the defendant to the mortgagee, for the loan of $5,000. It is wholly immaterial under what form or pretence, usury is concealed, our courts will refuse to enforce its payment if it can by any means be discovered: Hartranft v. Uhlinger, <a href="/pa/115/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="115 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="551801" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0270-01">115 Pa. 270</a>. The usury began when Brice took the bond and mortgage for $5,000. He had been paid the interest on it to December 1, 1879, from which date the mortgage bore interest, and $100 cash as part of the bonus. The defendant then legally owed but $4,900, and $100 contained in the debt represented by the bond and mortgage was usury. As to the two last payments, nothing need be said.</p>

    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.5",617,[159,381,1185,1171]]]'>The judgment note of 22 September, 1879, for $5,000, upon which judgment was entered 24 December, 1879, embraced no usury. Fully $5,000 was loaned by Brice to Blymyer, and this was the consideration of the note. The $800 note given afterwards, ostensibly as a bonus, was doubtless a device to evade the law; payments on that note were applicable to the original debt. On the 23 December, 1879, $100 was paid on this note, and when the judgment was entered on the 24 December, 1879, for $5,000, but $4,900 was owing upon it; therefore, although the note embraced no usury, the judgment confessed upon it did. On 30 January, 1880, $100 more was paid, and on April 1, 1880, the remaining $100; but the judgment was satisfied on the 12 January, 1880, which was before these two payments were made, and of course they could not be credited to a debt that was already paid. On the same day upon which the' judgment was satisfied, however, a new bond and mortgage in $5,000 were delivered by Blymyer to Brice, as a security for the same debt, and it is contended that the rule established in Campbell v. Sloan, <a href="/pa/62/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="62 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1017227" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0481-01">62 Pa. 481</a>, and since followed in a long line of cases, must be applied. It is argued that as the $5,000 judgment embraced usury to the extent of $100, the taint attached to the consecutive securities growing out of that transaction.</p>
    <p id="b617-6" data-blocks='[["BL_617.6",617,[157,1570,1184,715]]]'>The doctrine asserted in Campbell v. Sloan is undoubtedly correct, but it will be observed that Brice had obtained a judgment on the original security in this case. Judgment was entered for $5,000, disregarding the $100 paid on the day previous to its entry. This was conclusive, and the judgment could not be attacked collaterally even for usury: Rutherford v. Boyer, <a href="/pa/84/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="84 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1053587" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0347-01">84 Pa. 347</a>. Upon payment of $4,900 the judgment of right should have been satisfied. If the plaintiff refused to allow a credit of $100 and the defendant desired to avail himself of it, he should have had the judgment opened; for, as long as it remained unopened and unreversed, the defendant was precluded from denying that he owed the debt exhibited by the record. The case, as respects this $100, is governed by Montague v. McDowell, <a href="/pa/99/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="99 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="446138" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0265-01">99 Pa. 265</a>.</p>

It is conceded that the bond and mortgage were given for the same debt as the judgment; it was a mere change of securities for the same loan, and the law would apply the $200 of usurious interest, paid after the mortgage was given, as payments on the debt which it secured. We are of opinion that the court erred in directing a verdict for defendant; the court should have instructed the jury that the defendant was only entitled to a credit for the two payments of $100 each, made 30 January, 1880, and 1 April, 1880, respectively.</p>
