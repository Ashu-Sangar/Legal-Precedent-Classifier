It is undisputed that the amount as returned as due on mortgages, was obtained from the records of the county commissioners, and includes two trust mortgages, aggregating $620,000, in which the plaintiff had no personal property or interest, but merely stood as trustee for bondholders.

    <p class="summary" id="b153-5" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[180,505,1182,1901]]]'>The general rule in cases of this kind undoubtedly is that where the taxable has neglected or failed to make a return as required by the statute, if the assessor in the due exercise of his judgment makes an estimate of his property for him, this cannot be assailed by the taxable by showing that he has not the amount of property so returned. This would be merely a matter of excessive valuation, which the courts do not undertake to adjust: Hughes v. Kline, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Pa.%20231" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="30 Pa. 231">30 Pa. 231</a>. But the important part of this rule is, that there must have been a due exercise by the assessor of the discretion committed to him, and this suggests the limits to which the rule itself may alone be properly carried. Thus, if the assessor injudiciously discriminates against a taxable or makes a purposely oppressive assessment, this is such an abuse of his discretion as avoids the assessment: Cooley, Taxation, 157; Merrill v. Humphry, <a href="/mich/24/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="24 Mich. 170" data-case-ids="1938326" data-case-paths="/mich/24/0170-01">24 Mich. 170</a>; Lefferts v.

He does not in such case bring his judgment to bear upon the question submitted to him, but exerts it arbitrarily and capriciously, defeating the purpose of the laws.

This fact of itself established a legal fraud which vitiated the entire assessment. No citizen would be safe from illegal and onerous exaction, if assessors are to be permitted thus flagrantly to violate the laws by assessing large and valuable estates, not to the owners in the actual and visible possession under recorded titles, but to others, who claim no interest in the property, and are not in possession.”</p>

      <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>The present ease in my opinion, falls within the decisions last cited, and the exception to the rule which they sustain. The assessor here, has not only not estimated the amount of the plaintiff’s taxable property from the best information at his command, as directed to do by the statute, but he has actually disregarded his information and drawn into and made part of his estimate what the record of the commissioners’ office showed did not belong to the plaintiff but to others. This did not constitute a due exercise of the discretion with which he was invested. It was either a sheer abuse of his authority, or if made in mistake, was such a mistake as amounts to a legal fraud, and to such extent avoids the return. If this assessment is invalid, the plaintiff has a right to have it so declared, and the collection of the tax restrained regardless of the existence of the remedy by appeal. This is not simply an irregularity, nor matter of overvaluation, to be so corrected. It is an illegality which vitiates the whole proceedings: Harper’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/109/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="109 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="542323" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0009-01">109 Pa. 9</a>. The mere circumstance that it might be corrected upon appeal to the county commissioners will not legalize it. Moreover, the right of appeal is not absolute. The plaintiff must excuse his default to the satisfaction of the commissioners. Suppose he should not be able to do this, 'must he still be subject to the return as made? The fact is, that the failure of the taxable to make a return, does not authorize the assessor to make» any return he pleases for him. The discretion of the assessor must be duly exercised. If it be shown that it has not been, the return is not legal, and the taxable is not thereby subjected to the provision of the statute. He stands without it, and until brought within its pale by a proper return, is not bound to pursue the remedies which it provides: Harper’s Appeal, supra.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[248,1949,1186,457]],["BL_155.1",155,[165,345,1186,1025]]]'>In reaching these conclusions, I am not unaware of the decisions in Osborne v. Danvers, <a href="/mass/23/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="6 Pick. 98" data-case-ids="2011458" data-case-paths="/mass/23/0098-01">6 Pick. 98</a>, and Lincoln v. Worcester, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Cush.%2065" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="8 Cush. 65">8 Cush. 65</a>, but I cannot accept them as ruling this case. The statute under which the former was decided provided that whenever any person shall be aggrieved by being overrated in the assessment of any tax, he may apply to the assessors to make a reasonable abatement, and if they refuse so to do, complaint was to be made in the nature of an appeal to the court. The tax in that case was resisted on the ground <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>that the property for which the plaintiff was assessed was not liable to the tax. The court held that this was mere matter of overvaluation, and that the remedy provided by the statute must be pursued. The provisions of this statute, it is to be noted, are considerably different from those of that which we are considering, and the decision cannot therefore be safely taken as a guide. So far also as it denies the right to show in avoidance of a tax, that the property assessed is not liable, it runs counter to the decisions of our own courts. In either case I must decline to follow it as an authority ruling the case in hand. The decision in Lincoln v. Worcester is based upon that in Osborne v. Danvers, and does not add particularly to it. In conclusion, it may be remarked that the act of 1885 has not without difficulty been sustained by the Supreme Court: Fox’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/112/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="112 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="546754" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0337-01">112 Pa. 337</a>. It is not therefore to be oppressively administered or construed. A construction, which fairly regards the right of the individual tax payer, and does not unduly interfere with the collection of the revenues of the state thereby provided for, has at once the sanction of common judgment, justice and equity.</p>

Albright having refused to make the return required by the supplement of 1885, it thereupon became the duty of the assessor to make a return for him, “ estimating the amount from the best information at his command.” As contemplated by the act, the assessor had been furnished with a certified list of mortgages, etc., in favor of complainant, remaining open and unsatisfied on the records of Lackawanna and Luzerne counties. Aided by that evidence the assessor, doubtless according to the best of his judgment, made the return, including therein, among other things, two mortgages in favor of Mr. Albright, trustee, aggregating over $600,000. To that estimated return the county commissioners, as required by the act, added fifty per centum, in the nature of a penalty. Notice of the assessment thus made and day fixed for appeal was duly served on complainant, but he paid no attention to the matter until payment of the tax was demanded by the collector in whose hands it had been placed for collection. He then appealed to the commissioners for relief, alleging that he was misled by the notice served on him by the assessor, in that “the figures thereon were so pointed off as to indicate an assessment of $642.08 instead of $642,088 and for <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>that reason he permitted the day of appeal to pass.” These facts are substantially admitted by the bill and injunction affidavits.</p>
    <p id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[151,483,1184,1272]]]'>Assuming that complainant was misled by the notice, as to the aggregate amount of the assessment, it was of course a good reason for according or offering to accord to him a hearing as though he had appeared and demanded it on the day fixed for appeal, but it was no reason for relieving him from the duty of making a corrected return, such as is authorized by the proviso to the 9th section of the act, and which the commissioners might and doubtless would have substituted for the return made by the assessor. The assessment was not rendered void by the alleged mistake of the assessor in erroneously pointing off the figures showing the aggregate amount, or in not returning the mortgages as trust instead of individual securities. At most, these were mere irregularities or errors that could be corrected whenever discovered, subject to complainant’s right to be heard, as on appeal, after the correction was made. That right the commissioners were willing to recognize, and accordingly proposed that if complainant would then make the return contemplated by the proviso above referred to, they would substitute the same for the return made by the assessor. One of the commissioners in his affidavit says, complainant called at their office several times and attempted or endeavored to have some portion of the assessment stricken off; that he was requested by the commissioners to make the return provided by law, but he refused to do so.</p>
    <p id="b159-6" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[148,1774,1184,549]]]'>It is averred in the bill that the two mortgages had been given to complainant as trustee many years ago to secure certain bonds in which he had no personal interest, and that they had, in fact, been paid long before, and “ have been satisfied of record; ” but, it is not alleged or even pretended that they were satisfied of record at the time they were included in the assessor’s return. If they were unsatisfied on the record at that time, the assessor had no right to treat them otherwise than as outstanding securities taxable in the hands of complainant as trustee, and hence it was his duty to include them in his return.</p>

It was to remedy that great and growing evil, and secure, as far as possible, just and fair returns and assessments of personal property taxable for the support of government, that the act under consideration was passed. As was said in Fox’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/112/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="112 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="546754" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0337-01">112 Pa. 337</a>, “ It was intended to compel each tax payer to disclose to the assessor the full extent of his personal estate, and to avoid the unequal burdens which had been laid upon the shoulders of some persons by the neglect of others to return the full amount of their property. No legal objection can be made to this. If the state has a right to tax moneys at interest in the hands of her citizens, and this cannot be denied, she has the right to know to what extent each citizen holds such property. In the exercise of this right she has the power, and it is part of the taxing power, to require each tax payer to make known to the assessor the extent of his or her property of this description. She has the further right to punish the failure to make such return, by the imposition of a penalty or otherwise, as may best secure the object to be attained.”</p>
    <p id="b160-5" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[252,1515,1194,869]],["BL_161.1",161,[183,335,1181,189]]]'>The provisions of the 9th section apply only to tax payers who neglect or refuse to make the prescribed return. By their own act they are in default, and are prima facie attempting to avoid their share of the public burdens. The assessor is required to make a return for such delinquents, estimating the amount from the best information at his command, to which amount fifty per centum, in the nature of a penalty, must be added; but, in accordance with the fundamental principle that no man shall be condemned in person or property without a hearing, an appeal to the commissioners is provided, for the benefit of those who may consider themselves aggrieved by the assessor’s return. That is an ample, remedy, and on general principles it may well be regarded as exclusive, .except, perhaps, in extraordinary cases. When the tax payer refuses to make his own return, and by his silence acquiesces in that of the assessor, it may be ’ safely assumed the amount returned, plus the added penalty, does not exceed the sum on <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>which tax is justly payable; and in the absence of more reliable data, that sum may well be taken by the assessor as a safe guide in making the subsequent return in case the tax payer does not make it himself.</p>

In Clinton School District’s Appeal, supra, it is said: “All the cases assert the doctrine that when the general power to assess exists, the proper remedy for illegal taxation is by appeal to those to whom the appeal is required to be taken ,* and, if none be given, neither the Common Pleas nor this court can revise the judgment of the tax officers. Indeed, it would be a most ruinous consequence, if, just when the collector comes around with his warrant to demand taxes assessed in due form of law by those having the general power to tax, a court of equity could interfere by injunction.....It will not do to permit the collection of taxes to be interfered with by such persons, unless in the clearest cases of want of jurisdiction in the assessing and collecting officers.”</p>
    <p id="b161-8" data-blocks='[["BL_161.6",161,[182,1369,1180,716]]]'>" The power to make the return and assess undoubtedly existed in this case. At most there may have been an error in returning securities that are alleged to have been previously paid, and therefore not subject to assessment. That error, if it be one, would not have occurred.if complainant had made his own return. Then again, after the error was discovered, the proper correction would doubtless have been made by the commissioners, if complainant had not refused to comply with one of the essential conditions on which they were authorized to act. If he had then made a proper return it should and doubtless would have been substituted for that made by the assessor. That such return was not made and presented was complainant’s own fault.
