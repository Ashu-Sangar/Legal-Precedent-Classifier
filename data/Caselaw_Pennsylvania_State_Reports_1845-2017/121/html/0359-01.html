We fail to see any distinction in the character of the gift to these petitioners and that to the widow. There is a very slight difference in phraseology but no more than seems necessary to provide for the life of the wife which is limited, while the existence of The Christian Church of Plymouth and of destitute widows, as societies, is practically limitless. The wife might not, most probably would not, live to the end of the lease while the societies named as petitioners would certainly exist “ so long as the said lease runs and produces rent.” The other cause for the repetition of the provision limiting the bequests to the income from the said lease does not seem to be an intent to shut the legatees up to the particular lease but rather to define the leased estate as the only source of income from which these annuities are to be paid; and in this respect it seems to us there is' expressed but one common intent. The widows’ income is to be treated the same as the bequests to the church and its trustees.</p>

The testator seems not to have contemplated any forfeiture of the lease. His language concerning the duration and conditions of the annuities, is evidently based upon the idea that the company might work the coal to partial or total exhaustion before the expiration of the term of forty years. While the lease continues, or during the term specified for its continuance, these annuities shall be paid provided there be no exhaustion of the coal or sufficient rent be received to pay them, seems to have been the only idea in the testator’s mind.</p>

Short, 2 P. Wms. 402, a devise of so much money payable out of a certain lease was held to be a specific legacy, and to have been adeemed by the destruction of the lease. That great authority has been recognized by Lord Cottenham in Creed v. Creed, 11 Cl. &amp; F. 508, and has never been doubted in the whole history of our jurisprudence. It is impossible to construe this legacy to be demonstrative. The essence of such a legacy is that it shall be so given as that the fund appointed for its payment shall be designated simply for the convenience of payment, the legacy being in other respects, in effect, general and payable out of the whole estate. But when the gift is of a fund itself, or so charged upon the object made subject to it, as to show an intent to burden that object alone with its. payment, it is esteemed to be specific, and consequently to be adeemed by the alienation or destruction of the object: Walls v. Stewart, <a href="/pa/16/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="16 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="410211" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0275-01">16 Pa. 275</a>; Smith’s App., <a href="/pa/103/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="103 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="449145" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0559-01">103 Pa. 559</a>. In the case at bar, the legacies are “ out of the rents accruing under and from the said lease ” — “ so long as the said lease runs and produces rents sufficient at least to pay the legacies herein charged thereon;” “out of the rents of the aforesaid coal lease,” etc. And at the end of the will, the testator expressly discharges every other part of his estate from the payment of them.</p>

Gaylord, <a href="/pa/103/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="103 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="449134" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0319-01">103 Pa. 319</a>. But it is submitted that the differences between that case and tins are radical and vital in their character. Shupp v. Gaylord was decided upon the reasons given by the court below, and the more carefully those reasons are examined, the more clearly will it appear that the character of the legatee in that case and the presumption that some provision must be intended for her life, at least, coupled with the express provision that the annuity should be for her <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>life, were the dominating reasons for the conclusions reached. “But if,” says 2 Williams on Executors 1170, “it be apparent that the testator’s meaning is to give an annuity at all events, the legacy will become a general one, though it be directed to be paid out of an estate or the rents of it.”</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.4",397,[125,592,1179,974]]]'>3. Again: The residuary devisees having sold the lands claimed to be the subject of the charge of these legacies, before demand made upon them for their payment, were not personally liable in this proceeding. The mining lease of May 8, 1878, being a sale of the coal, there is tio reversionary estate in the residuary devisees. Their only right is to receive the purchase money reserved by that conveyance, and the court should have decreed payment of them by the alienees: Mohler’s App., <a href="/pa/8/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="959530" data-case-paths="/pa/8/0026-01">8 Pa. 26</a>; Hamilton v.

A mere duty on the part of the residuary devisee to pay a specific legacy, does not give the Orphans’ Court jurisdiction: Ditsche’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Phila.%20288" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="13 Phila. 288">13 Phila. 288</a>.

Moreover, § 59, act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 84, expressly confines the jurisdiction of the court to the making of a “ decree or order touching the payment of the legacy out of such real estate.”</p>

We submit that the language of the other bequests is of absolutely the same import and as nearly identical with it as that which any lawyer would use in making the same provision for the three different parties consecutively. Long v. Short, 1 P. Wms. 402, and Creed v. Creed, 11 Cl. &amp; F. 508, were cases of ordinary leases of land, the rentals being sums payable for the mere use of the land. Coal leases are very different, and even under those for short terms, the rents or royalties are paid for the coal itself, including the right to mine and remove it. The legacies were <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>'specific,' but they were charged upon the coal product, and were not adeemed by the forfeiture of one lease and the substitution of another. There was no extinction of the specific thing upon which the legacy was charged: Shupp v.

Gaylord, <a href="/pa/103/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="103 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="449134" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0319-01">103 Pa. 319</a>-330, to another bequest in the same will. That was $500 a year to testator’s wife during her natural life, “ to be paid out of the rents accruing under and from the lease of coal to the Wilkes-Barre Coal and Iron Company, if the said rents fail not to be paid; the same to depend upon the payment of rents under said lease, sufficient at least to pay the legacies herein charged thereon, and not to be paid out of or charged on any other part of ” testator’s estate. Two other legacies, one .of which is the subject of this contention, were charged on the same property, but in somewhat different language. Referring to these three bequests the testator^ in the closing sentence of the will, further directs that they “ shall be paid out only from the rents of the Wilkes-Barre Coal and Iron Company . . . and no other part of my estate is charged therewith.” The lease, executed by testator and others, was for the term of .forty years, and contained a clause of forfeiture on non-payment of rent, at the option of the lessors. Testator’s residuary estate was devised to his children. Shortly after his decease in 1876, the lease was declared void by decree of the Circuit Court for non-payment of rent. In 1878 the executors and other owners united in a lease of same premises to other parties at a reduced rental, under which payments were made more than sufficient to satisfy-the three bequests aforesaid. In Shupp v. Gaylord, supra, the court below in a clear and elaborate opinion, which was virtually adopted by this <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>court, held that the annuity to testator’s wife was not extinguished by the forfeiture of the original lease, but that the same is payable out of the rents or income of the specific property which was the subject of the forfeited lease and is now the subject of the second lease. In other words,that the subject of the testamentary charge was not the lease itself, but the rents of the coal property described therein, that the name of the Wilkes-Barre Coal and Iron Company was used in place of the property itself, the lease then in force being regarded merely as the channel through which the rents or income so charged were received.</p>
    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[139,905,1179,1490]],["BL_400.1",400,[258,324,1185,662]]]'>The bequest in this case to The Christian Chuych of Plymouth, appellee, is, “ $200 a year out of the rents accruing under and from said lease with the Wilkes-Barre Coal and Iron Company so long as the said lease runs and produces rents sufficient at least to pay the legacies herein charged thereon; to be paid yearly in each and every year while said lease produces rents as aforesaid.” The question is, whether this bequest or legacy is not also charged on the rents or product of the coal property, then leased to said company, in same manner as the annuity to testator’s wife. The learned judge of the Orphans’ Court held it was, and in this we discover no error. The controlling question was settled in the case above cited, and all that remained was to apply the principle. While the phraseology of the bequests is somewhat different, the testator’s purpose was to charge them all alike on the same fund. This is indicated at the close of the will, where the three bequests are specifically mentioned, and by necessary implication charged on same fund, with the declaration that “ no other part of my estate is charged therewith.” That purpose, however, is not discoverable from a single sentence of the will but from the entire instrument. The rents or product of the coal property, in the form of statedly accruing rents or royalties was manifestly the fund out of which testator intended not only the annuity to his wife but also the other two legacies to be paid, and on which, exclusively and in relief of every other part of his estate, they are by necessary implication charged. The then existing lease and the name of' the lessee-are mentioned merely as descriptive of the property whence the income, with which to pay the three legacies charged thereon, <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>was to be derived. “ The lease of coal to tbe Wilkes-Barre Coal and Iron Company ” is therefore to be regarded not as in itself the object of the charge, but as descriptive merely of the source whence was to issue the rent or income on which the legacies were charged. As was tersely said by the learned president of the Common Pleas in the case above cited: In this view the legacies would be regarded as specific, in that the produce in rentals of the coal estate then leased to the company only was charged therewith, and all other parts of the estate were discharged, and demonstrative, in that the rents or produce of the coal being primarily and solely charged therewith, the particular lease was referred to as'the channel through which they were receivable.</p>
