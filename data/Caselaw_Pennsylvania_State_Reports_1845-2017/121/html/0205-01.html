The case now under consideration is, indeed, a stronger case than Smith’s Appeal. In Smith’s Appeal the rule against perpetuities was held to have been violated, because the dispositions of the will then in question <em>might </em>have resulted in limiting an estate for a life not in being; here they actually <em>did </em>so result. William Mifflin, the complainant, was not bom until between six and seven years after the deed of 1813 was executed. Reading the provisions of his mother’s will into that deed, and the instrument will be a declaration by John Large (the trustee) that he is seized in fee of certain real estate in trust for Mrs. Mifflin for life, with remainder to her son, William Mifflin (born six years after the date of the deed), for life, with remainder to his children in fee, but with a power of appointment given to him to limit, by his will, the estates of his children upon the same trusts as those declared in his mother’s will in respect to himself.</p>

I therefore think that the limitations in Mrs. Mifflin’s will, so far as they relate to property included in deeds A and B, are invalid, inasmuch as they cause those instruments to offend against the rule forbidding perpetuities. Mrs. Mifflin, therefore, is to be considered as having died without exercising her power of appointing by will, so far as these properties are concerned ; and her children, therefore, took remainders in fee which were not directed by her will, but which passed by their wills, if any, or if none, under the intestate laws. The trustee under her will, I suppose, took the dry legal estate by virtue of her devise to him, but he was seized thereof, as the trusts declared by her were invalid as to said properties, under the evidence in this cause, as to one sixth in trust for the defendant J. Sergeant Price, as trustee under the will of James L. Mifflin, deceased, and as to five sixths in trust for the complainant.”</p>

In whatever words an estate is conferred, and although it be only for life, it cannot, agreeably to the above view, be a perpetuity, if the holder is clothed with power that will enable him to set aside the limitations imposed by the original grantor and confer an absolute interest on himself or on another person. Such a tenant is, so far as he himself is concerned, and in every essential particular, as much an owner as if he had the fee, and the property would descend at his death to his heirs. He can at any moment loose the bonds by which it is fettered and render it as available for the purposes of life and business as if there were no settlement. It is not therefore surprising that the English courts should have held that when property is settled on A. for life, with power to will and convey, he may make any disposition of it which would be valid if he were absolutely the owner; and, in determining whether the limitations which he creates contravene the rule against perpetuities, the computation will date from the period when the power is exercised, <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>and not from the execution of the instrument by which the power was conferred. The rule came to us from England, and was formulated there by judges who, from Taltarum’s Case to the present day, have shown themselves indisposed to tolerate any scheme of settlement which would unduly extend the authority of an owner beyond the grave, and enable him to subject future generations to his caprice or wishes. We should not, therefore, deviate from the path which the English courts have marked out, unless some decision in this state points in a different direction.</p>

The testator, Lewis Ryan, there devised his property in trust for the sole and separate use of his daughters for life, and immediately on the death of any of them, to pay over the principal sum to such person or persons as such daughter might direct by any instrument of writing in the nature of a last will and testament. One of the testator’s daughters, Mrs. Smith, died some years afterwards, and her will gave all the residue of her estate, including that which she was authorized to appoint under her father’s will, in trust for her sons and daughters for life, and upon their deaths to assign the same to such person or persons for such estates as they should appoint by will. The question was, whether this execution of the power was valid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b246-6" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[220,1539,1188,445]]]'>It seems to have been taken for granted, both by court and counsel, that the interest conferred by Ryan’s will was indestructible and would therefore be a perpetuity, if it could be prolonged, under the authority conferred by him, beyond a life or lives in being at his death, and twenty-one years after-wards. The' test consequently was to write the clause of Mrs. Smith’s will when executed, into the will of Lewis Ryan, when it -would clearly be bad, as including children -born after his death.</p>

The power conferred on Mrs. Smith was to be exercised by an instrument which could not take effect until after her death, and did not take the case out of the rule that nothing can be done under a power which could not have been done by the donor. The reason is so clearly stated by Mr. Gray that I will not attempt to put it in other words. “If a man who has a vested limited interest in <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>property has the present unconditioned right to turn that limited interest into an absolute interest, and thus to acquire the present unconditioned, absolute interest, he is regarded by the rule against perpetuities as already having such interest. A tenant in tail is such. A life tenant, with a general power exercisable by deed is also such a person. To this extent, the rule sacrifices form to substance, but the substance must be there. There must be a person with a vested limited interest, who has the immediate right to become the present absolute owner. Such is not the case when a life tenant has a power which he can exercise only by will. The general rule must govern unless the exception is made out, and the exception is not made out, unless there be a present right to acquire the present absolute interest.”</p>

The deeds under which the testatrix, Sarah Mifflin, acquired the property in dispute, authorized her to agree with any person or persons for the sale and purchase of the premises, and by deed or deeds of conveyance to grant the same to the purchaser or purchasers thereof in fee simple, and the money so derived to apply in such manner as she <em>may see </em>fit. The deed set forth in Exhibit A is to the same effect. Although the power so conferred on Mrs. Mifflin was “to sell and convey,” there is, I think, little doubt that she might have executed it by a deed of bargain and sale for a nominal consideration, in trust to reconvey to herself; because she was authorized to apply the purchase money as she saw fit, and whether this was much or little, concerned no one but herself. If this inference is just, she liad an immediate right to become the present absolute owner, and even if a trust to reconvey would have been beyond the scope of the power, she could undeniably have vested an absolute interest in the buyer, and so put the property beyond the scope of a rule which only applies where the holder’s estate is indestructible. A power to sell, and re-invest the purchase money for the same uses, would stand on a different footing; but that cannot well be a perpetuity which may be converted at any time into a fee simple, and, together with its proceeds, given, sold, or otherwise disposed of, as the <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>parties interested may desire. We may therefore infer that the judgment in Smith’s Appeal is consistent with the rule against perpetuities as therein defined, and the conclusions drawn by Gray and other writers of like repute, and tends to sustain rather than condemn the execution of the power now before us. If the declaration in Smith’s. Appeal that the test of the execution of a power is to write the word in the instrument through which the power came, had been laid down as a universal rule, we should have applied it unhesitatingly from deference, to the tribunal by which it was enunciated, but the language of a court must be taken relatively to the subject-matter, which in that instance was a perpetuity, while in this it is a destructible estate.</p>

The moment any owner or beneficiary for life has a general power of appointment, either by deed or will, as he or she may please, this, so far as the rule against perpetuities is involved, is equivalent to the ownership in fee by the possessor of such power, for the reason that all future limitations can be destroyed by such beneficiary, and the property is as fully alienable in his or her hands as if he or she were the fee simple owner. “ It is the immediate and unrestrained alienability of the property by means of the power, which puts the possessor of such power on the same footing as an owner, in regard to the application of the rule against perpetuities: ” Lewis on Perp., 483, 484. “ If property is given to A. for life, with power to appoint it by deed or will to whom he pleases, he has the absolute control of it.

Shultz, <a href="/pa/13/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="13 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="965014" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0098-01">13 Pa. 98</a>; Rush v. Lewis, <a href="/pa/21/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="21 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="411550" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0072-01">21 Pa. 72</a>; Lewis on Perp., Law Lib. ed., 488. It is not necessary, nor have we advanced the proposition, that Mrs. Mifflin had the fee simple ownership in the premises at the time of her death. She had a life estate and unrestricted powers of absolute disposition by deed or will at her pleasure; and this we maintain placed her actually in the same status, in applying the rule against perpetuities, as if she were the fee simple owner.</p>

The third fallacy of the argument for the appellant is that Smith’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/88/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="88 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1061267" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0492-01">88 Pa. 492</a>, rules this case and requires a reversal of the court below. We do not suppose that we can add any force to the careful analysis and consideration which Judge Hake has given in his opinion, of the decision in Smith’s Appeal, nor to the' clear demonstration that he gives, that it cannot and ought not to rule tins case. They are so totally different in their features that the claim made for it by the appellant as ruling the present case ought surely to be rejected. Mrs. Smith, the tenant for life in Smith’s Appeal, had a special and limited power only, to wit, a power to appoint by will given to her by the will of her father, Mr. Ryan. She had no power in her lifetime to unfetter and convey away the trust estate. <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>Mrs. Mifflin had at all times the amplest power to do that very thing. And the law is only concerned to know that the power of free alienation exists, without regarding the quantum of estate vested in the party holding that power.</p>

In at least two instances, this court has approved a definition which does include that element. Thus in Hillyard v. Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Pa.%20334" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="10 Pa. 334">10 Pa. 334</a>, Chief Justice Gibson said: “ A perfect definition of a pepetuity has not been given, and the nearest approach to it is found in Lewis on Perpetuities, ch. 12, where it is said to be a future limitation, whether executory or by way of remainder, and of real or personal property, which is not to vest till after the expiration of, or which will not necessarily vest within, the period prescribed by law for the creation of future estates, and which is not destructible by the person for the time being entitled to the property subject to the future limitation, except with the concurrence of the person interested in the contingent event.” The same judge in the same opinion said: “ It was the indestructibility not only of springing and shifting cases (uses ?) and of executory devises, but also of future trusts, which forced upon the judges the rule against perpetuities, in order to set bounds to the remoteness of not only legal, but equitable limitations ; and it acts upon perpetuities wherever they appear, except in conveyances in mortmain or to charitable uses.” In Smith’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20Pa.%20495" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="88 Pa. 495">88 Pa. 495</a>, the foregoing extract containing the definition by Lewis was repeated by our Brother Paxson in the course of the opinion which was delivered by him.</p>

Gray in his work on the rule against perpetuities, in sections 140 and those which follow, clearly points out that a perpetuity is an indestructible and inalienable interest in its original sense; and, while he shows that it has another or artificial meaning, to wit, that “ it is an interest which will not vest till a remote period,” yet in all his illustrations he shows that interests which were destructible were not perpetuities. <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>At § 203' he says: “ Thus a future interest, if destructible at the mere pleasure of the present owner of the property is not regarded as an interest at all, and the rule does not concern itself with it. For instance, limitations after an estate tail are never too remote ; the present tenant in tail can destroy them all at any moment by docking the entail.” Again, at § 443' he says: “ A future estate which at all times until it vests is in the control of the owner of the preceding estate, is, for every purpose of conveyancing, a present estate, and is therefore 'not obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities.” Under the head of Powers, at § 477 he says : “ A power given to the unborn child of a living person is too remote ; that is, if it is a power to be exercised by will only, or a special power to be exercised by deed. But if such unborn child has a general power to appoint by deed, he has the absolute control exactly as if he had the fee, since he can at once appoint to himself. Such general power to appoint by deed is therefore not obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities; ” citing Bray v. Hammersley, 3 Sim. 513. Again, at § 524: “ If property is given to A. for life with power to appoint it by deed or will to whom he pleases, he has the absolute control over it. There is in truth no future interest; the life tenant can deal with the property as if he owned it in fee. Therefore, in the execution of such a power, the remoteness of an appointment under it is to be judged from the point of time of its exercise, and not from the time of its creation; ” citing a number of authorities.</p>
    <p id="b254-5" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[263,1667,1189,716]],["BL_255.1",255,[167,324,1182,658]]]'>Mr. Lewis in his work on Perpetuities, on p. 483 says, “The great aim of the law against remoteness is secured in the immediate and unrestrained alienability of the property by means of the power.” Farwell on Powers, p. 226, says, “ The rules against perpetuities apply to instruments executing powers, as well as to other instruments ; but there is an important distinction between general and particular powers in this respect. The donee of a general power is virtually the absolute owner of the property on which his power extends, and he is regarded as absolute owner for the purpose of considering the application of the rule against perpetuities to him.” In Gray’s work at section 526 <em>i </em>the author says : “ And if a man who has a vested limited interest in property has the present unconditioned right to turn that limited interest into an <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>absolute interest, and thus to acquire the present unconditioned absolute interest, he is regarded by the rule against perpetuities as already having such interest. A tenant in tail is such a person; a life tenant with a general power exercisable by deed is also such a person. To this extent the rule sacrifices form to substance, but the substance must be there. There must be a person with a vested limited interest who has the immediate right to become the present absolute owner. Such is not the case when a life tenant has a power which he can exercise only by will. The general rule must govern unless the exception is made out, and the exception is not made out unless there be a present right to acquire the present absolute interest.”</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[170,997,1180,1391]],["BL_256.1",256,[265,324,1187,615]]]'>In Lewis on Perpetuities, at page 484, the author speaking of general powers says: “ Of this kind is a limitation of property to such uses or upon such trusts as A. shall appoint, and subject to any appointment to A. in fee, or to B. in fee, or to any other person or succession of persons for life, in tail, in fee or otherwise. In such cases, as the power is so general and absolute as to be equivalent, for the purposes of alienation, to the ownership in fee simple, an appointment under it, so far as concerns the proper period for the vesting of the interests thereby conferred, rests on the same footing with an original conveyance. Nor is there any greater tendency to a perpetuity in a general power of appointment over property, and the possibility of the exercise of such power in opposition to the laws of remoteness, than in a simple absolute right of ownership. The general power authorizes as complete and as immediate a disposition of the property as could be effected were the donee entitled to the fee or absolute interest; and it is of course clear that such a power may be exercised by the donee in favor of himself. And, as regards the estate limited in default of appointment, when not given to the donee of the power, there can be no necessity to consider how far a perpetuity may be created; because, although that estate may be defeated at any time by an exercise of the power, yet the great aim of the laws against remoteness is secured in the immediate and unrestrained alienability of the property by means of the power. It may be true that any alienation of the property must be merely and simply by virtue of the power, and tháft <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>the exercise of such' power must take effect by reference to the'deed or will creating it, and, so far, a necessity may seem to exist, for restricting the donee to the appointment of interests which would have been good if limited in the original will or settlement; but if the essence of a perpetuity be wanting in the nature of the power, or rather if the scope and spirit of the power be directly adverse to a perpetuity, it seems too much to argue that it will not authorize limitations which might have been created by a person having the absolute dominion, <em>i. e., </em>such limitations as will necessarily vest within lives in being and twenty-one years, computed from the time at which they are raised.”</p>
    <p id="AHp" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[258,948,1190,1378]]]'>The foregoing views are undoubtedly correct; they are not at all impeached by text writers or decisions. In our opinion they control this case. As a matter of course, if Mrs. Mifflin had actually executed the power of sale and caused the title to be conveyed to herself in fee simple, as she had the plain right to do, the limitations of her will would have to be determined upon their own merits, regarding her as the owner in fee and disregarding the previous state of the title. But so far as the application of the rule against perpetuities is concerned, the situation is precisely the same as if she had executed the power. For the question i.s, whether the provisions of the original deeds of 1818 and 1816 are inoperative because of the rule against perpetuities. They are, if they create inalienable and indestructible estates, to continue longer than the prohibited period. But the estate of Mrs. Mifflin was neither inalienable nor indestructible. It was destructible by her own act. It was entirely within her power to become the owner in fee simple of the estates granted and to totally defeat any ulterior limitations. It proves nothing to say she did not exercise her power and .that therefore the situation is the same as though she never had the power. For certain purposes and in certain cases that, of course, is true. But in considering merely the application of the rule against perpetuities, it is not true, because that rule requires that the estates in question should be indestructible, and an estate which can be destroyed by the person who holds it for the time being is not indestructible.</p>
