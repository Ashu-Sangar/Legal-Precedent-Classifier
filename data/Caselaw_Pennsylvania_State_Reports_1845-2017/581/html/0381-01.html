PennDOT, to the contrary, argues that this case does not arise from a contract entered into with the Commonwealth. PennDOT asserts that Wausau cannot establish that it was either a party to PennDOT’s contract or an intended third party beneficiary, because the Lang/PennDOT contract did not explicitly mention Wausau. We believe Wausau’s contentions are correct, and, consequently, disagree with PennDOT. ■</p>

Moreover, the statute is silent regarding the preclusion of the generally permissible assignment of rights described above, nor does the statute identify any restrictions on the non-Commonwealth party preventing them from bringing a claim based upon the assignment of rights. Therefore, because Wausau is effectively instituting a <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>claim against the Commonwealth seeking the enforcement of rights that were created, and assigned, by a contract with the Commonwealth, the Board of Claims is the proper forum to adjudicate the assignment claim. <em>See Texas Keystone Inc. v.

Because the basis of the equitable subrogation claim asserted by Wausau is the contract between Lang and PennDOT, we see no reason why jurisdiction over the claim should not lie with the Board of Claims. Although not founded on substantive contract law, this claim nevertheless arises from a contract with the Commonwealth. <em>See City of Philadelphia v.
