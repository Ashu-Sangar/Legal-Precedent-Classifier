Shortly thereafter, on May 19, 1994, Mr. Paternaster filed a writ of summons against Dr. Lee. As Mr. Paternaster could not personally serve Dr. Lee in Korea, he ultimately served him by publication and mail in September 1994. On December 22, 1994, Mr. Paternaster wrote a letter to the CAT Fund, advising it that he had instituted an action against Dr. Lee based on Dr. Lee’s treatment of him in 1986 and 1987, and requesting information about Dr. Lee’s primary insurance coverage. In reply, the CAT Fund notified Mr. Paternaster that his claims were not covered by Dr. Lee’s primary insurance policy or, for that matter, by the CAT Fund. On January 9, 1995, Mr. Paternaster wrote a second letter to the CAT Fund stating that he disagreed with its finding that it was not responsible for covering his claims against Dr. Lee. Furthermore, Mr. Paternaster demanded that the CAT Fund appoint counsel to defend Dr. Lee.</p>

Dr. Lee did not respond to Mr. Paternaster’s complaint, and therefore, on May 26, 1995, Mr. Paternaster sought a default judgment against Dr. Lee. The trial court subsequently entered the requested default judgment in the amount of $1,432,525 (the “Default Judgment”). Mr. Paternaster then filed a writ for execution on the Default Judgment against both Dr. Lee and the CAT Fund, as garnishee of the judgment, in the Erie County trial court.

Furthermore, on March 22, 2002, the CAT Fund filed an answer to Mr. Paternaster’s interrogatories as well as a new matter, in which it asserted that it was not responsible for indemnifying Dr. Lee with regard to the Default Judgment because: (1) it had not received proper notice regarding its duty to defend and indemnify Dr. Lee; and (2) Dr. Lee was not covered by a primary insurance policy for Mr. Paternaster’s claims, and such coverage was necessary for CAT Fund coverage to apply under the Act.</p>

Mr. Paternaster responded to these arguments in his motion, arguing that: (1) the CAT Fund was liable for the Default Judgment as a garnishee because it had a statutory duty to defend and indemnify Dr. Lee for the claim; (2) he had sufficiently notified the CAT Fund of its duty to defend and indemnify Dr. Lee in his December 1994 and January 1995 letters; and (3) the Act required the CAT Fund to provide occurrence-type coverage and therefore, where a health care provider, such as Dr. Lee, had primary policy in place at the time of an alleged wrongful act, the CAT Fund <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>was required to cover a claim relating to that act even if, at the time the claim was filed, the provider no longer had a primary policy to cover the claim.</p>

Morgan of the Commonwealth Court granted the CAT Fund’s summary judgment motion and denied Mr. Paternaster’s motion. Specifically, Judge Morgan found that the CAT Fund was not responsible for covering claims against a health care provider, such as Dr. Lee, who had failed to obtain a tail policy to secure primary insurance to cover the claims. Judge Morgan explained that there was nothing in the Act which “expressly or impliedly authorize^] the CAT Fund to pay toward a claim under these circumstances,” and further pointed out that 31 Pa.Code § 242.7, a regulation adopted by the director of the CAT Fund, explicitly stated that the CAT Fund was not responsible for paying a claim under these circumstances.

While Judge Morgan recognized that his conclusion “may leave a successful malpractice claimant without recourse to any malpractice coverage,” he stated that unless the General Assembly amended the Act to provide a claimant with relief under these circumstances, the courts were without power to grant any such relief. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. As he ruled in the CAT Fund’s favor on this basis, Judge Morgan did not address the CAT Fund’s claims that it could not be held responsible for the judgment as a garnishee and that it did not receive proper notice of its responsibility to cover Mr. Paternaster’s claims.</p>

Moreover, while Appellant correctly points out that nowhere in the Act was it explicitly required that providers purchase either occurrence policies or claims policies with accompanying tail policies, in our view, it is self-evident that in order to preserve the essentially excess character of CAT Fund coverage, primary coverage must be available either through an occurrence policy, a still-valid claims policy, or a tail or similar policy before a provider can tap the CAT Fund’s resources for excess coverage. Indeed, that this is what the General Assembly intended is underscored by section 807 of the Act, which specifically required insurers who offered claims policies to guarantee the continued availability of additional insurance to health care providers after the providers’ claims policies expired, no doubt to ensure that no <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>provider would be forced to forfeit his ability to obtain CAT Fund coverage upon the expiration of his claims policy. <em>See <a href="/pa/569/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="801 A.2d 492" data-case-ids="312792,9409629" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0147-01,/a2d/801/0492-01">id.</a> </em>§ 1301.807.</p>

However, we cannot agree. Rather, reading this language in the context of the Act as a whole, we conclude that the phraseology on which Appellant relies was merely meant to convey that the CAT Fund’s obligations were limited to providing excess coverage over the primary coverage that the health care provider had purchased to cover the time period in which the acts giving rise to liability occurred. We simply do not believe that, in the context of the Act, this language can be read to also convey that if the provider permitted his coverage for the relevant time period to lapse, he could still require the CAT Fund to pay excess coverage when there is no primary coverage to exceed.</p>
