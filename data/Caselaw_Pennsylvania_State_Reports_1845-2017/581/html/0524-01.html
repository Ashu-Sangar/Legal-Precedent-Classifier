Nevertheless, the trial court determined that the letter did not contain a sufficient indication of prejudice to warrant a hearing or new trial. <em>See Carter, </em><a href="/pa/529/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="529 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1831182" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0409-01">529 Pa. at 420</a>, <a href="/pa/529/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="529 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1831182" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0409-01">604 A.2d at 1016</a> (“Once the existence of a potentially extraneous influence has been established by competent testimony, the trial judge must assess the prejudicial effect of such influence.”). In this regard, the court found it significant that Juror 10’s letter did not convey specific knowledge concerning how the <em>ex parte </em>discussions influenced jurors, and that, under the no-impeachment principle, the jurors could not testify as to this aspect. Furthermore, the court indicated that, since the information discussed in the extraneous communications was amply covered in the presentation of the parties’ respective cases at trial, it was not prejudicial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The trial court also expressed substantial misgivings about broadening the availability of post-trial attacks upon jury verdicts. <em>See, e.g., Pratt, slip op. </em>at 4 (“To allow a less restrictive rule would mean that no jury verdict would ever be safe from attack.

    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[259,512,1152,1505]]]'>On appeal, in a divided opinion, the Superior Court determined that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to conduct a hearing and reversed and remanded for accomplishment of the hearing. <em>See Pratt, </em>824 A.2d at 305. Writing for the majority, President Judge Del Sole agreed with the trial court’s recitation of the governing standards, namely, the prevailing no-impeachment rule foreclosing, as a general proposition, juror testimony concerning deliberations, and the exception permitting post-verdict testimony regarding the fact or existence of extraneous influences that might have prejudiced the deliberations (but not the effect that such influence may have had on the deliberations). President Judge Del Sole also emphasized that the testimony that Appellants sought to develop by way of a hearing fell squarely within the exception. <em>See id. </em>at 302 (“Testimony that jurors sought outside information regarding the standard of care to be followed by health professionals and discussed it during deliberations is not testimony of the jury’s reasoning processes; rather it is testimony of overt conduct.”). The majority departed from the trial court, however, on the question of potential prejudice arising from the alleged, extraneous communications. In this regard, the Superior Court majority relied on <em>Carter's, </em>advancement of an objective test for prejudice, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the particular case and focusing on how a typical juror would be affected by the influence. <em>See id. </em>at 303 (citing <em>Carter, </em><a href="/pa/529/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="529 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1831182" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0409-01">529 Pa. at 420-22</a>, <a href="/pa/529/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="529 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1831182" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0409-01">604 A.2d at 1016-17</a>).

Since Juror 10 asserted that there had been improper juror solicitation of extraneous information going directly to this central issue, <em>see supra </em>note 2 (reflecting Juror 10’s description of the outside information gathered by jurors as pertaining to “whether a CAT scan should have been performed at the same time and whether this was the [appropriate] standard of care”), the majority concluded that potential prejudice was implicated under prong one of the <em>Carter </em>guidelines. With regard to <em>Cartefs </em>prongs two and three, the Superior Court majority recognized that, during trial, both sides presented extensive expert testimony relative to the question of whether and when a CAT scan was implicated. The majority found it significant nonetheless that the jurors were alleged to have obtained extraneous information from individuals in whom they placed particular trust, explaining:</p>
    <blockquote id="AiT" data-blocks='[["BL_617.5",617,[190,1457,1110,569]]]'>The jurors, by seeking an opinion from an outside source, sought an opinion from someone whom they found to be personally credible, on the core issue in the case. In essence, the jurors at issue sought out a third party’s opinion on which testimony presented at trial to accept. Human experience dictates that an individual will more heavily weight an opinion from an individual known to them, than an opinion given by a complete stranger. In this case, the two jurors in essence sought out their own expert testimony, which necessarily served to support one of the two sides at trial.</blockquote>

Thus, the Superior Court majority found it appropriate to remand for an evidentiary hearing on the juror misconduct claim to determine whether the jurors in fact received opinions from outside sources regarding the appropriate, medical standard of care.

Appellants also contend that the Superior Court’s reliance on the lead opinion in <em>Carter </em>was misplaced, since that opinion failed to garner a majority vote, and therefore, does not represent binding precedent. While Appellants appear to accept Carter*s basic propositions in terms of its framing of the no-impeachment rule and exceptions, their principal complaint concerning <em>Carter </em>centers on the objective test for prejudice. According to Appellants, this approach requires unwarranted and unprincipled speculation on the part of the trial judge. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief of Appellants at 14 (“Such a process is only arguably better than reading tea leaves.”). In this regard, Appellants highlight that no jury composed of ordinary human beings ever reaches a verdict solely based on the evidence presented in the courtroom, since each juror bring his or her own experiences, knowledge, and beliefs, some of which may be faulty, to bear on the deliberations. <em>Accord State v. Kociolek, </em><a href="/nj/20/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="20 N.J. 92" data-case-ids="1346250" data-case-paths="/nj/20/0092-01">20 N.J. 92</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.2d%20812" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="118 A.2d 812">118 A.2d 812</a>, 816 (1955). Without subjective information (which is simply not available in light of the no-impeachment rule), Appellants posit that a prejudice assessment is inherently a <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>misdirected and pointless exercise. Thus, Appellants urge this Court to announce a rule that forecloses any inquiry into the potential impact of extraneous information, at least in . cases in which the relevant information can be said to have been covered in the evidence presented at trial. Appellants assert that this is precisely the approach taken by this Court in <em>Pittsburgh Nat’l Bank </em>and <em>Friedman, </em>and by the Superior Court in <em>Omdoff.</em>

      <em> </em>To the extent that this Court would approve the remand directed by the Superior Court and should the fact of an extraneous influence be confirmed by the trial court, Appellants also complain that the trial court should not be constrained to find prejudice. In this respect, Appellants regard the Superior Court’s holding tantamount to a rule of <em>per se </em>prejudice. If the remand is sustained, Appellants urge that, at the very least, the trial court should be afforded latitude to determine if the contacts were sufficiently harmful to Appellees to require a new trial.</p>

According to Appellees, such information inherently raises the potential for prejudice, and an evaluative assessment is therefore implicated, which must begin with a hearing to develop, in the first instance, details concerning the precise character of the outside information infecting the deliberations. Once this is accomplished, Appellees contend that the trial judge must engage in a thoughtful comparison of the information in relation to the evidence presented within the courtroom. <em>Accord State v. McKnight, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20122682" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="2000 WL 122682">2000 WL 122682</a>, at *3, 2000 Wash.

    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.4",620,[257,597,1154,1518]]]'>Applying these principles to the present circumstances, Appellees highlight that Juror 10’s letter, at a minimum, gave clear notice of potentially prejudicial discussions between several jurors and outside medical professionals, which discussions related to the central issue debated in this case the standard of care to be exercised by defendants). Parallel to the assessment of the Superior Court majority, Appellees also emphasize that the extra-record input is alleged to have been obtained from trusted individuals having great potential influence over juror decision making. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellees at 14 (“[I]t stems to reason that any opinions from the jurors’ friends, family, and relatives engaged in the medical profession pertaining to which expert opinion to believe were never covered in court and is, on its face, prejudicial.”). Since the trial court failed to investigate what extraneous information the jurors had garnered, Appellees argue that it simply was unable to make any rational determination concerning the presence or absence of bias or prejudice so as to ensure that Appellees had received a fair trial. In particular, Appellees criticize the trial judge’s holding that the subject matter of the extraneous communications was “well covered by both sides at trial,” since this decision lacked the predicate of an informed factual comparison. Additionally, Appellees posit that the inaction by the trial court, coupled with the several-year delay associated with the appeal process, has now effectively foreclosed any reasonably accurate assessment, given the fading of memories that occurs with the passage of time. Therefore, it is contended that the only effective remedy that remains is a new trial.</p>

On the other hand, however, it should be noted that this Court has discouraged pointed, post-verdict discussions between disappointed litigants and discharged jurors that are specifically directed toward collecting evidence with which to impeach the verdict. <em>See Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>Two well-established principles of law govern this case. First, and foremost, is the longstanding rule that courts must protect jurors and their verdicts from unwarranted intrusions. The rule that jurors may not impeach their verdict was formulated to discourage harassment of jurors by losing parties, encourage free and open discussion among jurors, reduce incentives for jury tampering, promote verdict finality, and maintain the viability of the jury as a judicial decision-making body. <em>Carter by Carter v. U.S. Steel Corp., </em><a href="/pa/529/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="529 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1831182" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0409-01">529 Pa. 409</a>, <a href="/pa/529/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="529 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1831182" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0409-01">604 A.2d 1010</a>, 1013 (1992). The reluctance to probe into jury decision-making must give way <em>only </em>in the face of a showing sufficient to undergird genuine doubts about impartiality. Unlike some of our sister states,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Pennsylvania has never adopted a <em>per se </em>rule finding prejudice whenever there is juror misconduct. Moreover, it is axiomatic that inquiry into the motives of individual jurors and conduct during deliberations is never permissible; any investigation must focus solely on <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>whether there is solid information that the jury was exposed to external influences and, from an objective perspective, whether such influence was likely to have affected the jury’s verdict. In order for juror misconduct to warrant a hearing, it must entail the introduction of some new information to the jury as opposed to a clarification or illustration of the evidence presented in court.

Kniseley, </em><a href="/pa/322/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="322 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1167854" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0248-01">322 Pa. 248</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20300" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="185 A. 300">185 A. 300</a>, 302 (1936). The rule is justified by the fact that the trial judge is in a better position than the appellate court to decide the question of prejudice because of his or her first-hand knowledge of the relevant facts and evidence. When jurors conduct their own experiments or seek advice from those outside the presence of the court, the result is the introduction of facts that have not been subject to the rules of evidence or to cross-examination by either party. This is broadly defined as juror misconduct. However, when allegations of misconduct arise, it is the responsibility of the trial court to determine if the misconduct resulted in a reasonable possibility of prejudice. <em>Carter, </em><a href="/pa/529/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="529 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1831182" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0409-01">604 A.2d at 1016</a>.</p>

Juror No. 10’s oblique reference to a claimed prejudicial effect of an outside influence upon the jury’s deliberation sheds ho light on the ultimate question of <em>potential </em>prejudice. While the letter from the juror is signed, it lacks the indicia of authenticity and the reliability of an affidavit. In previous situations in which an evidentiary hearing was held, allegations of juror misconduct have been supported by affidavits prior to the hearing. <em>See, e.g., Pittsburgh National Bank v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/493/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="493 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="8731598" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0096-01">493 Pa. 96</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="493 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="8731598" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0096-01">425 A.2d 383</a> (1981).

The letter contains only vague allegations that information was solicited on a complex issue confronting them at trial. However, the medical issues involved in this case were not those associated with family practice, general practice, or the nursing profession, but were those governed by specialty practices. The letter does not detail whether the information received was the same as that introduced into evidence nor does it disclose whether the information was itself conflicting. In short, the vague, unsworn assertions contained in the letter of Juror No. 10 demanded no more than the review conducted by the trial judge. Following review of the evidence in this case, the trial judge determined •that, due to a lack of first-hand knowledge, Juror No. 10 could add nothing to a hearing by her testimony that was not included in the letter, and that no prejudice existed because both sides had introduced extensive evidence with regard to the CAT scan. Consequently, this Court’s review, as was that of the Superior Court, is limited to the deferential standard of abuse of discretion. I believe that the record contains sufficient evidence to find that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying a hearing in this matter.</p>

Significant to our holding in <em>Friedman, </em>then, was our finding that the information complained of could not have prejudiced the jury because the information communicated by the foreman to the other jurors was information already in evidence.</p>

The experimenters said that, because they were able to stop their automobiles before striking the defendant’s forklift that the plaintiff should have been able to do so as well.

We have never treated that lightly. As to the conclusion of the Superior Court that prejudice was certain enough to grant a hearing based solely on the contents of the letter, this is pure speculation and surmise given the paucity of information as to exactly what was communicated to the jury. All we have here are unsubstantiated allegations of one juror concerning matters that were revealed in the jury room by other jurors. It is beyond cavil that what is said in the jury room during deliberations is outside the purview of post-verdict juror testimony so that there is no basis in the law to justify any further proceedings. In <em>Carter </em>we observed that the trial court provided detailed and lengthy instructions that the jurors consider only the evidence and testimony of the witnesses presented.
