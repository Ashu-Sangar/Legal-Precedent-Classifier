Appellants, relying on standards set forth in the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Pennsylvania Prison Society, </em>which was reversed by this Court, believe the electorate should have been told the most significant reason for preventive detention is flight risk, and that this Court observed preventative detention: (1) would incarcerate for future offenses rather than punish for past offenses; (2) presumes the accused is guilty rather than innocent; (3) presumes the accused will commit additional crimes if released on bail; and (4) contravenes the purpose of bail for the accused to prepare for trial. <em>See Commonwealth v.

It does so to the detriment of the citizens of our Commonwealth. Indeed, the majority’s adoption of the “subject matter test” is not only inconsistent with the plain language of the Constitution, but also with the Framers’ intent as to how to safeguard the citizenry with respect to the amendment of that social compact, and our six-year-old decision in <em>Bergdoll v.

In adopting this test, the majority dispossesses the voters who may wish to amend certain facets of our fundamental law, but not others, of the right to do so, and instead, encumbers them with a Hobson’s choice between accepting all proposed amendments or none of them. Accordingly, while I concur as to the result reached by the majority regarding the constitutionality of the amendment to Article I, Section 6,1 respectfully dissent as to the analytical framework embraced by the majority and to its conclusions regarding the constitutionality of the amendment to Article I, Section 14 of our Constitution.</p>

A review of the debates surrounding the adoption of the “separate vote” requirement confirms this plain meaning interpretation approach to Article XI, Section 1. Specifically, the convention debates from 1838 disclose that the reason for this part of the amendment provision is to ensure that our citizenry is fully informed of the proposed amendments to the Constitution, easily understands the amendments, and is able to vote on the various amendments separately.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The Framers, therefore, intended for Article XI, Section 1 to guarantee that the voters may express their desires with respect to <em>each </em>constitutional amendment separately so that voters who favor only one o.ut of two proposed amendments are not placed in a situation in which they have to accept either both amendments or no amendment at all. Thus, the focal point of Article XI, Section 1 clearly is to grant the voter the greatest freedom to decide upon amendments to our fundamental law; and this may only be achieved by a literal and plain meaning interpretation and approach to Section 1.</p>

In that appeal, our Court found the proposed amendment at issue to violate Section 1. Our focus in <em>Bergdoll </em>was two-fold. First, we analyzed how many ways the ballot question at issue would change the <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>Constitution. We concluded that the ballot question would change the Constitution in two ways and that it encompassed amendments to two articles of the Constitution. Second, we reviewed whether the ballot question permitted the electorate to vote separately upon each of the amendments. As it did not, we found the ballot question violated Article XI, Section 1. <em>Bergdoll, </em><a href="/a2d/731/1261-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="731 A.2d 1261" data-case-ids="11673370,56796" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/1261-01,/pa/557/0072-01">731 A.2d at 1270</a> (stating that when a ballot question encompasses multiple amendments, it does “not permit the electorate to vote separately upon each of the amendments in violation of Article XI, § 1.”).</p>
