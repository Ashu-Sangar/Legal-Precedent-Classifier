The application thus facially tracked Section 1103 of the Public Utility Code, which requires an applicant for a certificate of public convenience to establish that that the proposed service is “necessary or proper for the service, accommodation, convenience or safety of the public,” 66 Pa.C.S. § 1103, and the PUC’s interpretation of this statute, which, as a general rule, has required that an applicant demonstrate a public need or demand for the proposed service, the inadequacy of existing service or facilities in the proposed territory, and the applicant’s fitness to render such service, along technical, financial and legal lines. <em>See, e.g., Seaboard Tank Lines, Inc. v.

In this submission, the authority acknowledged the need for water service to Cherry Farm and did not challenge Philadelphia Suburban’s ability and fitness to furnish such service or the company’s averment concerning the expression of developer preference. The authority emphasized its own fitness, however, and contended that it was in the public interest for Cherry Farm to receive water service from it, because it stood ready, willing, and able to perform at substantially lower rates as a natural extension of its own facilities, which, in fact, were located even closer to the Cherry Farm tract than those of Philadelphia Suburban.</p>

In other words, according to Philadelphia Suburban, the Commission could freely accept as true all factual allegations made in the protest and nevertheless grant Philadelphia Suburban’s application in conformity with the Public Utility Code and the Commission’s long-standing interpretation. Thus, the company suggested that there was no need for a hearing on the application or protest. Philadelphia Suburban also observed that the central averment of the protest (that Chester Water Authority was capable of providing water service to the development at lower rates) was the same as that which was raised and rejected in a recent and substantially similar protest lodged by the authority to another Philadelphia Suburban application pertaining to different Thornbury Township tract, which was decided on a full hearing record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Concerning the protest, the panel reasoned that the authority failed to challenge Cherry Farm’s need for water service or Philadelphia Suburban’s ability to supply it, but rather, implicitly acknowledged that water service was needed. Furthermore, it observed that there was no allegation in the protest refuting Philadelphia Suburban’s averment that it is structurally, financially, and legally able to provide such service. Consequently, the panel determined that the protest submission effectively constituted an admission that Philadelphia Suburban was capable of sustaining its burden of proof supporting the grant of a certificate of public convenience, and therefore, the matter was appropriately resolved on the pleadings. Like the Commission, the panel treated the authority’s allegation of lower-cost service as tangential to the essential certification inquiry. In concluding, however, that a hearing was required on Philadelphia Suburban’s application, the majority highlighted language from Section 1103 of the Public Utility Code that prescribes, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commission “shall hold such hearings, which shall be made public” on applications for certificates of public convenience. 66 Pa.C.S. § 1103(b).

Thus, the PUC deems the due notice afforded, as well as the corresponding opportunity to make written submissions of which the authority advantaged itself, to represent adequate process. Additionally, the Commission attempts to invoke the doctrine of collateral estoppel based on the prior, similar certification proceedings decided on an evidentiary record. Finally, the PUC contends that the Commonwealth Court’s criticism of the Commission proceedings as straying beyond the pleadings was inapt, particularly in light of the Commonwealth Court’s own established precedent in <em>Doria v.

On this point, the company highlights that municipal authorities are constrained by legislatively im<a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>posed restrictions on competition with existing business enterprises. <em>See </em>53 Pa.C.S. § 5607(b)(2) (articulating the intent of the Legislature in enabling municipal authorities was “not to unnecessarily burden or interfere with existing business by the establishment of competitive enterprises” and prescribing that “none of the powers granted [to municipal authorities] shall be exercised in the construction, financing, improvement, maintenance, extension or operation of any project or projects ... which in whole or in part shall duplicate or compete with existing enterprises serving substantially the same purposes”). Philadelphia Suburban observes that the salutary purposes of these limitations reflect the unfair competitive advantage that would be enjoyed by municipal authorities, in light of their exemption from property taxation and ability to raise capital via the issuance of tax-free bonds, <em>see </em>53 Pa.C.S. § 5620, and freedom from the substantial expense associated with regulation. According to Philadelphia Suburban, the Commonwealth Court’s decision invests municipal authorities with competitive rights before the PUC that are otherwise unavailable to them in the general marketplace and extends an open invitation to authorities to use the regulatory procedure that constrains jurisdictional utilities to achieve indirectly what they cannot accomplish directly. Furthermore, the company posits that the Commonwealth Court impermissibly substituted its judgment for that of the Commission with respect to the significance that should be attributed to a claim of lower rates by a protesting municipal authority, a matter that is inherently within the ambit of the PUC’s administrative expertise, and thus, its discretionary purview.</p>

According to the authority, the Commission’s decision to accept unproven and disputed allega<a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>tions from the application was contrary to good order, in derogation of its rights and interests as well as those of the public at large, and violative of fundamental due process tenets.

Relative to the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the authority criticizes the notion that a favorable disposition of one discrete application pertaining to a particular locality, and involving particularized circumstances in terms of the identity of the developer, applicable water rates, and proximity of prospective provider facilities, forever excuses Philadelphia Suburban from hearings on its subsequent and distinct applications. Finally, Chester Water Authority cites Commission regulations indicating that hearings will be held upon the filing of the pleadings, unless waived by the parties, <em>see </em>52 Pa.Code § 5.201, and that participants have the right to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, object, and submit motions and argument. <em>See </em>52 Pa.Code § 5.243(a); <em>accord </em>66 Pa.C.S. § 332(c).</p>

Dist., </em><a href="/pa/576/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="576 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="16761" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0574-01">576 Pa. 574</a>, 586, <a href="/pa/576/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="839 A.2d 1055" data-case-ids="16761,9061779" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0574-01,/a2d/839/1055-01">839 A.2d 1055</a>, 1062 (2003). The certification setting entails a unique regulatory process via which the General Assembly has imposed requirements upon certain utility service providers that would otherwise be subject only to dictates of the competitive marketplace and general law, along the lines of unregulated business activity. In this setting, while due process concerns implicating hearings certainly may arise in the course of particular certification proceedings, we do not regard the act of regulatory approval itself as the type of government activity that inherently requires a hearing to comport with constitutional doctrine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

First, with regard to the statutory provisions, Section 1103 is the most specific to certification proceedings; therefore, to the extent that another provision would seem to require a hearing, Section 1103’s conferral of discretion upon the Commission controls. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1933 (prescribing that special statutory provisions are to be deemed controlling over conflicting general provisions). The PUC regulations that the authority cites reflect general hearing practice, including the affordance to “participants” of the opportunity to have an active role, and there is no dispute that when a hearing is available, these procedures control. Since, however, both the enabling statute and the regulations also contemplate situations in which hearings are not required, <em>see, e.g., </em>52 Pa.Code § 5.102(a), the hearing regulations are not properly read to require a hearing in every instance.</p>

Further, we discern no abuse of Commission discretion in the grant of a certificate of public convenience to Philadelphia Suburban without a hearing, where the uncontested averments of the company’s application were sufficient to reflect a demand and need for the service (as this inquiry has been interpreted by the Commission to require little or no significance to be given to a municipal authority’s challenge grounded primarily on differential rates), the inadequacy of existing facilities, and technical, financial and legal fitness.</p>
