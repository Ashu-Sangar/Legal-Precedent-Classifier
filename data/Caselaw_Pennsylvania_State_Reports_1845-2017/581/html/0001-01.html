They obtained a final divorce decree from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court) on March 19, 1999. At the time of separation, Father sought primary legal and physical custody of the parties’ four children, who at the time ranged in age from nine to three years old. Pending the outcome of Father’s custody petition, the parties agreed to a temporary order of shared legal and physical custody, pursuant to which the children lived three and one-half days per week with each parent. They later amended the agreement to provide that the children would alternate between parental homes on a weekly basis.</p>

The trial court also ordered Father to pay the interest portion of the mortgage on the marital home; homeowners, personal property and automobile insurance; private school tuition; and other expenses. On June 18, 1998, the trial court reduced Father’s monthly support payment to $5,132.00 per month ($61,584.00 per year) because it determined that Mother’s counsel fees had improperly been included as a reasonable need of the children. It further reduced his obligation to $3,132.00 per month ($37,584.00 per year) on August 18, 1998 based on credits for overpayment of Mother’s counsel fees.</p>

He presented evidence of living expenses and reasonable needs in the amount of $14,834.23 per month ($178,010.76 per year). The master assessed Mother a net earning capacity of $4,607.00 per month ($55,284.00 per year). Mother presented the same reasonable needs as she did during the 1997 support hearing, namely $28,208.00 per month ($338,496.00 per year) for herself and the children, with $21,106.00 per month ($253,272.00 per year) attributable to the <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>children.

That being so, the Master can do no more than calculate the presumptive minimum that each would owe to the other with [Father] at $16,130 per month and Mother at $4,600 per month.

Further, these children’s expenses in Husband’s house only exceed the $2,380 per month figure which results from a combined income of only $10,000.

Where the parent who does not have primary custody has a less significant income than the custodial parent, it is likely that he or she will not be able to provide an environment that resembles the one in which the children are accustomed to living with the custodial parent. While a downward adjustment in lifestyle is a frequent consequence of divorce that affects both adults and children, we would be remiss in failing to ignore the reality of what happens when children are required to live vastly different lives depending upon which parent has custody on any given day. To expect that quality of the contact between the non-custodial parent and the children will not be negatively impacted by that parent’s comparative penury vis-a-vis the custodial parent is not realistic.

However, contrary to <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>the expressions of the majority and like Chief Justice Cappy, I would caution the trial court against ever resting a decision to deviate on a presumption that a child will favor his or her relationship with the parent who can provide the child with greater material possessions.</p>

      <p id="b95-11" data-blocks='[["BL_95.11",95,[135,1735,1154,627]]]'>. We note that in high income cases like the instant one, the trial court must generally calculate the parents' child support obligations according to the formula set forth by this Court in <em>Melzer v. Witsberger, </em><a href="/pa/505/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="505 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="1788910" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0462-01">505 Pa. 462</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="505 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="1788910" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0462-01">480 A.2d 991</a> (1984). <em>See </em>Pa. R.C.P.1910.16-2(e). The <em>Melzer </em>formula in no way presupposes that the non-custodial parent is the "obligor,” but rather simply makes each parent responsible for that portion of child-related expenses that corresponds to his or her percentage of the two parents’ combined income. Notably, in the instant case, both the domestic relations hearing officer ("DRO”) and the trial court determined the parents’ support obligations based solely on the presumptive minimum calculation in Pa. R.C.P.1910.16-2(e), reasoning that Mother had not presented any evidence of her reasonable living expenses as is required to perform a <em>Melzer </em>analysis. Whether the DRO and trial court erred in failing to request such information and apply the <em>Melzer </em>formula is not before the Court as it has not been raised by the parties.</p>

The majority further decrees that “the trial court should inquire whether the non-custodial parent has sufficient assets to provide the children with appropriate housing and amenities during his or her period of partial custody.” Majority slip op. at 8. The majority provides an exceedingly vague definition of “appropriate housing and amenities”, stating that “the term ‘appropriate’ does not mean equal to the environment the children enjoy while in the custodial parent’s care, nor does it mean ‘merely adequate’.” <em><a href="/pa/505/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="505 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="1788910" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0462-01">Id.</a> </em>Finally, the majority specifically states that this ruling is not limited to those high income cases where the combined net income of the parents exceeds $15,000.00 per month, but rather encompasses all situations where there is a “significant disparity in income”. <em><a href="/pa/505/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="505 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="1788910" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0462-01">Id.</a></em>

    <p id="b96-10" data-blocks='[["BL_96.8",96,[258,1940,1152,421]]]'>I find this analysis to be troubling for several reasons. First, I can perceive no objective standards within the rule it sets forth. How does a trial court determine what is “appropriate housing and amenities”? Furthermore, what constitutes a “significant disparity” in income? I am concerned that we are providing the trial courts and the practicing bar precious little guidance as to how the majority’s rule should be applied.</p>

      <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>Second, I find the majority’s approach disquieting because I believe it transforms a child support action into a quasi-equitable distribution action. In my view, the majority’s new rule is not so much addressing whether the needs of the children are being met (which is a proper subject of a child support action), but rather is focused on augmenting the wealth of the noncustodial parent. While such a focus may be proper in an equitable distribution matter, it has no place in a child support action. A child support action should not be used to jerry-rig a new balance between the respective financial positions of the spouses.</p>
    <p id="b97-4" data-blocks='[["BL_97.4",97,[134,917,1153,785]]]'>Finally, and most importantly, I am not in accord with the majority’s foundational premise concerning the relationships between parents and children. The majority appears to be of the belief that if there is a disparity in income, the parent-child relationship will perforce be corrupted by the wealthier parent’s desire to “buy the affection of the children.... ” Majority op. at 7 n. 5. The majority goes so far as to state that it is unrealistic to believe that a noncustodial parent’s relationship with her child will not suffer where the custodial parent is more wealthy than the noncustodial parent. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The majority believes we should capitulate to what it perceives to be a social reality, and redistribute the wealth so that the affections of the child will not be alienated due to a parent’s inability to provide the child with material advantages comparable to those provided by the wealthier parent.</p>
    <p id="b97-5" data-blocks='[["BL_97.5",97,[133,1725,1154,298]]]'>I am disturbed by this approach. First, I can find no basis in the law for the proposition that a noncustodial spouse must be enabled, via payments from the custodial parent, to provide material advantages and entertain her children in the same lavish fashion as may the custodial parent. This simply has not been the law of this Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b97-6" data-blocks='[["BL_97.6",97,[133,2055,1154,308]],["BL_98.1",98,[253,320,1153,418]]]'>Furthermore, I am disturbed by the philosophy underpinning this rule. Unlike the apparent view of the majority, I do not believe that the health of any given parent-child relationship is measured by a parent’s ability to provide a surfeit of expensive possessions or experiences for her child. Rather, the parent-child relationship thrives, or withers, based on the <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>availability of intangibles such as love, attention, and affection. While it may be true that we live in a highly materialistic culture, does this fact stand in contradiction to the timeless realities of parenting? Or, to put it colloquially, <em>can </em>money buy love? I think not. And, more importantly, I balk at this court’s implication that not only are a child’s affections for sale, but also that our judiciary should be in the business of fostering the market for such a “commodity”.</p>
