For approximately one year preceding this date, Lee, a former family friend, lived with Evelyn Brown, and her four children, in the apartment.</p>

Sonya Brown, the eldest daughter of Evelyn Brown, recognized Lee and, based upon specific instructions from her mother, refused to allow him to enter. As a result, Lee became enraged and angrily kicked the door repeatedly for several minutes. Before leaving, Lee wrote in black marker across the apartment door: “All you bitches, hit man Butter.” (Notes of Testimony (N.T.), April 27, 1987, page 497).</p>

A neighbor of the Browns, Denise Williams (Williams), testified that she saw Appellant and Lee standing outside of the Browns’ apartment door shortly before 2:00 a.m. Williams testified that she watched as Appellant conversed with someone inside the apartment. Meanwhile, she also noticed Lee standing with his back pressed against the adjacent wall to avoid being detected through the peephole. Williams further testified that she could hear Appellant conversing with one of the female occupants of the apartment, whom he eventually persuaded into opening the front door. When the door opened, both Appellant and Lee entered the apartment, which at the time was occupied by Evelyn Brown, along with her seventeen-year-old daughter Tina Brown and five-year-old son Daniel Brown.</p>

Gilbert, who lived in the same apartment building as the Browns, was a family friend of Lee, with whom Lee had occasionally lived following his eviction from the Browns’ apartment. Lee awakened Gilbert and explained to him that he “did something bad.” (N.T., May 1, 1987, page 1075). After Gilbert inquired further, Lee admitted that he stabbed Evelyn Brown. At this point, Lee gathered up a few articles of clothing from Gilbert’s apartment and informed Gilbert that both he and Appellant were leaving to stay at his mother’s house.</p>

Her hands and feet had been hogtied behind her back and a pair of panties was stuffed inside her mouth. She had been stabbed with a knife and scissors a total of forty-eight times in the face, neck, chest, side, and thigh. The deep puncture wounds from the weapons caused blood to spatter as much as four feet from her corpse. Next to her body, the killers left behind two playing cards, an ace and a jack, face-up on a pillow.</p>

Her pants had been removed and she had been raped prior to being stabbed an aggregate of fifty-three times in the face, head, neck, chest, abdomen, buttocks, and thigh. Similar to the gashes suffered by her mother, Tina’s deep puncture wounds had been inflicted by a knife and scissors.</p>

Appellant then proceeded to confess to the detectives that he raped Tina Brown. At this point, the detectives stopped Appellant and once again informed him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which he again voluntarily waived.

The three aggravating circumstances presented by the Commonwealth and found by the jury included: (1) Appellant committed the murders while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); (2) Appellant committed the offenses by means of torture, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8); and (3) Appellant had been convicted of another offense for which a sentence of life imprisonment could be imposed, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10). The three mitigating circumstances advanced by Appellant and found by the jury included: (1) Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1); (2) the age of Appellant at the time of the crime, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4); and (3) any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of Appellant and the circumstances of his offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). After weighing the three aggravating circumstances against the three mitigating circumstances, the jury found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and sentenced Appellant to death for each murder conviction.</p>

I join the Majority on this particular point because I have no objection to assuming certain points in order to facilitate a disposition, particularly given the typically prolix filings with which this Court is burdened upon capital PCRA review. But, since this Court is likely to encounter this new type of assault upon direct appeal counsel in capital cases with increasing frequency, I believe there are two points worth making about the point assumed by the Majority. First, it is pure speculation whether the Court would have entertained a particular defaulted claim based upon new constitutional authority under the discretionary relaxed waiver doctrine. Indeed, this Court has held that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective on appeal for failing to seek the retroactive benefit of a new constitutional rule that was announced while the appeal was pending, where the claim was not preserved below. <em>Commonwealth v.

And, on the other hand, there are also situations in which it would be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a different outcome as legitimate “prejudice.” Even if a defendant’s false testimony might have persuaded the jury to acquit him, it is not fundamentally unfair to conclude that he was not prejudiced by counsel’s interference with his intended perjury. <em>Nix v.

In this case, the trial court gave a first-degree murder instruction substantially identical to that which the <em>Huffman </em>Court characterized as a patently erroneous statement of the law resulting in a miscarriage of justice. <em>Compare </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 550 (quoting N.T., May 19, 1987, at 2145), <em>with Huffman, </em><a href="/pa/536/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="536 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1843201" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0196-01">536 Pa. at 198-99</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="207" data-cite="638 A.2d 961" data-case-ids="1843201,7374211" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0196-01,/a2d/638/0961-01">638 A.2d at 962</a>.</p>

The first portion of the instructions cited by the majority merely defines the circumstances under which a defendant may be deemed to be an accomplice. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 550-51 (quoting N.T., May 18, 1987, at 2108-09). It does not, however, address the subject of <em>Huffman, </em>namely, the expanded scope of vicarious criminal liability for other offenses that may ensue once a defendant is found to be an accomplice and/or coconspirator. <em>See Huffman, </em><a href="/pa/536/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="208" data-cite="536 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1843201" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0196-01">536 Pa. at 198-201</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="209" data-cite="638 A.2d 961" data-case-ids="1843201,7374211" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0196-01,/a2d/638/0961-01">638 A.2d at 962-63</a>. The trial court discussed this central issue of scope in separate passages of its instructions in ordinary terms (and not on the special terms required by <em>Huffman </em>in first-degree murder cases), including the passage complained of by Appellant. <em>See also </em>N.T., May <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>18, 1987, at 2103 (“What’s the coconspirator rule? When two or more persons conspire or combine with one another to commit an unlawful act, each is criminally responsible for the acts of his associates or his coconspirators committed in furtherance of their common design. In contemplation of the law, the act of one is the act of all.”); <em>id. </em>at 2112 (“Each accomplice is equally accountable for all acts committed pursuant to the original common criminal purpose or design, even if the specific act was not fully expected, intended, anticipated, or preplanned.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_3" id="ref_footnote_5_3">3</a>

    <p id="b236-5" data-blocks='[["BL_236.4",236,[260,860,1155,1096]]]'>The other passage cited by the majority is the trial court’s indication that specific intent to Mil is an essential element of the offense of first-degree murder. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 550-51. This charge, however, is phrased in terms of direct criminal liability and does not eliminate the possibility of jurors relying on the vicarious liability instructions to otherwise find Appellant guilty of first-degree murder. This is precisely why the <em>Huffman </em>Court recognized a special rule for first-degree murder cases in which vicarious liability is charged. <em>Accord Commonwealth v. Chester, </em><a href="/pa/557/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="210" data-cite="557 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="56819" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0358-01">557 Pa. 358</a>, 380 n. 12, <a href="/a2d/733/1242-01" class="citation" data-index="211" data-cite="733 A.2d 1242" data-case-ids="11551778,56819" data-case-paths="/a2d/733/1242-01,/pa/557/0358-01">733 A.2d 1242</a>, 1253 n. 12 (1999) (“A general accomplice charge, while legally correct on the law of accomplice liability, when given in conjunction with a charge of first degree murder, must clarify for the jury that the specific intent to Mil necessary for a conviction of first degree murder must be found present in both the actual Mller and the accomplice.”). Moreover, the specific intent charge given in relation to the Commonwealth’s assertion of direct criminal liability was also issued in <em>Huffman, </em>as it is in all first-degree murder cases. Indeed, its absence alone would be a fatal defect, as there would be no basis for a finding of direct criminal liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_4" id="ref_footnote_5_4">4</a>

Accordingly, the jurors may have believed (consistent with the most damaging of Appellant’s statements) that Appellant’s own intent was limited to the objective of rape, but may nevertheless have convicted him of first-degree murder based on the court’s vicarious criminal liability instructions. <em>Accord Huffman, </em><a href="/pa/536/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="214" data-cite="536 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1843201" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0196-01">536 Pa. at 199</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="215" data-cite="638 A.2d 961" data-case-ids="1843201,7374211" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0196-01,/a2d/638/0961-01">638 A.2d at 963</a>.
