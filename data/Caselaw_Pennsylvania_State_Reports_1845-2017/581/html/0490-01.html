Appellant told Miles that he knew where they could acquire some money, but that they might have to kill someone to obtain it. Thereafter, the two men left the bar and went to Appellant’s brother’s house. Appellant obtained a .22 caliber rifle from his brother, feigning that he and Miles were going hunting. After leaving his brother’s house, Appellant and Miles went to a second bar and purchased two quarts of beer before driving to a residence in Cumbola, Pennsylvania (the Residence) shared by Appellant’s 87-year-old grandmother (Grandmother) and his uncle, Edmund Saranchak (Uncle).</p>

Appellant rolled Uncle over, while Miles rifled through the victim’s pockets stealing his money. Appellant and Miles then went to Grandmother’s second floor bedroom. Appellant asked Miles to shoot Grandmother, but he refused. Upon awakening, Grandmother asked, “Danny is that you?” Appellant then fatally shot Grandmother once in the head. Appellant and Miles proceeded to lower the bedroom’s blinds and search Grandmother’s room for money.

After securing the crime scene, police canvassed the neighborhood and questioned neighbors.

In support of this argument, Appellant retained the same psychiatrist who had testified to his mental capacity during the initial proceedings, and provided him with all of Appellant’s relevant school, mental health and hospital records.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> At the PCRA hearing, the psychiatrist opined that had this information been available to him at the time of the original proceedings, he would have offered expert testimony that Appellant was suffering from a substance induced psychotic disorder or delusional disorder that prevented him from forming the requisite intent for murder and rendered him incapable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>

Trial counsel relied upon that diagnosis in deciding to forego a diminished capacity defense. After Stevens’ bench trial and sentencing, appellate counsel obtained background information which allowed the same expert to opine that a diminished capacity defense could have been presented had she been given the additional background information. Stevens argued that reliance on a pre-trial psychiatric examination could not constitute a reasonable basis for failing to pursue a diminished capacity defense because of counsel’s underlying ineffectiveness for failing to provide the psychiatrist with Stevens’ social history and past mental health problems. In <em>Stevens, </em>our Court initially noted that the PCRA court, who was also the factfinder in Stevens’ bench trial, stated that regardless of the expert’s change in diagnosis, it would still have concluded that Stevens had the capacity to form the specific intent to kill at the time of the murders.

We agree with the finding of the trial court that Appellant has not proved, by a preponderance of evidence, that there was a reasonable probability that presentation of expert testimony concerning Appellant’s psychosis would have successfully prevented the Commonwealth from proving Appellant’s premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

The PCRA court examined the chronol<a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>ogy of events. Appellant stated that he knew where he could get some money at 8:30 p.m. on October 15, 1993. At 11:00 p.m., Appellant left Courtney’s Bar with Miles. At midnight, Appellant retrieved a .22 caliber rifle. Appellant then proceeded to a second bar with Miles, where the two men purchased two quarts of beer. Appellant then drove to Cum-bola, Pennsylvania, parked in Grandmother’s driveway, and stated that he was going to get some money from Grandmother. Appellant took the rifle, entered the house through the basement door, walked directly to a sofa in the basement, and shot Uncle in the forehead before taking his wallet. Appellant then proceeded to the second floor where Grandmother was sleeping. Upon being asked by her, “Danny is that you?,” Appellant raised his rifle and shot her in the forehead. Before leaving, Appellant took money from Grandmother’s purse and unsuccessfully tried to open a closet safe. Eventually, Appellant was apprehended and confessed to his involvement. Accordingly, the PCRA court found that “the complex series of actions [Appellant] took on the night of October 15, 1993, as well as the statements he made to Miles at Courtney’s Bar and statements to the investigating officers after the crimes, provide compelling evidence of [Appellant’s] intent to commit a robbery and, if necessary, to kill in order to obtain money.” We agree with this analysis.

The Commonwealth argued that Appellant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony, as an aggravating circumstance. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6).

The PCRA court correctly found that <em>May </em>and <em>Billa </em>are distinguishable from the case <em>subjudice. </em>In this case, the PCRA court noted that Appellant was already found guilty of the underlying felonies relied upon by the Commonwealth following a non-jury trial on those charges prior to the penalty hearing. In neither <em>May </em>nor <em>Billa, </em>had the accused already been found guilty. To the contrary, the jury charge at issue in these cases related to the guilt phase of trial.

The PCRA court found that this precise issue was raised, nearly verbatim, on direct appeal to this Court and no error was found. <em>See Saranchak </em>I, <a href="/pa/544/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="544 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="463549" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0158-01">544 Pa. 158</a>, <a href="/pa/544/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="675 A.2d 268" data-case-ids="463549,7860475" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0158-01,/a2d/675/0268-01">675 A.2d 268</a>, 277 (1996).

Specifically, Appellant contends that the prosecutor, in his opening statement, told the jury that they would hear from Miles, co-defendant, who would testify to the same statements that he made to police following the murders. By doing so, Appellant argues that the prosecution bolstered the credibility of a key witness by referring to a prior consistent statement which was not admitted into evidence. Furthermore, Appellant maintains that the prosecutor <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>intended to inflame the passions of the jury by telling the jury that Miles would testify that prior to being shot, Appellant’s grandmother said, “Danny, why do you have that gun?” Appellant contends it was error for counsel not to object because neither Miles, in any of his prior testimony or statements, nor any other witness, had ever attributed those words to Grandmother. Finally, Appellant argues that the prosecutor incorrectly told the jury that Miles’ testimony that he and Appellant had gone to the Residence to commit robbery would be corroborated by Appellants statements to police. Appellant argues that he always denied the robbery charges. Appellant’s argument is that the cumulative effect of the prosecutor’s improper remarks violated his rights under the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteen Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>

The court found that the remarks were not inflammatory, did not prejudice Appellant, and the claim was without arguable merit. We agree. We conclude that Appellant fails to establish arguable merit because the cited statements by the prosecutor would not have the “unavoidable effect” of forming in the jury’s mind a “fixed bias and hostility” such that the jury could not “weigh the evidence objectively and render a true verdict” as is required to establish reversible error. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Dr. Kruszewski also stated, in general terms, that if a person tends to be impulsive by nature, consuming alcohol can make that person more impulsive and can potentially lead to his committing a crime without being fully aware of what he was doing, <em>see id. </em>at 123; however, the witness did not connect this reasoning with anything that occurred in the present case. Nor was Dr. Kruszewski, or any other mental health expert, asked to perform a more comprehensive evaluation subsuming a review of available records from the hospitals in which Appellant was treated for psychiatric problems connected with multiple psychotic episodes (including at least one suicide attempt), or from Appellant’s school, where, again, he had been placed in a special program for students with social and emotional disturbances.</p>

Further, when in grammar school, Appellant suffered from several additional psychological infirmities which, combined with his substance abuse, resulted in paranoid and delusional traits which became exacerbated by alcohol consumption. <em>See id. </em>at 13-14, 21, 39, 42. Dr. Kropp indicated that these conditions constituted significant impairments to normal functioning, and led to a condition in which Appellant—who apparently had wanted to join the military from an early age—would occasionally think that he in fact was in the military, and these delusions would become particularly strong when he consumed alcohol. <em>See </em>N.T.

Furthermore, when interviewed by police the next evening, Appellant seemed to think that the killings were accomplished as part of a military operation, and his responses were accordingly rigid and militaristic. The officers indicated that Appellant’s demeanor was unusual as well, as he appeared to.believe that he was a new recruit and the officers were his drill sergeants.</p>

However, after being provided with the appellant’s mental health records, the same psychologist testified at the appellant’s PCRA hearing that, had she seen the appellant’s background documents at the time of trial, she would have been able to offer expert testimony in support of a diminished capacity defense. <em><a href="/a2d/739/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="739 A.2d 507" data-case-ids="11565432,837141" data-case-paths="/a2d/739/0507-01,/pa/559/0171-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/739/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="739 A.2d 507" data-case-ids="11565432,837141" data-case-paths="/a2d/739/0507-01,/pa/559/0171-01">at 514</a>. Despite this testimony, a majority of this Court concluded on appeal that the appellant had not been prejudiced by counsel’s failure to provide the psychiatrist with the appellant’s mental health records. In support of its conclusion, the majority relied on the PCRA court’s statement that, as the trier of fact at the appellant’s trial, the court would not have accepted a diminished capacity defense in light of the other evidence presented by the Commonwealth that had, in the court’s view, definitively established the appellant’s specific intent to kill. <em><a href="/a2d/739/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="739 A.2d 507" data-case-ids="11565432,837141" data-case-paths="/a2d/739/0507-01,/pa/559/0171-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/739/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="739 A.2d 507" data-case-ids="11565432,837141" data-case-paths="/a2d/739/0507-01,/pa/559/0171-01">at 515</a>.</p>

There, Justice Zappala stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[191,754,1112,1324]]]'>The PCRA court determined that Appellant suffered no prejudice by his counsel’s failure to pursue [a diminished capacity] defense. It held that it would have found that Appellant had, and exhibited, the specific intent to kill despite [the psychiatrist’s] revised diagnosis as presented at the PCRA hearing. I believe that the PCRA court as well as the majority fails to consider the full effect of counsel’s error in failing to provide the documents needed to correctly diagnose Appellant. Rather, their consideration is limited to whether [the psychiatrist’s] testimony during the PCRA hearing would have been sufficient to establish reasonable doubt when set against the evidence offered by the Commonwealth at trial. This may have indeed been the proper analysis had Appellant presented [the psychiatrist’s] revised diagnosis as after-discovered evidence. However, the [psychiatrist’s] revised diagnosis, set against her testimony at trial, is offered to show counsel’s ineffectiveness in failing to pursue a vigorous and viable defense. Counsel’s failures precluded not only [the psychiatrist’s] correct testimony at trial, but also any other evidence, which was not discovered due to counsel’s failure. Since it is impossible for the trier of fact to fully anticipate and properly weigh a defense that was [not] ... presented, it is impossible for the PCRA court to state that Appellant was not prejudiced by such failure.</blockquote>
