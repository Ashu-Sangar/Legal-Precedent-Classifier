She appealed her dismissal to the State Civil Service Commission (the “Commis<a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>sion”), requesting reinstatement and back wages. Following hearings, the Commission concluded that Ms. Giovagnoli had been improperly removed and was entitled to be reinstated, but declined to award back wages. Appealing to the Commonwealth Court, Ms. Giovagnoli argued that the Commission had erred in failing to award her back pay. The court agreed and, in memorandum decision, remanded the case to the Commission for such an award. On remand, the Commission directed CYS to reimburse Ms. Giovagnoli for the wages and benefits that she would have received had she remained employed. As the parties could not agree upon the sum, a hearing was held, with the Commission ultimately issuing an opinion and order setting the amount.</p>
