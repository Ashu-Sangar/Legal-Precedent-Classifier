This question is brought before our court by Appellant who challenges the determination that trial counsel was ineffective. Because we find no violation of Appellee’s Fifth Amendment privilege, the <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>attendant finding of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was in error. Therefore, for the reasons stated below, we reverse the order of the Superior Court awarding a new trial and reinstate the judgment of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b639-5" data-blocks='[["BL_639.4",639,[141,545,1155,580]]]'>Appellee was convicted of aggravated indecent assault and related offenses, arising from his interaction with fourteen year old K.H., a resident at a youth placement facility where Appellee was employed as a staff member. Several weeks after Appellee’s unrelated, voluntary departure from his employment at the facility, K.H. confided to a staff member that Appellee touched her in an inappropriate, sexual manner. K.H. asked that her disclosure be kept in confidence. Against K.H.’s wishes, the staff member reported the disclosure, and an investigation ensued, first by facility staff and later by the Pennsylvania State Police.</p>

Appellee declined to meet with the trooper, expressing a desire to consult his attorney. Later, the attorney contacted the trooper and stated that Appellee adamantly denied any inappropriate conduct, but, on the advice of counsel, would assert his right under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remain silent at any interview with police.</p>
    <p id="b639-8" data-blocks='[["BL_639.7",639,[141,1988,1155,150]]]'>Appellee was subsequently arrested and charged with offenses ranging from aggravated indecent assault of a person less than sixteen years old to corruption of a minor.</p>

On cross-examination, Appellee’s trial counsel <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>attempted to proceed beyond the scope of the direct examination but was precluded from doing so. After the Commonwealth rested, however, trial counsel called the trooper as a defense witness. On the Commonwealth’s request for an offer of proof, counsel for Appellee summarized his reason for calling the trooper by stating that he wished to question the trooper “to determine the adequacy of the Pennsylvania State Police investigation against my client, Dave DiNicola. I don’t think they put on an adequate investigation. These questions are directly proposed to be present [sic] to show the jury and I think I should be entitled to let them know this.” (T.T. p. 16).</p>

During that examination, the Commonwealth objected and raised the concern that the line of questions would lead to the trooper revealing Appellee’s pre-arrest assertion of silence.

Was anything else investigated that might tend to show otherwise? Anything?”). On the Commonwealth’s objection, another sidebar discussion ensued, during which the district attorney <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>advised that such questioning would open the door to the trooper elaborating on his unsuccessful effort to interview Appellee in furtherance of the investigation. The trial court attempted to discourage trial counsel from proceeding on his intended course, suggesting that the central issue before the jury was credibility and that aggressive questioning of the trooper might not resonate with the jury, particularly as trial counsel was unable to offer any evidence that the officer should have uncovered. The court nevertheless overruled the Commonwealth’s objection, and trial counsel reiterated: “Now, was anything done by you—anything—did you look in any other direction to see if these charges were unfounded?” The officer responded that he contacted Appellee, at which point trial counsel interrupted him, shifting the focus away from Appellee’s response to the trooper’s inquiry.</p>
    <p id="b641-4" data-blocks='[["BL_641.4",641,[149,1153,1149,364]]]'>On cross-examination, however, the district attorney returned to the subject of the trooper’s conversation with Appellee, eliciting the trooper’s explanation that Appellee declined the request for an interview, and that counsel for Appellee later contacted the trooper and advised that Appellee denied the allegations but would invoke his right to remain silent in any discussion with law enforcement personnel.</p>

It was asserted that trial counsel was ineffective, first, for failing to object to the trooper’s testimony revealing Appellee’s pre-arrest silence; and second, for opening the door to the inevitable revelation that Appellee asserted his right to remain silent. A hearing on the matter was scheduled; however, the original record presented to this court, contains no transcript of an <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>evidentiary hearing at this stage or any other reference that would indicate whether or not it was actually conducted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The trial court’s decision rested on its determination that Appellee’s response to the trooper’s request for an interview was better characterized as a denial of the charges rather than as silence capable of being viewed by jurors as a tacit admission. Further, the court noted that while there is a strong proscription against references to a defendant’s post-arrest silence in circumstances in which the defendant elects not to testify at trial, <em>see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Clark, </em><a href="/pa/533/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="533 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="1837508" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0579-01">533 Pa. 579</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="533 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="1837508" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0579-01">626 A.2d 154</a>, 158 (1993), a defendant’s pre-arrest silence is more amenable to being offered into evidence, at least where the defendant elects to testify, as occurred in this case. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The court concluded:</p>
    <blockquote id="b642-6" data-blocks='[["BL_642.5",642,[293,1554,1113,359]]]'>Therefore because the defendant was never directly confronted with an accusation of criminal misconduct to which he remained silent but rather was simply asked for an appointment for an interview and because pre-arrest silence is admissible under certain circumstances, the defendant has failed to satisfy the first prong of the ineffectiveness test, i.e. that the claim has arguable merit.</blockquote>

It was the elicitation by the prosecution of Appellee’s pre-arrest silence through cross-examination that caused the panel concern. Proceeding from that point, with the erroneous belief that Appellee had not testified at his trial, the panel found merit in the claim that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the salient cross-examination. <em>See <a href="/a2d/751/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="751 A.2d 197" data-case-ids="11509104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0197-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/751/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="751 A.2d 197" data-case-ids="11509104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0197-01">at 202</a>. Furthermore, the panel stated, in a conclusory fashion, that the prejudice resulting from reference to Appellee’s silence was substantial. <em>See <a href="/a2d/751/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="751 A.2d 197" data-case-ids="11509104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0197-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/751/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="751 A.2d 197" data-case-ids="11509104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0197-01">at 202</a>.

Counsel gave inconsistent explanations regarding his failure to object to the relevant cross-examination of the trooper. On the one hand, counsel stated that he felt that an objection could have harmed the defense, particularly in light of his having asked similar questions. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., Oct. 23, 2000, at 20-21. On the other hand, counsel later conceded that he should have asserted an objection and that he could not recall having made any evaluative decision concerning whether or not to do so during the relevant inquiries. <em>See id. </em>at 30-31.</p>

Further, the court, in considering trial counsel’s inconsistent responses regarding his failure to object to the elicitation of references to Appellee’s pre-arrest silence, ultimately concluded that counsel lacked any reasonable basis designed to effectuate Appellee’s interests.

There are more dangers at trial than constitutional ones. However, it is apparent that the responsive evidence counsel invited here was not prejudicial. In addition to the fact that this evidence concerned the pre-arrest phase and was not introduced for the purpose of burdening appellee’s right to remain silent, the evidence in fact did not establish a tacit admission, nor did it otherwise trigger the constitutional concerns which powered the change in the law represented by <em>Doyle, </em><a href="/us/426/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="426 U.S. 610" data-case-ids="6181032" data-case-paths="/us/426/0610-01">426 U.S. 610</a>, <a href="/us/426/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="426 U.S. 610" data-case-ids="6181032" data-case-paths="/us/426/0610-01">96 S.Ct. 2240</a>, <a href="/us/426/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="426 U.S. 610" data-case-ids="6181032" data-case-paths="/us/426/0610-01">49 L.Ed.2d 91</a>, and its progeny. Appellee did not respond to the trooper’s interview request with stony silence, giving rise to an inference of guilt. Instead, he advised the trooper that he wished to consult with a lawyer before speaking with him. Appellee’s lawyer consequently contacted police and relayed “that he had spoke[n] with [appellee] regarding these allegations, and that he [appellee] adamantly denied that they had occurred.” Counsel also advised that he (not appellee) saw no point in his client giving police a statement, since “he already denied the allegations and ... it would just, it would be redundant information.” Thus, appellee’s hindsight second-guessing of counsel in this case involves a strategy which opened the door to the jury learning that, far from remaining “silent” in the face of a criminal accusation and thereby impliedly admitting <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>the accusation, appellee effectively and strongly denied it, albeit through counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

If the jury was prone to speculation, the trial record at best provided a basis for speculating that appellee cooperated with a police investigation, but on his own terms, <em>ie., </em>he elected to speak to police through his lawyer, just as criminal defendants routinely do at trial; unequivocally and vehemently denied the accusation; and declined to speak further. Because the jury here heard evidence of an explicit denial of guilt and not a tacit admission, in my view, the trial court clearly was correct the first time around when it found that the claim of counsel ineffectiveness fails. Since counsel did not do what he was accused of <em>doing—ie., </em>he did not open the door to prejudicial evidence in the form of a tacit admission—the claim of ineffectiveness fails irrespective of counsel’s subjective reasons for questioning the trooper.</p>

It is worth noting that this Court's conclusion of innate prejudice arising from references to the exercise of <em>Miranda </em>rights was based upon assumption, rather than empirical evidence. I am concerned that, in continuing to rely upon this mere assumption, we have strayed from the federal standard and the task of judging. The assumption of prejudice dates to 1972, when the <em>Miranda </em>decision was but six years old, and was based upon a non-controlling Circuit Court decision which was decided even nearer in time to <em>Miranda. See Commonwealth v. Haideman, </em><a href="/pa/449/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="449 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1945637" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0367-01">449 Pa. 367</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="296 A.2d 765">296 A.2d 765</a>, 767 (1972) (" 'We would be naive if we failed to recognize that most laymen view an assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege as a badge of guilt.'

Given the recency of the <em>Miranda </em>decision and its revolutionary effect upon police practice and criminal procedure, perhaps there was a basis for such assumption-based jurisprudence in 1968 and 1972. But, in this day and age, the naiveté consists in accepting that the old assumption arising from the very newness of <em>Miranda </em>should retain validity. In this regard, it is notable that one of the reasons why the U.S. Supreme Court recently declined to reconsider or overrule <em>Miranda </em>was precisely because <em>"Miranda </em>has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture.” <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/us/530/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="530 U.S. 428" data-case-ids="9413869" data-case-paths="/us/530/0428-01">530 U.S. 428</a>, 443, <a href="/us/530/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="530 U.S. 428" data-case-ids="9413869" data-case-paths="/us/530/0428-01">120 S.Ct. 2326</a>, 2336, <a href="/us/530/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="530 U.S. 428" data-case-ids="9413869" data-case-paths="/us/530/0428-01">147 L.Ed.2d 405</a> (2000) (citation omitted). Given the national familiarity with the <em>Miranda </em>incantation, and nightly examples on television and in movies of suspects invoking, or not invoking, their <em>Miranda </em>rights, it defies common sense to unthinkingly assume, and deem determinative, that "most'' laypeople would view an exercise of constitutional rights as a badge of guilt. I would jettison this antiquated assumption and return to judging cases on their merits.</p>

Thus, there were apparent downsides to the strategy in terms of drawing the Commonwealth’s fair response reference to Appellee’s failure to cooperate in the investigation, repetition before the jury of already developed Commonwealth evidence, and fostering of potentially negative impressions that may be associated with assertive examination of a witness at trial, and in particular, one who carries the authority of the state. On the other hand, in the arena of adversarial litigation, occasionally such aggressive tactics will bear fruit.

However, a more concrete weighing, from the appellate perspective, of the strategy, as it relates to the consequence of counsel’s implicating the Commonwealth’s fair-response reference to Appellee’s failure to cooperate in the police investigation, is hampered by the absence of properly focused findings and conclusions from the trial court.

The result was that the panel errantly bifurcated its analysis of trial counsel’s initial strategy choice and his later failure to object to responsive cross-examination. This is particularly significant because the Superior Court held that the initial strategy choice was reasonable, <em>see DiNicola I, </em><a href="/a2d/751/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="751 A.2d 197" data-case-ids="11509104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0197-01">751 A.2d at 200</a>, a conclusion which is fatal to Appellee’s present claim and which could not be disturbed in the course of the remand proceedings in the trial court. However, the Superior Court panel’s approval of counsel’s line of inquiry as supported by a reasonable strategy was via a generalized and conelusory reference to its potential to prove Appellee’s innocence, <em>see <a href="/a2d/751/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="152" data-cite="751 A.2d 197" data-case-ids="11509104" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0197-01">id.,</a> </em>without evaluation of the strategy in terms of its likelihood of achieving that result, or its effect on the availability of an objection to responsive references to Appellee’s silence (about which trial counsel was warned at sidebar).</p>

Indeed, in light of the trial court’s understanding of <em>DiNicola Fs </em>holding, namely, that references to pre-arrest silence were never admissible under any circumstances, it was a relatively simple matter for the court to conclude that counsel should have objected to the Commonwealth’s cross-examination of the trooper which implicated Appellee’s silence.</p>

Moreover, in the absence of a sufficient opinion from the trial court, the <em>DiNicola II </em>court was relegated to speculation in material respects. For example, as the Commonwealth has correctly noted, the reasoning supporting <em>DiNicola II’s </em>finding of prejudice (namely, that the disclosure of Appellee’s pre-arrest silence impeded his remaining silent at trial), is unsupported as of record. In this regard, there is no evidence that the defense trial strategy would have been any different had the disclosure not been made; indeed, as noted, trial counsel explained to the jury that it was essential for Appellee to present his version of the events that occurred in only K.H.’s and his presence. <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>

Particularly since both sides of the question are not presented by the parties, I would refrain from a categorical ruling concerning the obligation of a party suffering an adverse determination concerning one particular line of argument in the intermediate appellate courts to file a petition for allowance of appeal in order to preserve the opportunity for further review of that issue. In this regard, I note that, on the one hand, a remand directive bears hallmarks of an interlocutory decision, as the matter is being returned to the adjudicatory level for production of a record (or supplemental record) predicate to any further appellate review. In light of the potential interdependence of issues, and since at least one issue material to the outcome of the case remains to be decided, concerns for fairness and efficiency militate against requiring a potentially interim and unnecessary appeal. On the other hand, there are instances, as here, in which the intermediate appellate court’s resolution of issues and arguments may integrally affect the scope of the proceedings on remand, thus militating in favor of requiring any contest to occur prior to effectuation of the remand.</p>

While I recognize that the Commonwealth has not pursued this line of waiver argumentation in its brief, I believe that traditional review principles, available to be exercised by this Court of its own accord, permit the Court to look down on the record and determine where the proceedings went awry, and if fault is attributable to the judgment-loser, to uphold the verdict. <em>See supra </em>note 7. Here, I find such approach to be greatly preferable to a merits analysis that is grounded on an incomplete record and out of sync with this Court's long-standing understanding of the effect that jurors in their deliberations may give to evidence of a defendant's silence or assertion of privilege in the face of accusation or questioning.</p>

The <em>per se </em>rule of the Superior Court in <em>Commonwealth v.

The Majority Opinion correctly acknowledges that in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em><a href="/us/485/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="210" data-cite="485 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="13683" data-case-paths="/us/485/0025-01">485 U.S. 25</a>, 32, <a href="/us/485/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="211" data-cite="485 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="13683" data-case-paths="/us/485/0025-01">108 S.Ct. 864</a>, <a href="/us/485/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="212" data-cite="485 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="13683" data-case-paths="/us/485/0025-01">99 L.Ed.2d 23</a> (1988), the United States Supreme Court recognized that a defendant’s silence may be admissible to establish issues in addition to impeachment that arise in a criminal proceeding.

    <p id="b668-7" data-blocks='[["BL_668.7",668,[260,1370,1152,572]]]'>Although I completely agree with the extension of the fair response doctrine to include evidence concerning pre-arrest silence, I dissent from the determination to reverse the Order of the Superior Court and reinstate the judgment of sentence. I dissent because I believe that the majority uses the inadequate record in this matter to make a determination on the merits, finding that Appellee suffered no prejudice. Because many mistakes were made during every level of the proceedings to date, I believe that it is imperative to remand for an evidentiary hearing to conduct a rigorous analysis of Appellee’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b668-8" data-blocks='[["BL_668.8",668,[258,1995,1155,363]]]'>The majority notes that Appellee raised two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The first one is that trial counsel erred by not objecting to the testimony regarding his pre-arrest silence. Because pre-arrest silence is admissible as fair response, the failure of trial counsel to object to its admission does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. I agree with the majority’s resolution of this first issue.</p>

      <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>My dissent regards the majority’s disposition of Appellee’s second claim, which posits that counsel erred by opening the door for the prosecution to introduce evidence of his prearrest silence. The majority opines that “this claim of ineffectiveness can be definitively resolved by going directly to a consideration of prejudice.” Majority Opinion at 561-63, 866 A.2d at 336 (internal citation omitted). I respectfully disagree that this Court can review the issue of prejudice on this record, and I believe that this matter must be remanded to the trial court. On remand, the trial court would now have the benefit of clear direction from this Court, which finds that pre-arrest silence is admissible as fair response and that the failure of trial counsel to object to its admission does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the trial court would have to determine whether counsel was ineffective for opening the door to the admission. I believe that this claim must be resolved on the merits, and that, contrary to the disposition of the majority, it is impossible to do this with the existing record.</p>
    <p id="b669-5" data-blocks='[["BL_669.4",669,[145,1345,1151,736]]]'>The majority describes the labyrinthine procedural path traversed by this matter. To illustrate, Appellee filed a post-sentence motion alleging ineffectiveness of counsel for, <em>inter alia, </em>opening the door to the testimony revealing the prearrest silence. As a result, “[a] hearing on the matter was scheduled; however, the original record presented to this court, contains no transcript of an evidentiary hearing at this stage or any other reference that would indicate whether or not it was actually conducted.” Majority Opinion at 555-56, 866 A.2d at 332 (footnote omitted). “The common pleas court did not separately assess the allegations of ineffectiveness; rather, it reached a global conclusion that there was no merit to the allegations of ineffectiveness and denied relief.” <em>Id. </em>at 555-56, 866 A.2d at 332.</p>

Majority Opinion at 556-58, 866 A.2d at 333. At this hearing, counsel gave inconsistent explanations regarding his failure to object to cross-examination of the Trooper, and the trial court determined that all three prongs of the ineffectiveness inquiry were met and that a new trial must be awarded for Appellee.</p>

Appellee’s constitutional right to remain silent may well have been implicated and he may have suffered prejudice as a result of the evidence concerning his pre-arrest silence. The majority concludes that Appellee’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was not violated by reference to his pre-arrest silence. Majority Opinion at 552-53, 866 A.2d at 330. I share the perspective of the Superior Court majority that “[w]hen the Commonwealth referenced DiNicola’s pre-arrest silence prior to DiNicola testifying, the Commonwealth removed an incentive for DiNicola to assert his right not to testify.” <em>DiNicola II, </em><a href="/a2d/797/0966-01" class="citation" data-index="216" data-cite="797 A.2d 966" data-case-ids="9435526" data-case-paths="/a2d/797/0966-01">797 A.2d at 972</a>.

Like the majority in <em>DiNicola II, </em>I believe that the prejudice resulting from the reference to prearrest silence could have been significant and may have been a motivating factor in Appellee’s decision to forego his Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>

Appellee declined to meet with him, saying that he wanted to consult his attorney. Later, the attorney contacted the Trooper, telling him that Appellee denied any inappropriate conduct, but that, on advice of counsel, would assert his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent at any police interview. Whether or not appropriate on their part, I believe that the jury might well have expected an innocent person to deny involvement in the offenses involving the child victim, rather than to assert his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, and that evidence of Appellee’s refusal to speak with the Trooper and failure to deny the allegations in that conversation could well have prejudiced him. The majority recognizes that the panel in <em>DiNicola I </em>found that “the prejudice resulting from reference to Appellee’s silence was substantial.” Majority Opinion at 556-58, 866 A.2d at <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>333.
