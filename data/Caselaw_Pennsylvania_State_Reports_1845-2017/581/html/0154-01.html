Burghardt, a twenty-nine-year-old white female, weighing 225 to 240 pounds, resided alone at that address, a one-bedroom, first-floor apartment in a residential neighborhood. She told the police that someone had entered her apartment between 11:00 p.m. Tuesday and 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, when she returned from taking a friend home. Burghardt noticed that a fan, which she left on before leaving the apartment, had been turned off, the patio door she had left open was closed, and the screen on the door, which was locked, had been ripped about six to eight inches, just enough to get a hand through, near the locking mechanism. Burghardt also reported that $40 to $50 was missing from a bank bag in her dresser drawer. In all other respects, Burghardt reported her apartment appeared to have been undisturbed.</p>
    <p id="b260-6" data-blocks='[["BL_260.6",260,[261,1638,1151,573]],["BL_261.1",261,[143,320,1148,249]]]'>At approximately 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, August 9, 1992, Burghardt’s neighbor telephoned the police to complain that: (1) Burghardt’s stereo had been on for three days and nights; (2) no one answered the doorbell; (3) the screen had been out of the window for three nights; and (4) during one of those nights it had sounded like somebody was beating Burghardt up, hitting the walls, and screaming. When the police arrived at Burghardt’s apartment they noticed the screen for the front of the apartment was on the ground leaning upright next to the front window, the window was open, and the screen for the rear window was pushed out and lying on the ground beneath <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>that window, which was also open. The screen on the patio door was cut about six inches long next to the door handle. The television was blaring loudly and the front door and the patio door were locked. The patio screen door was closed but not locked.</p>
    <p id="b261-5" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[142,605,1155,527]]]'>Upon entering the apartment, the police found Burghardt dead, lying on her stomach on the living room floor in front of her couch. There was a large amount of blood on the couch, walls, and floor. She was beaten severely about the head. Aside from where the body was found, the apartment appeared to be neat and orderly. With the exception of the screens, there were no pry marks on the doors or windows or other evidence of forced entry. The police concluded that the perpetrator entered the residence through the front window and exited through the rear window.</p>
    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[142,1159,1151,473]]]'>At the time of her death, Burghardt was wearing a sleep shirt and a pair of jockey shorts that were ripped at the crotch and pulled up. She was unclothed from her hips down. A dresser drawer in the bedroom was open and a pair of black shorts was on the floor. There were blood spots and white stains on the back of the shorts. A peach-colored shirt was located on the closet door. It contained a lot of blood in distinctive patterns that appeared to have been made by swipe marks from whatever was used as the murder weapon.</p>
    <p id="b261-7" data-blocks='[["BL_261.6",261,[141,1660,1151,463]]]'>The subsequent autopsy revealed that Burghardt had been sexually assaulted and bludgeoned to death by thirty-seven individual blunt force injuries to her scalp, causing extensive skull fractures and damage to the brain. The weapon was a circular, cylindrical instrument about one-half to three-quarter inches in diameter with a smooth surface and about ten to twenty inches long. The force of the blows was so deliberate and tremendous that, as the instrument came down, it embedded hair between the fracture and skull.</p>
    <p id="b261-8" data-blocks='[["BL_261.7",261,[141,2159,1151,204]],["BL_262.1",262,[253,322,1153,458]]]'>Burghardt also had defensive injuries on both hands, evidencing that she was alive and attempting to protect herself from her assailant. Serology tests established that all of the blood and hair found at the scene, including those samples <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>found on the black shorts and peach colored shirt, were consistent with those of the victim. However, the shorts had seminal stains on the outside, as though someone had ejaculated onto them. Tests of the semen stains on the shorts showed the deoxyribonucleic (DNA) profiles that were later matched to the DNA profiles obtained from Appellant’s blood.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> An analysis of the blood spattering at the crime scene indicated the perpetrator was approximately 5'10" tall and stood over the victim during the attack.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[251,804,1157,935]]]'>Approximately ten months later, at about 6:45 a.m. on Wednesday, June 9, 1993, Allentown police responded to a call of a reported missing person at 1058 East Gordon Street, a residential neighborhood, also on the East Side of Allentown. A resident became suspicious when the normally punctual newspaper. delivery girl, Charlotte Schmoyer (Schmoyer), failed to deliver the newspaper. Her newspaper cart was left unattended for approximately thirty minutes in front of a neighbor’s house and the newspaper had been delivered to another neighbor. Upon their arrival, the police found the unattended newspaper cart half-filled with the day’s newspapers in front of the house; a separate copy of the newspaper; a Walkman radio and its headset separated from each other on the ground between two houses; and finger streaks on the windowpane of the door to the nearby garage of one of the houses. Police concluded that a struggle had ensued and Schmoyer, a fifteen-year-old white female, weighing Í80 pounds, had been abducted.</p>
    <p id="b262-5" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[251,1763,1155,464]],["BL_263.1",263,[135,323,1157,590]]]'>Later that day, while searching a heavily wooded area at Allentown’s nearby East Side Reservoir (Reservoir), the police found a bloody trail that led them to the body of Schmoyer, which was buried beneath some logs. Her sweatshirt was slightly pulled up; her sweatpants and underpants had been pulled down toward her knees. She had a large, gaping wound in her throat, separate stab wounds below that gash, multiple stab wounds on her back, and a patterned bruise on the right side of her cheek. An autopsy revealed twenty-two <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>stab wounds, sixteen in the back (including seven that were fatal), and six in the front area of the neck (of which any combination of one or three would have been fatal). In addition, there were cutting and scraping wounds in the neck area, indicating they were inflicted while the victim was conscious and her neck bent down as a protective measure, and seven more cuts to the back of the sweatshirt, indicating that some struggle occurred in that the sweatshirt was cut but the body was not penetrated. The weapon was a single-edged knife about four inches long. At least two of the wounds were up to the hilt of the blade.</p>
    <p id="b263-4" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[134,957,1158,753]]]'>Subsequent serology and DNA tests indicated that Schmoyer had intercourse shortly before death. Appellant’s DNA was found on her vaginal swab and blood consistent with that of Appellant and inconsistent with that of Schmoyer’s blood, was found on her sweatshirt and sweatpants, along the trail leading to her body, and on leaves at the crime scene near her head.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> All of the blood found on or about Schmoyer was consistent with that of either Schmoyer or Appellant; none of the blood was inconsistent with one of their profiles. A comparison of a hair found on the right knee of Schmoyer was consistent with hair from Appellant’s head and inconsistent with Schmoyer’s own hair; and a comparison of a hair found on the sweatshirt of Schmoyer was consistent with Appellant’s pubic hair and, again, inconsistent with Schmoyer’s own hair.</p>
    <p id="b263-5" data-blocks='[["BL_263.5",263,[121,1753,1168,532]]]'>On June 28, 1993, Denise Sam-Cali (Sam-Cali), a thirty-eight-year-old white female weighing 160 to 165 pounds, and ■ her husband resided at 1141 East Highland Street, on Allentown’s East Side. That evening she was home alone; her husband was out of town. She awoke during the night to noises from within a walk-in closet near her bedroom door. As Sam-Cali attempted to flee the house, an assailant grabbed her. She exited the house, but the assailant grabbed her again on the front walk, flipped her on her back, and got on top of her using his knees to hold her down.</p>

      <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>As Sam-Cali and the assailant began to fight, he pushed down on her mouth, choked her, and punched her face at least four times. She tried to punch him and bit him on the inside of his upper right arm. He raped her and then ran through the house to escape by way of the back patio-door. After-wards, Sam-Cali called the police. She had been beaten severely about the head, her neck had strangulation marks, and her lip was slashed. A large butcher knife wrapped in a paper napkin from her kitchen was found lying on the floor outside of her bathroom door. Following this incident, Sam-Cali and her husband left their East Allentown residence for a few days.</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[262,998,1152,634]]]'>Approximately two weeks later, shortly after 7:00 a.m. on July 14, 1993, Jessica Jean Fortney (Fortney), a forty-seven-year-old white female, weighing 235 pounds, who resided with other members of her family at 407 North Bryan Street, on Allentown’s East Side, was found dead in her bed. Fortney was half-naked; her shorts and underpants were pulled down mid-way between her knee and groin area and around only one thigh. Her face was swollen and black. She had dried blood about her lips, eye, nose, nostrils, and neck. There was blood spatter on the wall directly behind the sofa and on the lampshade next to the sofa. The window on the first floor was open; there was no screen in it.</p>
    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[261,1674,1152,688]],["BL_265.1",265,[141,322,1151,97]]]'>The autopsy revealed that Fortney died in the early morning hours as a result of suffocation by strangulation (probably manual) and blunt trauma. There were in excess of fifty different injury patterns, many of them compatible with being beaten by a closed fist about the face. Some of them indicated an object, such as a ring, on her assailant’s hands. Other injury patterns revealed that Fortney’s attacker placed his knees on her during the beating, causing her blood to spatter on the wall, lampshade, and him. Serology tests established that Fortney had sexual intercourse within a few hours of her death. It was later determined that Fortney and Appellant had different blood profiles. Blood and body fluids from Fortney’s vaginal swabs were consistent with Appellant’s pro<a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>file and seminal fluid from Fortney’s vaginal swabs matched Appellant’s DNA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[142,444,1151,357]]]'>Four days after the Fortney homicide, on the evening of July 18, 1998, Sam-Cali and her husband returned home. At about 4:00 a.m. the next morning, Sam-Cali heard a noise in the house and then the back door opened. Thereafter, the alarm went off. The intruder apparently fled. From that night on, an Allentown police officer stayed at the Sam-Cali residence.</p>
    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[140,836,1152,688]]]'>At approximately 1:25 a.m. on July 31, 1993, Officer Brian Lewis (Officer Lewis), who was at the Sam-Cali home, heard the doors being jarred and noticed someone at the front window. The officer saw the fingertips of a black-gloved hand removing the screen to the window. He then saw a head, and then the rest of the body, enter the home. When the intruder was fully inside the home, the officer challenged him. The intruder went to the kitchen and shots were exchanged. The officer retreated to the bedroom, where he heard banging and ripping at the kitchen door. Upon returning to the kitchen, the officer found the kitchen empty. The intruder escaped by breaking through several glass panels on a wooden door and pushing out the rear storm door.</p>
    <p id="b265-6" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[141,1551,1152,743]],["BL_266.1",266,[255,321,1151,145]]]'>At about 3:30 or 3:45 a.m., Officer Lewis was called to a local hospital where he identified Appellant as the intruder at the Sam-Cali home earlier that evening. Appellant had fresh, bleeding wounds to both of his arms and legs. He also had a healing scar of a bite mark several weeks old on his upper right arm. Later that day, the police obtained blood and hair samples from Appellant and searched his residence, where they found: (1) a black ski mask and a pair of gloves under the sofa cushions; (2) several drops of blood and a soaked, green-and-purple striped rugby-type shirt in the laundry; (3) additional blood in the bathroom; (4) additional pairs of gloves, including a pair of large black rubber gloves; (5) blood stained shorts and socks; (6) a pair of black high-tech sneakers in Appellant’s bedroom; and (7) a loaded .380 semi<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>automatic handgun in the bedroom closet, which used to belong to the Sam-Calis prior to its disappearance some time before July 31, 1993.</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[254,490,1154,412]]]'>The head stamp on the upper most cartridge in the handgun was identical with that on the empty cartridge casings found at the Sam-Cali house earlier that morning. Officer Lewis identified the horizontal striped shirt, shorts, sneakers, black knit cap, and rubber gloves found at Appellant’s house, as those worn by the intruder at the Sam-Cali residence. Further, Sam-Cali identified Appellant as the person who assaulted and raped her.</p>
    <p id="b266-6" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[254,926,1156,468]]]'>It was later established that the patterned design of the bruise on Schmoyer’s cheek was consistent with the size, design, and wear characteristics of the high-tech sneaker-seized from Appellant’s bedroom. There was no evidence found to exclude the possibility that the injury on her face was caused by Appellant’s sneaker. Similarly, chevron patterns found on the Walkman radio that belonged to Schmoyer and found at the scene of her disappearance corresponded with the shape and spacing of Appellant’s sneaker.</p>

At that time, Appellant told the officers that he drove his two-door Chrysler Laser automobile, and that he never drove his mother’s four-door blue Ford Tempo automobile, license plate number ZGP260, except to look for jobs. In fact, at approximately 3:45 a.m. on September 7, 1992, a little less than one month after Burghardt’s death, an Allentown police officer made a traffic stop of the blue Ford Tempo that Appellant was operating. On June 3, 1993, another Allentown police officer stopped the blue Ford Tempo at 2:40 a.m. and Appellant, its operator, was cited for driving the wrong way on a one-way street. At about 6:25 a.m. on the day of Schmoyer’s abduction and death, June 9, 1993, James Stengel, an Allentown City employee at the Reservoir, saw a blue, four-door automobile (which he later identified as a Ford Tempo) with damage to its right side in the Reservoir parking lot. At about 6:40 a.m. on that day, a carpenter on his way to work identified Appellant as operating a blue automobile and acting strangely only three <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>blocks from the Reservoir. Finally, at about 3:30 a.m. on July 31, 1993, when he sought treatment at the hospital after the last Sam-Cali incident, Appellant was in possession of the blue Ford Tempo automobile, license plate ZGP260, with right side body damage. This automobile- was owned by Appellant’s mother and was registered to 709 North Kearney Street. Blood patterns subsequently found in the vehicle were later determined to be from Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[136,752,1158,1042]]]'>Additional evidence also established that Appellant resided at 709 North Kearney Street, Allentown, in August of 1992, when Joan Burghardt was murdered, until September 23, 1992, and again from May 14, 1993, until his arrest on July 31, 1993, during which time Schmoyer and Fortney were murdered and Sam-Cali assaulted. Appellant did not reside in, or visit, Lehigh County between September 23, 1992, and May 14, 1993, because, during this period of time, he was detained in a juvenile placement facility on an unrelated charge. Appellant’s residence at 709 North Kearney Street is about: (1) four blocks from 1057 East Gordon Street, where Schmoyer was abducted, and about one mile from the Reservoir where her body was found; (2) five blocks from 1430 East Gordon Street, where Burghardt lived and was murdered; (3) five or six blocks from 1141 East Highland Street, where Sam-Cali resided and was assaulted; and (4) two miles from 407 North Bryan Street, where Fortney lived and was murdered.

The photograph of Schmoyer’s cheek portrayed the pattern injury which was later determined to have been caused-by a sneaker. It was used in conjunction with the testimony regarding footwear impressions to compare the pattern injury reflected on the photograph with the impression made by the sneaker found at [Appellant’s home. A photograph was cropped so that the gaping neck wound was not observable. Photographs of the Fortney crime scene demonstrated the intent and malice used to kill her. Finally, the photographs of Sam-Cali again demonstrated the brutality of the assault which could be compared with the brutality used in the other cases, particularly as to Fortney.

To facilitate appellate review of this case, by Opinion and Order of August 28, 2001, the trial court designated Appellant's convictions pursuant to Information Nos. 0055/1994 (relating to the Burghardt homicide) and 0056/1994 (relating to the Schmoyer homicide), where it vacated the sentence of death, eligible for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b). We granted allowance of appeal in those cases. Thus, in the present matter Appellant challenges: (1) the guilt determinations concerning his convictions in relation to murders of Burghardt, Schmoyer, and Fortney; and (2) the sentence of death for the Fortney homicide.</p>

In analyzing and ultimately rejecting this claim, the majority cites to this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Colson, </em><a href="/pa/507/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="378" data-cite="507 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1792370" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0440-01">507 Pa. 440</a>, <a href="/pa/507/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="379" data-cite="507 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1792370" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0440-01">490 A.2d 811</a>, 818 (1985), where the Court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss a venireperson for cause even though that venireperson, among other things, knew the victim’s mother, knew the prosecution witness who discovered the victim’s body, knew the wife of the prosecuting officer, and believed that the victim had actually once employed her husband. While I recognize this Court’s duty to adhere to the principle of <em>stare decisis, </em>I am compelled to note that I simply do not agree with the <em>Colson </em>court’s conclusion. Rather, it is abundantly clear, at least to me, that the nature of the venireperson’s many ties to those involved in that case created a sufficient likelihood of bias so as to warrant the venireperson’s disqualification. <em>Id. </em>at 818 (“A challenge for cause should be granted when the prospective juror has such a close relationship, familial, financial, or situational, with the parties, counsel, victims, or witnesses, that the court will presume a likelihood of prejudice or demonstrates a likelihood of prejudice by his or her conduct and answers to question[s].”). Nevertheless, I do not believe that the relevant facts in the instant case are even remotely similar to those in <em>Colson, </em>as none of the venirepersons at issue here had the same type of relationship to the case as the venireperson in <em>Colson </em>had. Indeed, in my view, the situations of the venirepersons in the instant case are much more akin to the situation of the venireperson in <em>Commonwealth v. Patterson, </em><a href="/pa/488/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="380" data-cite="488 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="1761009" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0227-01">488 Pa. 227</a>, <a href="/pa/488/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="381" data-cite="488 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="1761009" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0227-01">412 A.2d 481</a> (1980), who recognized one of the investigating officers from church services, but could not identify the officer by name.

I question the decision by the court not to ask the jurors about the article, especially in light of this Court’s clear pronouncement in <em>Commonwealth v.

In the end, however, I believe that any error that resulted from the court’s failure to question the jurors about the article was merely harmless as the evidence of Appellant’s guilt was clearly overwhelming. Thus, I agree with the majority that Appellant is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>

Indeed, since Ms. Sam-Cali’s testimony relating to the sexual nature of her attack was derived solely from the hypnotic session, it was plainly inadmissible under <em>Smoyer’s </em>second criterion. <em>See Smoyer, </em>505 Pa. at 87, 476 A.2d at 1306. Notably, the trial court acknowledged as much. <em>See </em>Opinion on Post-Sentence Motions, <em>slip op. </em>at 33 (finding that, aside from the notice requirement, none of the other <em>Smoyer </em>requirements were satisfied). I also have difficulty with the majority’s finding of neutrality for purposes of <em>Smoyer </em>on the part of a hypnotist who is a member of the law enforcement community. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 221-24, 864 A.2d at 500-01.

The weight of the evidence presented, and not the ability to “count” the catch-all mitigator, is the dispositive factor in the death penalty statutes qualitative approach to the selection determination in capital sentencing. <em>See generally </em>42 Pa.C.S. 9711(c)(4). Accordingly, and in light of the broad range of mitigation evidence which may fall under the umbrella of the catch-all circumstance, I believe that the ineffectiveness inquiry pertaining to the asserted failure to present adequate mitigation should generally entail a comparison of the mitigation evidence that was presented in the penalty phase of trial in relation to that which the defendant later claims should have been presented. <em>Accord Commonwealth v.

At trial, counsel presented friends and family members who testified that Appellant was loyal, helpful, and companionable. Trial counsel also presented testimony from Appellant’s brother, who testified to his conversion to Islam and positive developments arising in his life as a result, and prison authorities who testified to Appellant’s positive prison record.

To the extent that additional information is supplied, upon review, I do not consider it is as being of such a character or weight that it would have likely affected the penalty verdict, particularly taking into consideration the evidence that was actually presented. Additionally, deference is due to the common pleas court’s acceptance of counsel’s testimony that there was a strategic decision to curtail the presentation of character-based evidence, in light of substantial rebuttal evidence that was available to the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Opinion on Post-Sentence Motions, <em>slip op. </em>at 56-57.</p>

Moreover, the Court has an independent obligation in capital cases to review the record to ensure that the verdict was not the product of <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3).

Also in tension with <em>Morris </em>is the majority’s reliance on evidence discretely proving each offense individually, for example, the presence of Appellant’s DNA at each crime scene, to bolster its consolidation analysis. The presence of semen at each of three rape/murder scenes is not, in and of itself, reflective of a distinct method of operation any more than, for example, a fingerprint would be; rather, it is the discrete process of identification of the individual DNA samples found at each crime scene that creates the compelling comparison. The <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>majority opinion also appears to incorporate a tendency in the decisional law to conflate the “identity” and “common scheme or plan” exceptions to the general rule against consolidation. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 193-94, 864 A.2d at 483. My preference, however, would be to preserve the distinctions that arise out of the design and function of the exceptions. <em>See generally </em>Packel and Poulin, Pennsylvania Evidence 404-9(5), (6) (explaining the relevant distinctions).</p>
      <p id="b345-6" data-blocks='[["BL_345.2",345,[171,1004,1120,587]]]'>Finally, it should also be noted that the admission of other acts evidence requires an assessment of the probative value of the evidence versus its prejudicial effect. <em>See Commonwealth v. Billa, </em><a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="402" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">521 Pa. 168</a>, 177-78, <a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="403" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">555 A.2d 835</a>, 840 (1989); <em>accord </em>Pa.R.E. 404(b)(3). Applying this analysis, again, I view this as a very close case in terms of the trial court's judgment in permitting the joinder, particularly in a capital case in which it was known that the jurors would be called upon to assess different aggravating circumstances in relation to the separate crimes. Moreover, a demonstration of an evidentiary need is integral to the probative value versus prejudicial effect assessment. <em>See Billa, </em><a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="404" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">521 Pa. at 178</a>, 555 A.2d at 840. Here, the joinder was premised, in significant part, as bearing upon the perpetrator’s identity. The existence of DNA evidence in relation to each separate offense, however, diminishes the value of, and accordingly the necessity for, joinder (and the admission of other crimes evidence) in this regard.</p>

Also related to <em>voir dire, </em>based on a typographical error in Appellant’s brief, the majority declines to review his claim that his counsel erroneously conceded in jury selection that the case involved first-degree murders. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 212-14, 864 A.2d at 495. Since, however, the transcript reference to counsel's statement is discernable in conjunction with this Court's independent review of the record, <em>see </em>N.T.

On the merits, while counsel’s comment was directed to a juror who became seated at Appellant’s trial, I believe that its context made it sufficiently ambiguous as to whether counsel was referring to the charges lodged against Appellant to negate Appellant’s ability to demonstrate prejudice, particularly in light of the defense presented and the trial court's instructions in the trial that followed.</p>

Appellant, however, does not raise the spillover prejudice claim in relation to these photographs (in a separate argument, Appellant does separately claim that the prejudicial effect of the photographs outweighed their probative value, <em>see </em>Appellant's Brief at 82; this claim, however, is not focused on the spillover aspect, but rather, on the threshold admissibility issue in relation to the purpose for which the evidence was offered in the first instance).</p>
