As it concerns the penalty phase, Appellant contends that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object: (1) to the trial court's intermittent use of plural and singular form of the word "circumstance” during the jury instructions; (2) to a comment made by the prosecutor during the penalty phase closing argument indicating that Appellant had shown no remorse for the murder; and (3) to an allegedly erroneous instruction given by the trial court, which allowed the jury to consider the testimony of Norma Winn and Loretta Johnson as "victim impact evidence.”</p>

Unlike the procedural posture in <em>Summerlin, </em>however, in the present case, <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Ring </em>were decided after Appellant’s trial, but before the direct review of the conviction and sentence was finalized. As the U.S. Supreme Court reiterated in <em>Summerlin, </em>”[w]hen a decision of this Court results in a ‘new rule,' that rule applies to all criminal cases still pending on direct review.” <em>Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. at -, 124 S.Ct. at 2522 (citing <em>Griffith v.

In other words, the Majority’s tautological conclusion that “constitutionality” and “sentencing legality” are implicated by this waived claim begs the predicate and controlling question of retroactivity. It is no answer to the retroactivity question to postulate: “but if the rule was retroactively operable here, and if the derivative claim here did have merit”—two essential predicates that are missing—“appellant would be posing a constitutional claim which implicated sentencing ‘legality’ and would therefore not be waivable.”</p>

If today’s Majority is correct that constitutional claims affecting sentencing “implicate the legality of th[e] sentence [and] ... cannot be waived,” op. at 600-01 n. 32, 866 A.2d at 360 n. 32, then <em>Cox’s </em>holding that a <em>Mills </em>claim is waivable cannot stand close scrutiny. Although <em>Cox </em>was a PCRA appeal, and this is a direct appeal, that distinction cannot harmonize the cases. The same assumed “illegality” that defeats direct appeal waiver presumably would defeat PCRA waiver: facially “illegal” sentences do not become “legal” with the mere passage of time.</p>

Criminal trials should be evaluated according to the law as it existed at the time they were tried, unless the defendant anticipated and requested a new proce<a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>dural rule which was embraced before his conviction became final, or the new rule is of such watershed dimension that it has been deemed retroactively applicable to prior cases irrespective of doctrines of waiver, previous litigation etc. The difficulties this Court has had in coming to grips with the meaning of its “illegal sentence” doctrine should not change the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court, which devised the new rule at issue, has not deemed it of such watershed importance as to implicate the very “legality” of all existing death sentences. The practical meaning of the Court’s non-retroactivity decision in <em>Summerlin </em>is that death verdicts which were returned before the new rule in <em>Ring </em>were not—not even arguably—rendered “illegal.” I would defer to the High Court’s judgment concerning the nature and proper scope of its new rule.</p>

Our <em>ad hoc, </em>issue by issue, return to the doctrine—in a footnote no less in this case—will create as much havoc as did the former rule. It is particularly ill-advised to reestablish the doctrine in a case such as this, where it allows for a concluded and proper trial to be evaluated by a new rule which did not exist and did not govern at the time of the trial. Although the ultimate result in this case causes no immediate harm, since Pennsylvania’s capital sentencing scheme obviously comports with <em>Ring, </em>the very approach itself is flawed and may well work arbitrary havoc when the next new rule is at issue.</p>

As I have noted above, unless a new procedural rule is the sort of watershed rule of criminal procedure which the U.S. Supreme Court has held is entitled to “full” retroactive effect, the presumption should remain that retroactive application is available only where the defendant preserved the specific argument and his case is still pending on direct appeal. In this regard, it is notable that, for purposes of federal habeas corpus review of state convictions, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the fact that this Court employed relaxed waiver to reach a claim belatedly raised under <em>Mills v.

In a later appeal in the <em>Banks </em>case, the High Court reversed the Third Circuit a second time, holding that <em>Mills </em>was a new procedural rule; that it was not subject to retroactive application; and thus it could not be employed to overturn a Pennsylvania conviction which was secured <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>before <em>Mills </em>was decided. <em>See Beard v.

In construing relaxed waiver, I think this Court should employ a similar approach: a new procedural rule of federal constitutional law should be deemed retroactively applicable only in instances where the U.S. Supreme Court would require it to so operate. Since this case does not pose such an instance, this Court should not reach the merits of appellant’s belated <em>Ring </em>claim.</p>

The Majority apparently seeks to dilute the effect of the <em>Cabeza/Tilley </em>principle by characterizing it as merely ''customary.” The cases do not speak of, much less do they establish, mere judicial "customs.” The rule reflected in <em>Cabeza/Tilley </em>is a salutary principle of retroactivity law. In our system of jurisprudence, trials are the main event, not mere costly and time-consuming previews or dry-runs. A party, such as appellant here, who would seek to upset a judgment premised upon a new rule of procedure may properly be asked to show that he sought, but was denied, that relief at the point where such relief may effectively have been granted.</p>
