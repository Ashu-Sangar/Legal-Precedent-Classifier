Aside from the affidavit of appellant’s present counsel, there is no evidence in the record concerning appellant’s alleged incompetence during collateral review, and appellant makes no proffer as to any evidence which exists in support of this claim; the only expert reports or medical evidence appellant refers to is that relevant to his mental condition at the time of trial. Further, he does not aver facts which would entitle him <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>to an evidentiary hearing on this issue.

Thus, when first PCRA counsel failed to raise certain issues, appellant was not on notice that counsel’s failure would lead to an eventual time-bar of those claims. In a related vein, appellant further claims that depriving him of a mechanism to vindicate his “enforceable right” to effective assistance of PCRA counsel violates due process. These are nothing more than thinly-veiled attempts to utilize counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness to circumvent the time-bar, a tactic which has been flatly rejected by this Court. <em>See Commonwealth v. Davis, </em><a href="/a2d/816/1129-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="816 A.2d 1129" data-case-ids="9371084" data-case-paths="/a2d/816/1129-01">816 A.2d 1129</a>, 1135 (Pa.Super.2003) (attempts to escape PCRA’s jurisdictional time-bar by alleging ineffectiveness of counsel regularly rejected by courts) (collecting cases).

Recently, in <em>Commonwealth v. Santiago, </em><a href="/a2d/855/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="855 A.2d 682" data-case-ids="12254641,1370929" data-case-paths="/a2d/855/0682-01,/pa/579/0046-01">855 A.2d 682</a> (Pa.2004), a plurality of our Court noted that a defendant could not waive averments of incompetency in recognition that the very state of incompetency could impair one’s ability to recognize and raise the issue. <em>See also, Commonwealth v. Marshall, </em><a href="/pa/456/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="456 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="584419" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0313-01">456 Pa. 313</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20724" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="318 A.2d 724">318 A.2d 724</a> (1974) (stating that it would be contradictory to argue that a defendant may be incompetent, and yet knowingly and intelligently waive his right to have the court determine his capacity to stand trial). An analogous Catch 22 could be applicable in cases where the Commonwealth is aware of exculpatory information which a defendant cannot understand or articulate because of mental illness. In such situations, it is, in my view, the Commonwealth’s responsibility “to assess a defendant’s shortcomings as a client” to the extent such shortcomings arise from emotional or mental health disorders, and to make disclosures regarding defendant’s history in recognition thereof. While in this case there is no indication of a <em>Brady </em>violation, under the circumstances referenced herein, there may, indeed, be.</p>
