As the victim was walking through the school playground, she encountered Appellant, who was 16 years, 11 <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>months, and 24 days old, and whom she knew through an aunt. Appellant took the victim to a nearby vacant house at 1617 Olive Street in Philadelphia, where he forcibly removed her pants and underwear, attempted vaginal intercourse, and engaged in anal intercourse. Appellant then choked the victim to death, gathered flammable material from the room, placed it on top of her, and with a cigarette lighter, set the material on fire. At some point, Appellant also used the lighter to begin burning his nickname, “Peanut,” on the ceiling of the room, writing “PEA.”</p>
    <p id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[138,862,1151,730]]]'>At 10:30 a.m. that morning, police and fire personnel responded to a fire at the Olive Street address. Inside, police found the victim’s partially burned body lying on the floor with her legs spread apart. Detectives investigating the scene observed that the victim’s underwear and pants were tom, with blood running from her vaginal area, and noticed the letters burned into the ceiling of the room. A medical examination of the victim revealed bruising and tearing of her vaginal and anal areas and soft tissue braising of her neck, but no indication of smoke inhalation. The medical examiner concluded that the victim’s injuries were consistent with the attempted penetration of her vagina and the actual penetration of her rectum, and that she died from manual strangulation.</p>
    <p id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.5",377,[136,1617,1151,616]]]'>The murder went unsolved for approximately ten months. Then, on January 5, 1980, Appellant attacked a 13-year-old girl, M.O., grabbing her from behind and forcing her into a vacant house. Appellant ordered M.O. to undress and perform oral sex, after which, he choked her until she was unconscious. M.O. awoke in a closet a few minutes later and reported the assault to police, who presented her with a photographic array that included a picture of Appellant. M.O. identified Appellant, and an arrest warrant was issued. Upon executing the warrant at Appellant’s home, police noticed that the word “PEANUT” had been burned into the ceiling of his bedroom.</p>

As he was a juvenile, Appellant was <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>accompanied by two of his uncles; he was also advised of his constitutional rights. Appellant confessed to the assault of M.O. and, noting the similarities between that assault and the present matter,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the detectives who were investigating the homicide of Ms. Graham advised Appellant that they would like to question him about her death. After being informed of his constitutional rights a second time, Appellant initially denied any involvement in Ms. Graham’s death. Later in the interview, however, Appellant admitted that he had sexually assaulted and killed Ms. Graham. The following day, Appellant was again interviewed regarding the Graham homicide; on this occasion, he was accompanied by one of his uncles, was apprised of his constitutional rights, and again confessed to the crimes.</p>
    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[249,1064,1157,672]]]'>Shortly after his arrest, and in connection with whether he should be prosecuted as an adult for charges involving M.O., Appellant was evaluated by a court appointed psychologist, Clare Wilson, PhiD. In her report, Dr. Wilson noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that: Appellant was functionally illiterate; his comprehension, social judgment, and reasoning were deficient; his thinking was concrete and stereotypical; his full scale intelligence quotient was in the low average range; and mild brain damage could not be conclusively ruled out.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Ultimately, the charges involving M.O. were transferred to the criminal court. Appellant also unsuccessfully moved for decertification in the present matter, seeking to have the charges prosecuted in juvenile court.</p>

Although the initial psychiatric evaluations of Appellant indicated that he did not suffer from a major mental illness,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> he was prescribed a conservative <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>amount of Thorazine, an antipsychotic medication. Some months later, Appellant’s condition improved, and he was found fit to stand trial following a competency hearing.</p>
    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[130,495,1158,1864]],["BL_380.1",380,[261,320,1146,96]]]'>Thereafter, Appellant moved to suppress evidence and his statements. Prior to the hearing on that matter, counsel for Appellant orally requested a further competency examination, which was granted. Appellant was evaluated by Edwin Camiel, M.D., a psychiatrist employed with the Psychiatric Unit of the Probation Department of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, who testified at the ensuing competency hearing that Appellant showed no psychiatric abnormality and appeared to have a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings. Dr. Camiel noted, however, that Appellant exhibited some evidence of concrete thinking, and that he had reported hearing voices telling him to commit suicide. Dr. Camiel concluded, nevertheless, that Appellant was not so psychologically impaired that he could not proceed to trial. The court then permitted counsel to have Appellant examined by a psychiatrist retained by Appellant, Robert B. Blumberg, D.O. Following a review of Appellant’s records and an interview of him, Dr. Blumberg opined that Appellant was not competent to stand trial, as he suffered from persistent delusion, was profoundly disturbed, and was detached from reality. In light of Dr. Blumberg’s testimony, the common pleas court directed an examination by a court-appointed expert, Richard B. Saul, M.D., a clinical psychiatrist. Upon evaluating Appellant, which included a review of his mental health records, Dr. Saul opined that Appellant was oriented as to time, person, and place, and could communicate with his attorney and understand the proceedings. Dr. Saul acknowledged that Appellant reported hearing voices in his cell and observed that he suffered from a psychotic illness (schizophrenia). Dr. Saul concluded, nevertheless, that Appellant’s schizophrenia was in remission, noted that he was being treated with Thorazine, and opined that such medication should continue through the trial. The court found Appellant competent and, in response to a request from the prosecutor, ordered the prison officials to continue his medication. The trial court then proceeded to <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>address Appellant’s suppression motion, which it denied following a hearing.</p>
    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[258,434,1151,1209]]]'>Appellant’s trial commenced on February 17, 1981,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> with the Commonwealth’s case centering upon Appellant’s confessions and circumstantial evidence indicating his involvement, specifically, that: the letters burned into the ceiling of the crime scene were consistent with Appellant’s nickname and those appearing in his bedroom; the assault involving M.O. was substantially similar to that in the present matter and tended to establish that Appellant was the perpetrator; and Appellant’s route to school provided him with an opportunity to have committed the offenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The defense countered by contesting the circumstances surrounding Appellant’s statements, particularly, that Appellant was unable to read and write and was intellectually unable to have articulated the details of the crimes as they appeared in the statements; the defense also emphasized that Appellant was at school on the day of the crime. Appellant presented testimony from his uncle, Morris Hawthorne, who, in addition to testifying about Appellant’s statements, noted that he had never seen Appellant and his mother together, and that Appellant had the intellectual capacity of a two-year old. Appellant testified in his own defense, challenging his admissions to the detectives, and maintaining that he did not sexually assault and murder the victim.</p>
    <p id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[258,1674,1149,203]],["BL_381.1",381,[141,319,1152,885]]]'>The Commonwealth presented rebuttal evidence concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>Appellant’s confessions. In addition, the Commonwealth sought to introduce incriminating statements that Appellant made to Dr. Wilson during her psychological evalua<a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>tion, namely, that he had set a fire in an abandoned house on the date of the crimes and had raped, killed, and set the victim on fire. In response to Appellant’s objection to these statements, the court conducted a hearing, received argument concerning such proof, and ruled that the Commonwealth could not introduce Appellant’s admission to raping and killing the victim, but it would be permitted to elicit Appellant’s admission to setting a fire in a vacant house on March 1, 1979. Although the Commonwealth did not then call Dr. Wilson, Appellant presented testimony from her concerning his limited intellectual capacity and functioning, including the indication of mild brain damage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Counsel for Appellant also elicited that Dr. Wilson had been subpoenaed by the Commonwealth. On cross-examination, the prosecutor sought to explain the reason Dr. Wilson had been subpoenaed, revealing, over objection, Appellant’s incriminating statement of having set a fire in an abandoned house on the date of the offenses.</p>

With respect to the former, the Commonwealth incorporated the testimony of the medical examiner and Appellant’s statement. In support of the grave risk aggravator, the Commonwealth presented testimony that other homes along Olive Street were occupied. In mitigation, Appellant initially sought to invoke that he had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1); however, the trial court ruled that evidence concerning his lack of a significant criminal history and/or any evidence of good character would open the door for the Commonwealth to rebut such proof with evidence that Appellant had been involved in a sexual assault as a juvenile, <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>although he had not been adjudicated delinquent for such offense. As a result, counsel for Appellant opted to forego submission of the mitigating circumstance under Section 9711(e)(1), as well as any evidence of good character. Appellant thus offered as mitigating circumstances his age and the catch-all mitigator concerning his character, record, and the circumstances of the offense. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4), (8). In support of the latter, Appellant did not present any testimony, instead relying upon evidence presented during the guilt phase by his uncle and Dr. Wilson, namely, that he had been abandoned by his mother, had a diminished mental capacity, and may suffer from mild brain damage.</p>

On post-verdict motions and direct appeal, Appellant was represented by trial counsel and raised as issues: the propriety of the competency determination; the voluntariness of his confessions; the fact that several spectators and members of the jury were wearing green ribbons to symbolize the plight of African-American children in Atlanta, which suggested their predisposition and denied him a fair trial; and trial court error in allowing the Commonwealth to introduce other crimes evidence, specifically, the sexual assault involving M.O.

On June 12, 1996, Appellant filed an “Amended Petition Pursuant to the Post-Conviction Relief Act.” <em>See generally </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546 (the “PCRA”). However, in October of 1996, counsel from the former Center for Legal Education Advocacy and Defense Assistance entered their appearance on Appellant’s behalf and, on November 18, 1996, filed a 315-page “Amended Petition for Habeas Corpus Relief Under Article I, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and for Post-Conviction Relief under the Post-Convic<a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>tion Relief Act and Consolidated Memorandum of Law.” On May 27, 1997, and again on September 2, 1998, Appellant filed supplemental petitions for post-conviction relief. The various amended and supplemental petitions contained 24 separate “Claims for Relief,” with certain of the claims involving multiple allegations of legal error in connection with ineffective assistance of counsel, including that: Appellant was not competent during trial, post-verdict motions, and on direct appeal; he should not have been tried as an adult; his statements to the police were involuntary, and the waiver of his constitutional rights was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily given; he was entitled to have the jury selection proceedings transcribed and to reinstatement of his direct appeal rights with respect to all jury selection issues; he was tried while involuntarily drugged; counsel failed to investigate, develop and present mental health defenses; counsel did not seek a cautionary instruction surrounding the improper admission of other crimes evidence; testimony from the psychologist, Dr. .Wilson, that Appellant had admitted setting a fire in an old house on the day of the offense was improperly admitted; numerous errors occurred in connection with the guilt-phase jury instructions; Appellant was improperly precluded from introducing mitigating evidence that he did not have a significant history of prior convictions; the jury failed to consider and was impeded from considering Appellant’s age as a mitigating circumstance; the death sentence was unconstitutionally imposed, as jurors wore green ribbons symbolizing their sympathy for families of African-American children murdered in Atlanta, and the court failed to question the jurors as to the effect of the Atlanta killings upon the sentencing decision; the prosecutor’s penalty phase argument was unconstitutional; the penalty phase jury instructions unconstitutionally indicated that the jury had to unanimously find a mitigating circumstance before giving it effect; the penalty phase jury instructions erroneously implied that a life sentence carried with it a possibility of parole; the jury was unconstitutionally instructed during the penalty phase that capital punishment is “the American way”; and counsel failed to adequately investigate and develop mitigating evidence.</p>

      <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>The Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that Appellant’s allegations were either: waived, previously litigated, untimely by virtue of the delay in filing the PCRA petition, or meritless. The late Honorable Robert A. Latrone heard argument on four of the issues; however, before disposing of the case, he passed away. The matter was reassigned to the Honorable C. Darnell Jones, II, who granted the Commonwealth’s motion. Following an appeal and the filing of a statement of matters complained of on appeal, the PCRA court issued an opinion, noting that delay is a factor in evaluating the merits of a petition, and concluding that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary, as Appellant’s claims were either previously litigated or without merit.</p>

Consistent with the eligibility requirements of the PCRA, Appellant frames his claims as involving a violation of the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions or laws of the United States, the denial of effective assistance of counsel, or a proceeding in a tribunal without jurisdiction. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(i, ii, viii). To prevail on his ineffectiveness allegations, Appellant must demonstrate that the underlying claim is of arguable merit; that no reasonable strategic basis existed for counsel’s act or omission; and that counsel’s error resulted in prejudice, namely, that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. <em>See Commonwealth v.

An issue is previously litigated if the highest appellate court in which Appellant could have had review as a matter of right ruled upon the merits of the issue. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(a)(2). An issue will be deemed waived if Appellant could have raised it, but failed to do so before trial, at trial, or on appeal. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b).

Boxer, M.D., from April of 1980, noting that Appellant was out of contact with reality, confused and rambling, and exhibited “neurological appearing symptoms”; a mental health evaluation prepared by Gino Grosso, M.D., in July of 1980, referencing Appellant’s prior psychiatric commitment in 1977 and noting that he was in a confused and catatonic state; the competency hearing testimony of Dr. Blumberg, who concluded that Appellant was “detached from reality” and was “profoundly disturbed”; and the <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>opinion of Dr. Saul, who diagnosed Appellant as having a psychotic illness, namely, schizophrenia.

Dr. Fleming characterized Appellant as suffering from an extreme mental and emotional disturbance. Appellant also submitted an affidavit from Robert A.

In addition, the affidavits indicate that Ms. Bunn sexually abused Appellant, maintained relationships with various men who both physically and sexually abused Appellant, and attempted to commit suicide a number of times in the presence of her children. The affidavits reference an occasion when Appellant and a younger brother overdosed on Ms. Bunn’s pills and were hospitalized. The affidavits also assert that Appellant was abandoned when Ms. Bunn moved to California, and that he and his siblings were removed by California Children and Youth Services and placed in foster care until being returned to the care of Appellant’s grandmother in Philadelphia.

A premise of the Concurring and Dissenting Opinion's criticism of the above analysis is that we are indulging in a pretense that Appellant did not waive his right to vindicate' the <em>Cooper </em>rule on direct appeal. <em>See </em>Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 817 (Castille, J.). The criticism is undermined, however, by the fact that we engage in no such pretense. Rather, in part because Appellant has attached a derivative ineffectiveness claim to his <em>Cooper </em>argument, and in part for prudential reasons, we have simply determined that the claim is without merit rather than addressing the waiver arguments, an approach which clearly has been sanctioned by this Court, <em>see, e.g., McGill, </em><a href="/pa/574/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="343" data-cite="574 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="588049" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0574-01">574 Pa. at 588</a>, <a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="344" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">832 A.2d at 1023</a>, and, again, is commonly applied in other jurisdictions. <em>See supra </em>note 13. Moreover, the Concurring and Dissenting Opinion fails to acknowledge the material difference between the salient analysis concerning whether a petitioner has waived a claim, and the related but discrete question of whether and to what extent new, constitutionally based rules of criminal procedure are to be retroactively applied under <em>Teague.

Our decision in this regard does not “nullify the PCRA's waiver provision” as Mr. Justice Castille indicates, <em>see </em>Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 817, since relief is not being afforded on Appellant’s claim.

It is hard to grasp why the Majority ultimately denies appellant any benefit of <em>Cooper </em>if we are indulging the pretense that he did not waive his right to pursue the new rule on direct review.

It would be better simply to apply the statute according to its actual language and rational structure; recognize that the competency standard claim is waivable and was in fact waived here; decline to convert appellant’s claim of counsel ineffectiveness into the underlying waived claim; and dispose of the ineffectiveness claim—which is cognizable and not waived—on the merits by applying settled law which holds that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to predict the change in the law represented by <em>Cooper.

With the Supreme Court not yet having issued such a remarkable ruling, this defaulted claim, like the defaulted <em>Cooper </em>claim, should be treated as the ineffective assistance of counsel claim that it actually is.

The fact that appellant’s mother may have abandoned him, for example, says nothing at all of his community reputation for any particular character trait. Instead, Section (e)(8) permits evidence, under the rubric of character, which is much broader and necessarily more vague. That evidence typically encompasses matters such as childhood abuse, substance abuse, mental impairments, prison adjustment, religious conversion, individual good deeds, family relations, life achievements and disappointments, <em>etc. </em>The Section thereby permits evidence which allows a fuller and more personal portrait of the defendant to appear so that the jury may assess his “character” for purposes of determining whether the character/record/circumstances mitigator exists. The point of pursuing the mitigator is to convince the jury that, for purposes of penalty, this particular cold-blooded murderer is at least slightly less <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>blameworthy than other cold-blooded murderers.

Thus, the defendant cannot argue that each particular bit of evidence he would introduce pursuant to the Section warrants a finding of a separate statutory mitigator. Given the- very broad and flexible nature of this Section, it is certainly a plausible reading of its plain language to conclude that evidence of “good” Section (e)(8) character opens the door to rebuttal evidence of “bad” Section (e)(8) character.</p>

Op. at 811-12. I have no objection to assuming certain points in order to facilitate a disposition, particularly given the typically prolix filings with which this Court is burdened upon capital PCRA review. But, since this Court is likely to encounter this new type of assault upon direct appeal counsel in capital cases with increasing frequency, I believe there are two points worth making about such claims. First, even laying aside the procedural hurdle that the direct appeal in this case was already briefed and submitted when <em>Mills </em>was decided, it is pure speculation whether the Court would have entertained a particular defaulted claim based upon new constitutional authority under the discretionary relaxed waiver doctrine. Indeed, this Court has held that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective on appeal for failing to seek the retroactive benefit of a new constitutional rule that was announced while the appeal was pending, where the claim was not preserved below. <em>Commonwealth v.

In the event that the U.S. Supreme Court, or this Court, were to hold that a new constitutional rule is so fundamental as to warrant super-retroactive application on collateral attack, the PCRA specifically deems such claims to be cognizable as exceptions to the PCRA time-bar. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)((l)(iii)). The High Court has never held that <em>Riggins </em>is such a watershed rule.</p>
