The only notable difference between our decisions in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Fulton </em>and the case <em>sub judice </em>is that the former involved a trial court’s <em>adoption </em>of the Commonwealth’s argument as to relevant appeal issues, while this case involves the trial court’s <em>silence </em>as to relevant appeal issues. Because that distinction concerning the manner in which the trial court failed to explain its decision is unrelated to the purpose of the Rule, it is of no moment.

Indeed, in any case where the trial court fails to prepare an opinion that addresses the issues upon which it passed and which are raised by a party on appeal, the net result is the same: the appellate court is deprived of explication and guidance on those issues from the judicial entity most familiar with the matter. Moreover, the parties may be left without a meaningful context within which to make their arguments on appeal, particularly as to discretionary matters. Those concerns are no less salient in the context of direct capital review than they are in the PCRA arena; nor are they less salient where the lower court is silent on appeal issues, as opposed to adopting the position of an advocate as the entire basis for its opinion.</p>

Specifically, appellant alleges that trial counsel was ineffective in: (1) failing to present certain mitigating evidence at the penalty hearing; (2) failing to request complete jury instructions on manslaughter, passion, and provocation; (3) failing to object to the prosecutor's misstatements of the law during closing argument; (4) failing to make an adequate closing argument to the jury following the penalty hearing; (5) failing to object to the court’s incorrect statement of the law in response to one jury inquiry and failing to object to the court’s failure to answer another jury inquiry; and (6) failing to request <em>voir dire </em>of the jury when it submitted an inquiry to the court revealing one juror's preexisting bias.</p>

In <em>Grant, </em>we held that the rule announced therein would be applicable to the parties in that case and to "those cases currently pending on direct appeal.” <em>Id. </em>at 739. Here, appellants notice of automatic appeal was filed on October 29, 1998, and thus <em>Grant </em>is applicable since the appeal was pending when <em>Grant </em>was decided.</p>

In its opinion, the trial court stated that appellant failed to file post-sentence motions, albeit it did not suggest that any consequence followed from that supposed failure. In point of fact, the docket reveals appellant did file such a motion, although seemingly prematurely. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(A)(1) (time for filing optional post-sentence motions is <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>no later than 10 days after "imposition of sentence"). Moreover, we note that under existing post-sentence practice, appellant was not required to file such motions at all in order to preserve his claims for appellate review, so long as the claims were preserved by contemporaneous objections at trial. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(B)(1)(c) ("Issues raised before or during trial shall be deemed preserved for appeal whether or not the defendant elects to file a post-sentence motion on those issues.”). This change in post-verdict motions practice has made the procedure set forth in Rule 1925 even more important to ensure that the trial court files a meaningful opinion.</p>
