Saw Creek primarily consists of townhouses, which are independently owned by homeowners in Saw Creek. The community, however, also includes: roads; ponds; green areas; tennis courts; a pool; a clubhouse; a water tower; a well house; a community building in which there are various recreational facilities, a meeting room, and a restaurant; and a single-story building in which there is a real estate sales office (the “sales office”). All of the latter property is owned by the Association, rather than by individual homeowners, but it may nevertheless be used by any of Saw Creek’s residents.</p>
    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[258,1195,1154,1061]]]'>Prior to the 2000—2001 tax year, the Board reassessed the value of properties within Saw Creek. In doing so, it determined that the roads, ponds, green areas, water tower, and well house, as well as the community building’s recreational facilities and meeting room, qualified as “common facilities” of Saw Creek pursuant to section 5103 of the Act, which defines common facilities as: “Any real estate within a planned community which is owned by the association or leased to the association. The term does not include a unit.” 68 Pa.C.S. § 5103. The Board then found that these facilities were exempt from separate assessment and taxation as common facilities based on section 5105(b)(1) of the Act, which directs that “no separate assessed value shall be attributed to and no separate tax shall be imposed against common facilities.... ” <em>Id. </em>§ 5105(b)(1). In contrast, the Board found that the restaurant and sales office did not qualify as common facilities under section 5103, and therefore, had to be separately assessed and taxed. Consequently, the Board assessed the restaurant as having a value of $142,190 and the sales office as having a value of $33,480.</p>

During the hearing, Nicholas Mazzarella, the general manager of the Association, testified that although the Association owned the property on which the restaurant was located, it had leased that property to a private entity for the express purpose of operating a restaurant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Mr. Mazzarella explained that this arrangement was financially beneficial to the Association because it would lose money if it operated the restaurant on its own. Mr. Mazzarella further testified that although the restaurant was open to the public, it was considered a benefit to the residents of Saw Creek, as they were the primary patrons of the restaurant and received a 10% discount on their meals there. Moreover, Mr. Mazzarella stated that the rent that the restaurant operator paid to the Association went into a general fund to reduce the dues assessed against the Saw Creek homeowners for the common facilities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Unlike the trial court, the Commonwealth Court determined that the restaurant and sales office were clearly common facilities of Saw Creek, based on the plain and unambiguous definition of that term in section 5103. Turning to that statutory definition, the court explained that property qualifies as a common facility so long as it meets the following two requirements: (1) it is within the planned community; and (2) it is owned by or leased to the homeowners’ <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>association.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The court then concluded that because the restaurant and sales office met both of the above statutory requirements, they were undoubtedly common facilities and, as such, exempt from independent assessment and taxation pursuant to section 5105(b)(1) of the Act.</p>

Applying that premise here, Appellants contend that the restaurant and sales office cannot be exempt from separate assessment and taxation because they have been leased to private parties and, as a result, the planned community residents do not have the right to use these facilities in a free and unfettered manner. After considering Appellants’ argument, however, we cannot agree that the restaurant and sales office must be assessed and taxed under these circumstances.</p>

Like the Commonwealth Court, we read section 5103 of the Act to clearly require that common facilities be: (1) located within the planned community; and (2) owned or leased by the planned community homeowners’ association. <em>See id. </em>§ 5103. However, unlike the Commonwealth Court, we also find that section 5103 contains a clear third requirement that a common facility not be a unit, <em>i.e., </em>the property must not be designated for separate occupancy or ownership. <em>See id.</em>

As the Commonwealth Court found, the restaurant and sales office indisputably meet the first two requirements because they are located in the planned community and are owned by the Association. Moreover, we find that the restau<a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>rant and sales office also do not qualify as “units” because unlike the typical “unit” in a planned community, <em>i.e., </em>a home, the restaurant and sales office are simply not designated for separate occupancy or ownership. As the context of the Act makes clear and as Appellants even acknowledge in their brief, the term “separate ownership or occupancy” in the “unit” definition “denote[s] exclusivity of use” by the owner or lessee. Appellants’ Bf., at 14; <em>see also </em>68 Pa.C.S. § 5105 (explaining that unit is a separate parcel of real estate for which unit owner is independently taxed); <em>id. </em>§ 5202 (stating that any fixtures or improvements designated for a unit are allocated “exclusively” to that unit); <em>id. </em>§ 5213 (explaining that a unit owner has the right to make any improvements or alterations to unit that do not impair the structural integrity of planned community). Under this construction, property is a unit, <em>ie., </em>designated for separate ownership or occupancy, only if the owner or lessee is entitled to use the property for himself and has no obligation to share the property with others. <em>See </em>Webster’s II New College Dictionary 1007 (1st ed.2001) (defining “exclusive” as something that is “not shared with others”). Here, the Association did not lease the restaurant or the sales office to the lessees for their exclusive use, but rather leased them to the lessees so that they could use the property for the benefit of the Saw Creek residents.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Accordingly, these facilities cannot be classified as units and must instead be classified as common facilities. <em>See </em>68 Pa.

While Appellants seem to argue otherwise, we find that <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>the language of section 5105(b)(1) plainly and unambiguously states that all common facilities are, in fact, exempt from separate assessment and taxation. <em>See </em>68 Pa.C.S. § 5105(b)(1) (“no separate assessed value shall be attributed to and no separate tax shall be imposed against common facilities”). Thus, because we must effectuate the General Assembly’s intent when interpreting statutes, and because the plain language in a statute is the best indicator of the General Assembly’s intent, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921, we hold that the General Assembly must have intended section 5105(b)(1) to mean just what it clearly says: common facilities may <em>not </em>be separately assessed and taxed.</p>

In contending that such an exception exists, Appellants assert that section 5105(b)(1) only exempts common facilities from separate assessment and taxation because the individual homeowners in a planned community are already assessed and taxed for those facilities by means of their “appurtenant interest” in the facilities. <em>See </em>68 Pa.C.S. § 5105(b) (“[Ejach unit must be separately taxed and assessed. The value of a unit shall include the value of that unit’s appurtenant interest in the common facilities.... ”). Arguing that individual homeowners only have an appurtenant interest in common facilities if they have the right to use the facilities in a free and unfettered manner, Appellants contend that there is no basis for exempting from separate assessment and taxation a common facility to which homeowners do <em>not </em>have free and unfettered access because the planned community homeowners will not be taxed for any appurtenant interest in that facility. Contrary to Appellants’ assertion, however, homeowners do not have an appurtenant interest in common facilities only if they have the right to free and unfettered access to those facilities; rather, the Act makes clear that regardless of the quality of access <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>afforded to them, homeowners have an appurtenant interest in any facility that the planned community declaration designates as a “common facility,” at least in the absence of proof that they actually derive no value or benefit from that facility. <em>See </em>68 Pa.C.S. § 5105 (“each unit that has been created, together with the interests, benefits and burdens created by the declaration, <em>including, without limitation, the rights to any common facilities constitute a separate parcel of real estate”) </em>(emphasis added); <em>Id. </em>§ 5205 (explaining that planned community declaration must delineate between the units and the common facilities); Black’s Law Dictionary 98 (7th ed.1999) (defining “appurtenant” as describing something that is “[a]nnexed to a more important thing”). Moreover, as the facts of this very case make clear, facilities designated as common facilities are simply not only those to which homeowners have free and unfettered access.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Accordingly, Appellants cannot rely on a contrary factual premise in asserting that certain common facilities are not exempt from separate assessment and taxation.</p>

As the trial court aptly noted, these for-profit corporations enjoy exclusive control over the leased property, which is therefore not subject to the unfettered use, control or dominion of Saw Creek’s residents.

    <p id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[261,1161,1149,366]]]'>It is certainly possible to categorize the real estate office and the restaurant as either a unit or a common facility.

Cmwlth. 195, <a href="/citations/?q=423%20A.2d%20760" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="423 A.2d 760">423 A.2d 760</a>, 761 (1980) (internal citation omitted); <em>see also </em>Pa. Const. Art. 8 § 2(a). Presently, the trial court reasoned that the real estate office and restaurant were run by outside corporations with exclusive control and for the exclusive use of a third party entity other than the Association. Additionally, the trial court gave credence to the fact that Saw Creek property owners do not have unfettered use, control, or dominion over the properties, but rather that the office and restaurant are separately used, occupied, maintained, and controlled for the profit of a private entity. <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the two were not common facilities, but units.</p>
    <p id="b537-4" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[152,434,1152,518]]]'>Second, statutory provisions exempting property from taxation are strictly construed and it is the burden of the taxpayer to bring itself within the scope of that exemption. <em>In the Matter of Tax Assessment of Real Estate of Greater Erie Economic Development Corporation, </em>61 Pa.Cmwlth. 144, <a href="/citations/?q=433%20A.2d%20568" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="433 A.2d 568">433 A.2d 568</a>, 570 (1981); 72 P.S. § 5020-204(a).

Specifically, a “limited common facility” is defined as “[a] portion of the common facilities allocated by or pursuant to the declaration ... for the exclusive use of one or more but fewer than all of the units.” 68 Pa.C.S. § 5103 (emphasis added). By referring to “exclusive use” to define a limited common facility, the legislature has strongly implied that a common facility must be devoted solely to the use of the members of the association and their guests. The limited factor relates to the fact that not all of the units within the association must be able to use the facility. However, a common facility would, logically, be considered as being for the exclusive use of all of the units.</p>

This contrasts with the generally accepted examples of a common facility dedicated to the exclusive use of residents and their guests, such as a pool, clubhouse, fitness center, and the like. In each of the preceding examples, the facility is for the exclusive use of all the units within the development and not for the general public.

The real estate office and restaurant clearly meet each of these requirements based upon the plain language of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[246,973,1161,837]]]'>However, the Majority contends that because a unit is designated for separate ownership or occupancy, the definition of a unit can be satisfied only if the owners or lessees are entitled to use the property for themselves and have no obligation to share the property with others. Such an interpretation reads a requirement into the statute that does not exist. Even if that requirement was read into the statute or was reasonable, no obligation exists on the part of either entity to share the property with others. The fact that the two disputed businesses are commercial enterprises means that by their very nature, they desire to attract patrons. However, the power to exclude rests solely with the business owners, who are non-Saw Creek residents. Moreover, none of the residents have, at any time, free and unfettered access to the property; rather, such control is in the hands of the business operators.</p>

However, the alleged purpose and benefit of the two businesses are not important as to their categorization or definition. Even if the purpose were relevant to the decision, a ten percent discount to residents at the restaurant hardly qualifies as being for the benefit of Saw Creek residents. More important is that non-Saw Creek residents receive the benefit of operat<a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>ing a commercial enterprise, and other non-Saw Creek residents are not excluded from the property. Further, the proprietors of the businesses could choose to exclude Saw Creek residents, or anybody, from entering the restaurant.
