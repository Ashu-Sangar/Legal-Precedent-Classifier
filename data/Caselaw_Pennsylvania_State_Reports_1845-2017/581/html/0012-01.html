The general contractor, Acciavatti Associates, hired subcontractor Goldsmith Associates to perform electrical work in accordance with the plans and specifications of the general contract, Contract MV-1219, between Acciavatti and Super Fresh’s <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>parent company, A &amp; P.

    <p id="b101-4" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[131,491,1155,730]]]'>Bernotas sued Super Fresh for her injuries. The store filed a cross-claim joining Acciavatti and Goldsmith, claiming contractual entitlement to complete indemnification. In 1998, Bernotas settled for $200,000, with each defendant contributing one-third of the amount. Super Fresh then sought indemnification under the terms of Contract MV-1219, Article XII, which required “[t]he Contractor ... [to] assume entire responsibility and liability for any and all damage or injury of any kind ... caused by ... the execution of the work provided for in this Contract ...,” provided Super Fresh was not solely negligent. A bench trial was held in 2001, to determine whether Acciavatti was required to indemnify Super Fresh under Contract MV-1219, and whether Goldsmith was required to indemnify Acciavatti under the subcontract.</p>
    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[130,1246,1151,672]]]'>The trial court did not make a factual finding of the exact cause of the injury. Instead, it found Super Fresh was not solely negligent, as both Acciavatti and Goldsmith failed to provide a safe work area. Thus, Acciavatti’s obligation to indemnify Super Fresh under the general contract was triggered. Acciavatti was required to pay two-thirds of the damages (its own one-third as well as the one-third attributed to Super Fresh because of its contractual obligation to indemnify Super Fresh), while Goldsmith was required to pay the remaining one-third. Acciavatti appealed, claiming Goldsmith had agreed to indemnify Acciavatti pursuant to an incorporation clause in the subcontract, and was therefore responsible for the entire settlement.</p>

It determined the subcontract, by incorporating the terms of Contract MV-1219, created a pass-through indemnification provision which transferred to Goldsmith the contractual obligations Acciavatti owed to Super Fresh. The subcontract included an incorporation clause noting the “[prime] Contract Documents form a part of this Subcontract, and are as fully a part of this Subcontract as if attached to this agreement and as if herein set forth at length.” Acciavatti’s Answer, Exhibit A. The Superior Court ruled this clause “created a conduit through which the obligations embodied in the prime contract flowed from that contract to the one between [Acciavatti] and Goldsmith to the extent that the obligations were within the ambit of the subcontract.” <em>Bemotas, </em>at 231. Acknowledging the absence of express “agree to be bound” language that usually signals an intent to bind subcontractors to the terms of the prime contract, the Superior Court also discussed additional paragraphs (Paragraphs 11 and 13) of the subcontract agreement which, it concluded, showed Goldsmith agreed to perform in accordance with the terms of the prime contract. <em><a href="/a2d/816/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="816 A.2d 225" data-case-ids="9365694" data-case-paths="/a2d/816/0225-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/a2d/816/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="816 A.2d 225" data-case-ids="9365694" data-case-paths="/a2d/816/0225-01">at 229-230</a>.

The language in the subcontract (Paragraph 13) could be interpreted to mean Goldsmith would indemnify Acciavatti <em>only </em>in the event of negligence resulting from the <em>performance </em>of Goldsmith’s work. Goldsmith argues this provision specifically states it is not required to indemnify Acciavatti and/or Super Fresh for <em>either’s </em>negligent acts not arising from the performance of Goldsmith’s work. This interpretation is plausible when read in concert with the preceding language referring to a release of claims from any incidents occurring at the work site, which Goldsmith argues is distinct from its indemnification provision.

The general contract clearly states contractors will indemnify Super Fresh for any liability which is not solely the result of Super Fresh’s negligence. While the language of this contract is clear and unequivocal, allowing such indemnification to automatically pass through to the subcontract agreement through a standard incorporation clause, assigns more liability to the subcontractor than the subcontractor accepts via the subcontract alone. Furthermore, both the terms introduced by the incorporation clause and the terms of Paragraph 11 of the subcontract conflict with a plausible interpretation of Paragraph 13.

Notably, the circumstances underlying both the <em>Perry </em>and <em>Ruzzi </em>decisions involved primary liability on the part of the indemnitee as a sole or joint tortfeasor. <em>See Ruzzi, </em><a href="/pa/527/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="527 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1827724" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0001-01">527 Pa. at 6</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="527 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1827724" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0001-01">588 A.2d at 3</a> (involving an effort to obtain indemnification by a party that was found to have been 84 percent negligent in a jury trial); <em>Perry v. Payne, </em><a href="/pa/217/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="217 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="953727" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0252-01">217 Pa. 252</a>, 255, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="66 A. 553">66 A. 553</a>, 554 (1907) (involving negligence on the part of the indemnitee's employee in lowering an elevator on a painter, causing his death). Indeed, as secondary liability is the basis for common law indemnification theory, <em>see Builders Supply Co. v. McCabe, </em><a href="/pa/366/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="366 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="8845540" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0322-01">366 Pa. 322</a>, 328, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20368" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="77 A.2d 368">77 A.2d 368</a>, 371 (1951), it seems to me that the policy considerations at work in <em>Perry/Ruzzi </em>simply are not relevant in relation to contractual indemnification claims asserted by persons subject only to secondary liability on the underlying claim. <em>See generally </em>42 C.J.S. IndeiVinity § 15 (2004) ("Where an indemnity provision does not specifically address what effect the indemnitee's negligence will have on the indemnitor’s obligation, it is a general indemnity agreement, and the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification for loss resulting from its own active negligence, but only for its own passive negligence.”). While use of the terms "active” versus "passive” negligence has been criticized in this setting based on their vagueness, <em>see, e.g. Urban Redev., </em><a href="/pa-super/281/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="281 Pa. Super. 466" data-case-ids="152736" data-case-paths="/pa-super/281/0466-01">281 Pa.Super. at 479-83</a>, <a href="/pa-super/281/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="281 Pa.

American Asbestos Control Co., </em>157 Pa. Cmwlth. 235, 240, <a href="/pa-commw/157/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="629 A.2d 265" data-case-ids="1449076" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/157/0235-01">629 A.2d 265</a>, 268 (1993), the primary versus secondary liability distinction remains a meaningful one.</p>

The majority is correct in noting that the trial court did not specify the cause of the accident. It is noteworthy, however, that the record contains no evidence of any specific potential cause related to workplace safety other than the conduit pipe, and the common pleas court’s <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>liability finding must necessarily subsume some assessment of causation. <em>See generally McClure </em>v. <em>Deerland Corp., </em><a href="/pa-super/401/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="401 Pa. Super. 226" data-case-ids="889604" data-case-paths="/pa-super/401/0226-01">401 Pa.Super. 226</a>, 231, <a href="/pa-super/401/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="401 Pa.

Thus, it appears to me that the court may have attributed the injury to the conduit pipe (it is interesting to note that the only specific evidence to the effect that the plaintiff tripped on the pipe was admitted over an at least facially legitimate hearsay objection lodged by Goldsmith, <em>see </em>N.T., Mar. 26, 2001, at 129-34; the issue of the validity of such objection, however, has not been presented to this Court at this time), and the uncertainty in this regard could be clarified via a remand.</p>

Were the matter to be remanded, it is possible that Acciavatti’s participation in the settlement of the underlying cause could be deemed reasonable on a secondary liability theory in spite of <em>Leonard, </em>since, although <em>Leonard </em>predated the common pleas court’s decision on indemnification, the law in this regard remained uncertain at the time of the settlement.</p>

There is also some suggestion in the record that the conduit pipe may have been a remnant from prior construction that was not within the scope of Goldsmith’s work, <em>see </em>N.T., March 26, 2001, at 118-20 (testimony from a Goldsmith supervisor suggesting that Goldsmith's work was directed to overhead wiring, and not wiring from the floor area), which, if found as a fact, would render it outside the scope of the acknowledged delegation here.</p>
