Those orders held the Cumberland Valley School District (Cumberland District) responsible for providing education for a student, Lynn Thane, who had recently moved into the district. At issue is whether Lynn is a resident of the Cumberland District. On the record pre<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>sented, we hold that the courts below properly determined that Lynn is a resident of that district.</p>
    <p id="b988-4" data-blocks='[["BL_988.4",988,[246,385,1160,583]]]'>The appellees, Dr. T. Toe Thane and Phyu K. Thane, husband and wife respectively, are the parents of two boys, Wynn and Lynn Thane. In August of 1995, Dr. and Mrs. Thane decided that Mrs. Thane would, along with both boys, move from the family home in Chambersburg, Franklin County, to a townhouse in Hampden Township, Cumberland County. The purpose of the move was to live closer to Harrisburg Academy, where Wynn was to attend a private school. Lynn moved as well, because Mrs. Thane is his primary caregiver. Because Lynn requires special education, he was enrolled in an appropriate school in the Cumberland District.</p>
    <p id="b988-5" data-blocks='[["BL_988.5",988,[242,995,1161,582]]]'>Mrs. Thane moved the boys’ clothing, furniture, and possessions to the townhouse. Her intention was to maintain this arrangement for seven years, at which time Wynn would graduate from Harrisburg Academy. Mrs. Thane, along with Wynn and Lynn, spent Monday through Friday and alternate weekends at the townhouse. Other weekends and most vacations were spent in Chambersburg. At the townhouse, Mrs. Thane received mail and phone calls from the school district. She also paid certain personal taxes to Hampden Township, and changed her voter registration and driver’s license address accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b988-6" data-blocks='[["BL_988.6",988,[238,1604,1161,522]]]'>In October of 1995, Lynn suffered a deterioration in his mental health, due to Tourette’s syndrome. As a result, he was hospitalized for several weeks during October and November. Subsequently, after seeking expert advice, Dr. and Mrs. Thane enrolled Lynn at a private school for children with learning disabilities. That school, the Pathway School (Pathway), is located in Montgomery County. The Thanes requested that the Cumberland District pay the Pathway tuition, pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201400-1485" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1485">20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1485</a>.</p>

The <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>district refused, therefore, to pay any tuition for Lynn to attend Pathway. The Thanes took an appeal to the board of school directors. An evidentiary hearing was held, and the decision of the district was affirmed. The board reasoned that the townhouse in Cumberland County was a temporary residence for Mrs. Thane and her two sons, that it existed only for their temporary convenience, and that the Thanes had no intention of making it their primary residence.</p>
    <p id="b989-4" data-blocks='[["BL_989.4",989,[230,692,1151,900]]]'>The Public School Code of 1949, 24 P.S. § 13-1302, states that “[a] child shall be considered a resident of the school district in which his parents or the guardian of his person <em>resides.” </em>(Emphasis added). The board, in determining that Lynn was not a resident of Cumberland County, interpreted the statutory term “resides” as referring to the custodial parent’s primary residence. The board concluded that primary residence and domicile are largely equivalents for purposes of 24 P.S. § 13-1302, supra, and, thus, that because Mrs. Thane was domiciled in Chambersburg, she was not a resident of Cumberland County. The board reasoned that to define “resides” as requiring something less than being “domiciled” would lead to a questionable result, for it might enable children to claim residency in their choice of school districts, and it would burden school districts by permitting parents to send their children to schools in districts where they do not pay property taxes.</p>

In an opinion that examined the extensive factual record pertaining to the contacts that Mrs. Thane maintained with both Chambersburg and the Cumberland District, the <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>court determined that a residence had in fact been established in the latter district.</p>
    <p id="b990-4" data-blocks='[["BL_990.4",990,[235,382,1160,420]]]'>An appeal to Commonwealth Court ensued. That court affirmed, in relevant part, on the basis of the comprehensive opinion of the court of common pleas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> We granted allowance of appeal to review the interpretation accorded by the courts below to the statutory term “resides” rather than for the purpose of engaging in an extensive factual review of the record, inasmuch as the opinion of the court of common pleas amply set forth that record.</p>
    <p id="b990-5" data-blocks='[["BL_990.5",990,[228,844,1161,798]]]'>The courts below properly interpreted the term “resides” as it is used in the Public School Code of 1949, 24 P.S. § 13-1302, supra. The term refers to a place where the custodial parent maintains a residence, and, contrary to the board’s view, it need not be a primary residence or domicile. The legislature, in enacting section 1302, is presumed to have known the common meanings of the terms “residence” and “domicile.” Indeed, words in a statute must be construed in accordance with their common and approved usage. Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). In choosing the term “resides” rather than terms such as “has a primary residence” or “is domiciled” in the school district, the legislature did not require that parents do anything more than reside in a school district in order to enroll their children in the local public schools.</p>

There is, therefore, nothing in the School Code which indicates that the terms “resident” and “resides” should be given special meanings beyond their classic definitions.
