Sometime later, the employer filed a petition to modify the employee’s benefits arguing that the employee had recovered from his work-related injuries sufficiently to return to gainful employment.

As we discussed in <em>Kachinski, </em>Section 413 of the Act, 77 P.S. § 772, which governs the procedure for modifying benefits, gives no clear guidance as to what is required to warrant a modification of benefits. 532 A.2d at 376 n. 1.

Although a party seeking to change the status of benefits must establish that there has been a change in disability, the Act does not convey how this can be accomplished. Seeking to clarify the employer’s burden under the Act, this Court, in deciding <em>Kachinski, </em>looked to the development of the job availability requirement in <em>Barrett </em>and <em>Petrone </em>and construed Section 413 to require an employer seeking modification of benefits to demonstrate actual job availability.</p>

In other words, “we determine the degree of a worker’s disability by reference to how the injury affected his earnings,” as opposed to looking to the extent of the employee’s physical injuries. <em>Kachinski, </em>532 A.2d at 378. Therefore, by requiring an employer to demonstrate that a job has been made available to the employee, this Court has fashioned a workable procedure by which employers can show that the “disability of an injured employe has ... decreased.” 77 P.S. § 772. In the absence of anything concrete in the Act to govern this area, we can think of no better way for an employer to demonstrate that an employee’s disability has decreased, i.e., that an employee’s earning power has increased, than to require the employer to produce evidence that a suitable position has been made available to the employee.</p>

The very distinct issue before the Court was whether a residually injured employee <em>who returns to identical employment </em>should receive partial disability benefits because his wages are less in his current employment. In addressing this issue, we examined the provisions of the Act governing benefits for partial disability and the reinstatement of suspended benefits. Moreover, we acknowledged that in some instances, a residually injured employee’s post-injury wages would not match his or her pre-injury wages for reasons unrelated to the work injury. In <em>Harle, </em>the employee’s lost wages were not attributable to his work-related injury because he was performing an identical job.
