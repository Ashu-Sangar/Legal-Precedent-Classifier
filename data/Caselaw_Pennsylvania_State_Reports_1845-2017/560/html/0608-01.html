The crux of this testimony was that the work-related injuries of Bey resolved to the point where he could have at least performed sedentary or light-duty work if he were not otherwise totally unable to return to work because of his subsequent nonworkrelated head injuries. Based on the medical evidence that Bey was totally disabled by his nonwork-related injuries, the WCJ suspended Bey’s workers’ compensation benefits.

The Board stated that the Commonwealth Court held in <em>Sheehan </em>that “only where the employee is <em>no longer disabled by the work injury </em>is the employer not required to demonstrate job availability.” (Board’s Decision of July 1995, p. 3 (emphasis added).) Looking to the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Sheehan, </em>the Board concluded that because the WCJ had found that Bey could return only to sedentary or light-duty work in relation to his work-related injuries, as opposed to his pre-injury position, he continued to be at least partially disabled because of his work-related injuries. As such, the Board concluded that Schneider, in order to satisfy <em>Kachinski, </em>was required to produce evidence of a job that Bey could have performed, considering his remaining work-related physical injuries and disregarding his nonwork-related physical injuries.</p>

The Commonwealth Court noted that regardless of the work that Schneider could demonstrate was available, Bey would never be able to return to the workforce because of his nonwork-related injuries. However, the Commonwealth Court opined that “[r]egardless of Claimant’s subsequent nonwork-related injury which rendered him totally disabled, Claimant is still partially disabled from returning to his time-of-injury job without restrictions because of his work-related injury.” <em>Schneider, Inc. v.

Looking to its reasoning in <em>Sheehan, </em>and distinguishing the present case from its decisions in <em>Carpentertown Coal </em>and <em>USX Corp., </em>the court concluded that Schneider was required to demonstrate that there was an available position considering only Bey’s work-related injuries, i.e., a sedentary or light-duty position.</p>

While reaffirming the utility of these guidelines, our decision in <em>Costello </em>also discussed how we have departed from a strict application of <em>Kachinski </em>in limited circumstances.

In discussing the requirement of establishing job availability in <em>Banic, </em>we stated that the employer should not be required to establish job availability “where the facts demonstrate that the changed circumstances of a claimant’s disability [i.e., the claimant’s loss of earnings] make the showing of all four <em>Kachinski </em>factors irrelevant and fruitless.” <em>Banic, </em><a href="/a2d/705/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="705 A.2d 432" data-case-ids="11867138,281252" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/0432-01,/pa/550/0276-01">705 A.2d at 436</a>.

As we discussed in <em>Costello, </em>the job availability requirement developed in part because of the belief of this Court that the Act obligated the employer not only to pay benefits, but to take steps to reintroduce injured workers into the workforce. In the present case, the objective underlying the rule is in no way served through a meaningless showing of job availability when all the parties agree that there is no possibility that the employee can ever work again. Thus, because the objective of reintroducing injured workers into the workforce <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>would be in no way promoted here, we will not require a showing of job availability.</p>

While Schneider presents a valid argument that the <em>Carpentertown Coal, USX Corp. </em>and <em>Columbo v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Bd.

First, we are troubled that these decisions create an alternative standard for an employer seeking a suspension of benefits that undermines our decision in <em>kachinski. </em>Instead of presenting evidence as to job availability, these decisions allow for a suspension of benefits when an employer can point to a nonwork-related factor that is causing the employee’s loss of earnings. Establishing job availability pursuant to <em>kachinski </em>remains the proper standard to govern situations where the employer seeks to prove that an employee’s loss of earnings is attributable to a nonworkrelated factor. If an employer can establish that there is a job available that complies with an employee's remaining <em>work-related physical injuries, </em>and the employee fails to return to or accept this position because of <em>nonwork-related factors, </em>the employer has proven that the employee’s loss of earnings is attributable to something other than the work-related injury. Second, the Commonwealth Court's decisions appear to be founded on the premise that an employee who can return to his or her pre-injury position can be treated differently than an employee who can <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>return to a position other than his or her pre-injury position. As we stated in <em>Costello, </em>such a premise is erroneous. <em>See Costello, </em><a href="/a2d/747/0850-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="747 A.2d 850" data-case-ids="11475161,95798" data-case-paths="/a2d/747/0850-01,/pa/560/0618-01">747 A.2d at </a>857 n. 8.</p>
      <p id="AKN" data-blocks='[["BL_1237.3",1237,[247,1964,1119,351]]]'>Nevertheless, the results reached by the Commonwealth Court in <em>Carpentertown Coal, USX Corp. </em>and <em>Columbo </em>are consistent with our decision in the present matter to the extent that the Commonwealth Court’s decisions recognized the futility of requiring a showing of job availability if the employee can never return to work. <em>See USX Corp., </em><a href="/pa-commw/167/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="647 A.2d 605" data-case-ids="1466744,7866774" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/167/0019-01,/a2d/647/0605-01">647 A.2d at 607</a> (stating "if Claimant, admittedly, could not return to his time-of-injury job because of a non-work-related injury, it would he pointless to require Employer to prove that Claimant’s time-of-injury job was still available”).</p>
