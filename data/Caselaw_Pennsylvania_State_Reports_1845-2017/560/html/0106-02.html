At approximately 4:00 p.m. on that date the victim’s brother, Wendell Brown, became involved in an altercation over who should use a basketball court with one William Wingate, a friend of appellant’s, at the Tustin playground in West Philadelphia. The fight, however, was broken up and Wendell left the playground. Wendell later returned to the playground where he encountered appellant, whom he had seen earlier with Wingate. Wendell told appellant to tell Wingate that a basketball game was not worth fighting over. Appellant said, “you’re right” and claimed he would convey the message.</blockquote>

While Wendell Brown was standing in the playground, Wingate and another man approached him from behind and began bludgeoning Mr. Brown with a baseball bat. The two men then retreated up a flight of nearby steps when Darren Brown came to his brother’s aid. Wendell urged Darren that he was all right but Darren responded, “No £_k that, no one £_ks with my brother.” He then pointed a finger at the top of the steps and said, “Let’s go get them.”</blockquote>

As the two passed appellant who was standing on the steps, Wendell turned and noticed appellant drawing a pistol from his waistband. Wendell punched appellant in the face, shouted for Darren to run, and then fled up the steps. Darren, however, froze and was shot in the chest. He fled a short distance then collapsed. Appellant fired three or four shots at Wendell, who escaped unharmed, and then pursued his already wounded victim. Standing over his victim, he pumped shot after shot into Darren Brown’s prostrate body. Appellant then waved his weapon at the crowd and asked, “Does anybody else want some of this?”</blockquote>

The record belies Appellant’s insinuation that the killing occurred under the “heat of passion” as a result of a “serious provocation” from the victim. Furthermore, Appellant presented no evidence to demonstrate <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>that he negligently or accidentally shot the victim while attempting to kill his brother. Instead, Appellant presented evidence to support his alibi theory that he was not at that park when the murder occurred. In contrast, the jury heard evidence from the Commonwealth that, after Appellant drew a gun and pointed it at the victim and his brother, the brother of the victim punched Appellant and ran from the scene. The evidence supports, and the jury found, that, following the assault and flight by the victim’s brother, Appellant took deliberate aim, shot the victim in the chest, and then fired several more shots directly into his prone body. We find that the trial court did not err by omitting an instruction on voluntary manslaughter because Appellant presented no evidence to justify such a verdict. There is no ineffectiveness of counsel for failing to request an unwarranted instruction. <em>See Lark </em><a href="/a2d/698/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="698 A.2d 43" data-case-ids="11998055,960516" data-case-paths="/a2d/698/0043-01,/pa/548/0441-01">698 A.2d at 50</a>.

Appellant proclaims that this instruction gave the jurors permission to discredit any contradicted testimony. As previously discussed, we will review the effect of an entire instruction, and not just the meaning attributed to a segment of the charge. When the trial court told the jury to consider the effect of conflicting testimony, it did not direct the jury to disregard all contradicted testimony. Instead, the trial court instructed the jury to weigh the importance of any inaccuracy, consider the reason for the discrepancy, and decide whether all, some, or none of the testimony is believable.

Second, the trial counsel in <em>Doswell </em>failed to object, both during cross-examination and closing argument, even after it became evident that the witness had not been convicted of the specific crime.
