Throughout her employment, Appellant suffered from muscular dystrophy, a progressive disease characterized by the wasting of one’s muscles, and she was confined to a wheelchair.

In her application for benefits, Appellant stated, under penalty of perjury, that she “became unable to work because of [her] <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>disabling condition [muscular dystrophy] on February 6, 1988.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In order to be entitled to disability insurance benefit payments, an applicant must be suffering from a “disability” that is defined in <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 423">42 U.S.C. § 423</a>(d)(1)(A) as the “inability to engage in <em>any substantial gainful activity </em>by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.” (Emphasis added).

    <p id="b1263-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1263.4",1263,[219,878,1153,671]]]'>On July 9, 1990 (seventeen months after the termination of her job), Appellant filed the lawsuit before this Court today. In it, she claimed that the termination of her employment with Appellee was illegal and discriminatory, in violation of the provisions of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Section 955(a) of the PHRA provides that it shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any employer to discharge from employment any individual because of a “non-job related handicap or disability.” A non-job related handicap or disability means a handicap or disability “which <em>does not substantially interfere </em>with the ability to perforin the essential functions” of the individual’s employment. 43 P.S. § 954(p) (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b1263-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1263.5",1263,[215,1577,1153,414]]]'>Appellee moved for summary judgment on Appellant’s PHRA claim. The trial court granted the motion, and dismissed Appellant’s complaint, on January 27, 1997. The trial court, applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel, found that Appellant’s representations to the SSA, that she was unable to work because of her disability, were irreconcilable with a PHRA claim, which alleged that her disability did not substantially interfere with her ability to perform her job.</p>

They then examined her claim under the PHRA, claiming that she suffered from a disability that did not substantially interfere with her ability to perform the essential functions of her job, and they found that the latter assertion directly contradicted the former. The court applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel, and held that to permit Appellant to contradict a statement made under penalty of perjury would flaunt a fundamental assumption made in the judicial system; that assertions made under oath are true. Accordingly, the court found that Appellant failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory discharge, and the trial court appropriately entered a summary judgment.</p>

In <em>Cleveland, </em>the Supreme Court held that the pursuit, and receipt, of social security benefits did not automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim. The Court based its decision, in large part, on the fact that the ADA defines a “qualified individual with a disability” to include a disabled person who can perform the essential functions of his or her job with a “reasonable accommodation.” <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012111" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 12111">42 U.S.C. § 12111</a>(8). It was also noted by the Court that “when the SSA determines <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>whether an individual is disabled for SSDI [social security disability insurance] purposes, it does not take the possibility of ‘reasonable accommodation’ into account, nor need an applicant refer to the possibility of reasonable accommodation when she applies for SSDI.” <em>Cleveland, </em><a href="/us/526/0795-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="526 U.S. 795" data-case-ids="11133778" data-case-paths="/us/526/0795-01">119 S.Ct. at 1602</a>. The Court then specifically found that “an ADA suit claiming that the plaintiff can perform her job <em>with reasonable accommodation </em>may well prove consistent with an SSDI claim that the plaintiff could not perform her own job (or other jobs) without it.” <em><a href="/us/526/0795-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="526 U.S. 795" data-case-ids="11133778" data-case-paths="/us/526/0795-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis added).

She then filed her lawsuit pursuant to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. However, the PHRA does not apply to prevent the discharge of an employee who does have a handicap that substantially interferes with that employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of his or her employment. <em>See Buckno v. Penn Linen &amp; Uniform Service, Inc. </em><a href="/pa-super/428/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="428 Pa.

Rather, the PHRA provides protection to one dismissed from employment because of a “non-job related handicap,” 43 P.S. § 955, which means a handicap or disability “which does not substantially interfere with the ability to perform the essential functions” of the individual’s employment. 43 P.S. § 954(p). Thus, Appellant would have to establish that, on February 6, 1989, her handicap did not “substantially interfere” with her ability to perform the essential functions of her job. Nevertheless, Appellant had previously claimed in her application for SSI benefits that she was, in fact, unable to work. This prior allegation was made under oath and resulted in the payment of total disability benefits, and this is difficult to reconcile with her claims in the instant lawsuit. In <em>Cleveland, </em>however, the Supreme Court permitted the Appellant to attempt to explain the apparent inconsistency of her positions by noting that an ADA claim in which one <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>could perform his or her job with reasonable accommodation may be consistent with a prior SSA disability claim.</p>
    <p id="b1267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1267.4",1267,[221,415,1158,1091]]]'>Our PHRA statute does not specifically contain in the definition of “non-job related disability or handicap” the possibility of reasonable accommodations. However, the regulations relating to the Act do provide at 16 Pa.Code § 44.14(a) that an “employer shall make reasonable accommodations by modifying a job, including, but not limited to, modification of duties, scheduling, amount or nature of training, assistance provided, and the like, provided that the modification does not impose an undue hardship.” When interpreting the Act, courts of this Commonwealth have noted that an employer is required to make a reasonable attempt to accommodate a handicapped or disabled employee.

On the contrary, Appellee has implicitly, if not expressly, acknowledged its agreement to reasonably accommodate and has contended in every pleading filed on its behalf that it has accommodated Ms. Trowbridge. <em>See, </em>Answer and New Matter Raising Affirmative Defenses to Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, Reproduced Record (RR), 40-43, 46-48, 50, 52, and especially, New Matter III, “Fulfillment of Duty To Make Reasonable Accommodations,” RR. 59-61.

The doctrine of judicial estoppel is dispositive of this case. Appellant applied for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration on the basis of her representation, made under penalty of perjury, that she has a physical disability that rendered her completely unable to work as of February 6, 1989. The benefits were granted, and appellant continues to receive them. Appellant cannot now be heard to assert, in an attempt to collect damages against her former employer, that she was discharged from employment for an entirely inconsistent reason, to wit, that she was able to work but was discharged for illegal and discriminatory reasons. To allow appellant to maintain these irreconcilable positions cannot be <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>supported, and, indeed, undermines the judicial system.
