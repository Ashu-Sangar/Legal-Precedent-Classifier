Thereafter, Mrs. Miletti filed a fatal claim petition, pursuant to the Act, on September 27, 1993.

In Dr. Chaudhry’s opinion, the ILD was caused by on-the-job inhalation of heat, soot, chemicals, and asbestos and which, in turn, caused Decedent’s death. The workers’ compensation judge further found that on January 13, 1993, Mrs. Miletti’s counsel first notified the City of McKeesport that only as of December 7, 1992, did Dr. Chaudhry identify the cause of Decedent’s chronic respiratory problems as being work-related.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

However, the workers’ compensation judge rejected this argument and held that Mrs. Miletti had produced unequivocal and credible medical testimony that Decedent was disabled as a result of ILD prior to July 24, 1986 (the date he first received treatment by his physician). Because this date fell within 300 weeks following Decedent’s retirement in August 1983, Decedent established a compensable disability and satisfied the requirements of section 301(c)(2). The Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Board) affirmed. The Commonwealth Court, <em>en banc, </em>reversed the order of the Board. The court determined that Mrs. Miletti failed to meet the limitations for instituting a fatal claim petition under section 301(c)(2) because Decedent did not file a claim for benefits during his lifetime and his date of death was more than 300 weeks from his last date of employment.</p>

The Commonwealth Court erroneously concentrated on when <em>death </em>occurred and whether a lifetime disability claim was filed.

The judge also accepted as credible the testimony of Decedent’s fellow firefighter of twenty years, Albert Cipicchio, that Decedent was exposed to burning rubber, plastic wiring and asbestos, and that the City of McKeesport provided masks which restricted breathing, and therefore, were not usable.

A separate question arises whether section 301(c)(2) would permit death benefits to be awarded in a situation where a claim based upon disability occurring within 300 weeks would not meet the procedural or substantive requirements of the Act as of the time the death claim is filed. In such circumstances, it is arguable that the disability is not “compensable'' for purposes of section 301(c)(2). For example, the issue would present itself in a case in which, prior to the employee’s death, the three-year limitation period for the filing of a claim petition imposed by section 315 of the Act, 77 P.S. § 602, expired without a <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>lifetime claim having been filed, and where it is established that the employee was informed of the work-related nature of his disease. In the case at bar, although Decedent did not file a lifetime claim within three years after he suffered total disability, this court has held that the three-year period does not commence until such time as the employee is apprised by competent medical diagnosis that his disability is due to occupational disease. <em>See Price v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Bd. (Metallurgical Resources), </em><a href="/pa/533/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="533 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1837543" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0500-01">533 Pa. 500</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="533 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1837543" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0500-01">626 A.2d 114</a>, 117 (1993). Here, Decedent did not receive such diagnosis until December 1992, and the fatal claim petition was filed within one year’s time thereafter. Thus, section 315 is no impediment to the death claim, and the City of McKeesport has not suggested that the Act otherwise bars the underlying claim for disability.</p>
