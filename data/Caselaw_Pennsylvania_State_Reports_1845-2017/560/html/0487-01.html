Therefore, the facts upon which Appellant based his claim were not known to him and could not have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence until that date. At that time, his first PCRA petition was pending on appeal before this court. Within sixty days of the order denying relief pursuant to his first petition, he filed his second petition.

We reject Appellant’s suggestion that Attorney McMahon’s statements during a training session in 1986 or 1987 governed the conduct of a different prosecutor in 1985 merely because both attorneys worked in the same office. We have also previously determined that the tape is not sufficient to establish a policy of discrimination in jury selection by the prosecutors in the District Attorney’s Office of Philadelphia County. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Rather, the facts underpinning Appellant’s <em>Batson </em>claim (including the race of each potential juror, the prosecutor’s statement and the trial court’s refusal to make a record) have been present since the inception of his trial. Consequently, any <em>Batson </em>claim predicated upon these <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>previously existing facts does not fall within the exception enumerated under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(ii).

While such inaction may have constituted ineffectiveness of counsel, we cannot address Appellant’s untimely <em>Batson </em>claim merely because it is couched in terms of ineffectiveness, as this claim does not fall within any of the exceptions to the PCRA’s jurisdictional time bar. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Additionally, Appellant claims that he is entitled to review pursuant to Pennsylvania’s habeas corpus statute. However, the claims Appellant raises involve issues which are cognizable under the PCRA because they involve "[a] violation of the Constitution of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(f).
