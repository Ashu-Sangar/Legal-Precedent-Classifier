On July 11, 1992, claimant injured her right shoulder and elbow in the course of performing her duties. After initially denying her claim for workers’ compensation benefits, employer issued a Notice of Compensation Payable awarding claimant benefits. In January 1993, employer’s insurer requested that claimant be examined by employer’s medical expert, Dr. Kaymond Bruno. Dr. Bruno examined claimant and determined that claimant was able to perform light duty work with certain restrictions on her physical exertion. Claimant’s own physician, Dr. Floriel P. Diaz, did not believe claimant could return to light duty work, since, in his opinion, claimant was permanently injured and she had reached her maximum level of medical improvement.</p>

The Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ) credited the opinion of Dr. Bruno and rejected the testimony of Dr. Diaz. The WCJ concluded that claimant’s physical condition had changed and she was able to return to work in a light duty capacity. The WCJ also determined that employer had offered claimant an available job position within her capabilities and that she had failed to follow up on this referral in good faith. Accordingly, the WCJ modified claimant’s benefits. The Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB) affirmed. The Commonwealth Court reversed on the basis that the referral letter did not set forth a description of the job position that was offered. This court granted employer’s Petition for Allowance of Appeal to resolve the issue of whether employer’s referral letter satisfied employer’s burden of proof of an available job position pursuant to <em>Kachinski v.
