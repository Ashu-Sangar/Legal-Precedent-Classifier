According to Jimmy, the acts of sexual abuse took place at the Harley Hotel in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. (Notes of Testimony “N.T.” p. 21). At the time these acts allegedly occurred, appellant owned the hotel and Jimmy resided there with his mother and younger brother. (N.T. pp. 19-20). Some time in 1989 Jimmy was moved to a foster home. While in the foster home, Jimmy watched a film on “good touch bad touch”. (N.T. p. 27). After the film, several of the other foster children admitted being victimized by “bad touch”. Jimmy told his foster parents that he had also been sexually abused. (N.T. p. 27). Jimmy’s foster parents notified Montgomery County Children and Youth Services (CYS) of the alleged abuse. (N.T. p. 186). At the request of CYS, Maddi-Jane Sobel, a clinical social worker, interviewed Jimmy. (N.T. p. 103). In the initial interview on August 1, 1989, Ms. Sobel concluded that Jimmy had not been abused. (N.T. p. 104). Ms. Sobel interviewed Jimmy again on November 28, 1989 after which she concluded that Jimmy had been sexually abused. (N.T. p. 105). Jimmy was then interviewed by Detective Hart of the Montgomery County Detective Bureau in connection with a criminal investigation regarding the allegations of sexual abuse. (N.T. p. 148). Ms. Sobel interviewed Jimmy a third time on December 19, 1989 and additional <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>details of Jimmy’s sexual victimization were revealed.

(N.T. p. 106). The jury returned its verdict of guilty on all counts on September 12, 1990. Trial counsel prepared post-trial motions, which were filed on January 24, 1991. The post-trial motions did not preserve the objection, referenced above, to the expert testimony of Ms. Sobel. Post-trial motions were denied on February 11,1991.</p>

On August 24,1992 the Superior Court dismissed the appeal for failure of counsel to file a brief. Present counsel entered his appearance on December 4, 1996. Appellant then filed a petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541 et seq., seeking reinstatement of the right to a direct appeal, nunc pro tunc, and raising issues regarding the ineffectiveness of trial counsel. <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, appellant correctly raises the ineffectiveness of trial counsel, without the necessity of layering the claim referencing the conduct of prior appellate counsel whose representation had been found ineffective. It is as if the actions taken by first appellate counsel had not occurred. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In its opinion reinstating appellants right to a direct appeal, the trial court declined to address the merits of the claims raised regarding trial counsel’s ineffectiveness. The Superior Court reviewed the ineffectiveness claims as to trial counsel and denied relief, affirming the judgment of sentence. This court then granted a Petition for Allowance of Appeal, limited to appellant’s allegation of ineffectiveness regarding the omission of a meritorious issue by trial counsel in post-trial motions.</p>
    <p id="b1192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1192.4",1192,[242,1086,1164,1221]]]'>The burden of establishing a claim of counsel’s ineffectiveness is on the appellant, as counsel is presumed effective. <em>Commonwealth v.

In reviewing an ineffectiveness claim, the threshold inquiry is whether the issue/argument/tactic which counsel has foregone and which forms the basis for the assertion of ineffectiveness is of arguable merit. <em>Commonwealth v. Durst, </em><a href="/pa/522/0002-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="522 Pa. 2" data-case-ids="1818994" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0002-01">522 Pa. 2</a>, <a href="/pa/522/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="559 A.2d 504" data-case-ids="1818992,1818994" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0001-01,/pa/522/0002-01">559 A.2d 504</a> (1989). Should this threshold be met, we must then apply the “reasonable basis” test to determine if the-course chosen by counsel was designed to effectuate his client’s interest. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

      <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>Appellant’s claim of ineffectiveness requires that we first contemplate the admissibility of the expert witness’s testimony which appellant asserts improperly bolstered the credibility of the victim. To properly analyze this claim we must consider the context within which the testimony occurred. Prior to the expert’s testimony, Jimmy testified that during the year he resided at the Harley Hotel, appellant had anal and oral sex with him on at least ten occasions. (N.T. p. 21). On cross-examination, Jimmy admitted that he originally told Detective Hart that appellant had sex with him every day during the year Jimmy lived at the hotel. Jimmy admitted that the actual number of sexual encounters was 10, not 300. (N.T. p. 38). Jimmy testified that his first sexual encounter was with his mother and father at age three. (N.T. p. 24-25). Jimmy told of other sexual encounters that also occurred when he was three, with former neighbors in a trailer park. (N.T. p. 24). Jimmy testified that he had frequent sexual encounters while residing at the Harley Hotel with men other than appellant. According to Jimmy, he would sit with his mother at the bar and drink three or four beers, until his mother told him to go to his room. (N.T. p. 43). Once in his room men would knock on the door, saying that his mom had sent them. Jimmy, and sometimes his younger brother, would disrobe, and the men would have sex with them. (N.T. 44-45). Jimmy admitted that although he had revealed this information to his foster parents, when Ms. Sobel first interviewed him he did not tell her that he had ever been the victim of sexual abuse.

Trial counsel was quite candid with the trial court in detailing his intention to discredit Jimmy by underlining the incredible nature of Jimmy’s testimony and Jimmy’s delay in reporting the abuse. Trial counsel intended to cross-examine Ms. Sobel on her complete reversal of opinion regarding whether or not Jimmy had been abused between her first and second interviews with Jimmy. The thrust of the defense strategy was to demonstrate that this child fooled an expert <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>and therefore, he could easily fool the jury.

(N.T. 101-102). Thus, it concluded that counsel had no reason to pursue a fruitless exercise. We do not agree. To the contrary, we find that the cautionary instructions referred to by the Superior Court could not cure the impact of Ms. Sobel’s expert opinion. The instructions referred to were given before the objectionable testimony was uttered, and the instructions merely iterated the general rule on expert opinion testimony.

First, the Commonwealth avers that the testimony was properly admitted given the state of the law at the time of appellant’s trial; and second, that the trial strategy was to attack Jimmy’s credibility via the inconsistent findings in Ms. Sobel’s first and second reports regarding whether or not abuse had occurred. The Commonwealth attempts to support its first assertion by pointing to the fact that this court’s decision in <em>Dunkle </em>had not been issued at the time of appellant’s trial. As stated previously in this opinion, the testimony at issue was inadmissible under a long line of cases preceding <em>Dunkle, </em>and the Superior Court opinion in <em>Dunkle, </em>which was affirmed by this court in pertinent part, was available at the time of appellant’s trial.

Thus, the Commonwealth argues, it was properly permitted to bring out on re-direct that Ms. Sobel changed her opinion after the second and third interviews with Jimmy. The initial error in the Commonwealth’s argument here is that the testimony at issue was not brought out on re-direct as a response to the defense strategy. The prosecution on direct examination elicited the testimony regarding the general characteristics of sexually abused children, after an objection by trial counsel was overruled. (N.T. 105). Moving beyond the Commonwealth’s misstatement as to when this testimony came in, we acknowledge that the Commonwealth is correct in its analysis of counsel’s trial strategy. There is no doubt that an attack on Jimmy’s credibility was trial counsel’s strategy, and we agree that the strategy was reasonably intended to effectuate appellant’s interests. Further, we acknowledge that counsel pursued this strategy knowing full well that by <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>attacking the findings Ms. Sobel made in her initial report, the Commonwealth would rehabilitate her by reference to the second and third reports.- In fact, trial counsel wanted the Commonwealth to admit all three reports as that further illustrated for the jury that Jimmy fooled the expert and could not be taken at face value as a witness. (N.T. 175-178).</p>
    <p id="b1199-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1199.4",1199,[215,593,1154,954]]]'>However, we cannot agree that failure to preserve the objection to Ms. Sobel’s expert testimony on the general characteristics of abused children, which testimony directly bolstered the credibility of Jimmy, was part of that strategy. If we would accept the Commonwealth’s assertion, the fact that trial counsel made the objection at all is without rational explanation. Further, by admitting the testimony at issue, the points defense counsel wanted to highlight regarding Jimmy’s delay in reporting the abuse, and the fact that he originally convinced Ms. Sobel that he had not been abused, were completely undone. We do not agree with the Commonwealth’s assertion that trial counsel intentionally omitted this meritorious claim from post-trial motions in keeping with the trial strategy of vitiating the credibility of the Commonwealth’s primary witness. Rather, we find the admission of such damaging testimony by Ms. Sobel was in direct conflict with the designed strategy of showing the jury that Jimmy was not credible.</p>

In <em>Townsell, </em>this court held that failure to preserve an issue of arguable merit for appellate review constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Given trial counsel’s concern regarding Ms. Sobel’s testimony as an expert witness, a concern reflected in the fact that he did object to her expert testimony and move to strike same, there can be no discernible reason for failing to preserve this issue in post-trial motions.</p>

Here the Commonwealth points to the testimony of the physician, which revealed anal scarring and tightening of the sphincter muscle consistent with sexual abuse. The Commonwealth also points to the details of the abuse revealed by Jimmy and related by him to his foster parents to support the claim that the abuse did occur. The fact that Jimmy was sexually abused is only one of the issues this jury had to resolve the other issue was whether or not appellant caused that abuse. By permitting Ms. Sobel to bolster the credibility of Jimmy, the jury was not only led to believe that abuse occurred, but also that appellant was the abuser. Only Jimmy’s testimony related appellant to the crimes at issue. As trial counsel brought out in cross-examination of the Commonwealth witnesses, other persons identified by Jimmy as his sexual partners were not located. (N.T. 154-156). In addition, there was no physical or circumstantial evidence supporting the details Jimmy testified to regarding his sexual encounters with appellant. Jimmy had <em>given </em>statements and testified that appellant photographed him during sex and videotaped their encounters. When appellant was arrested and his apartment searched, no photographs, cameras, VCR equipment, or pornography was found. (N.T. 85). The Commonwealth’s assertion that such overwhelming evidence of appellant’s guilt was presented that appellant cannot establish prejudice by the admission of Ms. Sobel’s expert testimony is not borne out by the record.</p>

However, I am unable to agree that Ms. Sobel’s testimony was not offered to (and did not have the effect of) bolstering the child victim’s credibility, or that trial counsel’s strategy necessarily required that the Commonwealth be permitted to offer expert opinion to serve as a counterweight. Indeed, to allow testimony of the kind presented here simply because the defense elects to challenge the victim’s credibility through the use of the victim’s prior inconsistent statements would vitiate the evidentiary principles embodied in <em>Commonwealth v.

Rather, it is evident from a review of both the cross-examination of the child and of Sobel that the testimony was not used to bolster the testimony of either witness. Instead, defense counsel used the testimony of Sobel as an intentional trial strategy to undermine the statements of the child and to show that Sobel initially did not believe that the child was abused. It was also <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>used to set forth the many inconsistent and contrary statements that this child made to the authorities involved, including Sobel.</p>

Defense counsel raised the child’s differing stories to the investigators, including Sobel, regarding the dates of the abuse, the number of other men involved in the abuse, and the location of the sexual acts at issue. <em>(Id. ) </em>The boy admitted during this cross-examination that he told Sobel, in his first meeting with her in August of 1989, that “none of this happened to him.” (N.T. at 52.)</p>

The court <em>even </em>made a point to note on the record that he admitted Sobel’s testimony because of the request of defense counsel. The trial court stated:</p>

(Emphasis added) The trial court had defense counsel place on the record that testimony of Sobel was introduced as his trial strategy. Defense counsel specifically indicated that he “took it upon himself to elicit that opinion testimony.” (N.T. at 176.) Counsel further explained that the reasons he elicited the testimony was that at the first interview, the expert witness wrote a report indicating that she believed that the boy had not been sexually assaulted, and that it was only after the second and third interviews that the child had said he was abused. Defense counsel went on to state that:</p>

Before Sobel testified, the trial court instructed the jury that “she is permitted to testify first as a fact witness, as to some of the facts that occurred and second, she is also permitted to tell you about manifestations of sexual abuse in children generally.” (N.T. at 102.) Later, the court instructed the jury:</p>

I believe that the evidence at trial was sufficiently strong to establish that the child had been abused. In particular, the testimony of the pediatrician revealed anal scarring and tightening of the sphincter muscle consistent with sexual abuse and the details of the abuse revealed by the boy and related by him to his foster parents support the claim that the abuse did occur. The child steadfastly identified Appellant as one of his abusers and did not waver from this testimony despite his age and the fact that he was subjected to extensive cross-examination. As set forth above, I do not agree that the testimony of Sobel was used to bolster the credibility of the child. In fact, defense counsel used it in just the opposite manner and yet the jury concluded that Appellant did indeed rape and sodomize this child on repeated occasions. This case is not like <em>Seese, Rounds </em>or <em>Davis </em>where the expert gave testimony directly commenting on the truthfulness of the victim and I would accordingly affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

She also was asked about the reasons why she re-interviewed the child in November of 1989 and in response detailed the claims of sexual abuse that the boy at that time reported. The assistant district attorney then questioned her regarding the reasons the child did not disclose to her in the first interview that he had been abused, but did so in the subsequent interviews (N.T. at 103— 105.) In the course of this questioning, Sobel indicated that it was "normal” for children initially not to disclose incidents of abuse and gave a general description of children who have been sexually abused.
