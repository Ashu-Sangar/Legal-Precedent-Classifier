For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Superior Court.</p>

Unbeknownst to appellant, the police had placed a court-authorized wiretap on two telephones in the bar where he worked and had secretly recorded his telephone conversations pertaining to the potential sale or trade of controlled substances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In addition, the police had placed a body wire on an informant in order to record several face-to-face drug transactions with the appellant.</p>

Prior to playing the tapes, the prosecution distributed previously-prepared transcripts of the tapes to each member of the jury to assist them in following the conversations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In addition, Pennsylva<a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>nia State Trooper Vincent Pothoff, who had prepared the transcripts for each of the taped conversations, testified as to whose voices were about to be heard on the tapes and as to the date and/or time that the conversation was recorded. After each of the tapes was played for the jury, Trooper Pothoff testified as to the substance of the conversation that the jury had just heard. Additionally, nine of the individuals whose voices were heard on the tape recordings testified that they had listened to the tapes as the tapes were being played for the jury and agreed that it was their voices that had been captured on the tapes. These individuals also testified that they agreed with Trooper Pothoff s trial characterization of the conversations.</p>

The trial judge discussed the jury’s request with both counsel and appellant’s trial counsel objected to the transcripts going out with the jury during its deliberations. The trial judge overruled counsel’s objection and allowed the transcripts to go out with the jury with the following instruction:</p>

The jury found appellant guilty of twenty-three counts of Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance and one count of Criminal Conspiracy.

The jury should be assisted, not hindered, in conducting that search. Here, it is plain that the jury was seeking a complete understanding of how the voluminous evidence related to the specific crimes with which appellant was charged. After two hours of deliberation, the jury asked for the name of each person involved with appellant in <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>each count as well as the tapes and transcripts pertaining to those counts. The trial court properly realized that the transcripts could serve as an index to the tapes, assisting the jurors in finding those tapes that they wished to replay and allowing them to more easily correlate which of the seventeen recorded voices they were listening to with the corresponding counts charged against appellant. Not only did the trial court appropriately instruct the jurors that they could review the transcripts for these narrowly circumscribed purposes, but the court also clearly instructed the jury that they, as jurors, were independently responsible for ascertaining the <em>content </em>of the tapes. Under these somewhat daunting factual circumstances, with the jury attempting to match a large number of unfamiliar tape-recorded voices to an even larger number of counts describing disparate incidents of narcotics trafficking, the trial court prudently addressed the situation by permitting the jury to use the transcripts as limited guideposts to the recordings. Far from exhibiting manifest unreasonableness, the trial court’s decision was grounded in common sense and allowed the jury to evaluate and weigh the evidence in an efficient and reliable manner. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>

We cannot discern any policy considerations that militate against the weight of the overwhelming federal precedent on this subject. Indeed, it would be illogical and unfair to allow jurors to render a verdict on the basis of faulty recollection of evidence instead of the evidence itself. We cannot discern any reason why the jurors should be compelled to rely on their fleeting memories of the evidence when the evidence itself is readily available. In short, sound policy considerations militate in favor of interpreting Pa. R.Crim.P. 1114 so as to allow jurors to view evidence, such as the transcripts herein, with the precautions that were taken by the trial judge.</p>

Therefore, the Rules attempt to limit the opportunity for juries to unduly emphasize individual pieces of evidence. For example, Pa.R.Crim.P. 1113 prohibits jurors from taking notes during the course of trials because they might place undue emphasis and reliance on their notes, rather than rely on their collective recollection of the evidence and testimony presented at the trial. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 1113; <em>Thornton v.

Similarly, Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114(2) prohibits trial judges from permitting a jury to review transcripts of trial testimony during its deliberations, because of the risk that the jury will place undue emphasis on the testimony set forth in the transcripts and abandon its duty to rely on its collective recollection of the evidence and testimony presented at trial. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114(2); <em>Commonwealth v.

In addition, I believe that the dangers to the deliberative process that are created when a trial court permits a jury to review transcripts of tape-recorded conversations during its deliberations outweigh any potential probative value that the transcripts may have. Accordingly, I would find that the trial court’s decision to permit the jury to review the transcripts of the tape-recorded conversations during its deliberations was manifestly unreasonable, and therefore constituted an abuse of its discretion.</p>

In my view, the transcripts of the tapes provided to the jury during its deliberations in the instant case were tantamount to transcripts of trial testimony, which juries are never permitted to take with them during their deliberations pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114(2). In much the same manner as calling individuals to testify at trial, playing the tapes for the jury allowed it to hear Appellant and numerous other individuals relay information concerning the drug transactions which formed the basis of the Commonwealth’s case against Appellant. Therefore, I fail to see an appreciable distinction between permitting a jury to review transcripts of live trial testimony and permitting the jury in the instant case to review the transcripts of the tape-recorded conversations. In addition, I see little difference between permitting the jury to review a defendant’s recorded confession during its deliberations, which is prohibited by Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114(2), and permitting the jury to review the transcripts during its deliberations in the instant case. In the taped conversations that were the subject of the transcripts here, Appellant himself discussed multiple potential purchases and sales of illegal drugs. Although the tapes do not technically constitute confessions by Appellant to the crimes with which he was charged, I believe that the potential prejudicial effect of the transcripts is similar, if not identical to the prejudicial effect that would result from the jury having an opportunity to review a defendant’s recorded confession during its deliberations.</p>
