    <p id="b884-7" data-blocks='[["BL_884.6",884,[238,558,1162,1170]]]'>On December 23, 1986, Appellant, William Basemore (“Basemore”), gained entry, without permission, to the premises of his former employer, the Riverfront Dinner Theater in Philadelphia, by removing slats in the window of the men’s bathroom. Using a homemade hook device, he pulled through the window an acetylene tank, an oxygen tank, a cutting torch, and martial arts weapons, which included a knife and a homemade spear that had attached a throwing knife and a four-point throwing star at opposite ends. Once inside, Base-more murdered an elderly security guard, stabbing him with the knife several times in the neck, chest, and shoulder area. Basemore then dragged the guard’s body into the sales office where a safe was located, and, using the cutting torch, breached the safe and removed money and imitation gold coins. Upon fleeing, Basemore left behind the safe-cutting equipment and his weapons. The police ultimately traced these items to Basemore and later executed arrest and search warrants at his residence, at which time Basemore made certain incriminating statements. In addition, the search revealed items taken from the Riverfront Dinner Theater safe, martial arts equipment similar to that found - at the scene, and clothing of Basemore stained with the victim’s blood.</p>

The trial court questioned counsel as to his preparedness, and counsel responded by outlining his preparation for the guilt phase of the trial. Upon being satisfied that counsel was ready to proceed, the trial court denied Basemore’s requests. Apparently dissatisfied with the trial court’s ruling, Basemore repeatedly disrupted the jury selection proceedings, stating at one point that he had placed counsel under surveillance, and <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>that civil suits were pending against counsel, neither of which was true. When Basemore refused to abide by the court’s order to refrain from such conduct, he was removed from the courtroom for the remainder of the trial.</p>
    <p id="b885-4" data-blocks='[["BL_885.4",885,[217,478,1149,843]]]'>As a result of Basemore’s behavior, the trial court ordered a mental health evaluation, which was conducted by a psychiatrist, Robert Stanton, M.D., who had evaluated Basemore approximately six months earlier in connection with an unrelated robbery (also involving a former employer). In his previous evaluation, Dr. Stanton noted that Basemore denied any history of psychiatric illness, treatment or hospitalization and denied experiencing delusions, hallucinations or suicidal ideation. Dr. Stanton found Basemore to be alert and cooperative and concluded that his insight and judgment were adequate. Although Dr. Stanton reported that Basemore suffered some degree of anxiety and suspicion, he found no evidence of psychosis. Dr. Stanton diagnosed Basemore as having a mixed personality disorder, with passive-aggressive and schizoid features, also noting that Basemore appeared to have underlying emotional instability.</p>
    <p id="b885-5" data-blocks='[["BL_885.5",885,[215,1346,1151,467]]]'>In the second evaluation, conducted at the beginning of Basemore’s trial, Dr. Stanton referenced his earlier report, reiterating the same diagnoses. On this occasion, however, Basemore was unwilling to provide any information. Nevertheless, Dr. Stanton found no evidence of psychosis, noting that Basemore’s behavior, specifically his refusal to cooperate, appeared to be volitional. Thus, Dr. Stanton concluded that there was no reason to believe that Basemore’s ability to take part in the trial was impaired by any psychotic process.</p>

Prior to the penalty phase, the defense obtained a ruling from the trial court limiting the use of Basemore’s prior robbery conviction to rebutting character evidence suggesting that he was truthful or law-abiding. The trial court also ruled that the conviction would be admissible to rebut an argument’ that Basemore had no significant history of prior criminal convictions pursuant to the statutory mitigator in Section 9711(e)(1) of the <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1). The Commonwealth sought to establish as an aggravating circumstance that Basemore had committed the murder during the perpetration of a felony. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6).</p>
    <p id="b886-5" data-blocks='[["BL_886.4",886,[240,484,1161,944]]]'>In addition to limiting the defense mitigation evidence consistent with the trial court’s ruling, trial counsel elected not to present testimony from certain of Basemore’s family members. In particular, counsel was concerned that those family members who lived with Basemore had access to the fruits of the crime (the money and gold coins) and could be cross-examined regarding their knowledge of such items. Counsel also declined to present testimony from Basemore’s mother because she had provided a statement to the police in which she indicated that Basemore practiced karate at night in a cemetery. Thus, the defense offered in mitigation: Base-more’s age at the time of the offense, twenty-two years; through the testimony from his former girlfriend, Stacy Williams, that he had a son to whom he had contributed financial support; and that he had participated in community activities. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4), (8). The jury found the aggravating circumstance but no mitigating circumstances and sentenced Basemore to death.</p>

As part of a pre-sentence investigation, Dr. Stanton evaluated Base-more for a third time. Dr. Stanton reiterated many of the findings from his previous examinations, specifically, that Basemore showed no evidence of psychosis, and that he had a mixed personality disorder with passive aggressive and schizoid features in addition to an underlying emotional disorder. Dr. Stanton concluded that Basemore did not have a major mental illness and was capable of taking part in the sentencing proceeding. The pre-sentence report from Basemore’s prior robbery conviction was updated, and it indicated, <em>inter alia, </em>that Basemore “always received the material necessities as well as the emotional needs including love, attention, guidance and proper discipline according to him and his mother.” Post-<a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>verdict motions were denied, and Basemore was sentenced on the remaining offenses.

In his petition, Basemore alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for: failing to call certain witnesses during the guilt phase of the trial; not objecting to the testimony from the proprietor of a martial arts store where Basemore had purchased martial arts supplies; and not objecting to the admissibility of the Commonwealth’s blood evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Counsel was appointed and, on July 26, 1995, filed a letter stating that Basemore’s petition was without merit and that there were no meritorious issues that could be presented in an amended petition. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Subsequently, counsel moved to withdraw the “no merit letter” and to submit an amended PCRA petition alleging, in pertinent part, trial counsel’s ineffectiveness in failing to investigate, prepare and present certain mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of trial. The PCRA court ordered the “no merit letter” withdrawn and allowed Basemore to amend his PCRA petition. On January 10, 1996, counsel from the Center for Legal Education, Advocacy &amp; Defense Assistance (“CLEADA”) also entered an appearance on behalf of Basemore.</p>

During the hearings, Basemore <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>presented testimony from Stacy Williams and an individual with whom he worked, Cheryl Hawkins, with both women relating that Basemore was withdrawn, dressed strangely, and, at times, thought he was David Bowie or a ninja. Ms. Williams said that trial counsel never asked her about Base-more’s behavior, and Ms. Hawkins testified that she was never contacted. Basemore’s sisters, Charlotte Emfinger and Angelina Coleman, brother, Dennis Mease, and mother, Josephine Mease, testified that Basemore was physically abused as a child by his father, acted and dressed strangely, and, when he was eight or nine years of age, had fallen from a second story window striking his head.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Ms. Emfinger also related that Basemore thought that he was a ninja.

    <p id="b888-5" data-blocks='[["BL_888.4",888,[235,1047,1160,726]]]'>Testimony was also presented from a psychologist, Jethrow Toomer, who evaluated Basemore in September of 1995 and diagnosed him as having schizophrenia, without hallucinations, which he characterized as a schizo-affective disorder. “ Dr. Toomer opined that Basemore was suffering from this disorder at the time he committed the murder, that it was an extreme mental or emotional disorder, and that Basemore did not understand the criminality of his conduct. Although Dr. Toomer agreed with Dr. Stanton’s earlier findings, he noted that schizoid personality traits often precede schizophrenia. Dr. Toomer indicated that Basemore’s response to certain test questions suggested that he may suffer from some organic impairment, although there were no objective test results to confirm such a conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b888-6" data-blocks='[["BL_888.5",888,[236,1804,1158,256]],["BL_889.1",889,[226,241,1150,901]]]'>In addition, Basemore presented testimony from Robert Phillips, M.D., a forensic psychiatrist, who evaluated Base-more in November of 1996. Dr. Phillips reached a different diagnosis than Dr. Toomer, concluding that Basemore suffered from bipolar disorder and a personality disorder with schizoid <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>and narcissistic features. Dr. Phillips disagreed with Dr. Toomer’s opinion that Basemore lacked the capacity to understand the criminality of his conduct, but agreed that Basemore was suffering from an extreme mental and emotional disturbance at the time of the offense, and that his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired. While acknowledging that Basemore was not acutely psychotic during Dr. Stanton’s examinations, Dr. Phillips stated that there were some indications in Dr. Stanton’s reports that would warrant further exploration, particularly, the references to an underlying emotional instability. Both Dr. Toomer and Dr. Phillips conceded that there were no hospital records on Basemore reflecting any mental health issues; nor did his school and prison records indicate any issue in this regard. Thus, their diagnoses were essentially based upon interviews with Basemore and information from his friends and family members.</p>

Trial counsel explained that he had interviewed Basemore regarding his background and conducted a similar inquiry of Basemore’s mother in his numerous conversations, and that there was never any mention of mental health problems, head trauma, or Basemore’s difficult childhood. Indeed, to the contrary, trial counsel testified that Basemore’s letters and conversations suggested the absence of such circumstances. Although trial counsel had no specific recollection of the exact questions he asked, he said that his general practice was to also inquire of his clients about past medical and psychiatric treatment. In addition, trial counsel indicated that he explained to Basemore and his family the nature of the penalty phase of trial and the role of mitigating evidence, asking for any information that may be helpful. Trial counsel also obtained Basemore’s school records and, although he did not have the pre-sentence report and the initial mental health evaluation, he reviewed Dr. Stanton’s second mental health evaluation. Notably, trial counsel testified that nothing in the second evaluation alerted him to a mental health issue for purposes of mitigation, since the diagnoses did not, in coun<a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>sel’s opinion, constitute a major mental illness. Indeed, trial counsel acknowledged that had he been aware of Basemore’s diagnoses as testified to by Drs. Toomer and Phillips, he would have considered presenting such evidence.</p>
    <p id="b890-5" data-blocks='[["BL_890.4",890,[250,471,1161,688]]]'>Appellate counsel testified that, as is his practice, he reviewed the pre-sentence and psychiatric reports with Base-more, and that he never received information suggesting that Basemore was abused as a child, suffered any trauma, or had mental health problems. Based upon Dr. Stanton’s conclusion that Basemore did not have a major mental illness, appellate counsel did not investigate whether any mental health issues existed. Although the Commonwealth obtained an additional listing of the case for the purposes of consulting with an expert and presenting rebuttal testimony, no rebuttal testimony was presented, and the Commonwealth rested relying primarily upon its cross-examination of Basemore’s witnesses and Dr. Stanton’s competency evaluations.</p>
    <p id="b890-6" data-blocks='[["BL_890.5",890,[250,1182,1160,803]]]'>Near the conclusion of the PCRA hearings, counsel from CLEADA orally indicated to the court his intention to supplement Basemore’s PCRA petition with a claim that there had been discrimination in the jury selection process. This claim was premised primarily upon a video training tape allegedly utilized by the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office at or about the time of Basemore’s trial. At that time, the PCRA court granted leave to file, but expressed an unwillingness to consider evidence or grant favorable consideration. Subsequently, CLEADA filed a “Supplement to Petition for Habeas Corpus Relief and for Post Conviction Relief,” which requested an evidentiary hearing and alleged that Basemore was entitled to a new trial as the training tape reflected that the District Attorney’s Office had a policy of exercising peremptory challenges to jurors in a racially discriminatory manner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Regarding Basemore’s argument of racial bias in the jury selection process, the PCRA court determined that it was premised upon pure speculation. Respecting the penalty phase claim, although it did not make specific factual findings or resolve the credibility issues stemming from the conflicting testimony of trial counsel and Basemore’s family members, the PCRA court stated that counsel was never advised of any evidence indicating that Basemore was abused as a child or suffered from mental health problems. The court thus concluded that counsel was not ineffective for failing to investigate “a family background or mental illness about which he was never told.” Moreover, the PCRA court concluded that Basemore had failed to establish that the proposed mental health testimony would have been admissible, since neither expert testified that Basemore’s mental illness existed at the time of his offense,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and their opinions were based solely upon information from Basemore and his family.</p>

For example, in his brief before this Court, Basemore contends that the prosecutor used nineteen of his peremptory challenges to remove African-American venirepersons; however, the allegation was not included in Basemore’s supplemental post-conviction petition, nor was any witness identified or documentary proof attached. Moreover, although Base-more’s brief contains numerous citations to the record of the jury selection proceedings in support of this contention, our review of such record fails to reveal the race of any of the jurors removed by the prosecution. While Basemore also notes that voter registration data contains such information, this material was not provided in connection with the supplemental petition, and the difficulties inherent in the attempt to reconstruct a record including the race of all venirepersons in a jury pool are apparent. Thus, it is clear that Basemore’s claim does not comport with the traditional means for establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case under <em>Batson.</em>

Respecting Basemore’s purportedly traumatic childhood and head injury, the PCRA court’s sole finding was “that [trial counsel] spoke with petitioner and his mother on more than one occasion and neither of them alluded to any abuse during petitioner’s childhood or to mental problems in petitioner’s background.” From this statement, it appears that the PCRA court may have sought to credit trial counsel’s testimony that he interviewed both Basemore and his mother regarding background information, described the penalty phase to Base-more and his family, asked for any information that may be helpful, and was never advised of the allegedly traumatic childhood and head injury. Such an interpretation would also be supported by the testimony of appellate counsel and the statement in the pre-sentence report that Basemore “always received the material necessities as well as the emotional needs including love, attention, guidance and proper discipline according to him and his mother.” This evidence and the inferences that can be drawn from it, however, are contradicted by the testimony of Basemore’s mother and other family members to the effect that trial counsel had never inquired into Basemore’s background. Rather than resolving this credibility issue, the PCRA court skirted it by merely concluding that trial counsel was not advised of the potentially mitigating evidence. Obviously, however, different light falls upon counsel’s performance depending upon whether he asked and was not told, or he did not ask and therefore was not told. <em>See generally Strickland, </em><a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">466 U.S. at 690-91</a>, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">104 S.Ct. at 2066</a>.

Further, counsel conceded that he did not make a range of specific inquiries into the mental health area and, indeed, could affirmatively testify only that his general practice was to inquire about past medical or psychiatric treatment. Yet, trial counsel was also aware of a pattern of unusual behavior on Basemore’s part, specifically, his dressing as a ninja and practicing martial arts in a cemetery, and the incorporation of parallel oddities into the circumstances of the crime.

Nevertheless, ineffectiveness is not limited to such circumstances. Moreover, the present circumstances suggest that counsel may have had a duty to further pursue the mental health issues, the record does not reflect any strategic reason for the decision not to investigate further, and, if the testimony of Basemore’s experts is believed, the mental health evidence is not of such a nature that its impact was of speculative weight and may have been interpreted as unfavorable. <em>Cf.
