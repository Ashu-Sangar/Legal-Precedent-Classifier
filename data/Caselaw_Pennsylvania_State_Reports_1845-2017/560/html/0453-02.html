This does not imply that stock options have no value at the time they are granted. Stock options are valuable inducements to attract and retain employees and to compensate them for their services. The holder of a stock option can reap the benefits of stock price increases without bearing the risks of stock price declines. However, at the time that the stock option is granted, its “value” is purely speculative, for should the fair market value of the stock drop below the purchase price of the option, the exercise of the option on or after its maturity date would result in a loss to the holder of the option — i.e. the option would be worthless. In contrast, should the fair market value of the stock rise above the purchase price of the option, the exercise of the option on or after its maturity date would result in a gain to the holder of the option. Further, the holder of the stock option may well choose not to exercise the option.

When Appellee exercised the 1984 and 1985 options and purchased ALCOA stock at below market value, he was free to immediately resell the ALCOA stock and realize the associated spreads. Instead, Appellee chose to retain the ALCOA stock, thereby speculating in the stock market.
