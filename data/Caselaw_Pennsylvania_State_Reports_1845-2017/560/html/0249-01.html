Rule 1509 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, governing PCRA petitions in capital cases, grants authority to the PCRA court, after a review of the petition, answer and other matters of record, to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is required. Here, appellant requested an evidentiary hearing on the issues raised in his PCRA petition, but the PCRA court determined that a decision could be made from the existing record and denied appellant’s hearing request.

    <p id="b875-5" data-blocks='[["BL_875.6",875,[219,379,1152,1270]]]'>Appellant’s first ineffectiveness claim is that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court’s penalty phase instructions that, appellant alleges, violated <em>Mills v. Maryland, </em><a href="/us/486/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="486 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6217594" data-case-paths="/us/486/0367-01">486 U.S. 367</a>, <a href="/us/486/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="486 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6217594" data-case-paths="/us/486/0367-01">108 S.Ct. 1860</a>, <a href="/us/486/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="486 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6217594" data-case-paths="/us/486/0367-01">100 L.Ed.2d 384</a> (1988). Specifically, appellant contends that the trial court’s instructions failed to inform the jury that it is not required that mitigating circumstances be unanimously found and that the instructions created the misimpression that mitigating circumstances must be found unanimously. The trial court instructed the jury that “your verdict must be a sentence of death if you unanimously find at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance or if you unanimously find one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.” N.T. 2/5/86 at 66. First, <em>Mills </em>was not decided at the time of appellant’s 1986 trial; thus, his trial counsel cannot be ineffective for failing to raise an objection to the jury charge based upon <em>Mills, </em>and his appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise this meritless claim of ineffectiveness of trial counsel on direct appeal. Second, the trial court’s instruction to the jury directly tracks the statutory language, and this Court has upheld an identical instruction in <em>Commonwealth v. Banks, </em><a href="/pa/540/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="540 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="472193" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0143-01">540 Pa. 143</a>, 150, <a href="/pa/540/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="656 A.2d 467" data-case-ids="472193,7869373" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0143-01,/a2d/656/0467-01">656 A.2d 467</a>, 470 (1995).

Appellant cites not one single action counsel should have taken that he failed to take, nor does appellant point to a single shred of evidence that his counsel <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>might have turned up had he conducted an independent crime-scene investigation. Appellant also fails to demonstrate that a different result might have obtained had counsel conducted his trial preparation differently or that he was prejudiced thereby. This court has repeatedly held that we will not consider ineffectiveness claims in a vacuum. <em>Commonwealth v. Morris, </em><a href="/pa/546/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="546 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="466738" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0296-01">546 Pa. 296</a>, 312, <a href="/pa/546/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="684 A.2d 1037" data-case-ids="466738,7359447" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0296-01,/a2d/684/1037-01">684 A.2d 1037</a>, 1045 (1996). Thus, we will not find counsel ineffective here where appellant fails to allege with specificity sufficient facts in support of his claim.</p>
    <p id="b876-5" data-blocks='[["BL_876.4",876,[230,760,1159,527]]]'>Appellant next claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to cross-examine certain prosecution witnesses adequately, for failing to call additional defense witnesses and for failing to object to the admission of a hatchet into evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Appellant argues that his trial counsel did not adequately cross-examine two witnesses, St. Clair Holman and Janet Lomax, whose testimony, he contends, would have shown that the victim and her boyfriend argued shortly before the murder, thereby creating the possible inference that the victim’s boyfriend actually committed the murder.</p>
    <p id="b876-6" data-blocks='[["BL_876.5",876,[228,1319,1161,526]]]'>The record belies this claim. Appellant’s trial counsel cross-examined Holman, who stated that the victim and her boyfriend had never argued in his presence. N.T. 2/3/86 at 35-38, 46, 50. Trial counsel did not cross-examine Lomax for the simple reason that trial counsel had called Lomax as a witness on direct. Furthermore, Lomax’s testimony does not support the theory that the victim’s boyfriend is actually the murderer. N.T. 2/4/86 at 118-26. Trial counsel cannot be found ineffective where the testimony elicited from witnesses did not support the theory of the crime espoused by appellant.</p>

Holman’s testimony at trial was that the victim and her boyfriend had never argued in his presence. The level of emotion shown by the boyfriend on the night of the murder is not proof that he committed the crime. Appellant has failed to demonstrate how this officer’s testimony might have affected the outcome of the trial given that both Holman and the boyfriend testified and were cross-examined on these very issues.</p>
    <p id="b877-5" data-blocks='[["BL_877.4",877,[219,700,1155,674]]]'>Next, appellant claims that his counsel failed to call certain witnesses who would have testified to seeing the victim in a bar prior to the murder with two men, one of whom the witnesses identified as appellant. The witnesses supposedly would have given contradictory descriptions of the two men who were with the victim, thereby diluting the identification of appellant. Trial counsel, instead of calling these witnesses, made the strategic decision to call only one witness who testified that he saw the victim in the bar with her boyfriend. This testimony was consistent with appellant’s theory that the boyfriend actually murdered the victim. Therefore, it was a reasonable strategy by counsel not to call the witnesses and was therefore not ineffective assistance.</p>
