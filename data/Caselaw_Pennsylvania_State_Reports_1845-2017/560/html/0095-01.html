Accordingly, the Commonwealth must seek to impeach a defendant’s relation of events by reference only to inconsistencies as they factually exist, not to the purported inconsistency between silence at arrest and testimony at trial. Silence at the time of arrest may become a factual inconsistency in the face of an assertion by the accused while testifying at trial that he related this version to the police at the time of arrest when in fact he remained silent. <em>Doyle v.

In the face of these accusations and denials, there was no overwhelming evidence of guilt. Hence, credibility was pivotal to the outcome of trial. The reference to appellant’s post-arrest silence would not only have raised an adverse inference of guilt but would also have undermined his credibility insofar as his denial, at trial, of the allegations against him, particularly with regard to the abuse of Terry Foster. The testimony in question plainly served to impeach appellant’s denial of the charges and his explanation of facts relating to his interactions with the three boys, these being matters that appellant addressed for the first time at trial. Jurors were given the opportunity to have concluded that if appellant were not guilty, he would not have waited until trial to assert his innocence. It cannot be said as a matter of law that this improperly elicited testimony could not have affected the verdict, thus, due to trial counsel’s failure to object, appellant is entitled to a new trial.</p>

In that statement, appellant stated that Williams was making up the charges because appellant had not bought Williams a car that Williams believed appellant owed him. N.T. 3/7/99 at 25. The prosecutor later asked Officer Rok if appellant said anything when charges were subsequently filed involving a second victim, Terry Foster. To this question, the officer responded in the negative. N.T. 3/7/99.at 27. However, on cross-examination, trial counsel elicited from Officer Rok that he had not questioned appellant <em>at all </em>concerning the charges relating to Foster or the third victim, Eric McAfee, and that, in fact, the only time that Officer Rok spoke to appellant was when appellant was arrested on the charges relating to Williams, at which time appellant denied the charges relating to Williams.
