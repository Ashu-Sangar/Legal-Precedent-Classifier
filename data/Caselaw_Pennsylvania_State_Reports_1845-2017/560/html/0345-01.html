There were three occupants in the car, including the driver. Appellant R.A., a minor, was sitting in the back seat of the car. Trooper Oberdorf pulled the car over. After stopping in a service station parking lot, the driver of the stopped car jumped out of the car and began moving away from it.

During the pat-down, Oberdorf felt what appeared to be a cigarette or cigar and something similar to a pill bottle in the liner of R.A.’s jacket. Upon removing the items and visually inspecting them, Oberdorf determined that the cigar was hollowed out and contained marijuana, and that the pill bottle, which had a pop off lid, contained crack cocaine.

      <em>Dickerson </em>carefully circumscribes the application • of the plain feel doctrine to situations where an officer, while lawfully conducting a <em>Terry </em>frisk for weapons, plainly feels an object that is immediately apparent to him as contraband. In <em>Commonwealth v. Fink, </em>a case which examined the immediately apparent requirement of the plain feel doctrine, the arresting officer testified that during a pat-down search of the defendant he felt an object resembling “a regular smoking pipe without the stem.” <a href="/a2d/700/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="700 A.2d 447" data-case-ids="11899600" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/0447-01">700 A.2d 447</a>, 450 (Pa.Super.1997), <em>appeal denied, </em><a href="/citations/?q=552%20Pa.%20694" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="552 Pa. 694">552 Pa. 694</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=716%20A.2d%201247" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="716 A.2d 1247">716 A.2d 1247</a> (1998). The officer also testified that, in his experience, he had seen pipes of the size and shape felt in the defendant’s pocket used for smoking marijuana. After removing the object from the defendant’s pocket, the officer found it to be a marijuana pipe. In finding that the search was not justified under the plain feel doctrine, the <em>Fink </em>court concluded that the illegal nature of the object was not immediately apparent to the officer because pipes, although sometimes used to smoke marijuana, can also be used to smoke legal substances. <em>Id. </em>at 451.</p>
