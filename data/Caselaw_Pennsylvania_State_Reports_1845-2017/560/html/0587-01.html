We granted certification on the basis that the answer to this question would provide guidance in determining bridge ownership throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

Underlying the dispute is the question of who must pay to maintain and repair the bridge. Conrail, Amtrak, and the City all deny ownership, seeking to avoid responsibility for such costs.</p>
    <p id="b1209-10" data-blocks='[["BL_1209.10",1209,[204,1982,1152,313]],["BL_1210.1",1210,[256,249,1162,1118]]]'>The facts material to this case are not in dispute. In 1875, a steel and timber bridge was constructed to allow 41st Street to cross above the railroad right-of-way. That bridge was replaced by the present, now-deteriorated steel and concrete structure that was built in 1929. The City acknowledges that it is the owner of similar bridges that cross the same railroad <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>right-of-way at 40th and 42nd Streets. The supporting columns of the 41st Street bridge rest on the railroad right-of-way. Six railroad tracks lie within that right-of-way. Four of the tracks are owned by Amtrak, and two are owned by Conrail. The existing bridge was built pursuant to an ordinance of the City that required PRR to build and maintain the bridge at its own expense under supervision of the Philadelphia Department of Public Works. On behalf of PRR a document was signed accepting the terms of the ordinance on May 11, 1927. This document is known as the “ordinance agreement.” PRR and its successor, the Penn Central Transportation Company (Penn Central), complied with the ordinance agreement until a financial crisis befell the rail industry in the northeastern section of the United States. In the early 1970s, railroads in the northeast were rapidly failing. By 1971, Penn Central had filed for bankruptcy. Congress responded by enacting the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="45 U.S.C. § 701">45 U.S.C. § 701</a> et seq., designed to allow railroads to reorganize and become part of the financially viable operations of Conrail and Amtrak. Penn Central reorganized accordingly-</p>

The PUC, in its role as a regulator of rail-highway crossings, conducted an investigation to determine who was responsible for repair of the bridge. Subsequent action by the PUC, which was then reviewed by Commonwealth Court, resulted in the case being remanded to the PUC for apportionment of the costs of repair between the City, Conrail, and Amtrak.

The City sought a declaration that responsibility for maintenance of the bridge had been transferred to Conrail and Amtrak when the latter entities accepted the transfer of Penn Central’s property. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the City, thus holding Conrail and Amtrak responsible for all of the costs of maintenance and repair. The costs were apportioned, placing two-thirds on Amtrak and one-third on Conrail, based on the number of rail lines that each owned under the bridge.</p>

We are asked to decide whether, under Pennsylvania law, PRR owned the bridge upon completion of its construction in 1929. If it did not, then ownership of the bridge did not pass when the properties of PRR’s successor Penn Central were transferred to Conrail and Amtrak under provisions of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, supra.

Additionally, and particularly with respect to older bridges, I would not require that the evidence of ownership necessary to overcome the common law rule equate with a written deed reflecting title. Along with the problems of proof associated with the passage of an extensive period of time, rail-highway crossings represent a limited and quite unique subset of property, and the principles by which pertinent rights and obligations are to be determined should reflect the specialized context. In particular, current conceptions of railroad bankruptcy and reorganization law (which today are likely to substantially affect the consequences following from this Court’s determination) simply did not exist at the time when ownership initially vested, and thus, the technicalities of documenting ownership would appear to have been far less of an issue than the careful allocation of obligations related to upkeep necessary to maintain public safety.</p>
