At the conclusion of a three-day trial, the jury returned a verdict for appellants on their claim for promissory estoppel which the Superior Court reversed as barred by the statute of limitations. For the reasons stated below we find that the statute of limitations on an action sounding in promissory estoppel is four years and that, under the facts of this case, the question of when the appellants knew or should have known of a breach by the appellees is a question of fact which should have been submitted to the jury. We therefore affirm the Superior Court as to the applicable statute of limitations but reverse and remand to the trial court for a new trial on the singular issue of promissory estoppel, including a jury determination as to when the statute of limitations period began to run.</p>

Following negotia<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>tions, Crouse and Cyclops agreed to a price, subject to Crouse’s ability to secure financing within a six-month window. During the buy-sell negotiations, Crouse and Cyclops also entertained the idea that Crouse would fill some of Cyclops’s forging needs, but came to no firm understanding. While in search of financing, Crouse included in his business plan<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the possibility of doing business with Cyclops but found that potential lenders required a firmer commitment from Cyclops that it would outsource some of its steel conversion work to Aliquippa.

Crouse memorialized the meeting in a letter to Sullivan on November 24, 1987, in which Crouse recapped Sullivan’s remarks that Aliquippa should have been considered for outsourced conversion work which may have been going to other companies and that Aliquippa would now be given first priority on such work. Further, Crouse’s confirming letter reiterated his inquiry as to whether there were any problems with Aliquippa’s performance, any drop in Cyclops’s requirements or any reason at all why, in the course of the first six months of operation, the quantities weren’t closer to what Buser’s commitment letter specified. In addition, Crouse reminded Sullivan that, pursuant to an earlier discussion between Crouse, Sullivan and Buser, and in an effort to develop the mutually beneficial business relationship referenced in the commitment letter, Crouse had seen to it that Aliquippa’s sister company, Ameri<a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>can Specialty Metals, (American Specialty) was purchasing nearly all its tool steel from Cyclops.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The fraud count was dismissed and the jury returned a verdict for Crouse on the count of promissory estoppel only, in the amount of $210,000.

Where there is no enforceable agreement between the parties because the agreement is not supported by consideration, the doctrine of promissory estoppel is invoked to avoid injustice by making enforceable a promise made by one party to the other when the promisee relies on the promise and therefore changes his position to his own detriment.

Applying the four-year statute of limitations, Cyclops claims that Crouse’s September 5, 1992 complaint was not timely filed.

However, in some circumstances, although the right to institute suit may arise, a party may not, despite the exercise of diligence, reasonably discover that he has been injured. In such cases the statute of limitations does not begin to run at the instant the right to institute suit attaches, rather the discovery rule applies. The discovery rule is a judicially created device which tolls the running of the applicable statute of limitations until the point where the complaining party knows or reasonably should know that he has been injured and that his injury has been caused by another party’s conduct. <em>Pearce v.

    <p id="b1025-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1025.4",1025,[214,1075,1153,1224]]]'>Throughout the trial, Cyclops alleged that Crouse knew or should have known, at the latest by the end of 1987, that the promises made in the commitment letter were not being kept. N.T., January 30, 1996, at 88-90; January 31, 1996, at 133, 143; February 1, 1996, at 357. Specifically, Cyclops referenced a letter, written in November 1987 by Crouse to a third party to whom Crouse owed money, explaining that he was behind in payments and citing the forging work from Cyclops, which was anticipated but not forthcoming, as the reason. Crouse countered with testimony and documentation of the ongoing business relationship between Crouse and Cyclops; of his own efforts to generate the promised work in phone calls throughout 1988; of personal assurances from Cyclops executives at the 1988 meeting; of the notification that Aliquippa was on a Cyclops-approved list; of his agreement with Cyclops to hold forging prices until the end of 1988 and to discount their invoices; and of the very nature of the commitment letter anticipating an irregular flow of tonnage. Because of this evidence and the fact that Cyclops never terminated the agreement, Crouse believed that Cyclops intended to fulfill its promises. Thus, Crouse claims, it was not until the end of 1988 that he should reasonably have known that Cyclops was in breach of the agreement.</p>

      <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>The trial judge denied Cyclops’s motion for a non-suit based on a violation of the statute of limitations. In so doing, the judge said, “That will be denied. Now, that’s something [sic] I’m making that decision now so that we can get this case over with, but if this goes up on appeal, I’m not guaranteeing anything whether it’s right or wrong, I’ll tell you. <em>It’s just a judgment call on my part.” </em>N.T., February 1, 1996, at 357 (emphasis added). As there was no trial court opinion, this is the sum total of the benefit of the judge’s reasoning on the matter before us. It .is nonetheless instructive as it shows that the trial judge himself deemed the suit to have been timely filed. Thus, the Superior Court erroneously determined that the facts were so clear that reasonable minds could not differ as to the commencement of the limitations period and that it could therefore be determined as a matter of law. At least one reasonable mind — that of the trial judge — could and did differ on the run date for the statute of limitations.</p>

On the other hand, Crouse claimed that that correspondence was merely an attempt to offer momentary extenuating circumstances to the creditor while he worked things out with Cyclops. Moreover, Crouse presented evidence that his ongoing interactions with Cyclops and Cyclops’s continued reassurances led him to believe that the delays were part and parcel of the difficulties attending the internal changes at Cyclops and never an attempt to repudiate the commitment letter.</p>

Thus, the trial judge, who was himself uncertain about the propriety of his own judgment call, mistook a factual finding for a legal conclusion and usurped the province of the jury. The credibility of evidence on both sides of the matter of whether Crouse exercised reasonable diligence in determining whether Cyclops intended to honor its promises to Aliquippa — and therefore whether he knew or should have known of the breach before the end of 1988 — was a factual determination for the jury. We therefore hold that the Superior Court erred in reweighing the factual finding of the trial judge instead of remanding to the jury the factual issue of when the statute of limitations began to run.</p>
