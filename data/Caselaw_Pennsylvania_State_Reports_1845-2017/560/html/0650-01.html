Starr also filed suit against the Commonwealth, Department of Transportation (“PennDOT”), alleging that the intersection was improperly designed and maintained. PennDOT joined the Township as an additional defendant, contending that the Township was negligent in failing to install a traffic signal or other traffic control device restricting access from Sandy Hill Road onto Route 8. The Township filed an answer and new matter, contesting liability both on the merits and on the <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>grounds of governmental immunity pursuant to the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8541-8564 (the “Tort Claims Act”).</p>

According to the evidence, in 1959, the terminus of Sandy Hill Road at Route 8 was lowered by approximately four feet in connection with the widening of Route 8 by PennDOT. While there was some dispute as to what effect this change had on the sight distance for left-hand turns from Sandy Hill Road onto Route 8, it appeared from the evidence that the resultant topography of the intersection posed certain problems for motorists making such turns. In particular, the intersection is at the crest of a hill, and is situated just north of a horizontal curve on Route 8. Both of these factors tend to reduce sight distance for motorists turning left from Sandy Hill Road into the southbound lanes of Route 8.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Reacting to citizens’ complaints, including letters and a petition with over 100 signatures, the Township had on two occasions asked PennDOT to study the intersection and install a traffic signal. In 1989, PennDOT performed studies and concluded there was insufficient volume to warrant a signal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Subsequently, in 1991, PennDOT studied the intersection again, and reached the same conclusion. After informing the Township of the results of this second study, PennDOT suggested that the Township consider other remedial measures, such as a sign <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>prohibiting left turns from Sandy Hill Road onto Route 8, a flashing beacon at the intersection that would have given Route 8 traffic advance warning of the intersection’s dangerousness, or a campaign of vigorous enforcement of the speed limit along the portion of Route 8 leading to the intersection. PennDOT also offered to conduct an engineering and traffic study related to installation of a no-left-turn sign on Sandy Hill Road, which was a prerequisite to PennDOT approval, at no cost to the Township.</p>
    <p id="b1276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1276.4",1276,[263,765,1160,630]]]'>The Township never accepted PennDOT’s offer to perform such a study, nor did it submit a specific request to PennDOT to allow the Township to install a no-left-turn sign or flashing beacon at the intersection, or undertake a speed-enforcement campaign on Route 8. The Township did, however, ask Penn-DOT to perform another traffic signal study at the intersection, this time in conjunction with another nearby intersection, and pledged to pay for the installation of a signal, should one prove warranted. No further traffic control measures were taken at the intersection until October 1994, when the Township erected a no-left-turn sign pending the ultimate installation of a traffic signal by PennDOT.</p>

His expert opinion in this regard, however, was apparently unsupported by any traffic or engineering investigation of the intersection, or the system of intersections along Route 8 of which Sandy Hill Road is a part. More fundamentally, although the expert testified generally that a left turn prohibition would have prevented the accident involving Starr, he failed to offer even a conclusory opinion on the larger issue of whether a left turn prohibition was appropriate to this intersection. Specifically, no expert opinion evidence was offered to establish the feasibility of a no-left-turn sign, or that the net effect of a left turn prohibition upon the larger system of traffic control in the vicinity of the intersection would have been beneficial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

There was undisputed trial evidence that many drivers who approach the intersection from Sandy Hill Road wish to turn south onto Route 8, the very movement that a no-left-turn sign would have proscribed. When forced by heavy traffic to turn right, these drivers typically enter the passing northbound lane of Route 8 and look for a place to turn left, for entry into the southbound lane. While stopped in the passing lane awaiting a break in the oncoming traffic, they are in danger of being struck from the rear by other vehicles on the roadway, and numerous rear-end collisions had occurred as a result of this very circumstance.</p>

At trial, Starr elicited evidence that on May 24, 1991, Dean Bastianini, Acting Secretary of the Township Board of Supervisors (Board) sent a letter to PennDOT’s District Engineer, Henry Nutbrown, in which he acknowledged that a dangerous sight limitation problem existed at the intersection of Route 8 and Sandy Hill Road. In response, William Sacco, PennDOT’s Assistant District Engineer, wrote to the Board on June 10, 1991, stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that prohibiting the left turn out of a local road may be considered when inadequate sight distance exits. He further noted that upon request from the Township, PennDOT would perform a study regarding the feasibility of prohibiting turns at the intersection of Route 8 and Sandy Hill Road.</p>

Instead, it continued to petition PennDOT to install a traffic signal.
