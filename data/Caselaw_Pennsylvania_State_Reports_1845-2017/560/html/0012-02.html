On February 21, 1989, she was struck on the head by a light fixture and suffered injury. She subsequently received workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to a notice of compensation payable. In November of that year, however, Employer filed a petition seeking a termination or suspension of benefits, alleging that Claimant had returned to work at wages equal to or greater .than her pre-injury wages, suffering no residual disability. The workmen’s compensation referee scheduled a hearing for January 4, 1990, and notice was sent to Claimant’s last-known address.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Although the notice was not returned by the Post Office, Claimant failed to appear at the hearing. Employer advised the WCJ that Claimant no longer resided at the listed address and provided Claimant’s updated address. The WCJ scheduled a second hearing for February 1, 1990, and notice was sent to the new address. Again, the notice was not returned and Claimant failed to appear, nor did she contact the WCJ personally or through a representative. The WCJ heard Employer’s evidence and subsequently entered a decision and order terminating Claimant’s benefits.</p>

Employer filed a timely answer denying the material allegations of the petition. Claimant also filed a petition seeking penalties against Employer for unilaterally refusing to pay medical expenses arising from the 1989 injury which were incurred after the grant of Employer’s termination petition. Employer responded by filing a petition for review, challenging the reasonableness of further treatment or testing in relation to the 1989 work injury.

Claimant was transported to the hospital, where she was examined and released, but she failed to report to work as scheduled for the next two days or to report the reason for her absence. Employer terminated her employment, concluding, in accordance with the employee handbook, that Claimant had voluntarily resigned by failing to report to work or call in sick for two consecutive days. Claimant asserted that she did not believe she was required to report her absence, as Employer was aware that she had been injured. Claimant re<a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>ceived unemployment compensation benefits, the award of which was affirmed by the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review.

The WCJ also denied Claimant’s petition for penalties, concluding that Employer’s contest was reasonable and its failure to pay medical expenses after the original termination order was not a violation of the Act.</p>

Thus, the WCJ awarded total disability benefits for the period from February 5, 1991, until July 15, 1991, when Claimant returned to modified duty work, and partial disability benefits thereafter. The WCJ awarded total disability benefits beginning again as of April 2,1992, the date Claimant’s employment was terminated, on the ground that Claimant established a residual disability and the unavailability of suitable employment.</p>

The claimant sustained a work-related injury to his lower back and received benefits pursuant to a notice of compensation payable. He subsequently returned to light duty work at a wage loss and received partial disability benefits, until the employer subsequently discharged him for misconduct. The employer then filed a termination petition, based in part upon the allegation that the claimant’s loss of earnings occurred for reasons unrelated to his work injury. The workers’ compensation judge suspended benefits, and the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board affirmed. The Commonwealth Court, however, reversed, reasoning as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="Al" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[261,1548,1109,203]]]'>Disability is synonymous with loss of earning power. Indeed, “benefits for partial disability are based on the difference between pre-injury earnings and post-injury <em>earning power </em>.... ”</blockquote>

Our supreme court has stated, “[s]ince the purpose of the Act is purely to compensate a claimant for his work-related injury, the dispositive element in the suspension analysis ... is the status of the injury. Issues of misconduct or fault, if any, on the part of a claimant do not impact upon this determination.”</blockquote>

Therefore, consistent with the purpose of the Act — to remedy a loss in earning power due to a work-related injury — Claimant is entitled to continue to receive his partial disability benefits, calculated according to the wages he would have earned but for his misconduct.</blockquote>

Moreover, it is consistent with the language of the Act, which defines partial disability benefits according to the loss of earnings power, 77 P.S. § 512, corresponds to the Act’s remedial purpose, and has the effect of providing compensation for that portion of a claimant’s loss in earnings capacity that the claimant cannot recover in the marketplace due to a continuing inability to perform full employment. <em>See generally Harper &amp; Collins v.

Total disability benefits were subsequently provided pursuant to a notice of compensation payable, and the employer then filed a petition to terminate or suspend, based upon the contention that the claimant had fully recovered from his injury. Thus, the Court was confronted with the issue of what caused the entire loss in earnings capacity — the injury or the asserted performance-based discharge. Since the Court determined that a factual determination was necessary to answer this question, it remanded for the necessary findings. <em>See Hertz-Penske, </em><a href="/pa/546/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="546 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="466672" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0257-01">546 Pa. at 261-62</a>, <a href="/pa/546/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="684 A.2d 547" data-case-ids="466672,7351306" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0257-01,/a2d/684/0547-01">684 A.2d at 549-50</a>. <em>Hertz-Penske </em>does not stand for the proposition, as Employer seems to suggest, that fault is never relevant in a workers’ compensation proceeding.

The Court held that an unemployment compensation referee’s finding that the claimant worked to the best of his abilities and did not engage in misconduct was not dispositive of this inquiry; and therefore, it was error for the workers' compensation judge to accord collateral estoppel effect to such finding. <em>Id. </em>It is noteworthy, however, that the claimant's entitlement to continued partial disability benefits was not the issue presented, as the employer had not sought suspension of those benefits.

While this is a proceeding on a claim petition, as opposed to one on a petition to suspend, terminate or modify, as previously noted, the initial burden of proof associated with job availability is generally allocated to the employer in any context once a loss of earnings capacity attributable to a work-related injury is demonstrated by the claimant. <em>See supra </em>note 7 and accompanying text. Because, unfortunately, some claims review proceedings are protracted, the status of both disability and earnings may change for a variety of reasons prior to the rendering of a decision. Workers’ compensation judges are vested with the authority to render adjudications on claim petitions which incorporate aspects of modification, suspension or termination where the evidence so indicates, without the necessity of formal petitions by the employer. <em>See generally Connor v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Bd.

Thus, in assessing the relevant burdens in a claim proceeding, workers’ compensation judges must apprehend the stage to which the proceedings have advanced. Of particular relevance here, where the claimant has established that a work-related injury is the cause of a loss in earnings capacity (or remains so) during the time period in issue, the employer will generally be charged with the initial burden of establishing job availability for that time period. The decision in <em>Inglis House </em>is not to the contrary, since the Court <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>merely held that, by virtue of the claimant’s voluntary decision to abandon the employment, she had not advanced beyond the point of establishing a loss in earnings power attributable to a work-related injury. <em>See Inglis House, </em><a href="/pa/535/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="535 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="1841527" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0135-01">535 Pa. at 142</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="535 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="1841527" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0135-01">634 A.2d at 596</a>.
