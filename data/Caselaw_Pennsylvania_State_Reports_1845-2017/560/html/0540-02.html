Employer contends that consideration of concurrent earnings in these circumstances would be unfair, as it would result in an effective “doubling” of a claimant’s wages, thus allowing a claimant to “earn more money on workers’ compensation than he ever earned in real life.” Claimant, on the other hand, argues that the particular facts and circumstances of his situation demonstrate that his employment relationship with It &amp; J was not severed during his layoff <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>period, and that the receipt of unemployment compensation should not foreclose a finding of concurrent employment.

In holding that the job with the bus service company was indeed concurrent employment, the Commonwealth Court relied upon the testimony of management personnel of the bus service company indicating that: employees who are laid off over the summer by reason of the seasonal nature of the work remain listed as employees and are not terminated from the company; bus driver employees were asked in June if they intended to recommence driving the following September; and the claimant had in fact expressed his intention to drive the following fall. <em>Hoffman, </em><a href="/a2d/716/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="716 A.2d 711" data-case-ids="11703832" data-case-paths="/a2d/716/0711-01">716 A.2d at 713-14</a>.</p>

The Act seeks to compensate claimants for the ongoing loss in earning capacity resulting from their injuries; therefore, some reasonable assessment must be made of claimants’ pre-injury ability to generate future earnings. Section 309 directs the focus to the employee’s past performance, often measured over a period of time, as the gauge for determining this future earning potential. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 582. For example, in the case of seasonal employees such as the claimant in <em>Hoffman, </em>the Act generally requires consideration of the employee’s <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>total wages for the year preceding the injury, <em>see </em>77 P.S. § 582(e); this is obviously to obtain a fair assessment which takes into account the seasonal aspect of the work. For employees such as Claimant, who are paid on an hourly basis (as well as employees whose wages were fixed by the day or by output), Section 309(d) calculated the average weekly wage by taking the most employee-favored average from wages earned in the first, second, third or fourth period of thirteen consecutive calendar weeks in the fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the injury. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 582(d)(repealed).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The amended provision requires calculation of the average weekly wage for employees who are not paid on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis by taking the average of the average of actual wages earned on a weekly basis in each of the highest three of the last four consecutive periods of thirteen calendar weeks in the fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the injury. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 582(d). The effect of substituting an overall average for selection of the thirteen-week period yielding the highest wage figure is to lessen, to a degree, the employee-favored aspect of the calculation.</p>

Employer’s argument that inclusion of concurrent earnings in the benefits computation allows a claimant to "earn more money on workers’ compensation than he ever earned in real life” is belied both by the mechanics of the system of computation described above and by the facts of this case. The record discloses that, during the period prior to his layoff from R &amp; .1, Claimant typically worked forty-hour weeks, <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>which generated a gross weekly earnings figure from that company of $340.00 (Claimant also testified that, in the past, he had worked up to seventy hours in a week). Claimant worked 25-40 additional hours per week with Employer, and Employer stipulated that Claimant’s average weekly wages from it were $244.15. Thus, the $365.37 per week which Claimant received pursuant to the amended NCP is some $215.00 <em>less </em>than the $580 per week that Claimant actually earned during many of the weeks prior to his injury.</p>

In <em>Freeman v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (C.J. Langenfelder &amp; Son), </em>107 Pa.Cmwlth. 138, <a href="/pa-commw/107/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="527 A.2d 1100" data-case-ids="1361007" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/107/0138-01">527 A.2d 1100</a>, <em>appeal denied, </em><a href="/citations/?q=517%20Pa.%20600" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="517 Pa. 600">517 Pa. 600</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=535%20A.2d%201058" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="535 A.2d 1058">535 A.2d 1058</a> (1987), the claimant sustained an injury at C.J. Langenfelder &amp; Son two weeks after losing his job at A.J. Picone, which went out of business. The Commonwealth Court noted that Section 309(e) is written in the present tense (“Where the employe is working under concurrent contracts .... ”), thus rendering it inapplicable to claimants who had previously worked for concurrent employers. In <em>Mengel v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Boyer’s IGA, Inc.), </em>118 Pa.Cmwlth. 582, <a href="/pa-commw/118/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="545 A.2d 992" data-case-ids="1375452" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/118/0582-01">545 A.2d 992</a> (1988), the claimant was laid off from her job at Foltz Trucking in September 1984, when the company went out of business. She began collecting unemployment compensation benefits, but continued working at her second job at Boyer’s <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>Supermarket. On February 1, 1985, she was injured while working at Boyer’s. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board’s decision that the claimant was not concurrently employed, and therefore ineligible to have her workers’ compensation benefits calculated pursuant to Section 309(e). Moreover, the court noted that the Act does not provide that the receipt of unemployment compensation is deemed to constitute concurrent employment.</p>
    <p id="b1172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1172.4",1172,[236,702,1158,574]]]'>Claimant asserts that the Commonwealth Court correctly decided <em>Freeman </em>and <em>Mengel </em>because in those cases the alleged concurrent employer had gone out of business, thus precluding the possibility of a continuing employment relationship. However, in the instant matter, although Claimant was receiving unemployment compensation benefits, he was required to call R &amp; J on a daily basis to find out if work was available. Otherwise, R &amp; J would have considered him to have voluntarily quit. He argues that if R &amp; J no longer employed him during the layoff, there would have been no employment from which to quit.</p>
    <p id="b1172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1172.5",1172,[233,1300,1160,787]]]'>It is Claimant’s position that the receipt of unemployment compensation benefits is one factor to be considered in determining whether an injured employee has concurrent employment pursuant to Section 309(e). He suggests that each ease must be decided in light of the individual circumstances presented. Here, on the date of injury, Claimant was on temporary layoff from a full-time position that he had held for seven years. He was required to call R &amp; J every day as a condition of maintaining his employment contract. Furthermore, it is undisputed that his loss of income from R &amp; J after May 31, 1990, was not the result of adverse economic conditions (i.e. plant closing), but was a direct result of the work-related injury he sustained at Triangle. Because of these factors, Claimant asserts that he was concurrently employed on the date of injury.</p>

Furthermore, Section <em>4(1 </em>)(1) of the Unemployment Compensation Law, Act of December 5, 1936, Second Ex.Sess„ P.L. (1937) 2897, as amended, 43 P.S. § 753(0(1) defines “employment” as:</p>

    <p id="b1173-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1173.8",1173,[223,1608,1151,690]]]'>I agree with Triangle that the focus of the inquiry must be whether a claimant is working for the second employer at the time of his injury. Shifting the focus to the relationship between claimant and the second employer, or to whether the second employer’s inability to offer work to the claimant is temporary or permanent, creates administrative complexities and deviates from the plain language of Section 309(e). The Commonwealth Court properly held that Claimant was not concurrently employed because his receipt of unemployment compensation benefits establishes that he was not working for R <em>&amp; </em>J at the time of his injury. Accordingly, the determination not to calculate Claimant’s workers compensation benefits according to Section 309(e) is correct.</p>
