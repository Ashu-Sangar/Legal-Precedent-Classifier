Mr. Mitchell was hired as a State University Administrator 2, Admissions Counselor/Reeruiter, and was responsible for the University’s “outreach activities.” Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the University and the State College University Professional Association (the Union), newly hired employees are considered probationary employees during their first twelve months of employment.</p>

Mr. Mitchell attempted to contact his superior, Sharon L. Cannon, Director of Admissions. Unable to reach Ms. Cannon directly, Mr. Mitchell left a message that he was unable to attend work for personal reasons. Mr. Mitchell did speak with Steve Hilton of the University Motor Pool and informed him that he planned to call a friend to come to the police barracks to drive the vehicle back to the University.

When he returned to his office, Mr. Mitchell was informed of his superior’s recommendation and he was reassigned to administrative duties.

The University argued that the language completely prohibited a probationary employee from filing any grievance to challenge his termination. University witnesses offered that the disputed language was to deny probationary employees all access to the grievance procedure in the event of termination. Additionally, the University contended that as Article 14, Section 1 of the agreement prevented any adverse employment action against an employee without “just cause,” probationary employees were not entitled to the protection of this standard.</p>

Union witnesses testified that the language from the first sentence of Article 14, Section 3 relied upon by the University was only intended to deprive probationary employees of the application of a “just cause” standard to a termination. However, the Union offered that the last sentence of the section implicitly recognized that although probationary <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>employees do not have access to a just cause standard, they do have the right to progressive discipline in all but the most serious cases.

    <p id="b761-7" data-blocks='[["BL_761.7",761,[218,1096,1155,745]]]'>The Arbitrator also found <em>as a fact </em>that, while the collective bargaining agreement does not explicitly set forth a separate standard for judging the actions of probationary employees, the parties had seemingly agreed “that if there is a standard it is that the University may not be ‘arbitrary and capricious’ in meting out discipline.” Interim Arbitration Award, June 26, 1996 at 10-11. The arbitrator further reasoned that even if the parties had not agreed that the arbitrary and capricious standard was applicable, he would have drawn the same conclusion from the negative inference emerging from Section 3 that “some minimum procedural due process standard applies.” Interim Arbitration Award, June 26, 1996 at 11. Thus, Arbitrator Pereles initially determined that he had jurisdiction and that the grievance was arbitrable.</p>

On October 14, 1996, a final award and opinion was rendered. Arbitrator Pereles sustained the grievance finding that, at a minimum, the University was required to provide Mr. Mitchell with an investigation and a statement of the reasons why he was being terminated. The arbitrator found that the situation was prejudged and that Mr. Mitchell was terminated before there was <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>any verification of the police report or the status of Mr. Mitchell’s driver’s license. Thus, according to the arbitrator, Mr. Mitchell had not been terminated for a contractually permissible reason. Arbitrator Pereles ordered that the termination be "withdrawn and that Mr. Mitchell be reinstated with full back pay and benefits.</p>
    <p id="b762-4" data-blocks='[["BL_762.4",762,[246,599,1162,586]]]'>The University refused to comply with the award. Instead, it filed a petition for review with the Commonwealth Court. On September 3, 1997, a three-judge panel of that court vacated the arbitrator’s award and reinstated Mr. Mitchell’s termination. Specifically, the Commonwealth Court found that the plain meaning of the first sentence of Article 14, Section 3 precluded arbitration and that since no standard of due process was stated in the agreement, the arbitrator impermissibly determined whether the University’s actions were arbitrary and capricious. Thereafter, we granted the Union’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b762-5" data-blocks='[["BL_762.5",762,[247,1223,1158,313]]]'>The ultimate issue raised by the Union is whether the Commonwealth Court erred in vacating the arbitrator’s award.

    <p id="b762-6" data-blocks='[["BL_762.6",762,[247,1576,1158,530]]]'>Our court has spoken to this issue on numerous occasions. However, based upon the number of challenges to arbitration awards, this court’s standard of review has seemingly become a boilerplate standard lacking in real meaning or practical application.

The benefits of arbitration are many. Arbitration is swifter, less formal, and less expensive than traditional dispute resolution by courts.

Perhaps most importantly, arbitration has been seen as a prime force in the policy of reducing industrial strife.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Indeed, the Legislature recognized the value of informal dispute resolution as arbitration of grievances is mandated under the PERA. 43 P.S. § 1101.903.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Under Act 195, it is for the parties to agree upon the arbitration procedure to be used. 43 P.S. § 1101.903.

At times, the court has suggested extreme deference by stating that as long as the issue is covered by the agreement, the inquiry is at end. <em>Leechburg II. </em>On one hand, this approach is true to the concept of final and binding arbitration. Conversely, the drawback of this approach is that it allows an arbitration award to be upheld where the award is so without support or <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>is so illogical, that the parties could not have possibly intended to be so bound.

    <p id="b769-4" data-blocks='[["BL_769.4",769,[227,459,1153,1324]]]'>On the other end of the spectrum is the language used by our court indicating a standard of review looking to the “reasonableness” of the arbitrator’s award. A mere reasonableness standard encourages a reviewing court to assert its own brand of labor relations philosophy. It emboldens a court to become a “superarbitrator” and to vacate an award when it finds that the award is at odds with how the members of the court would have decided the case. The admonition against such judicial intervention was persuasively stated by this court in <em>Scranton Federation of Teachers v. Scranton School District, </em><a href="/pa/498/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="498 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="1776156" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0058-01">498 Pa. 58</a>, <a href="/pa/498/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="498 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="1776156" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0058-01">444 A.2d 1144</a>, 1147 (1982): “The parties to a collective bargaining agreement ha[ve] bargained for the arbitrator’s construction, not the court’s; thus, a court has no business intruding into the domain of the arbitrator because its interpretation of the agreement differs from his.” The court’s rejection of a broad review is well founded. This approach takes away the dispute resolution procedure bargained for, and agreed to, by the parties, as well as undermines the many benefits of labor arbitration as a form of dispute resolution. Moreover, when a court vacates an arbitrator’s award as being at odds with its idea of a proper resolution of the dispute, it inspirits employers and employees alike to seek judicial review when they do not prevail at arbitration, in the hope that they too can reargue their case, and win in court what they could not achieve in arbitration.</p>

We hold that in light of the many benefits of arbitration, there is a strong presumption that the Legislature and the parties intended for an arbitrator to be the judge of disputes under a collective bargaining agreement. That being the case, courts must accord great deference to the award of the arbitrator chosen by the parties. A fortiori, in the vast majority of cases, the <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. However, there exists an exception to this finality doctrine. The arbitrator’s award must draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. Pursuant to the essence test as stated today, a reviewing court will conduct á two-prong analysis. First, the court shall determine if the issue as properly defined is within the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Second, if the issue is embraced by the agreement, and thus, appropriately before the arbitrator, the arbitrator’s award will be upheld if the arbitrator’s interpretation can rationally be derived from the collective bargaining agreement.

The crux of Article 14, Section 1, as is found in most collective bargaining agreements, is that an employee will not be demoted, suspended, discharged, or be subject to any disciplinary action, without just cause. Section 3 of Article 14 expressly covers the rights of probationary employees. Specifically, Section 3 indicates that during a professional employee’s initial twelve months of employment, the provisions of Article 14 shall not apply. Section 3 further recognizes that during a professional employee’s probationary period, if the President or his designee determines that the professional employee will not be retained, the professional employee will be given 90 days notice prior to termination, which notice may include paid or unpaid periods of time. Finally, in Section 3 of Article 14, the <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>parties recognized that for some serious offenses, progressive discipline is inappropriate and that immediate removal may be warranted and the 90 day notice period referred to in this section shall not be applicable.</p>

The University focused upon the language contained in Article 14, Section 3 which indicates that during a professional employee’s first twelve months of employment, the provisions of Article 14 would not apply. It was the University’s position that this language completely precluded a probationary employee from filing any grievance to challenge his termination and denied the employee the protection that his termination be for just cause. Conversely, the Union concentrated on the last sentence of Article 14, Section 3 which indicates that in some serious offenses, progressive discipline is inappropriate, and immediate removal may be warranted. The Union argued that although a probationary employee may not be entitled to application of a just cause standard before an adverse employment action, the language of Section 3 indicated that probationary employees do have the right to progressive discipline in all but the most serious cases. This argument was based on the language of Section 3 which offers that for some serious offenses, progressive discipline is inappropriate and that immediate removal may be warranted and the 90 day notice period is not be applicable. The offense in this case was not so serious as to dispose of the need for the 90 day notice. Thus, according to the Union, progressive discipline was appropriate and the arbitrator had jurisdiction to consider the grievance.</p>

We acknowledge that the terms “rational” and "reasonable” have often been used interchangeably as part of the standard of review. Indeed, in common parlance, the two words have similar meanings. However, we find that in the context of review of an Act 195 labor arbitration award, determining an award to rationally be derived from a collective bargaining agreement connotes a more deferential view of the award than the inquiry into whether the award is reasonable. An analysis of the "reasonableness” of an award too easily invites a reviewing court to ignore its deferential standard of review and substitute its own interpretation of the contract language for that of the arbitrator. Thus, we find that in this very limited context, a review of the “reasonableness” of an award is not the proper focus.</p>

However, the inquiry as to whether the interpretation is rationally derived has nothing to do with whether the reviewing court agrees with the interpretation or even whether the interpretation is, in the court’s view, “reasonable.” Instead, a rational interpretation is simply one in which the arbitrator applies the terms of the agreement to the problem at hand. In this case, the arbitrator’s interpretation addressed a problem within the agreement by the application of the terms of the agreement. This is a case, therefore, in which courts should not intervene.</p>

The majority then correctly points out the drawbacks of an extreme deference approach by noting that “it allows an arbitration award to be upheld where the award is so without support or is so illogical, that the parties could not have possibly intended to be so bound.” Op. at 413. I believe that this language is, in essence, an acknowledgment that arbitration decisions are subject to judicial review where they are manifestly unreasonable. To allow review only where the arbitrator’s decision cannot be rationally derived from the collective bargaining agreement is too limiting and places unbridled discretion in the hands of individual arbitrators. The majority’s standard of review would allow an arbitrator’s decision to stand if it could be made under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement even if the decision was manifestly unreasonable under the facts of the case. I am in accord with the majority that a straight reasonableness standard permits more judicial review than is desirable. Thus, I would have the second prong of the test include that the arbitrator’s award will be upheld if the arbitrator’s interpretation can be rationally derived from the collective bargaining agreement and the decision is not manifestly unreasonable.</p>
