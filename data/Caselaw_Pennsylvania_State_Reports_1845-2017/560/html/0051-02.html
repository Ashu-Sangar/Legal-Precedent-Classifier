Approximately one year later, when Michael was ten to eleven years old, Luddy began sexually molesting him. Luddy often took Michael and his brothers out to eat after religion classes, and allowed the boys to watch television in his bedroom at St. Therese’s Rectory. He became Michael’s godfather, and would ask Michael’s mother to take the boys out to dinner. Luddy also traveled with Michael and his brothers, and would often buy the boys toys and candy. During this period, from 1976 to 1982, Luddy molested Mi<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>chael approximately fifty to seventy-five times in Luddy’s rectory bedroom. By the time Michael was fifteen years old, he became accustomed to turning to Luddy for advice and counsel on personal and religious matters, as well as for “nice things,” such as trips and eating out, which were usually intertwined with sexual molestation.</p>
    <p id="b675-4" data-blocks='[["BL_675.4",675,[226,593,1152,717]]]'>Two other incidents of molestation occurred in 1982 and 1984, when Michael was fifteen and seventeen years old, respectively. At the time of both incidents, Michael was living with his family in Akron, Ohio, and ran away from home to talk to Luddy about problems he was experiencing at home, and Luddy was working at St. Mary’s Church in Windber, Pennsylvania, where he had been reassigned in 1980. Michael testified that he specifically requested that they not engage in any sexual activity. Nevertheless, on both occasions, Michael stayed in a motel room in Altoona at the suggestion of Luddy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and Luddy visited Michael, talked with him, and molested him. Only these last two incidents form the basis of this civil action, because the earlier incidents are all barred by the statute of limitations.</p>
    <p id="b675-5" data-blocks='[["BL_675.5",675,[225,1343,1153,614]]]'>In 1988, Michael filed a Complaint against Luddy, St. Therese’s, Bishop Hogan and the Diocese, alleging causes of action for, <em>inter alia, </em>battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent retention and supervision. At trial, Michael testified about the 1982 and 1984 incidents, and introduced the testimony of other boys whom Luddy had abused, including Michael’s brother Mark Hutchison (Mark). These witnesses testified that Luddy had abused them, using the same pattern of befriending them, treating them to gifts and trips, and molesting them. One boy testified about two trips to Puerto Rico, during which Luddy repeatedly molested him.</p>

He testified that he molested the first child in 1967, approximately two years after his ordination, and that he continued to molest child after child within the Diocese in the years that followed, usually in the rectories where he lived and worked as an assistant pastor. He was supervised by a Diocesan pastor. Luddy admitted that he took many trips with boys from the parish, during which he would molest them.</p>
    <p id="b676-4" data-blocks='[["BL_676.4",676,[230,705,1162,629]]]'>Michael also presented evidence that the Diocese had actual notice of Luddy’s pedophilia since 1967 to 1969, when Luddy was assigned to St. Mark’s Church. At that time, a fourteen or fifteen year old boy reported two incidents of molestation to Father Louis Mulvehill, Luddy’s supervising priest at St. Mark’s. Michael’s mother and Mark testified that, in 1981, they reported Luddy’s sexual abuse of Mark to two priests in the Diocese. Furthermore, Monsignor Roy Kline, who was Luddy’s supervising priest at St. Therese’s, testified that he often saw Luddy take Michael, Mark, and other boys into his rectory bedroom, and that he should have known that Luddy was engaged in pedophilic behavior.</p>
    <p id="b676-5" data-blocks='[["BL_676.5",676,[229,1357,1162,837]]]'>After hearing eleven weeks of testimony, the jury returned its verdict on April 21, 1994. The jury specifically found that St. Therese’s, Bishop Hogan and the Diocese knew Luddy was molesting children, that they were negligent in their retention and supervision of Luddy, that they had a pattern and practice of ignoring allegations of pedophilic behavior among priests, and that their negligence was a substantial factor in bringing harm to Michael. The jury attributed liability thirty-six percent to Luddy, eleven percent to St. Therese’s, and fifty-three percent to Bishop Hogan and the Diocese and awarded Michael a total of $519,000.00 in compensatory damages. The jury also found that the conduct of all the defendants was outrageous, and therefore awarded- Michael punitive damages totaling $1,050,000.00 (fifty thousand dollars against Luddy and one million dollars against St. Therese’s, Bishop Hogan and the Diocese).</p>

The majority did not address any other issues. Judge Ford Elliott dissented, concluding that Luddy was privileged to enter the motel room only as a priest, and that Michael had proven that St. Therese’s, Bishop Hogan and the Diocese knew of Luddy’s pedophilic behavior and knew or should have known of the necessity for controlling such behavior. Accordingly, Judge Ford Elliott would have <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>affirmed the jury’s verdicts as to liability and compensatory damages.

Therefore, in reviewing the Superior Court’s decision, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Michael as the verdict winner, giving him the benefit of every reasonable inference arising from the evidence and resolving any conflict in the evidence in his favor. <em>See, e.g., Moure v.

    <p id="b678-6" data-blocks='[["BL_678.6",678,[231,1017,1160,1301]]]'>In his Complaint, Michael pleads numerous causes of action against Luddy, St. Therese’s, Bishop Hogan and the Diocese. In Count Five of the Complaint, Michael alleges that St. Therese’s, Bishop Hogan and the Diocese knew or should have known that Luddy was predisposed to engage in pedophilic behavior, and, therefore, they owed a duty to Michael and other parishioners to ensure that Luddy would not be in a position that would permit him to have contact with children. Michael further alleges that St. Therese’s, Bishop Hogan and the Diocese breached their duty by: (a) putting Luddy in a position in which he would have contact with children; (b) allowing Luddy to remain in that position; (c) failing to secure treatment for Luddy; and (d) failing to supervise Luddy adequately so as to prevent him from engaging in pedophilic behavior. In Count Six of the Complaint, Michael alleges that the Diocese had a longstanding practice of ignoring pedophilic behavior by priests, e.g., by intentionally failing to investigate reports of abuse; refraining from taking disciplinary action against priests known to have abused children; allowing such priests to continue to participate, without supervision, in activities involving children; and concealing from parents reports of Luddy’s misconduct. Thus, in general terms, Counts Five and Six of the Complaint set forth a cause of action against St. Therese’s, Bishop Hogan and the Diocese for negligent retention and supervision of Luddy.</p>

He was gone. He was no longer involved with them.

Dissenting Opinion, page 1066. I believe that this interpretation is too circumscribed. Rather, I believe that counseling one on personal problems is part of the varied duties of a clergyperson. While the dissent is correct that those who do not don the robes of a priest might counsel individuals on personal matters, the fact remains that Father Luddy was a priest, whose duties included personal counseling, at the time Hutchison sought his presence. Just because other professions might perform similar services does not make these services any less a part of a priest’s duties.

Thus, Father Luddy was not serving as a priest at St. Therese's Church at the time of the incidents in question and had not done so for at least two years. Moreover, decisions regarding placement, discipline, and transfer of priests were not made at the parish level. Under these circumstances I do not believe that St. Therese’s Church can be held liable.</p>

Since the servant in this case, Luddy, was not upon premises in possession of the master at the time of the alleged negligent acts, the essence of the inquiry becomes whether Luddy was upon premises which he was privileged to enter <em>only </em>as his master’s servant. Rest. (Second) Torts § 317(a)(ii). The evidence adduced at trial, even when viewed in the light most favorable to appellants as verdict winners, did not support a finding by the jury that Luddy was privileged to enter Michael Hutchison’s hotel room <em>only </em>due to his status as a servant — in this case his status as a priest of the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown.

While being able to help with depression or being a good listener may be qualities that many priests possess, they certainly are not inextricably intertwined with the notion of Priesthood.

The Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court attaches significance to the fact that Bishop Hogan testified that "if you’re a Priest, you’re a Priest 24 hours a day, every day of the year.” It may be true that priests are priests at all times, but the relevant question under the Restatement is why Hutchison chose to allow Luddy into his hotel room. Luddy’s standing as a priest, as the excerpted testimony illustrates, was irrelevant to Hutchison’s decision to allow him into his room.</p>

The Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court takes this negative causal inference out of its context and attempts to convert it into a positive causal inference that Luddy’s priestly status <em>did </em>provide the exclusive impetus which drove Hutchison to invite him into his hotel room. As a matter of logic, the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court’s approach here is unsound. The fact that Luddy might never have had the opportunity to meet Hutchison if Luddy was not a priest does not in any way entail that it was only Luddy's priestly status, and <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>not other factors, which caused Hutchison to allow him access to his hotel room on the occasions in question.</p>

I note that the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court in this matter should not be viewed as conferring this Court’s imprimatur on a cause of action against a religious sect under Section 317 for Constitutional purposes. A number of other state supreme courts have declined to authorize a cause of action against a religious sect for negligent retention of its religious leaders because to do so would result in excessive entanglements with religious beliefs contrary to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>See Pritzlaff v.

Without commenting on the merit of these decisions, I note simply that the issue of excessive entanglement was not before this Court in this matter, and, accordingly, should not be viewed as having been laid to rest by this decision.</p>
