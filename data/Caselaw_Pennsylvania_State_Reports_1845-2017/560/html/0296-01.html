On April 14, 1995, various residents of the Kerry view Trailer Park observed Appellee backing his car into a parked truck and driving around the park in an apparently intoxicated state. Police were called to the scene, and Appellee was arrested for DUI. On September 28, 1995, a jury convicted Appellee of DUI.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After finding that Appellee’s latest conviction was his third DUI conviction for purposes of determining his appropriate mandatory minimum <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>sentence pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(e)(1),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the sentencing court imposed a term of imprisonment of six to twenty-three months and twenty-nine days, plus a $1,000 fine, a $200 <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>statutory surcharge, and costs of prosecution.

The Superior Court agreed, finding that Pennsylvania’s DUI offense enumerated at 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(1) and New York State’s DWAI offense enumerated at <a href="/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Veh.%20%26%20Traf.%20Law%20%C2%A7%201192" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="N.Y.

There are increasing mandatory minimum sentences set forth in sub-sections 3731(e)(1)(h), (iii), and (iv), which are based on the number of times that the defendant has been previously convicted of violating section 3731(a) within the last seven years. Sub-sections 3731(e)(1)(h), (iii), and (iv) provide that the defendant’s previous in-state or out-of-state convictions for offenses that are "equivalent” to section 3731(a) offenses are also to be counted as prior convictions for purposes of determining the appropriate mandatory minimum sentence. In addition, section 3731(e)(2) provides that if the defendant has previously accepted Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition on any charge brought under section 3731(a), then that acceptance shall be considered as his or her first conviction for purposes of determining the appropriate mandatory minimum sentence. In the instant case, the sentencing court found that the mandatory minimum sentence of 90 days set forth in sub-section 373l(e)(l)(iii) applied to Appellee, because he: (1) accepted an Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition placement for DUI in 1993; and (2) had a 1992 New York State conviction for DWAI, which the sentencing court considered to be equivalent to a DUI conviction under section 3731(a)(1).

On page 11 of its brief to this Court, the Commonwealth also asserts that the Superior Court's rationale for vacating Appellee's judgment of sentence and remanding the matter for resentencing is no longer viable, because Appellee is no longer on parole, and thus is no longer subject to the sentence imposed on him. Assuming, arguendo, that the Commonwealth is correct, we fail to see how that fact could possibly impact upon the validity of the Superior Court's decision at the time it was entered. We can only assume that the Commonwealth is not inferring that the issue before the Court is now moot, because the Commonwealth is the Appellant before this Court, and a finding of mootness would necessarily result in the dismissal of its own appeal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we would not find that the issue presented in the instant appeal is moot, since it presents an issue that is capable of repetition yet apt to avoid appellate review. <em>See, e.g., In Re J.M., </em><a href="/pa/556/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="556 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="607216" data-case-paths="/pa/556/0063-01">556 Pa. 63</a>, <a href="/a2d/726/1041-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="726 A.2d 1041" data-case-ids="11594282,11594296,11594326,607173,607186,607216" data-case-paths="/a2d/726/1041-01,/a2d/726/1041-02,/a2d/726/1041-03,/pa/556/0062-01,/pa/556/0062-02,/pa/556/0063-01">726 A.2d 1041</a>, 1045 n. 6 (1999).</p>
