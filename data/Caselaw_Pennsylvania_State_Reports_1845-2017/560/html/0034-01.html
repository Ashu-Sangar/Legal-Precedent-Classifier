Wright, Sr. (“Wright”), returned to the mobile home he shared with his wife and their nine-year-old son. After entering his son’s room, where he found his wife and son asleep in bed, Wright produced a nine-millimeter handgun, fired a shot over the bed, and forcibly removed his wife to the living room. There, Wright argued with his wife, placed the gun against his chin, and told her to pull the trigger. Wright then shot his wife in the head, causing a <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>“glazing injury” to her parietal scalp and fracturing her skull. Upon seeing the injury to his mother, Wright’s son telephoned the local emergency response number and reported the shooting.</p>

When the troopers arrived, they observed a spent nine-millimeter casing near a screen door on the side of the mobile home. The troopers announced themselves several times, were ultimately advised to “come in,” and in response, ordered Wright out of the residence, placed him on the ground, and handcuffed him. Medical personnel were summoned, Wright’s son was removed to a neighbor’s house, and the scene was secured.</p>

Wright responded that he had used a nine-millimeter Makarov, which was inside the mobile home. The police maintained the security of the scene until a third trooper arrived at 1:40 a.m. At that time, having obtained neither a search warrant nor the consent of Wright or his wife, troopers searched the residence. During the search, they discovered the Makarov and a .380-caliber pistol beneath the mattress of the bed in the master bedroom. The nine-millimeter handgun was loaded, with the hammer in a cocked position. Wright was charged with criminal attempt-homicide, 18 Pa.C.S. § 901; aggravated assault (two counts), 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702; and reckless endangerment (two counts), 18 Pa.C.S. § 2705.</p>

The suppression court denied the motion, finding that Section 2711(b) of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2711(b), requires the seizure of all weapons used by the defendant in the commission of the offense. Wright proceeded to a jury trial, arguing that he had not fired his gun into the wall over his son’s bed, and that the injury to his wife was accidental, having occurred during the course of a strug<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>gle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Wright was convicted of all charges, except the offense of aggravated assault related to his son, and was subsequently sentenced to an aggregate prison term of five-and-one-half to eleven years and eleven months.</p>

In the lead opinion, Judge Joyce reasoned that the search was justified pursuant to Section 2711(b), which requires the police to seize any weapons used in the commission of certain enumerated offenses involving domestic violence, and that the power to seize such weapons necessarily confers the right to search. Judge Joyce also concluded that the search was proper, because of exigent circumstances that required the troopers to remove the weapons from the residence to ensure the safety of the individuals who resided there. In a concurring opinion, Judge Olszewski maintained that a construction of Section 2711(b) that permits warrantless searches in domestic cases involving a weapon violates the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Nevertheless, Judge Olszewski agreed that the return of Wright’s son to the residence in the future constituted an exigent circumstance justifying the warrantless search. Judge Kelly also concurred, stating his view that the warrantless search was permissible as incident to a lawful arrest. This Court allowed appeal to consider the propriety of the search and seizure.</p>

To rebut this evidence, the Commonwealth felt it necessary to offer the testimony of an expert witness, based upon his examination of the weapon, to the effect that substantial pressure needed to be applied to the trigger in order to fire the weapon, and that it could not have been accidentally discharged.

Shortly thereafter, appellant’s mother phoned Miller, requesting that Miller go next door and retrieve appellant’s son because “[appellant] just shot Missy [appellant’s wife] in the head.” When Miller arrived next door, appellant’s wife, who had blood all over her body and a gunshot wound to the head, exclaimed: “He did it again. Randy [appellant] shot me, and he put in me [sic] in the shower, Gizzy, and he tried to clean me up.” N.T. 1/14/97 at 12.</p>

Trooper Russo testified that, upon arriving at appellant’s house, he observed a spent bullet casing by the screen door, then knocked on the door and identified himself to appellant, who responded to the knock. Trooper Russo and his partner detained appellant and proceeded into the home, where they observed the victim bleeding profusely and observed the victim’s son, who appeared “shaken up.” Trooper Russo testified that, when he spoke with the nine-year-old boy, the child told him that he and his mother had been asleep in the bedroom when appellant came home and initiated an argument with his mother. According to Trooper Russo, the child stated that the argument moved into the living room, at which time the child heard two gun shots. The boy then came out of his bedroom and observed his father on top of his mother, prompting him to return to the bedroom and call the police. N.T. 1/14/97 at 22-24.

The presence of the firearm used to commit the crime as a Commonwealth exhibit did not render appellant’s defense any less believable.
