      <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>The facts of this case depict a tumultuous engagement between Rodger Lindh (Rodger), a divorced, middle-aged man, and Janis Surman (Janis), the object of Rodger’s inconstant affections. In August of 1993, Rodger proposed marriage to Janis. To that purpose, he presented her with a diamond engagement ring that he purchased for $17,400. Rodger testified that the price was less than the ring’s market value because he was a “good customer” of the jeweler’s, having previously purchased a $4,000 ring for his ex-wife and other expensive jewelry for his children. Janis, who had never been married, accepted his marriage proposal and the ring. Discord developed in the relationship between Rodger and Janis, and in October of 1993 Rodger broke the engagement and asked for the return of the ring. At that time, Janis obliged and gave Rodger the ring. Rodger and Janis attempted to reconcile. They succeeded, and Rodger again proposed marriage, and offered the ring, to Janis. For a second time, Janis accepted. In March of 1994, however, Rodger called off the engagement. He asked for the return of the ring, which Janis refused, and this litigation ensued.</p>

The case proceeded to arbitration, where a panel of arbitrators awarded judgment for Janis. Rodger appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, where a brief non-jury trial resulted in a judgment in favor of Rodger in the amount of $21,200.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Janis appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the trial court in a 2-1 panel decision. Judge Ford Elliott, writing for the majority, held that no-fault principles should control, and that the ring must be returned regardless of who broke the engagement, and irrespective of the reasons. In a Dissenting Opinion, Judge Schiller criticized the Majority Opinion for creating what he termed a “romantic bailment” because of its refusal to examine the actions of the donor in breaking the engagement, thereby creating a <em>per se </em>rule requiring the return of an engagement ring in all circum<a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>stances.

Vogtsberger, </em><a href="/pa/390/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="390 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="1275688" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0502-01">390 Pa. 502</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=136%20A.2d%20127" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="136 A.2d 127">136 A.2d 127</a> (1957). In <em>Pavlicic, </em>the plaintiff supplied his ostensible fiancée with numerous gifts, including money for the purchase of engagement and wedding rings, with the understanding that they were given on the condition that she marry him. When the defendant left him for another man, the plaintiff sued her for recovery of these gifts. Justice Musmanno explained the conditional gift principle:</p>
    <blockquote id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[303,1003,1117,367]]]'>A gift given by a man to a woman on condition that she embark on the sea of matrimony with him is no different from a gift based on the condition that the donee sail on any other sea. If, after receiving the provisional gift, the donee refuses to leave the harbor, — if the anchor of contractual performance sticks in the sands of irresolution and procrastination — the gift must be restored to the donor.</blockquote>

    <p id="b624-7" data-blocks='[["BL_624.7",624,[259,1453,1163,745]]]'>Where the parties disagree, however, is: (1) what is the condition of the gift (i.e., acceptance of the engagement or the marriage itself), and (2) whether fault is relevant to determining return of the ring. Janis argues that the condition of the gift is acceptance of the marriage proposal, not the performance of the marriage ceremony. She also contends that Pennsylvania law, which treats engagement gifts as implied-in-law conditional gifts, has never recognized a right of recovery in a donor who severs the engagement. In her view, we should not recognize such a right where the donor breaks off the engagement, because, if the condition of the gift is performance of the marriage ceremony, that would reward a donor who prevents the occurrence of the condition, which the donee was ready, willing, and eagerly waiting to perform.</p>

This theory is contrary to Pennsylvania’s view of the engagement ring situation. In <em>Ruehling v. Hornung, </em><a href="/pa-super/98/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="98 Pa.

It follows that in order to permit a recovery by plaintiff, it would be necessary to hold that the gifts were subject to the implied condition that they would be returned by the donee to the donor whenever the engagement was dissolved. Under such a rule <em>the marriage would be a necessary prerequisite </em>to the passing of an absolute title to a Christmas gift made in such circumstances. We are unwilling to go that far, <em>except </em>as <em>to the engagement ring.</em>

In the context of our conditional gift approach to engagement rings, the issue we must resolve is whether we will follow the fault-based theory, argued by Janis, or the no-fault rule advocated by Rodger. Under a fault-based analysis, return of the ring depends on an assessment of who broke the engagement, which necessarily entails a determination of why that person broke the engagement. A no-fault approach, however, involves no investigation into the motives or reasons for the cessation of the engagement and requires the return of the engagement ring simply upon the nonoccurrence of the marriage.</p>

Where one fiancée has truly “wronged” the other, depending on whether that person was the donor of the ring or the donee, justice appears to dictate that the wronged individual should be allowed to keep, or have the ring returned. Ho'wever, the process of determining who is “wrong” and who is “right,” when most modern relationships are complex circumstances, makes the fault-based approach less desirable. A thorough fault-based inquiry would not only end with the question of who terminated the engagement, but would also examine that person’s reasons. In some instances the person who terminated the engagement may have been entirely justified in his or her actions. This kind of inquiry would invite the parties to stage the most bitter and unpleas<a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>ant accusations against those whom they nearly made their spouse, and a court would have no clear guidance with regard to how to ascertain who was “at fault.” The Supreme Court of Kansas recited the difficulties with the fault-based system:</p>

This view brings to mind the words of Thomas Campbell from <em>The Jilted Nymph: </em>“Better be courted and jilted than never be courted at all.” As I cannot endorse this approach, I respectfully dissent.</p>

It is a symbol of nuptial intent dating back to AD 860. The engagement ring was to be of a valued metal representing a financial sacrifice for the husband to be. Two other customs regarding the engagement ring were established in that same century: forfeiture of the ring by a man who reneged on a marriage pledge; surrender of the ring by the woman who broke off an engagement. <em>See </em>Charles Panati, <em>Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things (copyright 1987). </em>This concept is consistent with conditional gift law, which has always been followed in Pennsylvania. <em>Stanger v.

Could not this theory justifying the majority’s decision be advanced in all other arenas that our trial courts must venture? Are broken engagements truly more disturbing than cases where we ask judges and juries to discern possible abuses in nursing homes, day care centers, dependency proceedings involving abused children, and criminal cases involving horrific, irrational injuries to innocent victims? The subject matter our able trial courts address on a daily basis is certainly of equal sordidness as any fact pattern they may need to address in a simple case of who broke the engagement and why.</p>

The Restatement of Restitution, § 58 comment c, discusses the return of engagement rings and states that:</p>
    <blockquote id="AA" data-blocks='[["BL_631.6",631,[269,597,1112,956]]]'>Gifts made in the hope that a marriage or contract of marriage will result are not recoverable, in the absence of fraud. Gifts made in anticipation of marriage are not ordinarily expressed to be conditional and, although there is an engagement to marry, if the marriage fails to occur without the fault of the donee, normally the gift cannot be recovered. If, however, the donee obtained the gift fraudulently or if the gift was made for a purpose which could be obtained only by the marriage, a donor who is not himself at fault is entitled to restitution if the marriage does not take place, even if the gift was money. If there is an engagement to marry and the donee, having received the gift without fraud, later wrongfully breaks the promise of marriage, the donor is entitled to restitution if the gift is an engagement ring, a family heirloom or other similar thing intimately connected with the marriage, but not if the gift is one of money intended to be used by the donee before the marriage.</blockquote>
    <p id="b631-6" data-blocks='[["BL_631.7",631,[225,1578,1150,636]]]'>I believe that the Restatement approach is superior to the no-fault policy espoused by the majority because it allows equity its proper place in the outcome. Here, it is undisputed that appellee twice broke his engagement with appellant. Clearly, appellant was not at fault in the breaking off of the couple’s engagement, and there is no allegation that she fraudulently induced appellee to propose marriage to her twice. Fairness dictates that appellant, who is the innocent party in this couple’s ill-fated romantic connection, retain the engagement ring, which was given to her by appellee as an unconditional gift. I would therefore reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>
