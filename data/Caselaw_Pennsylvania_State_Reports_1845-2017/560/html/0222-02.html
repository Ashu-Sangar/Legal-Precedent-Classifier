Officer Pfadt asked the Cl to confirm that marijuana was growing in Appellee’s basement during the week of February 13, 1994 and the Cl did so.

      <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>To focus upon the “waste heat” radiating from a structure is to ignore both the purpose of the device and the manner in which it operates. The imager measures not “waste heat” but rather heat differentials; it records heat gradients across the exterior surface of a building. The laws of thermodynamics inform us that the amount of heat radiated from a given section of the exterior wall is directly related to the amount of heat generated by heat sources in proximity to the interior of that wall. Activities that generate a significant amount of heat therefore produce a heat “signature” that the imager can detect. Under optimal conditions — viewing through an open window into a darkened room, for example — the imager (or one much like it) might well be able to resolve these heat signatures into somewhat indistinct images. See, e.g., <em>Young, </em><a href="/citations/?q=867%20P.2d%20593" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="867 P.2d 593">867 P.2d at 595</a> (noting that an imager can discern a human form through a curtained window under certain circumstances). More typically, the machine identifies only hot spots on a wall (as was true in this case). In either instance, it is the existence of these distinct interior sources that the device indirectly recognizes — with greater or lesser imprecision varying with the insulating attributes of the exterior walls — and records. While the heat lost by a building is data of some limited value, the true worth of the derice — the very reason that the government turned the imager on the home of the Defendants — is predicated upon the translation of these thermal records into intelligible (albeit speculative) information about the activities that generate the observed heat. The utility of the machine depends therefore not on the inevitable and ubiquitous phenomenon of heat loss but on the presence of distinguishable heat signatures <em>inside the structure. </em>We see no reason to blind ourselves to the physical reality of this relationship by severing our analysis of the heat differentials emanating through the walls of a structure from an informed consideration of the heat sources within that structure.</p>
