    <p id="b956-9" data-blocks='[["BL_956.9",956,[247,942,1158,310]]]'>This is a custody matter. The question at issue is whether the lower courts properly determined that Randall Charles (“Appellee”), who is the step-parent of the child in question, should have primary custody rather than Richard Stehlik (“Appellant”), who is the child’s biological father. After careful review of this matter, we affirm.</p>

A son, who was named Matthew, was born to Appellant and Mother on March 3, 1989; this was the only child resulting from this marriage. In August of 1989, a few months after Matthew was born, Appellant and Mother separated. At that juncture, Mother moved from the marital residence in New Jersey to reside with her parents in Pittsburgh. Mother took with her Matthew and her two children from her first marriage, Kimberly and Kevin Bauer (referred to as “Kimberly” and “Kevin”).</p>

Mother and Appellee set up house with their new blended family consisting of the then one year old Matthew, Kimberly, Kevin, and Appellee’s daughter, Jennifer. During Mother’s marriage to Appellee, Mother had primary physical custody of Matthew. Appellee was very active in Matthew’s life; so close was the relationship between the two that Matthew has always called Appellee “daddy”.</p>

Custody of Matthew, however, became a contested issue. On September 15, 1995, Appellee filed a complaint seeking primary custody of Matthew. This matter was assigned to the Honorable Ronald W. Folino. Extensive evidence was presented by several witnesses, including Appellant, Appellee, Jennifer, a few character witnesses, the therapist who treated Matthew following the death of Mother, and from William F. Fischer, Ph.D. (“Dr.Fischer”), a court-appointed psychologist.</p>
    <p id="b957-5" data-blocks='[["BL_957.5",957,[225,967,1152,575]]]'>The trial court relied heavily on the testimony of Dr. Fischer, whom the trial court found both credible and persuasive. Tr. ct. slip op. at 6-7. In formulating his opinion in this matter, Dr. Fischer conducted interviews and tests with the parties, Matthew, and Jennifer, Matthew’s stepsister. Dr. Fischer also conducted telephone interviews with the therapist who helped Matthew cope with the death of Mother as well as a counselor who had been working with Appellant. After gathering all of this data, Dr. Fischer opined that it was “in Matthew’s best interest to remain in the primary custody of [Appellee], at least for the present time.” Tr. ct. slip op. at 7.</p>

First, Dr. Fischer pointed to the fact that on two separate occasions, Matthew spontaneously indicated<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> that “he wanted to stay with his dad <em>here </em>in Pittsburgh (i.e.[Appellee]).” Tr. ct. slip op. at 7 (emphasis in the original); <em>see also </em>tr. ct. slip op. at 9. Dr. Fischer also testified that Matthew was more cheerful and relaxed when he accompanied Appellee to the sessions with Dr. Fischer than when Matthew accompanied Appellant. Tr. ct. slip op. at 7. Also, the pictures that Matthew drew while in the company of Appellant showed chaotic and sad scenes, tr. ct. slip op. at 7-8, <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>while the ones he drew in the company of Appellee were “much more cheerful....” N.T., 08/15/1996, at 25. Finally, Dr. Fischer testified that Matthew’s loss of his mother would make it “extremely difficult, if not traumatic, for Matthew to move to New Jersey at this time.” Tr. ct. slip op. at 8.</p>
    <p id="b958-4" data-blocks='[["BL_958.4",958,[245,526,1159,360]]]'>The trial court also relied on the testimony provided by Jennifer LaRosa (“Ms.LaRosa”), the therapist who treated Matthew after Mother’s death. Ms. LaRosa testified that Matthew felt a strong sense of abandonment whenever he would visit Appellant in New Jersey, and that he worried that he would not be brought back to Pittsburgh. Tr. ct. slip op. at 11-12.</p>
    <p id="b958-5" data-blocks='[["BL_958.5",958,[243,921,1161,529]]]'>Appellant and Appellee both testified. As to Appellant, the trial court found that he loves Matthew very much. Although the trial court was concerned about displays of “questionable judgment” and of anger on the part of Appellant, it noted that its “overall impression of [Appellant] ... was that he is a good man and truly wants to be a loving (and loved) father.” Tr. ct. slip op. at 14-15. The trial court, however, expressed concerns over Appellant’s “capacity to withdraw and isolate himself from others,” a trait which was clearly not in Matthew’s best interests. Tr. ct. slip op. at 15.</p>
    <p id="b958-6" data-blocks='[["BL_958.6",958,[244,1476,1161,635]]]'>The trial court found that Matthew’s life centers on his home in Pittsburgh. The trial court referred to Appellee, who has lived with Matthew since Matthew was a year old, as Matthew’s “day-to-day father”. Tr. ct. slip op. at 4. The trial court found Appellee credible when he testified “that Matthew calls him dad or daddy[, and that Appellee] ... treats Matthew like his sonTr. ct. slip op. at 9. The trial court further noted that Pittsburgh is the only home that Matthew had ever known in his eight years of life. The court stated that “Matthew’s school is here, his stepsister (Jennifer) is here, his maternal grandparents are here and his school friends are here.” Tr. ct. slip op. at 9-10.</p>

The trial court noted that it made this determination by applying the standard which states that a biological parent has a <em>prima facie </em>right to custody as against a third party, and that the scales are thus tipped hard in favor of the biological parent at the outset of the analysis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The trial court found that this presumption in favor of the biological parent had been overcome in this matter as “the instant case offers compelling and convincing reasons why [Appellee] should ... retain primary custody of Matthew at the present time.” Tr. ct. slip op. at 17. The trial court, however, stressed that “Matthew’s- relationship with his biological father should continue and should be expanded.” Tr. ct. slip op. at 16. The trial court’s order thus provided that Appellant would have partial custody of Matthew, and the length of the summertime visits Matthew would spend with Appellant in New Jersey would gradually increase over the next several years.</p>

Yet, even with Appellant having this presumption in his favor, the trial court nonetheless found that there were convincing reasons which compelled it to award primary custody of Matthew to Appellee. As noted <em>supra, </em>the trial court gave extensive reasons to support this conclusion. The most important factors to the trial court were that Matthew felt most at home in Pittsburgh with Appellee, the man he has known as “dad or daddy,” tr. ct. slip op. at 9, since he was a baby. Furthermore, the trial court noted that considering the recent loss of his mother and his half-siblings, uprooting Matthew from his home, school, and the man he <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>considers his “dad” could prove devastating to Matthew’s present mental condition.

    <p id="b961-4" data-blocks='[["BL_961.4",961,[205,455,1151,567]]]'>Appellant takes issue with the trial court’s determination. He first contends that the trial court’s decision is not supported by sufficient evidence because the trial court based its determination solely on the testimony of Dr. Fischer, a witness who had little opportunity to observe the parties. This claim must fail. First, although the trial court did rely heavily on the testimony of Dr. Fischer, such testimony was certainly not the only basis for the trial court’s opinion. The trial court based its opinion on the testimony of several witnesses, including Appellant, Appellee, Jennifer, Ms. LaRosa, and many character witnesses.</p>

Dr. Fischer conducted a series of interviews with the parties in the winter of 1995-1996; he also conducted telephone interviews with Ms. LaRosa as well as a counselor who had been working with Appellant. In addition, Dr. Fischer conducted another series of interviews in December 1996-January 1997.

We again emphasize that the standard seeks only to stress the importance of parenthood as a factor in determining the best interests of the child.

While this Commonwealth places great importance on biological ties, it does not do so to the extent that the biological parent’s right to custody will trump the best interests of the child.

In a highly mobile society, additionally fraught with the vagaries of modem relationships, those initial custody decisions may have a long-term effect of severing the child/non-custodial-parent ties equivalent to terminating that parent’s parental rights. “The day to day contact between the child and one having custody can create a relationship that may leave the <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>birth parent almost an intruder.
