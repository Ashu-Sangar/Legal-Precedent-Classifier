Appellant chose not to file post-trial motions and proceeded to sentencing on July 22, 1994. Following the imposition of sentence, an appeal was taken to the Superior Court in accordance with Pa.R.Crim.P.1410. In that appeal, appellant raised the claim that his conviction was against the weight of the evidence. Citing Pa.R.Crim.P. 1410(B)(1)(c) the Superior Court determined that the weight of the evidence claim had been waived because appellant had failed to provide the trial court with an opportunity to rule on the claim. <em>Commonwealth v.

Among those present at Cress’s home were David McAndrew, who also resided there, and McAndrew’s girlfriend, Joanna McCusker. After about an hour of drinking, Widmer, Cress, Mullin, Brown and McAndrew went out to a bar to continue their celebration.

Widmer went upstairs to use the bathroom, and, after he had been gone for what seemed to be a long time, McAndrew went upstairs to check his whereabouts. Upon doing so, McAndrew found Widmer in McAndrew’s bedroom engaged in sexual intercourse with McCusker. Widmer then left the house and McAndrew retrieved a handgun and followed him. Outside McAndrew threatened to kill Widmer, who, after pleading with McAndrew not to shoot him, left the scene with Mullin and Brown. At trial, Widmer testified that he and McCusker had engaged in consensual intercourse. McCusker, however, said that she had been sleeping and had awakened to find Widmer on top of her with his penis in her vagina. According to McAndrew, he entered his bedroom and found Widmer on top of McCusker, with McCusker hitting Widmer on the chest. Widmer had then rolled off McCusker onto the floor. He looked up at McAndrew and appeared to be scared. After Widmer had fled the room, McAndrew said that McCusker had been shaking and crying.</blockquote>

In its opinion, the trial court focused on the credibility of Ms. McCusker in contrast to the credibility of appellant.

Appellant argues that where, as here, the trial court grants a new trial based upon its view that “the verdict shocked his sense of justice” then a broad scope of review applies. Appellant argues that the use of the emphasized phrase implies that <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>more than the stated reasons influenced the trial court decision to grant a new trial. Appellant’s assertion is not convincing. The trial court in its opinion clearly enunciated the specific points that brought it to reach the conclusion that the jury’s verdict represented an unreasonable resolution of the evidence so that “the verdict shocked his sense of justice” and a new trial was warranted. In other words the phrase appellant focuses upon is the trial court’s conclusion, not an open invitation to the appellate court to broaden its scope of review. Contrary to appellant’s assertion, the trial court’s statement that the verdict shocked its sense of justice did not indicate that reasons other than those specified warranted the grant of a new trial.
