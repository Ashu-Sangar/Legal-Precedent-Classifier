    <p class="author" id="b1084-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1084.5",1084,[304,498,513,40]]]'>FLAHERTY, Chief Justice.</p>
    <p id="b1084-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1084.6",1084,[260,565,1160,585]]]'>Light of Life Ministries, Inc., is a non-profit organization which seeks to provide shelter, food, clothing, and basic medical care to emotionally and sociologically disabled individuals and substance abusers. Light of Life provides these services at its facility located on a'three hundred-twenty-two-acre tract of land, two hundred-sixty of which are located in Cross Creek Township. In 1992, Light of Life acquired this property from the predecessor in title, Serenity Farms, Inc., also a non-profit organization that provided shelter for similarly handicapped individuals. Serenity Farms had owned the property and provided similar services since the 1960s.</p>
    <p id="b1084-7" data-blocks='[["BL_1084.7",1084,[258,1174,1162,962]]]'>In 1980, the township enacted a zoning ordinance which classified the property as agricultural, allowing Serenity Farms to continue operations as a conditional use group home. After the transfer of the property, Light of Life continued operations as a group home under the conditional use without objection from either the township or its residents. In 1995, when Light of Life began making improvements to the property, a group of residents, under the name ‘Cross Creek Concerned Citizens,’ petitioned the township board of supervisors to close down the facility. Following a hearing, the township sent a letter to Light of Life directing it to discontinue its use of the property. Light of Life appealed to the township’s zoning hearing board, which denied the appeal. Light of Life then appealed to the common pleas court. The court issued an order allowing Light of Life to continue operations at its present level, but prohibiting new construction or expansion pending a hearing by the zoning board or the supervisors on the merits.</p>
    <p id="b1084-8" data-blocks='[["BL_1084.8",1084,[261,2162,1159,150]],["BL_1085.1",1085,[222,270,1150,695]]]'>Light of Life subsequently applied to the supervisors for an expansion of its conditional use in order to accommodate up to one hundred-sixty clients and staff over the next ten to fifteen <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After public hearings before the township planning commission and the board of supervisors, the supervisors granted the conditional use application. The supervisors imposed numerous conditions and restrictions on the conditional use despite their conclusion that the application satisfied the provisions of the zoning ordinance and that it would not adversely affect the township or its residents. Light of Life appealed to the common pleas court, challenging the validity of five of the twenty-three conditions imposed and asserting that the conditions constituted illegal discrimination under the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203601" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 3601">42 U.S.C. § 3601</a> et seq. The residents’ group also appealed, challenging the grant of the conditional use. The appeals were consolidated.</p>
    <p id="b1085-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1085.4",1085,[217,1005,1154,792]]]'>The trial court affirmed the grant of the conditional use and reversed four of the five conditions imposed by the supervisors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court referred the matter back to the board of supervisors for reconsideration of the basis established in the record for imposing limits on the number of residents allowed in the conditional use. The township subsequently issued supplemental findings in support of its imposition of client limits. The trial court then affirmed the condition placing limits upon the number of clients Light of Life could shelter, but did not address the fair housing act claim. Appellants and appellees filed appeals to the commonwealth court, which were consolidated. That court reversed the trial court and denied the application for conditional use entirely. Light of Life’s petition for reargument was also denied and this appeal followed.</p>

The court accordingly determined that since a group or residence home could only comprise a single dwelling unit, then the definitions for ‘farm dwelling’ and ‘single family dwelling’ applied, therefore concluding that the proposed use fell outside the definition of an institutional residence or group home as defined in the ordinance. Light of Life argues that the court applied a tortured interpretation of the ordinance to reach its conclusion. We agree.</p>
