Following a jury trial, Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime. The jury found one aggravating circumstance, that the victim and Appellant had been associated in the manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance and the killing was related to that association, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(14). As no mitigating circumstances were found, Appellant was sentenced to death. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and grant a new trial.</p>

The two men proceeded to 4128 Old York Road, Philadelphia, where McAiley exited the vehicle and began walking away. Appellant then stepped out of the car and fired shots at McAiley, killing him. Police Officer Michael Weleski was about one block away when he heard three gunshots. As he drove toward the vicinity, he saw a brown Cadillac with a bearded Hispanic male behind the wheel. The car stopped, the man pointed toward the area where the shooting occurred and drove away. Officer Weleski did not pay attention to the man and could not make an identification.</p>

No one at the scene could identify the perpetrator. One witness, however, Dawn Newman, later came forward and informed police that she observed Appellant step out of a Cadillac and shoot McAiley. Newman explained that her initial failure to identify <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>Appellant was due to her past background involving drugs and prostitution. At trial, McAiley’s- nephew testified that McAiley sold drugs for Appellant. Johnuall Bender also testified that there was a drug relationship between Appellant and McAiley. Bender further stated that he was present at the Princess Lounge immediately before the murder and overheard Appellant say to McAiley, “[B]etter get me my fucking money, I’m not playing with you.” N.T. 7/25/94.</p>

We agree with Appellant that such advice was clearly unreasonable as it is well-established that evidence of prior convictions can only be introduced for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness if the conviction was for an offense involving dishonesty or false statement. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s convictions of drug trafficking and firearms offenses did not involve dishonesty or false statements and therefore would not have been admissible to impeach his credibility. As the common pleas court credited Appellant’s testimony that his decision not to testify was based solely on this erroneous advice, such decision cannot be deemed knowing or intelligent. The right of an accused to testify on his own behalf is a fundamental tenet of American jurisprudence and is explicitly <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>guaranteed by Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em> </em>Instead, the Commonwealth argues that trial counsel believed Appellant should not testify at trial because if he did, the Commonwealth could cross-examine him regarding the motive for the killing, which was allegedly a drug debt, and thereby introduce his prior drug convictions. As illustrative of its point, the Commonwealth asserts that Appellant did in fact testify at the penalty phase of trial and portrayed himself as a “small-time drug dealer” who had only a few drug transactions with the victim, involving five or ten dollars.

Appellant also raises the following issues: (1) Whether the trial court erred in denying Appellant a second opportunity lor a lineup; (2) Whether there was sufficient evidence to support the aggravating circumstance that the victim and Appellant had been associated in the manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance and the killing was related to that association, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 (d)(14); (3) Whether trial counsel was ineffective for eliciting information from Officer Weleski which corroborated the theory of the Commonwealth’s case; (4) Whether trial counsel was ineffective for introducing a letter that implicated Appellant in the killing; (5) Whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to inadmissible hearsay testimony; (6) Whether trial counsel was ineffective for allowing the introduction of testimony from Warren McAiley that the victim worked for Appellant in the drug business; (7) Whether trial counsel was ineffective for waiving Appellant’s opportunity to participate in a lineup; (8) Whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a <em>Sexton </em>charge alter the trial court denied a second lineup; (9) Whether trial counsel was ineffective during the penalty phase for failing to advise Appellant that he could call as many witnesses as he chose to testify on his behalf; and, (10) Whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object during the penalty hearing when the prosecutor erroneously cross-examined Appellant about his prior criminal record.</p>

The common pleas court issued two opinions, one on May 7, 1998, and a second opinion on May 13, 1998, wherein it listed findings of facts as well as conclusions of law. The May 13, 1998, opinion indicated that Appellant had only one prior conviction of possession of a firearm without a license. The Commonwealth, however, properly notes that Appellant’s Exhibit A to his original brief filed in our Court contains an excerpt of his complete criminal record, which shows at least two convictions for drug-trafficking and two convictions for weapons offenses. Rather than acknowledging this error, Appellant merely reiterated the incorrect finding of the common pleas court in the factual summary in his supplemental brief. We look with disfavor upon this type of “silent advocacy.”</p>

The Commonwealth also contends that Appellant’s decision to testify was his own and that it was freely and voluntarily made. Although the court conducted an extensive colloquy after which Appellant indicated that it was his decision not to testify, Appellant indicated at the evidentiary hearing that such decision was based solely on trial counsel's advice. Thus, the pertinent inquiry is whether counsel's advice was reasonable so as to render Appellant’s decision not to testily knowing and voluntary.</p>

The fact that Appellant's testimony arguably worked to his detriment during the penalty phase of trial does not compel a different conclusion. First, claims of counsel's ineffectiveness may not be evaluated in hindsight. <em>Commonwealth v. Washington, </em><a href="/pa/549/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="549 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="17692" data-case-paths="/pa/549/0012-01">549 Pa. 12</a>, <a href="/a2d/700/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="700 A.2d 400" data-case-ids="11899290,17692" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/0400-01,/pa/549/0012-01">700 A.2d 400</a> (1997). Second, it is sheer speculation to conclude that what transpired during the penalty phase would have occurred at trial. Finally, there is no basis to conclude that Appellant suffered prejudice from the admission of his prior drug arrests since there was already evidence that Appellant engaged in drug activity.</p>
