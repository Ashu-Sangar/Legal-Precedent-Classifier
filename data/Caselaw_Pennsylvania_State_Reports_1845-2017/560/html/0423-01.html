Diogenes A. Saavedra, M.D., performed the surgery at Meadville Medical Center (collectively referred to as Appellees). Prior to surgery, Appellant complained of left side pubic area pain, frequent urination, tiredness and difficulty walking. Following surgery, Appellant had a “different kind of pain,” which was much more severe. Appellant described the pain as being “further down,” and “closer to the joint.” Dr. Saavedra explained to her that the pain was a result of his sewing the wall in the left inguinal area to prevent a hernia from developing.</p>

On her first post-surgery visit, she requested her medical reports from the surgery to ascertain exactly what procedures Dr. Saavedra had performed. The report did not include any procedure involving the sewing of the wall in the left inguinal area. Appellant thereafter consulted several other physicians. On February 6, 1992, Appellant was examined by Lawson C. Smart, M.D., who <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>opined that the source of her pain might be a suture from the sewing of the left inguinal area.

Appellant was informed that the suture was the cause of her pain.</p>

Following initial x-rays and exploratory surgery, Hayward’s doctors removed a portion of his right lung suspected to contain a tumor. Final pathological studies showed that the mass that was removed from Hayward’s lung was not a malignant tumor, but a blood clot. Following this, Mr. Hayward and his family members repeatedly questioned the doctors about whether removal of a portion of the lung was necessary. The doctors reassured them that such surgery was medically necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 1041. Immediately following surgery and for two years thereafter, Hayward experienced shortness of breath, which increased with time. During this time, the doctors who performed the surgery reassured Hayward that this type of shortness of breath was to be expected following the removal of a portion of the lung. In November 1981, Hayward went to a lung specialist, who told him that the shortness of breath was due to the decreased lung capacity resulting from the 1980 surgery. Finally, in May 1983, Hayward went to see another doctor, who informed him that the lung surgery was unnecessary and was a substantial factor in Hayward’s disability (shortness of breath). In April 1985, Hayward filed a negligence action against the doctors that removed a portion of his lung.

In finding that this question should have been reserved for the jury, this court relied on a number of facts. It found that the jury could determine that Mr. Hayward had not exercised due diligence in investigating his claim because as soon as he discovered that the mass had been misdiagnosed, he should have sought a second opinion. On the other hand, the court determined that the jury could find that Hayward was reasonable in delaying his investigation, because of the doctors repeated assurances that the procedure was necessary. The court also determined that it was for the jury to weigh whether the fact that the lung specialist informed Hayward in 1981 that the shortness of breath was directly related to the surgery should have compelled him to investigate sooner; or whether Hayward was justified in delaying his investigation until 1983, when he finally discovered that “the ill effects he suffered were a result of wrongdoing and not merely the unexpected, inevitable or unforeseeable consequences of the medical treatment.” <em>Id. </em>at 1043.

There is little to distinguish the instant case from <em>Hayward. </em>In the instant case, appellant had surgery on June 3, 1991. Immediately following surgery she believed that there was some kind of problem related to the surgery.

Although the Opinion in Support of Affirmance may be attempting to create a bright line rule by turning the grant of summary judgment on appellant’s pain, this standard charges appellant with an unrealistic burden of knowledge. According to that opinion, “[t]he severity and continuation of the pain reasonably should have put Appellants on notice that the discomfort was not normal post-operative pain, but rather an actionable injury.” Opinion in Support of Affirmance at 97. Under this view, not only must the patient know that the pain is “different in kind and type of that prior to the surgery,” but now the patient, a layperson, must also recognize that the “different” pain is not normal post-operative pain which will recede with time, but pain due to some negligent act of her doctor.

The Opinion in Support of Affirmance places an undue burden on a patient by requiring her to file suit at the time she is exploring the medical cause of her pain or discomfort, when clearly the priority at this time is uncovering the cause of such pain or discomfort. Accordingly, an injured party’s rights are secured only where the statute of limitations is tolled during the time when she is merely exploring the possible medical cause of her pain or discomfort and is reasonably unaware that an actionable injury has been sustained.</p>

As stressed in the dissent in <em>Cochran, </em>the condition precedent to the running of the statute of limitations is the time when the plaintiff <em>reasonably should know </em>of the injury and its cause and not the time when the plaintiff <em>could have known.

It posited that a party could discover the cause of his illness a day or a week before the expiration of the limitations period and not benefit from the discovery rule. The party would then only have a day or week to bring his cause of action. The opinion further posited that if a party reasonably ascertained his injury one week after the expiration of the limitations period, the discovery rule would apply and the party would reap the full benefit of the two year limitations period. Although we agree that such approach may seem unfair to some, this result is inevitable when enforcing a statute that hinges upon the passage of time. The same "inequity” arises any time an action is disposed of on account of the statute of limitations even though it may have been filed but one day late.</p>

Medical Center of Beaver County, </em><a href="/pa/530/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="530 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1833007" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0320-01">530 Pa. 320</a>, <a href="/pa/530/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="530 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1833007" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0320-01">608 A.2d 1040</a> (1992), is misplaced. In <em>Hayward, </em>the plaintiff had a portion of his lung removed, which caused shortness of breath. Relying on the defendant physician's assurances that the surgery was necessary, the plaintiff contended that he could not discover that he was injured until another physician informed him three years later that the surgery was unnecessary. The instant case is clearly distinguishable, as it is undisputed that Appellants were aware of the injury within the two-year statute of limitations. Moreover, Appellant was not prevented from discovering her injury due to assurances from Dr. Saavedra. Rather, she fully investigated the medical cause of her injury, yet failed to commence her action within the statutory period.</p>

Patients will now be forced to file suit prior to any indication that post-operative pain was caused by something other than successful surgery. This may result in higher professional liability insurance premiums for physicians and hospitals, possible physician deselection from Managed Care Organization’s (MCO’s), and harming physician-patient relationships.

The Opinion in Support of Affirmance ignores the fact that the purpose of the discovery rule is equitable, in that it attempts to treat all plaintiffs similarly. <em>Dalrymple, </em><a href="/a2d/701/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="701 A.2d 164" data-case-ids="11891666,17222" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0164-01,/pa/549/0217-01">701 A.2d at 167</a>. The Opinion in Support of Affirmance apparently recognizes the discrepancy that may arise by treating a plaintiff who became reasonably aware of her injury within the statute of limitations differently from one who became aware of her injury following the applicable limitations period, but suggests that such a result is inevitable. Opinion in Support of Affirmance, p. <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>95, fn. 4. Under the Opinion in Support of Affirmance, a plaintiff who is reasonably diligent, but fails to discover her injury until the day before the statute of limitations is to run on the action, must file the action within the applicable statute of limitations, or 24 hours. However, the plaintiff who is reasonably diligent and discovers her injury the day after the statute of limitations has run on the action, would be entitled to another two years to file the action, since she discovered her injury outside the applicable statute of limitations. Although the Opinion in Support of Affirmance remarks that such a result may seem unfair, we believe that such a result is not merely unfair, but absurd and contrary to the purpose of the discovery rule.</p>
