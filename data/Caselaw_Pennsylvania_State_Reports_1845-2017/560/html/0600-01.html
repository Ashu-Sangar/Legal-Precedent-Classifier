It agreed with the trial court that the contract claims were properly dismissed, but it determined that the estoppel claim should not have been dismissed. Superior Court’s estoppel analysis was based largely on <em>Straup v. Times Herald, </em><a href="/pa-super/283/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="283 Pa. Super. 58" data-case-ids="156959" data-case-paths="/pa-super/283/0058-01">283 Pa.Super. 58</a>, <a href="/pa-super/283/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="283 Pa. Super. 58" data-case-ids="156959" data-case-paths="/pa-super/283/0058-01">423 A.2d 713</a> (1980). In that case, when newspaper distributors began receiving newspapers without the advertising sections inserted, they attempted to negotiate a change in the way the advertising sections were handled, and when this failed, they announced that they would not distribute the newspapers unless the advertising sections were already inserted. The newspaper refused to agree, and the dealers then refused to pick up the newspapers. The newspaper then began distributing its papers itself, thus removing the distributors from their accustomed duties. At the time the <em>Straup </em>action commenced, all written agreements between the parties had expired. Although the <em>Straup </em>court acknowledged that the oral contracts pursuant to which the parties operated were presumably terminable at will, it held that the newspaper’s words and conduct established a kind of conditional property right which could not be terminated at will. Superior Court held that because the newspaper treated dealers as “exclusive owners” of distributorships and remained silent when distributorships were sold for consideration, the newspaper was “estopped from depriving appellants of their reasonable expectations that they ‘owned’ their respective distributorships.” The holding, therefore, was based on the theory of equitable estoppel.</p>

This general authority (prerogative of Grace) required the Chancellor to base all decisions on the principles of “Conscience, Good Faith, Honesty and Equity.” If someone had committed any unconscientious act or breach of faith and the “rigour of the law” favored that party, then the other party who suffered thereby would be granted corrective relief “under the head of conscience.” With its source in that writ, the “Good Faith” basis of promissory estoppel was subsequently recognized and applied by American courts.</blockquote>

[The basis of promissory estoppel] is not so much one of contract, with a substitute for consideration, as an application of the general principle of estoppel to certain situations.
