David Thomas Reibman, the appellant, was appointed Executor and also Trustee for minor grandchildren upon trusts which are presently irrelevant.

In the Spring of 1959, testator’s widow made an offer in writing to purchase this property and its contents for $30,-000. Testator’s furniture which was in the nine apartments in this Northampton Street property was never inventoried, but the Executor testified it had a value of $5,000/$6,000. No finding on this point was made by the Auditing Judge or the Orphans’ Court.

The Executor spent $1,999.45 for capital improvements to fireproof the furnace room. The room was fireproofed approximately two years after decedent’s death, but before the sale of the property. The Executor claimed credit in his Account for the expenditure of $1,999.45 on July 7, 1961, which was after the sale of the property, even though the room had been fireproofed before the sale. This credit was disallowed by the Orphans’ Court as a Principal Credit in the Executor’s Account. The Court said: “This item . . . did not inure to the benefit of the estate. Had accountant accepted the widow’s offer in or about May of 1959, or if accountant had sold the premises otherwise but with reasonable dispatch, the work and expense of this remodeling would not have been required. ...

Furthermore, no one could have foretold at the time the fireproofing was installed that Reibman would be the successful purchaser of the property. Under these circumstances, it seems to us that a surcharge for the cost of the fireproofed room is, in effect, a double surcharge for one and the same act of negligence, and therefore this surcharge was improperly imposed.</p>
