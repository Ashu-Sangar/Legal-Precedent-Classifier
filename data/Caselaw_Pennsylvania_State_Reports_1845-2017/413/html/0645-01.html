After hearing, the court below dismissed the rule as to this savings account. From that order this appeal was taken.</p>

The evidence to rebut the fact that a gift inter vivos was intended and effected must be clear, precise and convincing. ... No such evidence has been presented here.

All her testimony that infers otherwise must be attributed to her own deductions- and conclusions rather than to anything the decedent may have said. The fact that Mrs. Reichard testified that decedent said she was to have everything if anything happened to him does not violate the terms of -the signature card, but is in keeping with the ‘right of survivorship provision’ of the agreement. The fact that decedent retained the pass book is of no consequence.
