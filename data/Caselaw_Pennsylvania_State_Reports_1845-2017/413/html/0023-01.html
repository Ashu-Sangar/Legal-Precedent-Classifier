A curbing is constructed along both streets, but near the intersection on Shady Avenue, it is low or only about one inch above the surface of the street.

He then stated, that this water seeping downward “could <em>possibly </em>be a weakening of the area” and “there is a <em>possibility </em>that a void would be created under this area.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>
