Wray, an Alderman, came to the hospital where Glace was a patient, for the purpose of drawing Glace’s Will. The alleged will was written on a printed legal form with blank spaces— consisting of a single printed sheet of paper 8%" in width and 13" in length. The handwritten parts were all written by an Alderman, Charles E. Wray, with the exception of the signature, “George Glace.” The words “George Glace” were written by him on the front page after the word “I”, and again in the testimonium clause after the words “In Witness Whereof, I”. The alleged will was signed at the end of the testimonium clause, “Chas. E. Wray” on the line intended for the signature of the testator, with a seal opposite; and the word “Alderman” was written by Wray underneath his own signature.</p>

    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[194,640,1157,1279]]]'>Judge Fortney, in a very able opinion, held that <em>Churchill’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/260/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="260 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="1040244,1040326" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0094-01,/pa/260/0094-02">260 Pa. 94</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.%20533" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="103 A. 533">103 A. 533</a>, controlled this case. With this we agree. <em>Churchill’s Estate </em>is factually on all fours with the Glace instrument; indeed it is stronger for probate than the instant one. In <em>Churchill’s Estate, </em>the alleged will was written— as was Glace’s — by filling in blank spaces on a printed form. Churchill wrote his name in three blank spaces in the printed paper, first at the top, then in the testimonium clause, and then in the attestation clause. He did not sign his name at the end of the paper. The. Court said, “It is apparent that in writing his name in the three blank spaces in the form, decedent did not intend his name as a signature. A writing in of a name, in those circumstances, was not a signature and did not constitute an execution of a Will in conformity with the Wills Act. The place chosen by this decedent to affix his signature was at the point where the appointment of his executors was consummated”. <em>Churchill’s Estate, </em>we repeat, governs the instant case. Our conclusion is further supported by <em>Griffith Will, </em><a href="/pa/358/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="358 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="8845786" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0474-01">358 Pa. 474</a>, 483, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.2d%20893" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="57 A.2d 893">57 A. 2d 893</a>, and <em>Baldwin Will, </em><a href="/pa/357/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="357 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="472121" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0432-01">357 Pa. 432</a>, 436, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20263" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="55 A.2d 263">55 A. 2d 263</a>, each of which reaffirmed <em>Churchill’s Estate.</em>
