The facts are well summarized in the opinion of the court below as follows: “On February 13, 1962, an action in trespass was instituted by the filing of a complaint by Carl Rimpa against Helen Bell, formerly Helen Motter, Administratrix of the Es<a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>tate of Lawrence R. Motter, Deceased. The action was brought for the recovery of damages to a truck tractor owned by the Plaintiff as a result of the alleged negligence of the decedent, Lawrence R. Motter, at the time when the truck tractor was being operated by one William Hull, who was in the employ of Emery Transportation Company, which leased the truck tractor from the Plaintiff.</p>

Incorporated in the Original Defendants complaint was a counterclaim of the Original Defendant against the Additional Defendants for damages to the automobile of the decedent as a result of the accident.</p>

Motter, Deceased, executed a general release in favor of Emery Transportation Company, Mid-West Transfer Company (the successor to Emery Transportation Company), and William Hull, a copy of which was attached as part of the Answer, it being alleged that the terms of the release extended to the liability set forth in the Original Defendant’s complaint and counterclaim.</p>
