Fa. reaches the hands of the Sheriff.” In <em>Lombardo, </em>supra, this Court affirmed per curiam a decree upon the opinion of President Judge Hob an of the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County. In that opinion, the court found that the “words of the first sentence [of the Act] clearly indicate an intention to impress a lien on personalty in the hands of the employer at the time”, however, since liens are not self-executing and, since a later portion of Section 308.1 provides that “. . . it shall be lawful for writs of scire facias to issue and be prosecuted to judgment and execution in the same manner as such writs are ordinarily employed”, “such writs” must be “ordinarily employed” only as prescribed in the Act of 1836<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> which provides that a writ of fi. fa. will not bind a debtor’s property until the writ is delivered to the sheriff. Because of <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>this later portion of Section 308.1, the court found there “is an ambiguity as to the effectiveness of the lien so far as it binds personal property” and, in view of such ambiguity and the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent, held that the Commonwealth could not enforce its lien against personal property transferred, after entry of a lien, by the employer to a “bona fide transferee for legal value without actual notice of the filing of the lien as provided in section 308.1”. With <em>Lombardo, </em>we agree. However, neither <em>Lombardo </em>nor <em>Ersa, Inc. v. Dudley, </em><a href="/f2d/234/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="234 F.2d 178" data-case-ids="79610" data-case-paths="/f2d/234/0178-01">234 F. 2d 178</a>— also relied on by Quaker — are presently apposite.

In <em>Pittsburgh Petition, </em>supra, the Pittsburgh City Treasurer had sold certain real property for unpaid taxes which the City purchased; upon passage of the period of redemption, the City agreed to sell the property to a third person and the City then petitioned the court to confirm the sale free of all claims against the property. The Commonwealth had of record several liens for unemployment compensation contributions as to which it asserted priority.
