Harold Eittenhouse had been employed by Albert Eosman, doing business as Penn State Music Company, for many years, as manager of the business engaged in distributing cOin-operated music machines and coin-operated amusement devices.

    <p id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[197,681,1149,642]]]'>Harold Eittenhouse became employed by Independent Music Company, the other appellee, a few weeks after the formation of that Corporation by Pryor Neuber, sometime in March, 1961. Harold Eittenhouse owned no stock or interest in the Independent Music Company. All the stock of the corporation was owned by Mr. and Mrs. Pryor Neuber. The Independent Music Company is engaged in the distribution of coin operated music machines and coin operated amusement devices and is engaged in the same type of business as appellant and is in competition with Tri-State Music Company.</p>
    <p id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[197,1332,1148,804]]]'>The questions before the chancellor were (1) the construction of the contract, and (2) whether the defendants violated the agreement. The chancellor, in substance, found that the agreement containing the restrictive covenant applied only to the solicitation of business sites listed in. the agreement as those having done, business with Penn State Music Company, for which Harold Eittenhouse had formerly worked, and which sites he, under the agreement, was restricted from soliciting. The chancellor found as a fact that there was no violation of the agreement by the defendants, Eittenhouse and the Independent Music Company, and dismissed the complaint. Appellant filed exceptions to the adjudication, which were dismissed by the court en banc; this appeal followed.</p>

It does not prohibit competition nor is it an agreement to refrain from competing with the appellant for any period or in any area. The restriction is limited to solicitation of enumerated business sites. Appellee-Rittenhouse is a party to the agreement but appelleeindependent Music Company is not a party to the agreement. The undisputed evidence revealed that at the time Harold Rittenhouse became employed by Independent Music Company, Pryor Neuber, the President and sole owner, with his wife, of all of the stock of Independent, discussed the contract and particularly the restrictive covenant and instructed Harold Rittenhouse that he was not to solicit any of the sites mentioned in the agreement. The examination of the agreement naturally revealed the sites being serviced at the time by Tri-State and its predecessor, Penn State, and the occupants of those business sites, or many of them, were solicited by a person under the direction and instruction of Pryor Neuber. The list having been available to him, he did use it for the purpose of solicitation. The evidence reveals, and the chancellor so found, that Harold Rittenhouse was not a party to this action and did not participate in the solicitation in any way, and in fact scrupulously avoided any conduct proscribed by the restrictive covenant. Harold Rittenhouse’s work <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>■with Independent was to service the machines and make collections. Some former customers of Penn State did call Harold Rittenhouse to install the equipment of Independent. The evidence revealed that these calls were unsolicited by Rittenhouse and no overtures were made by him to the people calling for the equipment, directly or indirectly.</p>
    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[205,735,1150,1169]]]'>Appellant’s contention in this appeal, in respect to Harold Rittenhouse, is that he, Rittenhouse, turned over the list of sites to a felloAV employee of his new corporate employer, and Rittenhouse installed and serviced, at these locations, equipment of the corporation Avhich now employs him. There is no evidence •that Rittenhouse turned over the list to a fellow employee. The evidence reveals that the list in the contract was turned over to an employee of the corporation by its president. There was no evidence that Rittenhouse either directly or indirectly participated in •the solicitation of any locations on the list. He did, however, after changes, for various reasons, in some of the locations of Tri-State, install and service the equipment of Independent Music Company. This work was not proscribed by the restrictive covenant not to solicit. He was free to accept employment with a competitor and to do all things in the furtherance of a competitor’s business, with the exception of solicitation, either directly or indirectly, and the record reveals no violation of this agreement by any conduct of Rittenhouse.</p>

Martucci, </em><a href="/pa/390/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="390 Pa. 618" data-case-ids="1275672" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0618-01">390 Pa. 618</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=136%20A.2d%20838" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="136 A.2d 838">136 A. 2d 838</a> (1957), as authority to sustain his averment of improper conduct, both on the part of the corporate appellee and the individual appellee. The <em>Morgan </em>case is not apposite to the instant case. In this case, we are concerned with 42 locations in and about the City of Lancaster which were business establishments open <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>to the public, with equipment of appellant open to the public and in public view. The list of these sites was not a confidential one and was prepared and attached to the agreement for the purpose of specifically naming' the locations which the appellee Eittenhouse could not solicit. There were no trade secrets involved and no intent on the part of anyone to deceive. There was an open competition situation with only one restriction covered by the restrictive covenant, and that was that the former employee could not solicit any of the customers whose names were on the list prepared for the purpose of stating the locations which the former employee could not solicit.</p>
    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[194,1064,1150,745]]]'>There was no contractual arrangement between Tri-State and Independent, and since there was no confidential status between Eittenhouse and Tri-State, except the limited restrictive covenant, there was nothing to prevent Independent from competing with TriState. This is far different from the conditions', in <em>Morgan, </em>supra, where a former employee launched on a deliberate attempt to deceive the customers of Morgan, armed with confidential information in the nature of customer lists and other trade information, and where some of Morgan’s former employees, in violation of their agreement with Morgan to refrain from competing for a time within a certain area, did so compete.</p>
