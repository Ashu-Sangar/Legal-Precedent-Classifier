Under such definition, Patton, Esther Patton and Derr are within the defined word “insured”, and it is clear that the insurer agreed under the “Coverages” and “omnibus” clauses in the policy to pay all damages for bodily injuries for which any of such “insured” should “become legally obligated to pay”. In <em>Wenig v. Glens Falls Indemnity Co., </em><a href="/ny/294/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="294 N.Y. 195" data-case-ids="2064494" data-case-paths="/ny/294/0195-01">294 N.Y. 195</a>, 201, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20N.E.2d%20442" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="61 N.E.2d 442">61 N.E. 2d 442</a>, 445, Chief Judge Lehman aptly said of an “omnibus clause”: “The liability of the insurance company upon its promise to insure the ‘named assured’ is neither extended nor limited by the fact that <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>under the terms of the policy it assumed an obligation also to insure the ‘additional assured’ against liability for damages for which he might become liable.”</p>
    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[191,520,1148,1448]]]'>In considering the definition of “insured” in the “omnibus clause” we must bear in mind both the purpose and the language of that clause. The purpose of the “omnibus clause” was the <em>extension </em>of coverage, i.e., extension of protection against legal liability for damages for bodily injury, to a person or persons, other than the named insured and spouse, i.e., to a permissive user or users of the insured automobile. The language in the “omnibus clause” is highly significant; it does not constitute a blanket definition of “insured” for all purposes or as the word “insured” might appear elsewhere in other portions of the policy for the language distinctly and clearly states that <em>“with respect to the insurance afforded under coverages A and B, </em>[Bodily Injury Liability and Property Damage Liability] the unqualified word ‘insured’ includes”, etc. and to such the definition is limited and restricted. What the purchaser and seller of this policy clearly intended was that, through the medium of the “omnibus clause”, the person or persons to be protected were to be identified but not the person or persons against whose claims they were to be protected. Both the language and the purpose of the “omnibus clause” reveal that the word “insured” was defined for use only for a qualified and restricted purpose, to wit, the identification of the parties to whom protection under the policy was granted.</p>

Unlike the “omnibus clause”, the exclusionary clause delineated a certain class of individuals for the payment <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>of whose, damages claims for bodily injury no protection under, the policy would be allowed.</p>

To reach that result perverts the basic purpose of the “omnibus clause”, i.e., the <em>extension </em>of coverage to a person or persons other than the named insured and spouse, into a <em>denial </em>of coverage to the named insured by introducing into a clause intended to <em>exclude from coverage </em>a definition of “insured” from a clause intended to <em>extend coverage. </em>Such an introduction ignores the plain language and purpose of each clause and results in a deprivation of an essential protection for which the named insured bargained and paid.</p>

Such a construction preserves the true intent on the part of the insurer and the person purchasing such insurance and preserves the language and the separate purposes of both the “omnibus clause” and the exclusionary clause. Nowhere in this policy is language from which it can be inferred that protection to a named insured is withdrawn against liability to co-resident members of the family of the additional insured. In our view, this construction of the instant policy affords and permits a more sensible and just <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>solution than bad we engaged in tbe semantical merry-go-round of tbe sort necessary to afford no coverage to Patton.</p>
