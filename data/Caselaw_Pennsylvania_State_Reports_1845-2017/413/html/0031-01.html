In view of all the testimony in •the record, we cannot say that the verdict was inadequate or against the weight of the evidence. Neither can we find any abuse of discretion in the refusal :of the lower court to grant a new trial on this basis. Where the trial court refuses a new trial on the ground .of inadequacy, we will not interfere with its action in the absence of a gross abuse of discretion: <em>Paustenbaugh v.

    <p id="b58-4" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[222,581,1150,857]]]'>On direct examination, that particular witness stated that he was familiar with all of the sales that had recently taken place in the relevant area. He specifically mentioned his familiarity with the sales of the properties about which he was cross-examined. He further stated that in making his appraisal he took into consideration the sales that he had previously mentioned with the exception of two, neither of which were the sales now involved. The only reasonable conclusion, from a reading of his entire testimony, is that he was influenced, in his opinion as to valuation, by the sales involved. This being so, it was within the right of the cross-examiner to ask him what prices these properties sold for. The trial court excluded any interrogation as to the sales he said he did not consider in fixing the value.</p>
