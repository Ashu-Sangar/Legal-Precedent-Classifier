Section 1201(2) of the ordinance empowers the zoning board to grant special exceptions which are “herein expressly provided for, in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance, with power to impose appropriate conditions and safeguards.” Section 100 of the ordinance sets forth the “purpose and intent” as follows: “To promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare pf the inhabitants of the Township of Lower Moreland by lessening congestion in the streets, securing safety from fire, panic and other dangers; providing adequate <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>light and air, preventing the overcrowding of land; avoiding undue concentration of population; facilitating the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other requirements; conserving the value of buildings; and encouraging the most appropriate use of land.”</p>

    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[220,1169,1146,638]]]'>Implicit in appellants’ argument is the thought that an applicant for a special exception has the burden of establishing that the proposed use will not adversely affect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community.

No property owner is misled in this respect for every person purchasing a home site or a home in this district does so with notice contained in the ordinance that some day a school, a church or a philanthropic institution might be erected in the neighborhood.” The appellants apparently choose to be unmindful of the fact that both the court below and the Board attached conditions to the grant of the special exception and that these conditions — authorized by the ordinance — effectually guard against the evils foreseen by the appellants.</p>

To say, as do the appellants, that such tax loss per se is detrimental to the general welfare, is to say that the legislature had no concern for the general welfare in providing tax exemptions for religious and educational institutions. So universal is the belief that religious and educational institutions should be exempt from taxation that it would be odd indeed if we were to disapprove an action of the zoning authorities consistent with such belief and label it adverse to the general welfare.</p>
