Thereupon, appellant contracted with Universal Builders, Inc. (Universal), a general contractor, for the construction of the motel. A no lien agreement was filed and Universal provided a la<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>bor and materials bond. Before completion of the motel, appellant reconveyed the land to Berger and Parker.</p>

The court below appointed a permanent receiver and these appeals followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We hold that the appointment of a receiver was improper.</p>
    <p id="b249-5" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[177,800,1149,530]]]'>Appellee relies upon the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> to justify the appointment of a receiver. It argues that the reconveyance from appellant to Berger and Parker was fraudulent as to its rights as a creditor of appellant, and hence the court below had power to appoint a receiver under section 10 of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> While there are several defects in appellee’s position, it will suffice here to point out the most obvious one — appellee’s failure to show that it is a creditor of appellant.</p>

In an attempt to establish itself as a creditor of appellant, appellee invokes the doctrines of quasi contract, unjust enrichment, and constructive trust without, however, demonstrating how these general principles are applicable to the facts of the instant case. It may be that Universal is a creditor of appellant. In such event, however, appellee must obtain a judgment or take other steps against Universal; it cannot proceed directly against appellant un<a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>der the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act.
