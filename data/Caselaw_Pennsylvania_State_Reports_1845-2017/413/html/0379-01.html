The site of construction is owned by a group of investors known as the Cedarbrook Joint Venture. The appeal challenged as unconstitutional Township Ordinance No. 938, pursuant to which the property had been rezoned, on the grounds that the zoning change depreciated the value of surrounding properties by fifty percent, thus constituting .an unlawful taking, and that the rezoning constituted unlawful spot zoning. After a complete and lengthy hearing,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the board of adjustment denied the appeal and affirmed the issuance of the permit.</p>

A hearing was held by the court, which set the supersedeas bond at $75,000. The civic association did not post bond, and the supersedeas was not granted. Without taking additional testimony, the court below held that ordinances No. 938 and No. 873, to which the former was an amendment, were invalid on the authority of <em>Eves v.

Cheltenham Township adopted a general zoning ordinance and zoning map in 1929, which established zoning districts throughout the township. Ordinance No. 873 was enacted on May 17, 1956, “to amend, supplement and re-enact the Cheltenham Zoning Ordinance of 1929, as amended.” Section 200 divided the township into eight designated districts, including “FF Commercial and Business District,” one of the classifications later applied to the Cedarbrook property.</p>

The property now owned by the Cedarbrook Joint Venture, a large triangular tract bordered by Cheltenham and Ogontz Avenues and Easton Road, less than one-quarter mile from the first FF area, was then occupied by the Cedarbrook Country Club and was zoned by ordinance No. 873 “C Residential” along the highways and “A Residential” in the center.</p>
    <p id="b407-4" data-blocks='[["BL_407.5",407,[203,1111,1149,856]]]'>Beginning in September, 1958, a series of public meetings were held between members of the Cedarbrook Joint Venture<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and the board of township commissioners to consider the future use of the Cedarbrook tract which was being purchased for development.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> On February 17, 1959, apparently as a result of the earlier meetings, ordinance No. 873 was amended by ordinance No. 934, which created “FFF Commercial Districts.” In these districts, office buildings, multiple dwellings, apartment buildings, hotels, and accessory uses were permitted. Although setting forth specific land coverage requirements and limitations, the new ordinance, as did ordinance No. 873, provided for application by landowners to the board of commissioners for re-classification, accompanied by the same type of development plan.</p>

The application and plan requested that 33 acres of the tract be rezoned to FF Commercial and that the remaining 116 acres be rezoned FFF Commercial. The FF area would contain an enclosed mall shopping center, including 23 acres for parking. In the FFF area would be constructed five high-rise apartment buildings located on 70 acres of land, a hotel on six acres, and office buildings on approximately 41 acres. The 70 acre apartment area would include, for use of apartment residents, a swim club and a 40 acre golf course in the center of the tract, separating the apartments from the commercial area.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[212,1335,1145,475]]]'>Mr. Merriam testified, both on direct examination and on cross-examination by counsel for the civic association, and explained in detail the considerations entered into in reaching the finalized plan. Particularly emphasized was the fact that development of the entire 150 acre tract was contemplated as an integrated complex and comprehensive whole, not as individual projects on separate parcels of land. The total cost of the undertaking was estimated at $50,000,000.</p>

Although there was no specific objection at the time, later in the meeting a representative of the Curtis Hills and other civic associations requested that the commissioners continue the hearing until studies on sewage, flood control, traffic and policing be made, the developers’ ability to finance <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>be demonstrated, and a master plan by tbe planning commission be submitted.

After testifying that the increase would be devoted to additional parking areas, Mr. Merriam was extensively cross-examined by an attorney on behalf of the civic association. A witness for the association, testifying in opposition to the proposed increase, stated that two years earlier, when the tract was rezoned, all were pleased that the plan was a finalized arrangement and that everyone was satisfied with the way it had been set up. The theme and tenor of the opposition was satisfaction with the original plan and an insistence that the developers be required to adhere to it. The view of the protestants prevailed, and the amendment was refused.</p>

The Cedarbrook Joint Venture consummated the purchase of the tract for $3,150,000; a commitment, expiring in September, 1964, for $7,500,000 was obtained from a life insurance company; and a lease was signed with E. J. Korvette, Inc., for a department store to be ready for occupancy in October, 1963, with optional delivery <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>in February, 1964. The completion of at least one apartment building was to coincide with construction of the shopping center. In addition, a general building contractor was engaged.</p>

No one challenged the issuance of the permit, and the period during which an appeal could be taken expired. In the latter half of 1962, further meetings were held between the commissioners, the Joint Venture and the residents. The installation of sewage and electrical systems to serve the entire development was begun during the same period of time.</p>

The issuance of a building permit is such a decision. See <em>Home Life Insurance Co. v.

In <em>Herslcovits, </em>a building permit for partial construction of a building was issued pursuant to a valid ordinance which was later amended. That permit was revoked after substantial work had begun, and a final permit for completion was refused. We affirmed the court below and held that the property owner had acquired a vested right in the permits by virtue of his good faith reliance on the original, valid permit and his expenditure of time, effort and money in exercising the privilege granted by it.</p>

No vested rights arose because appellant had not made expenditures on a pre<a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>viously issued permit. Although, expenditure by the developer may be relevant where the question is one of equity and waiver, the crucial issue in determining whether protestants have waived their rights is basically the nature of their conduct, not necessarily the conduct of the builder.</p>

    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[196,796,1147,964]]]'>The record reveals that, since 1958, when use of the property and rezoning was officially brought before the board of commissioners at public hearings, members and representatives of the Curtis Hills Civic Association had the opportunity to and did participate in the final formulation of the comprehensive plan for development of the Cedarbrook tract. The record also indicates that Mrs. Diamond herself attended many of these meetings. At the important meeting of April 21, 1959, the plan was presented by the developer, Mr. Merriam, who was cross-examined by counsel for the civic association. He explained in detail that the project was to be undertaken as an integrated complex, each part dependent upon the other, not as separate projects on separate parcels. No opposition was voiced other than a request that reassurances be given on specific matters at future hearings. It appears that these' matters were satisfactorily resolved.</p>

The clear basis of their antagonism to the change was that a satisfactory plan had . been agreed upon, and the civic association did not want it changed. As noted earlier, a witness called for the civic association testified: “We were all pleased to the degree that it was a finalized arrangement. This is what the promoter told us. . . . This is a very, very important thing to our people in the residential area. We are complete-<a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>]y satisfied with the potential development of the Cedarbrook tract in so far as the commercial area has been set up — the residential area has been set up: A hotel may be erected on the premises, if you recall, and the research labs. We are in agreement with that, but we are not in agreement with anything else.”</p>
    <p id="b415-5" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[204,685,1149,360]]]'>Protestants’ counsel stated: “But this we do know, that this Board gave him 33 acres of commercialization and gave him the balance of 3-F for certain specific purposes under a certain specific plan, and the Civic Associations went along with those plans on the basis that the man was giving us an honest concept of what he intended to do.”</p>

The opportunity was utilized, and the residents - succeeded in preventing expansion of the commercial area. There is no indication that other reasonable objections, if raised, would have met with less success. Appellees not only interposed no objection to the plan, but, by their statements and conduct, indicated acquiescence in its implementation and completion.</p>
    <p id="b415-7" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[200,1607,1151,531]]]'>Appellees testified that they had no idea that a discount department store, as distinguished from a “quiet type” operation, would become part of the shopping center. Had they known, it was urged, they would have opposed more strongly. But they did know that a large department store was planned as part of a shopping center containing 600,000 square feet of sales space. This argument, in effect, would grant appellees the privilege of tenant selection to which they cannot reasonably be entitled.</p>

Instead, fully aware that the project called for an interdependent complex premised on implementation of the complete plan for development, the residents remained silent and permitted the appeal period to lapse. Construction of the apartment building was begun, sewage and electrical lines for the entire project were started, the engineering drawings for the shopping center were completed, and various contracts and financing arrangements were negotiated. Six months later, shortly after issuance of the building permit for the shopping center, appellees took their appeal.</p>

The builder there acquired land for residential development pursuant to a single overall plan for the entire tract. To facilitate financing, construction, and orderly development, it was divided into four sections. After approval of the first section, extensive planning and construction was undertaken. However, after approval of the second quarter, the ordinance was amended, and approval of sections three and four was refused. The court said (<a href="/citations/?q=218%20N.Y.S.2d%20175" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="218 N.Y.S.2d 175">218 N.Y.S. 2d at 177</a>) : “It is clear from this record that the water system, roads, drainage system, model house construction and advertising were laid out and designed for the benefit of all four sections developed as a single, overall tract; that they would have been laid out and treated on an entirely different basis if the development of each section were to be separate; and that, prior to the zoning amend<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>ment, substantial construction had been commenced and substantial expenditures had been made in partial development of sections three and four, as well as sections one and two.

    <p id="b417-6" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[206,695,1149,583]]]'>While that case involved the concept of vested rights, which we noted earlier, it also supports the proposition that the integrated, comprehensive, staged development of a large tract of land may and should be treated as a single undertaking. That principle is equally applicable to the instant case where the protestants were fully cognizant of the nature and comprehensiveness of the development. It is of little consequence that involved here are two differently zoned districts with varying uses, as opposed to the single zoning classification in <em>Telimar.</em>

However, the president of the Curtis Hills Civic Association later testified:.“Now, we don’t object to the apartments per se but we object to the over-all permission of zoning under which the apartments exist and we still do ask that that zoning in its entirety be reviewed, reconsidered and withdrawn. . . .</p>

We need not reach that question. Since the civic association is clearly attacking the entire development plan, the proper time to have appealed was at the issuance of the first permit for its implementation. To allow a complex, comprehensive plan for development of as large a tract of land as is here involved to be attacked on a piece by piece basis would result in the greatest of inequities to the developers. This is particularly true on the facts here presented, which demonstrate that not only were the residents completely informed of all phases and the nature of the development program, but that they were also able to and did participate in the formulation and finalization of the development plan.</p>
