The case was called for trial on December 11, 1961. On December 13, 1961, a jury was impaneled and sworn and the case was tried by a jury and Judge. On December 19th, the trial Judge charged the jury; and at the conclusion of his charge, viz., at 4:34 p.m., the case was given to the jury for deliberation. The record is silent as to exactly what occurred thereafter,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> but it was assumed by counsel for both appellant and appellee that the jury had its dinner and after some deliberation retired for the night. The following morning the jury resumed deliberation of the case. At 11:27 a.m. the jury returned to the Courtroom for further instructions and at 12:07 p.m. retired to resume its deliberations. Approximately forty-five minutes later, the jury returned to the Courtroom and informed the trial Judge that it was in disagreement. Thereupon, the following colloquy took place: “The Court : Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have had this case since yesterday afternoon. I know you have given it your very best consideration. The length of time we have taken to try this case ordinarily would have been two weeks and you have been here nine days now. May I ask you, Madam Forelady, it is now five minutes of one. If you went out and had lunch and tried again, because we are supposed to suggest to you that you must remain and deliberate as long as you can hope that you might arrive at agreement, do you think if you did that, that you could reach a verdict? Do you think that would be helpful? The Forelady: I don’t think it would be helpful, Your Honor.

The Court: Then I presume you want me as the judge to say this is .a mistrial, that you just cannot acome to an agreement. The Forelady: I am afraid so. • (Side bar discussion with counsel.)

Pending the trial, the jury was permitted to separate, which, it was urged, compelled a reversal. We said (page 256), ‘As the conviction was of the second degree the case ceased to be a capital one and the temporary separation of the jury, of which complaint is made, becomes unimportant.’</p>

The cases in which the protection of the clause may be invoked are those in which, at the time the crime was committed, <em>it was punishable by death. </em>Thus, crimes which at common law were capital, but which under our statutes are not so punished, are not within the meaning of the provision. If at some future time the punishment for murder should be made life imprisonment in all cases, the clause in question would be of no service, except because of the possibility of a return to capital punishment.’ For these latter statements there is the express authority of McCreary v. Com., <a href="/pa/29/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="29 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="982815" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0323-01">29 Pa. 323</a>, 326.</p>

When it appeared the jury was unable to agree on a verdict, it was discharged; subsequently the accused were again put on trial. Their defense was former jeopardy. The plea was overruled and they were convicted. We affirmed the sentence, in the opinion making it clear that the constitutional provision applied only to capital offenses, saying: ‘It is not denied that the clause applies to cases of felony of death; but no case has been cited showing its application to crime of an inferior grade. ... It [the constitutional provision] is not so inexorable as to shut out a practical construction demanded by necessity, and the safety of the community. . . . That it applies to capital cases is on all hands conceded, for both “life and limb” are there in jeopardy. But this cannot be said when imprisonment alone is the punishment. There life is surely not jeopardized. But if the construction asked for be tolerated, that where imprisonment places “life or limb” in jeopardy, convictions for assault and battery might with equal propriety be embraced. ... We find them coupled together in the Constitution, and all we can do is to give them a rational and practical interpretation.’ . . .</p>

The Judge dismissed the jury at the first sign of disagreement, after the jurors had been deliberating only a relatively short period of time. We believe that the trial Judge dismissed the jury (1) before there was any <em>absolute necessity or realistic justification </em>for the discharge, and (2) without the actual or express consent of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b139-3" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[188,953,1150,1075]]]'>In reaching our conclusion that defendant cannot be tried again for murder of the first degree even though the penalty be limited to life imprisonment, we are influenced by the fact and the law that in a trial for murder a jury can impose the penalty of death irrespective of the recommendations of a district attorney or of the Court itself: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Johnson v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/411/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="411 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1886005" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0497-01">411 Pa. 497</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.2d%20381" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="192 A.2d 381">192 A. 2d 381</a>. It would be illogical and unreasonable to hold that on a second trial for murder in the first degree, the jury could find defendant guilty of murder in the first degree but the law would not permit it to impose the death penalty. For these reasons we hold that the maxim that silence gives consent should not be applied to a situation as grave and a constitutional right as important as this. In other words, mere silence by defendant or his counsel to the proposed discharge of the jury by the trial Judge will not amount to a waiver of this very important constitutional right of every person accused of a capital offense.</p>
