      <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Vogt, Inc., </em>354 U.S. (1957), supra, is well summarized in the syllabus: “Respondent owns and operates a gravel pit in Wisconsin, where it employs 15 to 20 men. Petitioner unions sought unsuccessfully to induce some of respondent’s employees to join the unions and began picketing the entrance to respondent’s gravel pit with signs reading, ‘The men on this job are not 100% affiliated with the A.F.L.’ As a result, drivers of several trucking companies refused to deliver and haul goods to and from respondent’s plant, causing substantial damage to respondent. On respondent’s application, a State Court enjoined the picketing. The injunction was sustained by the State Supreme Court <em>on findings ~by it </em>that (1) the picketing had been engaged in for the purpose of coercing respondent to force its employees to become members of petitioner unions, and (2) such picketing was for ‘an unlawful purpose,’ since <a href="/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7111.06" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="Wis.
