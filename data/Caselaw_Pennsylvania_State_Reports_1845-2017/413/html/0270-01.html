      <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>The actions were instituted as a result of a collision of automobiles. The facts concerning this collision are fully set forth in <em>Thomas v. Tomay, </em><a href="/pa/394/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="394 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="1280947" data-case-paths="/pa/394/0299-01">394 Pa. 299</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.2d%20321" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="147 A.2d 321">147 A. 2d 321</a> (1959). The facts are summarized as follows : On November 4, 1951, at about 1:45 A.M., a sedan, driven by Theodore Wade Frazee, of Friendsville, Maryland, while going south towards Uniontown from Pittsburgh on Highway Route No. 51, collided with a car driven by Frank Tomay, Jr.</p>
    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[205,847,1146,251]]]'>The appellants, Richard C. Thomas, and James Vernon Shultz, were passengers in the Frazee automobile and were severely injured as a result of the collision. Tomay, Jr., the sole occupant of his car, died a few hours after the collision.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[204,1119,1148,476]]]'>Five years more have elapsed since we said “At the outset, we are impelled to remark the great length of time that was allowed to elapse before these cases were brought to trial — a circumstance which is all the more regrettable since they must go back for retrial because of reversible error, harmful to the appellant, which the record discloses”. <em>Thomas v. Tomay, </em>supra, at page 300. Once again, the cases must go back for retrial because of reversible error, harmful to the appellants.</p>
    <p id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[204,1607,1148,628]]]'>There were three separate actions instituted. Mary Tomay, administratrix of the Estate of Frank Tomay, Jr., sued Theodore Wade Frazee under the wrongful death and survival statutes, to recover damages for decedent’s death. The respective guardians of Richard C. Thomas, a minor, and James Vernon Shultz, a minor, brought separate suits against Mary Tomay, administratrix of the Estate of Frank Tomay, Jr., to recover damages for their personal injuries. In the actions by the passengers Thomas and Shultz against the Estate of Tomay, Jr., Frazee was joined as an additional defendant.</p>

Verdicts were returned against the Estate of Tomay <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>and Frazee in favor of the passengers, Thomas and Shnltz. These verdicts were appealed and we granted a new trial. <em>Thomas v. Tomay, </em>snpra.</p>

In the present case, the court either should not have instructed the jury on contributory negligence; or, if it was thought necessary to instruct them on that subject, the Trial Judge should have told them specifically that such an issue was not in this case.”</p>
