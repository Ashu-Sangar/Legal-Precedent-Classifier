Second, is the note void on its face because it was not executed by two officers of the corporation? We are of the opinion that both questions must be answered in the negative, and that, therefore, the only procedure for attacking the validity of the note is by way of petition to open judgment.

From the record before us, we cannot determine whether or not the corporation adopted this form of seal for the purpose of the note. Certainly, a corporation may adopt a common form of seal in executing any particular instrument, regardless of the fact that it has its own peculiar or unique seal which it might use for general business transactions. <em>Lebowitz v.

The defense was raised that the note was not executed by the two officers described in Section 2 of the Act of May 12, 1925, P. L. 615. This position was rejected because the Act did not preclude the corporation from selecting and authorizing another execution procedure.</p>

If the ruling below is undisturbed, judgments entered on such obligations would be subject to motion to strike without an opportunity to establish that a particular officer possessed authority to act for the corporation and to execute the instrument. Proceeding by way of petition to open preserves the judgment and permits the creation of a record in which validity is tested. The financial institutions further urge that once notes have been confessed of record, the powers to confess have been exhausted, and banks would be left without remedies they were intended to have and without which they would not have entered into certain transactions in the first instance. It is indicated also that the Prothonotary of Philadelphia County, in reliance on the decision below, is now accepting such obligations for filing only upon an appearance being entered by an attorney who certifies authorized execution of the instrument, which involves additional expense and delay.</p>
