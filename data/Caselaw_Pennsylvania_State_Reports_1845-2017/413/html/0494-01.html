Our examination of the record reveals no such admission. On the contrary, Pankas testified, and his records indicated, that Bell commenced his latest employment with Pankas on March 5, 1962, and that the contract discussions had lasted about a week before Bell commenced work. The court below obviously believed Pankas and, in light of Bell’s confused testimony as to what happened at that period, we see every reason why the court should credit Pankas on this point.

      <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>In <em>Harbison, </em>the court held that a minor could be enjoined from breaching his covenant not to serve milk to his former employer’s customers within a year after his discharge from service. The court, relying, in large part, on <em>Fellows v. Wood, </em>59 L.T.R. 513 (Q.B.) and <em>Evans v. Ware, </em>3 Ch. 502, 67 L.T.R. 285, said: “But [other minors’ contracts] have been recognized by the courts and held binding on the ground that they are clearly beneficial to the infant. Among these are his contracts of service. The test of validity is,. ‘Is the contract as a whole beneficial to the infant?’ If so, it will be enforced. If not, he may avoid it.” (698) In <em>Bradley, </em>the court refused to enjoin a professional boxer, who was a minor, from boxing under the auspices of persons other than a person with whom he had contracted as his manager. The court held that, while equity can restrain a minor from violating a contract not to compete in business with his employer for a certain number of years after leaving the employment, yet, if there is no element of competition involved, equity will not enforce a minor’s contract for personal services by an injunction compelling him not to render similar services for others.

      <em> </em>5 S. &amp; E. 309, stated that, while infants' are liable on their contracts for necessaries, there are “numerous decisions . . . that minors are not liable <em>on any other form of contract” </em>(Emphasis supplied). In <em>Niedland, </em>the rule in <em>Harbison </em>was approved and applied. Although it was pointed out to the court that <em>Harbison </em>constituted a dangerous precedent in that it tended to strip from minors the “protective cloak” which the law has always thrown about them, the court stated: “. . . the law should not allow a so-called ‘protective cloak’ to be used by a minor as an in<a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>strument for deliberately evading the dictates of common sense, good conscience, and a sense of justice. Where a contract is without taint of fraud or overreaching, and is for the benefit of a minor, the minor should not be permitted to disaffirm where such action would result in injustice and damage to the other contracting party.” (422)</p>

Therein, a 19 year old minor had entered the employ of the plaintiff as the driver of a milk delivery wagon and had signed a contract agreeing, inter alia, not to solicit business from plaintiff’s customers or deliver dairy products to them within three years after leaving plaintiff’s employ ; the contract was terminable by either party upon one week’s notice; several months later the minor quit and entered the employment of a rival milk dealer and solicited business from the plaintiff’s customers. In upholding the issuance of an injunction against the minor who had pleaded infancy to avoid the contract, the court stated: “Although he had not arrived at the age at which all contracts with him would be binding, he was of sufficient age to appreciate the nature of this <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>contract, and to know whether or not it was for his benefit.” (158) The court considered that the issue was not one of the liability of a minor for a breach of his contract but whether a minor should be thereunder permitted to repudiate his contract without restoring what he had received and, if restoration cannot be made, without being enjoined from making use of the information he had gained from his employment by the plaintiff to the latter’s damage. The court held that the minor should be enjoined “from making use of that information, in violation of his agreement made at the time when he desired and obtained employment, and upon the faith of which he obtained the information and acquaintance” (159), and the court further observed: “No man would engage the services of an infant if he could not impose the same condition for his own protection against the use of his formulas, trade secrets, and lists of customers that he could exact of an adult.”</p>
