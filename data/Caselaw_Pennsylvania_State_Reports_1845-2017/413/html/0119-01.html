Each of these cases involved the question of the admissibility of a corporate capital stock tax return <em>to evidence the value of taxpayers’ land </em>which was taken <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>by condemnation in eminent domain proceedings. The question involved in the instant case is the question of detention damages, not the value of the condemned land, and consequently these cases are clearly inapplicable.</p>
