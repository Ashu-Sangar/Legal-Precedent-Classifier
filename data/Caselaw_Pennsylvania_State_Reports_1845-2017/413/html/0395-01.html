Maurice Seifert (Seifert) manufactures and sells machinery and equipment used in applying labels to containers and other items by means of a heat sealing process. Seifert has been developing an attachment to a cigarette purchasing machine whereby labels can be cut from a continuous roll and fed into the machine.</p>

      <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>In 1956 Globe and Seifert jointly organized Dumatic Industries, Inc. (Dumatic) for the purpose of manufacturing and merchandising these machines. As part of the incorporation agreement, Seifert transferred his patents on the manufacturing process to Dumatic and agreed to be sales representative for all Globe labels processed through equipment manufactured by Dumatic. In return, Globe furnished working capital to the corporation and promised to furnish the labels necessary in the process. Globe and Seifert each received 50% of the stock of Dumatic and each appointed two directors of the corporation.</p>

Globe retaliated by petitioning for removal of the law firm representing Seifert alleging a conflict of interest in that firm’s dual capacity as counsel for Dumatic and Seifert.</p>

Apart from the incorporation agreement, however, it is nothing more than a conduit for the reception of patents from Seifert on the one hand and working capital from Globe on the other. As such, it is merely an appendage to the separate businesses of these two stockholders.</p>
    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.6",423,[200,968,1149,577]]]'>It is apparent that Seifert has adopted the position that Globe has now found it contrary to its interest to uphold its part of the incorporation agreement. Accordingly, Seifert filed suit for the purpose of enforcing that agreement realizing the futility of asking the board of directors to do so. Subsequently, he did introduce a resolution requesting authorization for the suit but, as expected, the vote on the resolution resulted in a deadlock with the two Globe directors voting against the institution of suit. Globe in turn has filed for dissolution of Dumatic.</p>

With respect to a possible conflict of interest, the latter lawsuit differs from the derivative suit only in that it more clearly depicts the actual parties in interest by bringing into issue the continuation of Dumatic. The failure of the court below to view the parties likewise in No. 217 was error and we therefore reverse the order below and direct that counsel for Seifert be reinstated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>
