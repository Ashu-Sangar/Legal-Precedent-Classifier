The identity of the cause of action is obvious. It is one and the same in both suits. The 1957 action settled that issue once and for all. It cannot now be resurrected. See, <em>Federal Land Bank v. Putnam, </em><a href="/pa/350/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="350 Pa. 533" data-case-ids="461160" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0533-01">350 Pa. 533</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20586" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="39 A.2d 586">39 A. 2d 586</a> (1944); and <em>London v.

The basic cause of action in the 1957 case was the removal of the coal. See, <em>Pantall v. Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em><a href="/pa/204/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="204 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="927539" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0158-01">204 Pa. 158</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.%20751" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="53 A. 751">53 A. 751</a> (1902). The present claim is premised upon the same violation of duty. While the relief sought is enlarged, no new cause of action is presented. The violation of duty in both actions was the removal of the coal, not the damages resulting therefrom. The damages sought are but a consequence of the original trespass. See <em>Pantall v. Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em>supra; <em>Simodejka v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/360/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="360 Pa. 332" data-case-ids="475060" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0332-01">360 Pa. 332</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.2d%2017" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="62 A.2d 17">62 A. 2d 17</a> (1948); and <em>London v. Philadelphia, </em>supra. The final determination of the 1957 action precludes the plaintiffs from maintaining this suit, even though other grounds for relief are asserted than those presented in the original action. That action was conclusive, not only as to those matters that actually were litigated, but also of those matters which could have been litigated therein. Restatement, Judgments, §63; <em>Jones v.

See, Restatement, Torts, §162. However, a continuing trespass must be distinguished from a trespass that effects a permanent change in the condition of the land. The latter, while resulting in a continuing harm, does not subject the trespasser to liability for a continuing trespass. See, Restatement, Torts, §162, comment d. If a nuisance at the time of creation is a permanent one, the consequences of which in the normal course of things will continue indefinitely, there can be but a single action therefor to recover past and future darn1 ages and the statute of limitations runs against such cause of action from the time it first occurred, or at least from the date it should reasonably have been discovered.
