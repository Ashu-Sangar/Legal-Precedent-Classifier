On a number of these visits appellant threatened to kill Mrs. Boston and some or all of her children. Russell Boston, aged 14, one of decedent’s sons, testified that on one occasion his brother, Daniel, aged 17, stepped between his mother and appellant when they were fighting and the appellant threatened him with a knife.

If the trial Judge or Court permits a jury to hear “penalty” evidence after a very long deliberation as to guilt, or when for any reason they are tired or exhausted or ill, it is an abuse of discretion and amounts to a denial of due process, i.e., the fundamentals of a fair trial, whenever a defendant is convicted. On the other hand, if a jury is permitted or required to hear “penalty” evidence after a dinner or a good night’s rest, that constitutes, according to this appellant, an abuse of discretion and a denial of due process. In other words, heads, the defendant wins; tails, the Commonwealth loses.</p>
