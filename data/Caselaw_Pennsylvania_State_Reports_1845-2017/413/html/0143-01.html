    <p id="b169-3" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[177,581,1152,1019]]]'>On December 28, 1962 approximately seven of King Jack’s Foodarama’s fifty employees went on strike and began picketing the Foodarama place of business. The Foodarama is located in a shopping center which fronts on a parking lot. There is only one entrance to the parking lot and this is through a four lane wide driveway. Burt’s Pennsylvania, Inc. also fronts on the parking lot with the one driveway entrance. Big 0 Shopping Center, Inc., is the owner of the building in which the two stores are located. Only Foodarama was engaged in the labor dispute. Burt’s and Big C Shopping Center were not parties to any labor trouble. The pickets -placed themselves in this driveway and thus impeded the flow of business into the shopping center. Some vehicles turned away and did not enter. The strikers also set up picketing in the front and rear of Foodarama and pickets were placed at a footbridge connecting a municipal parking lot with plaintiff’s property.</p>
    <p id="b169-4" data-blocks='[["BL_169.5",169,[176,1612,1149,359]]]'>The plaintiffs then filed a petition seeking a pre: liminary injunction to compel the defendants to cease picketing. On the 7th day of January, 1963, the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, sitting in equity, granted an injunction upon findings of violence and unlawful picketing and enjoined all picketing by the defendants.</p>

A picketing employee threatened to split open the head of another employee if he reported for work.</p>
    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[208,471,1148,587]]]'>The appellant contends that a state court does not have jurisdiction to issue an injunction against a labor organization’s picketing of premises occupied by several employers subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, and the injunction limiting all picketing — not just limited to violation of law— is improper. The National Labor Relations Board, in the Advisory Opinion, Case No. AO-49, states that this dispute of unfair labor practices is properly before the Board under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.</p>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[207,1067,1149,1020]]]'>The appellant is correct to the extent that the state courts may not decide questions of unfair labor practices when the issues are “arguably” within the scope of the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. The law is clear that the National Labor Relations Board has with certain exceptions exclusive jurisdiction under such circumstances. This is true, even though the acts complained of unquestionably violate the state statutory labor law. See <em>Garner v. Teamsters, C. &amp; H.
