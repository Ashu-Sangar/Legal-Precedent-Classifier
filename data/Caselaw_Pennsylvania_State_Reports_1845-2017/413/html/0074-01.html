Appellant contends also that Deike and Ryan, majority stockholders and top management executives, had confidential corporate information of special facts and circumstances involving secret and continuing negotiations with the Navy not available or known to him, and that in purchasing stock from him, the chairman of the board and the president of the company traded on inside confidential information and sought to profit personally on the basis of confidential knowledge acquired in their capacities of corporate fiduciaries.

They seek to sustain this position primarily on the argument that appellant, by virtue of his years of management association with MSA, had “intimate knowledge” of the company’s traditional <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>policy of avoiding public distribution of its stock and encouraging instead acquisition of shares by its officers, employees and “other friendly interests”, and that when the company bought back its stock (in accordance with by-laws or contract provisions), the company did not retain such stock in its treasury but redistributed the purchased stock to its “own officers and employees, and others closely associated with the company in some business way.” It is further contended that appellant may not prevail in this proceeding because he unduly delayed his action for rescission and, hence, is guilty of laches. In support of this result, appellees argue that had appellant made knoAvn his election to rescind the sales earlier and shortly after the award of the Muskogee contract had become knoAvn to him in 1956, appellees might have reversed the sales “at a cost of not more than $15.00 per share,” Avhereas his attack on the validity of the sales coming in April, 1958, at a time when shares (in small lots) were being sold at prices “higher than $300.00 per share,” made the cost and difficulty of any attempt to restore the status quo “insuperably great.”</p>

This Court has recently reaffirmed the principle that a contract provision which requires an offer of stock first to other stockholders (or to the corporation) before sale to outsiders is valid and enforceable. <em>Mather Estate, </em><a href="/pa/410/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="410 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="1884583" data-case-paths="/pa/410/0361-01">410 Pa. 361</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=189%20A.2d%20586" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="189 A.2d 586">189 A. 2d 586</a> (1963). In the <em>Mather </em>case, we upheld a decree of specific performance directing a decedent’s estate to sell stock representing majority control to surviving shareholders at the price fixed in a restrictive agreement, $1 per share, a figure far below actual value at the time ($1,060 per share). The controversy in <em>Mather </em>was based on the very great disparity between the contract price and the actual value of the stock. Here, the principal dis<a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>pute centers on substitution of persons not named or included in the contract in place of the expressly-named corporate purchaser.

The market inference which logically flows from a purchase of additional shares by such a corporate officer is that something of importance may be occurring in the affairs of the company. Appellant reasonably could have concluded that if the acquisition were worthwhile to the Deike and Ryan families to the exclusion of others, it might have been just as worthwhile for him to retain his stock. At the very least, their desire to purchase would have been a proper factor for his consideration and determination of the quantity and price of shares to be sold. He was entitled to this information, par<a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>ticularly since lie was not disposing of his entire holding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[197,470,1149,845]]]'>The court below concluded, as appellees strongly argue here, that in view of appellant’s long and intimate, relationship with MSA, he knew of the custom of the company to make distributions of stock to its officers, friends and employees. Appellees contend that knowledge of this policy made immaterial the actual identity of the purchasers, since appellant should have known that the corporation itself would retain none of the stock. The simple answer to such contention is that custom could not supplant the express terms of the written agreement entered into with knowledge of the custom. Moreover, careful examination of the record reveals that the custom and policy, knowledge of which appellees attribute to appellant and upon which the former base their case, was not followed in these transactions.</p>
    <p id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[195,1335,1148,744]],["BL_111.1",111,[197,359,1148,636]]]'>Although the policy of MSA was to distribute stock purchased under restrictive agreements to key employees, officers, etc., no such distribution was here made. As stated in the brief for appellees: “The members of the Deike and Ryan families have usually shared in these distributions, among other things, no doubt, in order to preserve their positions as majority stockholders,” and “The plans of distribution were settled, and the distribution prices fixed, by the directors of the Company, and were always so formulated as to preserve, by at least narrow margins, the majority positions of the Deike and Ryan families, considered as a group . . : .” Further, in a 1954 transaction, where stock was purchased directly by one of the Deikes from <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>the estate of a late shareholder pursuant to a restrictive agreement, the purchaser did not retain the shares for himself or his family, but immediately redistributed the stock more broadly, as was the custom. Here, the stock was taken entirely by the Deike and Byan families. Thus, even assuming, as contended by appellees, that knowledge and expectation of compliance with the corporation’s distribution policy would have made immaterial the identity of the actual purchasers of appellant’s stock, the failure to comply with that policy renders totally ineffective the argument based upon it.</p>
    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[195,1008,1149,576]]]'>Nor can appellees effectively contend that appellant has suffered no damage because he received the fair market price for his shares. What they term “fair market price” was based only upon knowledge then available to the public. However,. when the confidential information previously in possession of Deike and Byan was released to the public, the market price of shares in MSA rose sharply. The price that appellees contend was fair on the market was not fair as between appellant and appellees under these circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b111-6" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[191,1606,1150,472]]]'>Viewed realistically, the undisputed factual situation is simply this: MSA did not exercise the first refusal option granted it by the contract.

To the contrary, in 1956, appellant had no reason to suspect <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>that he had been dealt with not in accord with the terms of the agreement. The stock sales by him in 1955 and 1956 were, to his knowledge, to the corporation pursuant to its express terms. The 1957 sale of shares by appellant directly to MSA, subsequently attacked in the district court on federal grounds, was in exact compliance with the contract. It was not until January, 1958, at pre-trial proceedings in the federal action, that appellant discovered the identity of the purchasers of his stock and that neither the terms of the contract nor of his offer to sell had been observed in 1955 and 1956. Only at that time was appellant aware of the facts giving rise to the cause of action presently before us; only then did he have reason to seek rescission of those sales. Suit was begun in June, 1958, after negotiations for the return of the stock had failed. The additional delay of five months was not unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>
