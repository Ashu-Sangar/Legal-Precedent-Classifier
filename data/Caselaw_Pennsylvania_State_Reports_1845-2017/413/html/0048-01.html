According to the brief of the defendant’s experienced counsel, Judge McKenna said, “He respected the opinion of Mr. Boss but on a plea of guilty generally to the indictment, he would base his verdict on the testimony produced in the case.”</p>

An examination of the record reveals no misapprehension of facts or law on the part of Green or his counsel, no doubt of the appellant’s guilt, no defense whatsoever to the homicide and certainly no justifiable reason to submit this causé to a jury at this time.

For about eight months prior to the homicide, Dupree had been living there in a meretricious relationship with defendant’s daughter, Germaine Shields. Dupree and Germaine occupied an apartment on the first floor. Dupree rented a room in the house to “Millie,” and another room to a boarder., Leonard L. Goins. Millie lived there for approximately two months before the homicide. She became friendr ly with both Dupree and Germaine and the three frequently ate breakfast together.</p>

In the light of the testimony and the cases hereinabove set forth, a fact-finding Judge could justifiably have found beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that defendant fabricated parts of her statements with intent to divert suspicion by placing the blame for the killing on her daughter or otherwise to establish her innocence; (2) that she had a criminal intent; (3) that she had a particular ill-will against Millie when she went to Dupree’s house with a large kitchen knife: (4) that she intentionally used her knife to wound or kill Millie; and (5) that she killed Millie unlawfully and without any legally justifiable provocation. It is clear that <em>defendant must have intentionally stabbed Millie in the neck because there, were two large stab wounds </em>— if Millie had fallen on the knife when she was allegedly thrown by defendant over defendant’s shoulder, it would not have caused <em>two </em>stabbings.
