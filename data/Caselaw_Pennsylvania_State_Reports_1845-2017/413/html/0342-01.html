One spouse cannot fraudulently withdraw property for his own exclusive use or for the purpose of depriving the other of the use or title to such property. If one spouse appropriates entireties property to his own use, a revocation of the estate results by virtue of the fiction that the appropriation is an offer of an agreement to destroy the estate which the other spouse accepts by instituting an action. The property is then fit for accounting and division. <em>Stemniski v.

      <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>Appellant’s contentions as to the first three items are identical: appellee has appropriated this property held by the entireties for his own exclusive use and benefit and not for the mutual benefit of himself and his wife. With one exception, there is sufficient evidence to sustain the findings of the court below that these items were used by appellee for the mutual benefit of both parties.</p>
    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.4",369,[577,840,424,33]]]'>Joint Bank Account</p>
    <p id="b369-5" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[214,942,1149,1346]]]'>Appellee primarily used the joint bank account as a business expense account. He furnished it with funds paid to him by his employer for past and future expenditures in pursuance of the business. Appellant correctly contends that the fact that the money put into the account was appellee’s did not give him the right to use it for his own separate purposes. See <em>Alcorn v. Alcorn, </em><a href="/pa/364/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="364 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="1223489" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0375-01">364 Pa. 375</a>, 378, 379, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%2096" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="72 A.2d 96">72 A. 2d 96</a>, 98 (1950). However, she goes on to argue that the use of the account for payment of business expenses was not for her benefit. We cannot agree. The payments made out of the account in pursuance to appellee’s business aided in the creation of the salary earned by appellee, which salary accrued to the benefit of his wife. Although appellee, upon separation, withdrew the balance in the joint account and placed it in an account in his own name, there was sufficient evidence for the court below to find that the funds so withdrawn were still earmarked for expenditures made or to be made in pursuance to appellee’s business. Such expenditures would, therefore, still continue to accrue to the benefit of appellant through her husband’s support payments. Thus, the court below was justified in holding that appellant is not entitled to any portion of the funds withdrawn by her husband from the joint bank account.</p>

    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[204,464,1148,800]]]'>Following their separation, appellee with the consent of appellant, cashed $3858 worth of United States Government Series E bonds and gave $2,000 of the proceeds to their daughter for the purpose of defraying the cost of her wedding. Appellee contends that the remaining $1858 was spent for the mutual benefit of both spouses. We are unable to discover any facts in the record which would substantiate this contention. Appellee was in fact unable to explain what had been done with this portion of the proceeds. We therefore reverse the finding of the court below that this money was spent for the mutual benefit of the spouses and remand with directions that the court below enter judgment for appellant in the sum of $929 — one half of the balance of the proceeds from these bonds.</p>
    <p id="b370-5" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[202,1276,1148,964]]]'>Appellee cashed another $7200 worth of United States Government Series E bonds following the separation and gave the proceeds to the son of the parties for the purpose among others of building a home. Appellant contends that her lack of knowledge of and failure to consent to this gift rendered it solely on behalf of appellee and therefore not for their mutual benefit. The absence of appellant’s consent and her lack of knowledge alone are insufficient to compel this result. The record discloses that the amount of $7200 approximates the sum given to the daughter for her college education and wedding. This, coupled with the fact that the recipient of this gift was the son of the spouses and that there was no apparent antagonism between appellant and her son constituted a sufficient basis for the finding of the court below that the $7200 was given for the mutual benefit of the spouses. The consequent denial of recovery was therefore proper.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b371-3" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[202,461,1148,1400]]]'>Appellant requests that appellee be required to turn over one half of the rental value of their home (a house and lot) now solely occupied by appellee, and that this home and a vacant lot be sold and the proceeds divided equally between the parties. It appears that in her counterclaim appellant only requested her share of the rents received from these two properties. The chancellor made findings of fact that no such rents had been received. These findings are not challenged here. She raised the questions of fair rental value and sale and division for the first time after trial. The right to recovery of fair rental value and a sale of and division of the proceeds from realty held by the entire-ties require a determination that appellant was wrongfully excluded from the enjoyment of such realty. <em>Lindenfelser v.

The chancellor refused to hear testimony on this question and appellant took no exception. The chancellor as affirmed by the court en banc, therefore, properly refused to make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to these issues. The court below could not, and neither can we enter upon a consideration of questions which relies upon facts of which the record is barren. Appellant has, therefore, established no right to the recovery sought.</p>
