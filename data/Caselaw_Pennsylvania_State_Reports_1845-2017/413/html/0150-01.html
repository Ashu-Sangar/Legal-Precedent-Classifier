Sixsmith, entered into a written contract to purchase the entire assets and business of the Highway Sand and Gravel Company, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in the production and sale of sand and gravel. The purchase consideration was the payment of $80,000 in cash and the delivery of a judgment note in the sum of $15,-000,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> executed by the “new” Highway Sand and Gravel Company, Inc., in favor of Harold M.

Sixsmith, a prospectus on the nature of the business; that statements therein as to the production capacity of the plant, the wage scale paid to the employees, and the prevailing prices received for the material sold were falsely stated. It also alleged that during the negotiations Harold M.
