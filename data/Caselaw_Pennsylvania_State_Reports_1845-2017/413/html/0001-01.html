June. 5, 19.33,. appellant Pittsburgh Railways Company (Railways) and appellee; Duquesne Light Company (Duquesne) entered into an agreement for the lease to- Railways of' certain substations and equip.ment necessary to convert electric power supplied by Duquesne. At that time, Railways and Duquesne were affiliated companies. The lease which was terminable upon 60-days’ notice provided for an annual rent of $220,600A3.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Railways (denied that this amount was owing and asserted, on the contrary, that it had overpaid rent in the sum of $414,53,0. Duquesne’s claim and Railways’ 'counterclaim were •accordingly submitted to a board of three arbitrators as provided in the lease.</p>
    <p id="b27-4" data-blocks='[["BL_27.4",27,[185,853,1153,693]]]'>Before the arbitrators, Railways relied on the ’.following clause of the lease-: '“The rental 'herein set forth includes :a ¡return to Duqnesne for interest, <em>•mmo0tiswtion} </em>.insurance and maintenance except .that insofar as the rental payment relates to land no return to Duquesne ¡is made to cover amortization, insurance and maintenance.

Duquesne denied that this was the understanding of <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>the parties and maintained that the stated annual rent was to continue until the lease was terminated.</p>

On appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County this decision was affirmed on September 5, 1962. On September 25, 1962, Railways presented to the common pleas court a second petition to open judgment this time asserting that the lease was void and unenforceable because of Duquesne’s failure to file it with the Public Utility Commission and to secure approval thereof as provided in the Public Utility Law. The court below dismissed this petition on the ground that Railways could not now raise the defense of illegality. These appeals followed.</p>

On this question, there was conflicting oral testimony; In addition, each side presented corroborating evidence to support its position.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In this state <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>of the record, we conclude that the parties by the arbitration agreement intended the arbitrators’ decision on the submitted question to be final.

The defense of illegality should have been raised in the first petition to open judgment. Although Bailways’ second petition alleges that it first discovered these facts while searching the records of the Public Utility Commission in the course of preparing its appeal to this Court from the denial of the first petition, no explanation is offered why these alleged violations of the Public Utility Law were not detected and set forth in the first petition. The res judicata doctrine is designed to prevent the very situation which would result if appellant’s second petition were granted, namely, the injection of a new issue into the case after almost four, years of litigatipn.</p>
