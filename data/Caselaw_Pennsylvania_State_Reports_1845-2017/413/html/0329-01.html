If the Authority chooses the “foot front method”, the charges to be made by the Authority are determined by “the plan of construction and estimated cost” that are approved by the municipality. Thus it can be seen that in either event the basis for the charges, and therefore the control, are not within the purview of the Authority. It can also be seen from subsections (r) and (s) recited above, that either or both methods may be used by the Authority and that they both may be used simultaneously on the same project. No restricting words appear, such as are present in The Second Class Township Code; the disjunctive “or”, which would restrict the simultaneous use of <em>both </em>methods, is not present.

While there is a presumption that a property is benefited by the construction of a sanitary sewer adjacent to it, this presumption may be rebutted ....

If the amount of benefits exceeded the cost, such excess could not be assessed against the property (under the foot front method). If the costs exceeded the benefits, such excess could not be assessed against the property. When the legislature enacted the Act of 1945 and the subsequent amendments, it certainly must have known- of the long line of decisions in Pennsylvania interpreting the foot front rule so that the property could not be assessed for a greater portion of the cost of the sewer than its frontage upon the improvement bears to the total frontage of lots thereon.” (Parenthetical material supplied). <em>Wilson v.

The foot front method of apportionment is but a practical substitute for an actual assessment by a jury of view. It is not a principle of taxation but is merely a convenient method of practical adjustment of proportional benefits and it is allowable only because it practically arrives at a correct result in adjusting the burden according to the benefits.

The substantive law governing the charges made by an Authority is contained in the right given to it by the Legislature, its parent body, in the empowering statute, the Municipality Authorities Act.” The only procedural rule that is of revelance in The Second Class Township Code, Act of May 1, 1933, P.

This is a matter of balancing the equities between one property owner and the remainder of the property owners also serviced by the sewer system.
