    <p id="b538-9" data-blocks='[["BL_538.13",538,[214,1184,1147,422]]]'>Isaac Plasterer (decedent), died, testate, on July 22, 1959. Under the provisions of his will — executed December 12, 1958 — decedent, after bequeathing $300 to his widow, Stella M. Plasterer, gave the residue of his estate to his two daughters by a prior marriage, Sadie M. and Mabel H. Plasterer (appellants). This will was probated and letters testamentary issued to appellants.</p>
    <p id="b538-10" data-blocks='[["BL_538.14",538,[214,1618,1147,744]]]'>On October 17, 1959, the widow filed an election to take against the will. Over three years later, appellants petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Lebanon County for a rule to show cause why the widow’s election to take against the will should not be vacated on the ground that the widow, by a written instrument dated August 5, 1958, has renounced her rights in decedent’s estate. The widow filed preliminary objections which alleged that the written instrument of August 5, 1958 failed to show any promise by either the widow or the decedent supported by consideration. The court sustained these preliminary objections and dismissed appellants’ petition to vacate the election. From that decree this appeal was taken.</p>

In the case at bar, since appellants rely exclusively upon this written instrument to. set aside the widow’s election, the existence or non-existence of consideration on the face of the writing was properly raised by preliminary objections.</p>

Where the court erred was in considering that the language of the instrument was clear and unambiguous. We consider the language both unclear and ambiguous and believe that only evidence of the attendant circumstances can enable the court to determine just what the parties intended by the writing. Most apposite to the instant situation is our language in <em>Mowry, </em>supra (243) : “The plaintiff’s bill of complaint should not have been dismissed on preliminary objections. It is clear that a contract when ambiguous is to be interpreted in the light of the surrounding circumstances. A disposition of the matter without permitting full development of the circumstances is premature. The rule is that a summary judgment or decree will not be granted unless a case is clear; if the case is not clear the parties must have an opportunity to develop the facts at trial.”</p>
