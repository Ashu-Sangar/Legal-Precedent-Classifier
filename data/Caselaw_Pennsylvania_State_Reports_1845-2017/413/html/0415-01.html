Gardiner, her husband (Gar-diners), in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County against the Philadelphia Gas Works (Gas Works), for an alleged breach of “agreement, warranty and promise.” In their complaint, Gardiners averred a month-to-month oral agreement with the Gas Works for the sale by the latter of gas; that the Gas Works, impliedly and expressly, warranted that the gas would be transmitted to Gardiners in a safe manner through an underground conduit maintained by it; that the Gas Works was careless and negligent in (a) allowing the gas to escape from its underground conduit into Gardiners’ home and (b) permitting the gas conduit to become and remain in a defective and broken condition; that, as a result of the escape of gas, Gardiners sustained personal injuries.</p>

As to the claim for personal injuries, the Court held such claim was barred by the statute of limitations imposed by the Act of 1895 but, as to the claim for return of the down payment, the Court held such claim was not barred by the Act of 1895. At first blush, the result in <em>Jones </em>might appear anomalous, i.e., the application of different statutes of limitations to the same breach of contract. However, a reading of <em>Jones </em>clearly reveals its sound rationale, i.e., that the express language of the <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>Act of 1895 should not be avoided or circumvented and that “courts should not extend that time [the two-year limitation under the Act of 1895] by allowing a party to keep alive the right to sue by electing to sue in one form of action [assumpsit] instead of another [tort]”: <em>Jones, </em>p. 246.</p>

Pursuant to such instruction we have examined not only the language of §2-725 and other sections of the Act but we have considered the basic purposes underlying the promulgation of the Code itself. In §2-715 of the Act of October 2, 1959, P. L. 1023, 12A P.S. §2-715 (which amended the Code), it is provided that: “(2) Consequential damages resulting from the seller’s breach include ...

In connection with the latter, it may be noted that, although the rule enunciated prior to the enactment of the Code in <em>Jones </em>Avas that recognized in the majority of jurisdictions, there were several important jurisdictions in which the contrary obtained.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Under the Pennsylvania Bar Notes to this Section it is stated, inter alia: “The four year period under the Code changes prior laAV” noting that there had been a limitation of 6 years on contract actions, a limitation of 2 years on personal injury actions and making reference to the ruling in <em>Jones.</em>

Furthermore, in departing, due to the language of the Code, from the rule enunciated in <em>Jones, </em>we are mindful that §91 of the Statutory Construction Act mandates that “whenever a general law purports to establish a uniform and mandatory system covering a class of subjects, such law shall be construed to repeal pre-existing local or special laws on the same class of subjects.”</p>
