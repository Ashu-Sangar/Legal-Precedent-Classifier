First, they contend that the requirement that milk remain on the producer’s farm prior to sale to customers (italicized in the quotation above) is unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory, capricious and beyond the scope of the legislative purpose. More specifically, they urge that it is violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, Article I, § §1 and 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and Article III, §7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution which prohibits special legislation. Second, they urge that so construed, the clear language of §402 exempts their operation from regulation under the Milk Control Law.</p>

      <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>In Section 402, the Legislature has set forth the con-ditions under which farmer-producers may sell directly to consumers the milk of their herds produced on their farms without disrupting or endangering effective •regulation of the remaining industry. In exempting the producer-handler, the Legislature not only sought to aid him in selling such milk but also to give recognition to the historical custom that individual, self-sufficient farm activity has traditionally been free of many forms of licensing and regulations. This exemption is an acknowledgement by the Legislature of the need to permit the local, family farm to continue to function unregulated by the Milk Control Commission in this particular activity.</p>
