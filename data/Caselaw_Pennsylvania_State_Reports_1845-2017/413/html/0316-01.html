Kalodner, </em>the income is not the subject of tax. It is, rather a device of classification and, I believe, a reasonable one under the circumstances. Nothing presented by appellee here indicates otherwise.</p>

Nor did the exclusion from the corporate net income tax of building and loans, banks, insurance companies, etc., violate the uniformity clause. In <em>Commonwealth v. Warner Bros. Theatres, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/345/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="345 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1213366" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0270-01">345 Pa. 270</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20A.2d%2062" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="27 A.2d 62">27 A. 2d 62</a> (1942), we held that the fact that the federal definition of net income, both as to what is to be included and what may be deducted therefrom, does not impinge upon our uniformity clause. Both the Corporate Net Income Tax and the Capital Stock Tax imposed by the Commonwealth and paid by Pennsylvania corporations are filled with deductions and exemptions. I cannot subscribe to a system of jurisprudence that permits exemptions from taxation to corporations and at the same time denies similar treatment to individuals.</p>
