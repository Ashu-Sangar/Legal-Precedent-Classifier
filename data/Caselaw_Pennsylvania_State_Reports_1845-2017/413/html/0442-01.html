Decedent and his wife, for many years prior to her death (October 17, 1955), were eolessees of the safe deposit box. On November 16, 1955, shortly after his wife’s death, Doctor Carson substituted the name of appellant, his wife’s sister,- for that of his deceased wife as colessee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The lease for the safe deposit box <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>was signed by both decedent and appellant and two keys were issued. Each lessee retained a key, but appellant never exercised her right , of access to the box during Doctor Carson’s lifetime. Appellant testified that at the time Doctor Carson had her sign the lease, he gave her one of the keys. He also told her that the purpose of having her sign the lease was to make her co-owner and that she could enter the box at any time she desired.</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[195,847,1147,1125]]]'>Decedent’s will, dated September 4, 1959, was prepared by his attorney and, at decedent’s death, was in possession of the scrivener. Testator bequeathed his residence and half of his approximately $490,000 estate (after $6000-of pecuniary legacies) to appellant and designated his attorney as executor. On the day following decedent’s death, appellant and decedent’s attorney together sought and obtained access to the safe deposit box for the sole purpose of learning whether it contained a will of later date. No other will was found, and the box, with its contents intact, was returned to the vault. Appellant, on this occasion, had provided her key for entry to the box. Testator’s counsel read a part of decedent’s will to appellant and informed her and the president of the bank that the safe deposit box could not be opened until the will had been probated and that nothing could be removed until a proper inventory of the contents had been completed. The record does not disclose that appellant voiced any objection, nor did she express a desire to remove anything from the box at that time.</p>

Appellant was advised by the bank employee in charge of the vault that she was not permitted into the box and was refused permission to sign an entry slip. Shortly thereafter, the named executor entered the bank and, upon being informed of appellant’s purpose, again stated that access to the box was not to be permitted. He repeated his direction that the box should remain closed until after probate of decedent’s will and the granting of letters testamentary. It was on the basis of these instructions that appellee-bank refused appellant entry that afternoon.</p>

To those assembled, appellant stated that decedent had told her that she should have the money.- The executor, however, denied her possession and claimed it as an asset of the estate. Appellant could make her claim to the money before the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County, he added. The box also contained stock certificates, deeds, life insurance policies, and other documents, all in the name of decedent. Upon completion of the inventory, the executor took possession of the entire contents of the box except the $4,825 in bills marked as the property of appellant and previously delivered to her.</p>

She then signed the printed form at the bottom of the lease, certifying that all the property in the box had been safely withdrawn and that the box was surrendered. The executor, in the name of the estate, immediately executed a new lease for the box and placed into it everything except the currency.

The lease provided: “A rental contract, signed by two or more lessees, constitutes a separate rental to each, and either of them shall have access, free from liability on the part of lessor for misappropriating any of the contents thereof. ... In all cases of joint lessees, it is hereby’ declared that each of them has such interest in the entire contents of said box as to entitle him or her to the possession thereof, without liability to lessor for misappropriating same, . . . .” It is argued that appellant, having the right of access to the box and being known to the bank as a colessee,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> could not le<a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>gaily be denied access to the rented box, and that the refusal of access constituted a conversion of the cash in the box.</p>
    <p id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[220,522,1145,358]]]'>Appellant further contends that the bank, in refusing her access, could not have been motivated by a concern for possible liability arising from conflicting claims between the colessees because the lease, by its express terms, provided that the lessor shall not be liable for misappropriation of the contents by either co-tenant.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[218,901,1147,412]]]'>Appellee’s primary contention is that the orphans’ court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine both ownership and possession of the cash and that appellant’s right of access to the box pursuant to the lease did not, in any way, fix the ownership of its contents. In the absence of proof of appellant’s ownership, the bank urges, appellant is not entitled to judgment in the amount of the cash found in the box.</p>
    <p id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[214,1334,1149,909]]]'>Appellee further contends that it was legally justified in deferring appellant’s access to the box for two days pending probate of the will and a proper inventory of the contents, and that such reasonable delay did not constitute a conversion of the cash. Moreover, appellee points out that on the second day, access to the box and to its contents were made available to appellant and the executor and that on that occasion, appellant surrendered the box and signed the bottom of the printed form lease. It is contended that she thereby released the bank from any claim against it for conversion. We do not view this occurrence or appellant’s signature to the form as a waiver or release by her of any claim she may have acquired for conversion. The transaction was merely the termination of the lease agreement and the physical surrender of the rented box, nothing more.</p>
    <p id="b474-7" data-blocks='[["BL_474.7",474,[215,2254,1144,100]],["BL_475.1",475,[179,361,1147,586]]]'>It is also urged that should appellant’s claim for conversion prevail, a bank would be required, in sitúa<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>tions of conflicting claims, to determine, at its peril, ownership of the contents of the box. If it should turn the property over to claimant-colessee, the bank argues it would expose itself to an action for conversion by the decedent’s estate, whereas if it acted as it did here, under appellant’s rationale, it would be liable for conversion to her for the full value of the contents. This argument lacks validity in view of the precise provisions of the lease specifically absolving the lessor from liability for safe deposit box property misappropriated by a colessee.</p>
    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[177,959,1149,966]]]'>Both parties advance additional contentions which we have carefully considered but find unnecessary to detail or discuss. Many of them are without direct relevance here; they are concerned primarily with various aspects of the present factual situation as they may be presented in the orphans’ court. Considerable portions of the briefs are devoted to arguments seeking to determine the ownership of the cash, the tactical advantage of appellant being in possession of the cash, the burden of proof, the competency of appellant’s testimony, and similar evidentiary, procedural and hearing factors, none of which are directly involved in this trespass action but which are considered by the parties as having significance, persuasiveness and value in the result to be reached in the orphans’ court. These and similar orphans’ court issues, not within the jurisdiction of the court below and not presently before us, we have already indicated we refrain from deciding.</p>

(c) Unreasonably withholding possession from one who has the right to it.” Prosser, Torts §15 (2d ed. 1955). Since title to the cash is for determination by a tribunal other than the. court below, appellant’s action for conversion, if it is to prevail, must be based upon her right of access to the box and to possession of its cash contents. Was the bank, as appellant contends, obligated under the terms of the lease to give appellant, at her request* access to the box; or was the bank, as it.urges, justified in denying her entry until the executor qualified? This fundamental aspect of the controversy must be resolved by resort to. the provisions of. the lease agreement.</p>

' The express language “either of them shall have access” and the further declaration that “each of them has such interest in the entire contents of said box as to entitle him or her to the possession thereof,” do not restrict or limit her right of entry and possession to only those occasions when she is accompanied by her colessee or by his personal representative in the event of his death.</p>
    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[229,1657,1148,584]]]'>Were we to accede to appellee’s argument, we would, in effect, expand the language of the lease by reading into it conditions and limitations upon the right of entry not contained in its terms. A construction of the lease which permits lessor to deny or delay access for the reasons asserted by it and upon grounds not recited or otherwise implied in the lease is to add to that writing restrictions not contained in the contract itself. To do so would be an obvious violation of the parol evidence rule. See <em>Caplan v.

Its refusal to admit appellant to the box was a willful interference with her right of possession of the contents and constituted an act of conversion. Allowing her access with the executor two days later did not bar the action of conversion which she acquired on April 19. We conclude, therefore, that the court below, in the light of the undisputed facts, erred in refusing appellant’s request for bind^ ing instructions.</p>

We are unable to accept this speculative circumstance as a basis for awarding real or compensatory damages in this proceeding. The asserted loss of a procedural or evidentiary advantage in another and independent legal action is too conjectural and unreliable a basis on which to assess substantial damages. This Court has held repeatedly that a hlfllm <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>for damages must be supported by a reasonable basis for calculation; mere guess or speculation is not enough.

All that she has proved is that she was denied possession of the funds. No acceptable evidence was offered as a basis for fixing compensation for that deprivation of possession, nor did appellant prove real, special or other compensatory items of damages. In the absence of such proof, appellant’s recovery for the technical and temporary interference with her right of access and possession must be limited to a vindication of that right by an award of nominal damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Prosser, Torts §15, at 68 (2d ed. 1955). Of course, we do not here know who is the owner of the funds, nor shall we make that determination. As previously pointed out, should appellant be declared owner of the cash, she has suffered little, if any, proven damage. If the fund be declared property of the estate, the value of appellant’s own interest in temporary possession is merely speculative on the record before us. In the particular circumstances of this case, there is no basis for any award of punitive damages. Such damages are only awarded to punish outrageous conduct. Restatement, Torts §908 (1939).</p>

As difficult as it may be to determine the actual damages suffered by appellant, not conceding that it cannot be determined, the landscape here is ideal for the award of consequential, exémplary or punitive damages. The assessment of damages in actions of conversion has always presented a difficult problem and we should not summarily foreclose ap: pellant from recovery, particularly since the problem was not litigated and we have not had the benefit of briefs or arguments from counsel. In addition, the determination by the majority that nominal damages is the only solution flies square into the face of its determination that the acts of the bank constituted “a willful interference with [appellant’s] right.”</p>
