    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.7",588,[203,576,1148,531]]]'>Appellant applied to the zoning officer of Upper Moreland Township for a permit to erect a 144 unit garden type apartment development on approximately 10 acres of land. The land in question is zoned under the township’s zoning ordinance as R-2 Residential, except for its frontage on Easton Road, which is zoned C-Commercial for a depth of 200 feet. R-2 zoning, under the ordinance, allows single family dwellings on 20,000 square foot lots, but does not allow the type of construction contemplated by appellant.</p>
    <p id="b588-6" data-blocks='[["BL_588.8",588,[201,1116,1147,369]]]'>The zoning officer refused the requested permit and appellant applied to the board of adjustment for a variance from the terms of the ordinance. The board denied the variance and an appeal to the court below was pursued by appellant. The court below took no additional testimony and sustained the view of the board; this appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[196,1167,1148,799]]]'>The only hardship which appellant would suffer from the refusal of the requested variance is financial. Such hardship is insufficient to warrant the grant of a variance. <em>Pincus v. Power, </em><a href="/pa/376/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="376 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1246158" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0175-01">376 Pa. 175</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20914" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="101 A.2d 914">101 A. 2d 914</a> (1954).

In that case, the property owners complained that they could not sell the property for the permitted use and denial of a variance effectively deprived them of their property. They also raised an issue concerning the mixed character of the neighborhood. Here, as in <em>Bomgardner, </em>we find that the only substantial hardship proved is that unless a variance is granted, the property will not be developed as profitably as otherwise.</p>

The record does not show, as contended by appellant, that the property cannot be used within the zoning strictures. All that is shown is that such use might be difficult and might not yield a profit.</p>
