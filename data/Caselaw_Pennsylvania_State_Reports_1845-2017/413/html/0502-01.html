The Authority contended, and does so still, that the proceedings in connection with the taking of the easements for rights of way involved an entirely separate and distinct taking from the proceeding which involved the taking of the land as the site of the pumping station.

In so concluding, reliance was placed on <em>Nicholson Borough, </em><a href="/pa-super/27/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="27 Pa.

The Viewers found that (p. 573) “the lot [on which the dwelling house was located] was a separate enclosure and ascertained that the only damage caused to any property was to this house and lot” and that the property to the rear was neither damaged nor benefited and that “the result would be the same whether the Viewers considered the whole of the property on that side of the street or only the house and lot referred to”.

    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[201,464,1150,958]]]'>The Authority takes the position that, since there were <em>two </em>takings by two <em>separate </em>resolutions, there <em>must </em>be two separate proceedings. Such a position cannot be sustained. It ignores the fact that the only reason there were two takings of the same tract of land is that the Authority so elected and a consolidation of the proceedings ordered by the court was prevented by the Authority’s action. Furthermore, such a position contravenes the rationale of our well settled law in this field. By the legal legerdemain employed by the Authority it could well be that the constitutionally protected right of an individual to “just compensation” for the taking of his property might be rendered worthless. The fictional device to which the Authority has resorted cannot, by indirection, accomplish that which our constitution has inhibited, i.e., the taking of property from an individual without “just compensation”.</p>

So stringent would be the result under the instant factual situation that it cannot be countenanced.</p>

The question of both damages and benefits should be determined by the same triers of the facts in the same proceeding. The order of consolidation of both proceedings instituted in the court below should not have been vacated. That justice may be done to all parties the order of the court <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>below should be reversed and the proceedings, to Nos. 2677 and 2678 July Term, 1961 should be consolidated and a trial had wherein both the questions of damages and benefits to this tract of land should be determined in one proceeding by the same triers of the facts.</p>
    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[216,638,1148,582]]]'>The Authority has contended that whether there has been a change in value of a property as the result of benefits conferred by a public improvement thereon is a matter of discretion for the viewers which cannot be reviewed on exceptions to the viewers’ report. With this contention we agree. However, the question before us is whether the procedure adopted in the assessment of damages and benefits to the same tract of land was appropriate as a matter of law. This matter has been properly raised and determined adversely to the Authority..</p>
