    <p id="b573-11" data-blocks='[["BL_573.17",573,[169,1598,1149,589]]]'>On January 31,1959, Miriam Penn and her husband set out to visit their friends, Mr. and Mrs. Balter. When the Penns arrived at the Balter home, Mrs. Penn learned that Mrs. Balter was at appellee’s store having a cup of coffee. Mrs. Penn decided to join her friend and walked the short distance from the Balter home to the Isaly store. She entered the store and walked some ten to thirteen feet toward the booth in which Mrs. Balter was seated. The women had just exchanged salutations when Mrs. Penn slipped and fell to the floor, sustaining physical injuries.</p>

At the conclusion of appellants’ case on liability, the <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>trial court granted appellee’s motion for compulsory nonsuit. The court en banc refused appellants’ motion to take off the nonsuit and this appeal followed.</p>

Examining the record in the light of this oft-stated standard, of review, we conclude that the judgment of nonsuit was improperly entered.</p>

She stated that she was wearing flat heeled shoes and that her foot slipped causing her to fall backwards into a sitting position on the. floor. She further testified that after the fall she observed a skid mark on the floor caused by her heel. This skid mark was described as an indentation in the coating of the floor.</p>

Mr. Balter, who came upon the scene shortly after the fall, also inspected the skid mark and described it as having raised sides, as though someone “had slid through the mud or something”. A closer examination by Mr. Balter revealed the skid mark to exist in a yellow waxy substance.</p>
