This tract, rectangularly shaped, fronted 159 feet on the Boulevard and 103.5 feet on Center Avenue and contained 16,640 square feet.</p>

(Intervenors) on which is erected a supermarket operated by the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (A. &amp; P.); to the south across Center Avenue and to the east across the Boulevard, the United States’ land faces an uninterrupted line of commercial establishments the upper floors of many of which are used for residential purposes. Both the Boulevard and Center Avenue carry so much traffic that, prior to the offer for sale of the United States’ land, the Borough Council had discussed the feasibility of acquiring some of the A. &amp; P. property or some of the Railroad property for use as a municipal parking lot. Later, on learning that the United States might sell its property, Council determined to bid therefor if and when it should be placed on the market.</p>

      <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>Accordingly, when the United States offered the land for sale the Borough submitted a bid. That bid and all other bids submitted at that time were rejected as being too low and the land was re-offered for sale. Bids were again submitted by the Borough, by Carmelo and Teresa Glorioso (Glorioso) and by the Intervenors. On May 31, 1957, Glorioso’s bid was accepted.</p>

    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[199,1064,1150,909]]]'>Only three properties were included within the “Special” district: the Glorioso property, the Railroad property and the A.- &amp; P. property. The “Special” district encompasses approximately <em>á 1/2 </em>acres or 1.3% of the total Borough area of 338 acres and within such district only nine land uses are permitted: (1) cultivation, (2) government use, (3) hospital, (4) medical center, (5) municipal building, (6) parking, (7) public utility structure, (8) railroad use and (9) nonprofit recreation areas. Use as a gasoline service station was specifically prohibited in the “Special” district and the ordinance further provided that, on an appeal to the Board of Adjustment, “no use different from that permitted in the Zoning District shall be permitted.” Glorioso appeared at the Borough Council meeting at which the ordinance was adopted and notified Council that his bid had been accepted by the United States.</p>
    <p id="b220-7" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[196,1986,1148,422]]]'>Pour years after the purchase of the land, Glorioso applied to the Borough for a variance to permit the construction of a gasoline station. The Board of Adjustment decided that it was without authority under the ordinance to grant any variance. Appeal was taken to the County Court of Allegheny County which, after taking extensive testimony, dismissed the appeal. Hence, this appeal.</p>

Our reading of the record does not bear out Glorioso’s imputations but, on the contrary, indicates that the Borough officials were actuated solely by the best interests of the Borough. Furthermore, it seems clear that the ordinance was not directed at the Glorioso property nor enacted to favor existing gasoline stations; on the contrary, it was a very belated attempt to remedy the neglect of former officials in not providing for the orderly development of the Borough.</p>

The legislative judgment is never sacrosanct, and certainly not fairly debatable, when the legislative body ignores reality. The purpose of a zoning ordinance is to regulate development of land use; the creation of the “Special” district in the case at bar enacts a redevelopment. In <em>French v.

In the case at bar, the “Special” district was carved out of an area devoted to commercial uses; it was bounded by two busy, traffic-congested streets to the front and by railroad tracks to the rear; it contained but three properties, the two larger of which were already devoted to commercial uses; and it restricted the uses to which such properties could henceforth be devoted to a point where the permitted uses, if not actually illusory, were at least such as to make the properties affected considerably less usable than they would have been had they been developed immediately prior to the enactment of the ordinance in a manner consistent with the nature and uses of the immediately adjacent properties. The only distinction between the zoning in the instant case and in <em>French </em>is that the spot zoning in <em>French </em>tended to increase the value of the area given exceptional treatment whereas here the special treatment tended to diminish value.</p>
