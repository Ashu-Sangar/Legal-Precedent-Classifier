There, the vacancy on October 24, 1955, was caused by death, and the Democratic Committee sought to fill the vacancy by a substituted nomination made on October 26. The printing of ballots for the municipal election (November 5) had been started on October 5 and completed on October 25. Military ballots had already been mailed prior to October 24.</p>

Although that case expressly did not construe Section 981(a), its reasoning is. compelling.

The sections to which we have referred must be given a reasonable and practical rather than an intensely narrow, literal construction. Consequently, they are to be construed as being merely directory, not mandatory,, and as meaning that a substituted nomination for a <em>deceased </em>candidate may be made so long as time permits for the correction of the ballots accordingly.</p>

Death, unlike withdrawal, is rarer ly a voluntary act; it comes frequently unexpectedly, almost always unwillingly. To permit substitution for á deceased nominee up to the last possible moment preserves the best traditions of democracy by giving the electorate a full choice of candidates where otherwise it would be unavoidably deprived of such freedom to select. Withdrawal, on the other hand, is a purely voluntary act; it represents the desire of a nominee to remove his name from consideration. It is not too much to ask of a candidate that he not unduly disrupt the election machinery if he wishes to withdraw and that <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>he act, if at all, before a certain date.

In this series of events both sections 978 and 981(a) of the Election Code were violated, and now our Court absolves both violations. I suppose it is now possible for nominees and parties to engage in an almost endless parade of voluntary withdrawals and substitutions. The majority attempts to justify this perversion of the electoral process by the County Board of Elections and the lower court on the need to. preserve our American tradition to choose be<a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>tween candidates. I find this an amazing feat of irrational logic and illogical reasoning. To me, the disregard of clear legislative pronouncements by the judiciary does far greater violence to our American tradition. In no way do I wish to associate myself with the majority’s opinion or its determination sanctioning flagrant violations of the Election Code. As in <em>Reading Election Recount Case, </em><a href="/pa/410/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="410 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1884575" data-case-paths="/pa/410/0062-01">410 Pa. 62</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.2d%20254" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="188 A.2d 254">188 A. 2d 254</a> (1963), I agree with former Chief Justice Charles Alvin Jones who pointed out in <em>Weber </em>Appeal <a href="/pa/399/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="399 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="1290582" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0037-01">399 Pa. 37</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20901" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="159 A.2d 901">159 A. 2d 901</a> (1960) that strict adherence to the Election Code serves a vital purpose in our electoral process and, I might add, conforms to our American tradition.</p>

The County Board of Elections does not sit as a quasi-judicial body adjudicating contending forces as it wishes but rather as an executive agency to carry out the legislative mandates. Its duties are ministerial only. <em>Shroyer v.
