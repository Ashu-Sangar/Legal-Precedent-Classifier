Apparently, the basic distinction drawn by the Commonwealth is that (1) where a beneficiary is designated and survives decedent, the proceeds from the Fund are paid directly to such beneficiary, whereas (2) if no beneficiary is designated or if the designated beneficiary predeceases the decedent, the proceeds are paid to the legal representative of the decedent’s estate and, upon such payment, the proceeds lose their .identity as retirement funds.</p>

      <em>Tack’s Estate, </em>supra, — upon which the Commonwealth relies so heavily- — -determined a very narrow issue: whether “the tax imposed by the Act of 1919 [the inheritance tax statute] is a tax upon the <em>transfer </em>of” certain Delaware River Bridge Joint Commission bonds issued under the authority of identical statutes of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Both enabling statutes provided, inter alia: “the bonds . . . issued by the commission, their transfer and the income therefrom (including any profits made on the sale thereof), shall, at all times, be free from taxation within [Pennsylvania and New Jersey]” and each bond contained a clause stating that, under the enabling statutes, “this Bond is exempt from taxation.” The decisional point in <em>Tack’s Estate </em>was that an inheritance tax was not a tax on the <em>transfer </em>of these bonds within the meaning of the exemption clauses of the enabling statutes. The rationale of the Court was that an inheritance tax is not a tax either on the <em>property </em>of a decedent or on <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>the <em>transfer </em>of such property but on the <em>right of succession or of inheritance </em>of the estate of a decedent, hence, not within the provisions of the exemption clause of the enabling statutes. With such holding and rationale we are in full agreement. If the wording of §18 does not exempt a State tax on the right of succession to, or of inheritance of, the proceeds received from the Fund, then clearly <em>Tack’s Estate </em>requires that an inheritance tax be paid on the proceeds received from the Fund in the case at bar.</p>

The decisional point in <em>Simpson </em>was that, under the <em>wording </em>of the exemption clause in the California County Employes’ Retirement Law, where a county employee died having designated his widow as his beneficiary to receive death benefits under the statute, the benefits which the widow, as designated beneficiary, received were subject to the payment of an inheritance tax. <em>Simpson </em>is presently inapposite. In the first-place, in holding that a designated beneficiary under the retirement statute must pay an inheritance tax on the proceeds received by such beneficiary from the retirement fund, <em>Simpson </em>takes a position directly contrary to that now taken by the Commonwealth, i.e., that, under such circumstances, the proceeds received by a designated beneficiary are not subject to inheritance taxation. In the second place, the California statute employed the language “exempt from taxation, whether state, county, municipal or district” whereas the language in our statute reads “exempt from <em>any </em>State or municipal tax.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In fact, as the opinion in <em>Simpson </em>clearly and explicitly indicates, the Court deemed of great significance the fact that the Cali<a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>fornia legislature had not adopted the language of the exempting clause in the New York retirement statute— “exempt from any state or municipal tax” — which had been construed by the New York courts as exempting retirement benefits from inheritance taxation. The Court in <em>Simpson </em>considered the word “any” as “a word broad enough to comprehend, in its enlarged and plural sense, all state or municipal taxes without limitation” and noted that the California legislature “chose not to include the word Any’ in the tax exemption clause, a deletion consistent with an intent to effect a different application.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In this respect, <em>Simpson </em>supports the appellees’, rather than the Commonwealth’s, construction of the wording of §18.</p>

That which §18 exempts from “any State or municipal tax” is the “right of a person” to certain specifically named benefits under the Act which benefits fall into six categories. Four of the six categorized benefits receive specific definition in the Act while two of such categorized benefits are not so defined.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Bearing in mind the statutory definitions of the benefits in the first <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>four stated categories, it is obvious that the “right of a person” under the exempting clause to such benefits refers to the “right” of a <em>living </em>contributor to the Fund, a “right” not presently in issue. An analysis of §18, construed in the light of and in connection with other provisions of the Act, discloses that the words, “any benefit or right accrued or accruing to any person under the Act” mean and include the. benefit or right accrued or accruing to any contributor as well as to. any beneficiary. In other words, this benefit or right accrues not only to any contributor but also to any. “person”, i.e., any beneficiary and any person who acts for a living contributor (i.e., a guardian for a living contributor) or to a person who acts for a deceased contributor to the fund (i.e., a designated beneficiary or the legal representative of a deceased contributor). The sixth category refers and is limited to “moneys in the fund created under the Act,” and the right thereto and such fund and the moneys therein and the right thereto are likewise specifically exempt from <em>any </em>State or municipal tax.</p>
    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[201,1501,1149,851]],["BL_397.1",397,[206,350,1150,1233]]]'>Our analysis of the wording of §18, construed in the light of other provisions of the Act, clearly indicates that the “person” whose “right” is exempted from “any” state tax is (1) a <em>living </em>contributor to the Fund under the first four categories of benefits, (2) either the “person” acting for a <em>living </em>contributor or the designated beneficiary or the “legal representative”- of a <em>deceased </em>contributor under the fifth category of benefits and (3) the right to “moneys in the-Fund created under the Act,” under the sixth category of benefits. Insofar as the benefits mentioned under the fifth ánd sixth categories be concerned, in the case of a <em>deceased </em>contributor, it was clearly the legislative intent to exempt from state taxation the <em>right of succession </em>to the proceeds of the Fund either by a designated beneficiary or by those who take, either under the Wills <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>Act or the Intestate laws, the ultimate distribution of such proceeds. As a matter of fact, insofar as a designated beneficiary is concerned, the Commonwealth itself construes the language of §18 to constitute an exemption of inheritance taxation on the <em>right of succession </em>to the proceeds of the Fund by such designated beneficiary and such construction by the Commonwealth has long prevailed. This position of the Commonwealth is significant; even if we were to adopt the position of the Commonwealth (which we do not) that the language of §18 is not clear and explicit, “the contemporaneous construction of [§18] by those charged with its execution and application [the Commonwealth], especially when it has long prevailed, is entitled to great weight and should not be disregarded or overturned except for clear language in the Act itself or very strong cogent and convincing reasons, [citing cases]”: <em>Loeb Estate, </em><a href="/pa/400/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="400 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="1292482" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0368-01">400 Pa. 368</a>, 373, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20207" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="162 A.2d 207">162 A. 2d 207</a>; <em>Pickering Estate, </em><a href="/pa/410/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="410 Pa. 638" data-case-ids="1884579" data-case-paths="/pa/410/0638-01">410 Pa. 638</a>, 650, 651, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20132" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="190 A.2d 132">190 A. 2d 132</a>.

Such contention renders meaningless and unreasonable the legislative intent. <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>In the absence of a living designated beneficiary, the Act provides that the proceeds from the Fund are to be paid to the “legal representative” of the deceased contributor’s estate. It has long been settled — many years prior to passage of the Act — that while it is the duty of the “legal representative” of a decedent to make sure that an inheritance tax appraisal is proper and that the tax, when settled, is paid, the duty of actual payment of the tax falls upon those persons entitled to distribution of the estate and not upon the “legal representative”: <em>Brown’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/208/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="208 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="998038" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0161-01">208 Pa. 161</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.%20360" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="57 A. 360">57 A. 360</a>; <em>Oroxton’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/289/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="289 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1103316" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0433-01">289 Pa. 433</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20608" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="137 A. 608">137 A. 608</a>; <em>Loeb Estate, </em>supra. When the legislature passed the Act and the amendments thereto, it can be assumed that the legislature knew that the responsibility for the actual payment of inheritance taxes was not upon the “legal representative” of the estate but upon those entitled to distribution of the assets of the estate. If we were to adopt the Commonwealth’s contention, we would be led to conclude that the legislature intended to exempt from payment of inheritance taxes on the proceeds of the Fund the “legal representative” of the estate who had no duty to pay such taxes but not to exempt those persons upon whom did rest the duty of payment of inheritance taxes. Such a construction of the exemption clause would be absurd and cannot be ascribed to the legislative intent. The only sound construction is that the legislature intended to exempt those to whom the proceeds are given, whether a designated beneficiary or the persons entitled under the deceased contributor’s will or the intestate laws.</p>

    <p id="b400-7" data-blocks='[["BL_400.8",400,[208,1494,1148,635]]]'>Section 18 of the Public School Employes’ Retirement Act states as follows: “The <em>right </em>of a person to an employe’s annuity, a State annuity, or retirement allowance, to the return of contributions, any benefit or right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this act, and the moneys in the fund created under this act, <em>are </em>hereby exempt from any State or municipal tax, and exempt from levy and sale, garnishment, attachment, or any other process whatsoever, and shall be unassignable, except as in /his act specifically otherwise provided. . . .” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b400-8" data-blocks='[["BL_400.9",400,[206,2141,1149,207]],["BL_401.1",401,[211,358,1146,96]]]'>The majority of this Court apparently read “The <em>right </em>of a person” as being limited by six succeeding categories, i.e., “The <em>right </em>of a person to” (a) an employe’s annuity, (b) a State annuity, (c) a retire<a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>ment allowance, (d) a return of contributions, (e) any benefit, etc., (f) the monies in the Fund “are exempt.”</p>
    <p id="b401-5" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[211,466,1147,465]]]'>I disagree. The provision quoted is hardly a model of proper sentence structure; but I conclude that, correctly read, it means that three categories are exempt from tax, levy, sale, etc.: (1) the right of a person.t.0 an employe’s annuity, a State annuity, .a retirement allowance or a return of contribution; (2) .any benefit or right accrued or accruing.to any person under the provisions of the Retirement Act; (3) the moneys in the Fund created under the Retirement Act.</p>

First, the verb in the above-quoted exemption provision is the plural “are” (i.e., “. . . are hereby exempt from.....”); read as the majority would have it, the provision must contain the singular verb “is”. Second, my conclusion is consonant with traditional exemption clauses; that is, the property itself is exempt from tax, not necessarily its transfer, etc. (subject here, however, to. the apparent intent of the second category of exemption to free from inheritance tax the direct receipt of benefits by a specifically designated beneficiary). See <em>Tack’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/325/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="325 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1172316" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0545-01">325 Pa. 545</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.%20155" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="191 A. 155">191 Atl. 155</a> (1937). Third, under the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, §316, retirement benefits paid to the decedent’s estate are subject to inheritance tax when ultimately received by the heir or legatee; and the comments to this section indicate that the provision conforms to existing law (both decedents in the present appeal died prior to the time the Act of 1961 took effect and would be subject to the inheritance tax provisions of the Act of 1919 — the “existing law”). Fourth, the reasoning of the majority leads to some absurd results. For example, suppose a school employee retires and receives a retirement allowance under the Act of 1917. Suppose, further, he carefully places each and every periodic payment in a <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>savings account and inserts a provision in his will making a specific bequest of the “retirement moneys in the savings account.” Can it be doubted that such a bequest is subject to inheritance tax? I think not, but the majority would raise such a doubt. For example, also, suppose an employee dies while in service and actually has designated his estate as beneficiary. The retirement moneys credited to him are paid by the Fund to his estate. Are such moneys still exempt from claims of the decedent’s creditors? I cannot believe so, but the majority apparently would so hold.</p>
    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[197,955,1149,1174]]]'>In short, I believe §18 was intended only to exempt from tax rights and moneys while held by the Fund itself for someone. Once the moneys are paid from the Fund, they enjoy no special privilege. Receipt from the Fund itself is explicitly freed from inheritance tax, whether received by specific persons or by the estate; but receipt thereafter from the estate is taxable. In this light all of the Commonwealth’s argument here about the true nature of the inheritance tax is beside the point. At this late date it seems quite clear that it <em>is </em>a tax, a tax on the privilege of inheritance; and as such it is included within the breadth of §18 of the Retirement Act as well as any other tax. Therefore, the benefit or right accruing to a person (be he individual or the estate) to receive retirement funds, in cases like the present ones, from the Fund itself upon the death of an employee is exempt from inheritance tax. The right or privilege of a person to inherit or take from the. estate itself moneys which were formerly in the Fund is not exempt. Hence, I would hold the assets involved in the estates here subject to appraisement for inheritance tax purposes and must dissent.</p>
