Moylan and Lola M. Brooks, filed a complaint in equity seeking to restrain appellant and the sheriff of Luzerne County from proceeding with the sale of the properties listed for execution. The grounds for relief alleged were that one of the parcels offered for sale was a leasehold interest and personal properly, that Lola M. Brooks had a prior judgment and had issued execution on personalty prior to the execution by appellant, and that there was a misdescription of the properties offered for sale. On March 6, 1963, the court below granted a preliminary injunction restraining appellant from proceeding with execution for the reason that the description published by the sheriff was faulty since it failed to include improvements.</p>

Freck, 7 Pa. C.C. Rep. 456, it is held that a sheriff’s ¿dvertisement which simply refers to the number of the warrant of a tract of land is a sufficient description.; and so we think here, that the sheriff’s advertisement referring to the defendant’s title papers and quoting therefrom, was all that was required, and the allegation of want of description must fail.” See <em>American State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

    <p id="b97-4" data-blocks='[["BL_97.7",97,[188,1173,1152,856]]]'>Ordinarily, a complaint in equity will not lie to restrain an execution creditor from proceeding in due course to sell real estate alleged to belong to his debt- or. If there is a dispute as to title of to the quantum of properly sold, such matters may be determined in an action of ejectment. See <em>Brackin v. Welton Engineering Co., </em><a href="/pa/283/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="283 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="1090524" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0091-01">283 Pa. 91</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20A.%20818" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="128 A. 818">128 Atl. 818</a> (1925); Krea<em>mer v.

As we held in the <em>Brackin </em>case at p. 98, Atl. at 820, “The true principle is that equity has no jurisdiction unless the controlling facts are proved by matters of record, or by undisputed writings, or are admitted.” Accord, <em>Conemaugh Iron Works Co. v.

This they refused to do and have sought to prevent the satisfaction of a debt to which, on the record, they have no real defense. The foreclosure <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>proceedings were commenced four years ago, and since that time, appellees have been in the Superior Court, twice in this Court, and over a half dozen times in the court below. Should it appear that at the sale a grossly inadequate price was obtained for the. properties and/or that, because of failure to include improvements in the advertisement, someone is misled or deterred from bidding, the remedy is to set aside the sheriff’s sale. See, e.g., <em>Senge v. </em>Border, supra; <em>Levi v. Greer, </em><a href="/pa/236/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="236 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="986602" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0475-01">236 Pa. 475</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20917" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="84 A. 917">84 Atl. 917</a> (1912); <em>Yost v.

The last two cases, in which the sales were set aside because of gross misdescription and inadequacy of price, do not stand for the proposition that equity will enjoin the sale in the first instance.</p>
