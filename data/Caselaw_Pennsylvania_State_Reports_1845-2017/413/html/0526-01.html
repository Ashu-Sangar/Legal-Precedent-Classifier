The reasons for this rule given in the authorities cited above are convincing and amply sufficient to sustain it. The imposition of a tax or assessment by the authority of the state, represented by itself or any subordinate political division thereof, upon property held by another subordinate division and used for public purposes would in effect be a party demanding money and receiving payment from himself. An assessment pays for a public, though a local improvement. It therefore relieves the public from the necessity of contributing to the cost or expense of the improvement. If public property purchased by funds raised by taxation is subjected to assessment for a local public improvement, it is the public paying the public, which clearly discloses the absurdity of the proposition.” <em>Pittsburg v. Sterrett, </em>supra, pages 643, 644. Nor, we may add, does the fact that the Sewer Authority financed construction of the sewer system by a bond issue alter the force of the above reasoning for the public eventually foots the bill and there is little point in adding a bookkeeping expense to its burdens.</p>

Union Burial Ground Society, </em>supra, footnote 4). The provisions of the exemption clause, may well be, therefore, declaratory of the law as to lienability of municipalities (in their proprietary capacity) and charities. Even though the clause can be read so as to raise an inference that municipalities and charities are in the same category as regards assessability for certain specified local improvements, considerations of public policy require us to hesitate before so reading <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>the clause lest we fall into the trap of. supposing that public bodies (in their governmental, capacity) can be subjected to such an obligation <em>by implication. </em>Merely because charities and municipalities are associated in the same breath, in the exemption clause of the Lien Act will not serve to identify them as identical twins in the eyes of the law. . ’ .......</p>

A school authority acts as an alter ego of a school district to undertake public school projects which the school district, by reason of its debt limitations, cannot undertake. Such title to said projects as the school authority takes is primarily to secure the sources which made possible financing of the school project and such title is held until the school authority’s obligations have been repaid or assumed by the school district (Authorities Act, supra, §18, as amended, 53 P.S. §321 (B)) or the school authority terminates (Authorities Act, supra, §14, as amended, 53 P.S. §317).

Moreover, if, by reason of absence of registered title in these properties in the School District, the School Code’s exemption clause is not applicable and if School Authorities are not exempt from these assessments, then another reality of the situation must be faced, i.e., the School Authorities must pass on to the School District the cost of such assessments (Authorities Act, supra, §4, 53 P.S. §306), a result which clearly and completely negatives the expressed legislative intent in the School Code that properties devoted to public school purposes be exempt from such assessments. The fact that such properties are nominally titled for security purposes in the School Authorities should not thwart the unequivocal mandate of the legislature set forth in the School Code.</p>

As to the first contention, the answer is the same as that given as to the School Code of 1949, i.e., the legislative intent being clear resort need not be had to any rule of statutory construction. Moreover, a reading of the exemption clause of this statute indicates clearly that the legislature intended to grant to Municipal Authorities exemption not only from taxation but also from assessments for local improvements and to construe “assessments”, as the Sewer Authority urges, as a phase of the process of taxation clearly nullifies the manifest legislative intent.</p>

The protection of the public health lies within the control of the township commissioners.
