Noting that the power to “control disorderly practices” was added by the 1953 amendatory statute, the township <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>argues that §702 grants the “widest possible powers to the Township Supervisors for the purpose of allowing them to take whatever appropriate measure might be necessary for securing the safety of persons or property within the Township”. In our view, the township somewhat inflates the legislative delegation of police power under §702.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> An examination of §702 indicates that its language is most inappropriate and inadequate to evidence any intent on the part of the legislature to delegate to second class townships vast and extensive police powers; certainly no intent is manifest or evident to grant powers to second class townships to act in areas where the Commonwealth itself, through legislative enactments, has provided regulation.</p>

Rationalized, this provision of the ordinance only prohibits the use for hunting of a firearm in the township <em>if </em>such use is on land of another without the written consent of the landowner or land-lessee; therefore, if the township is correct and if the <em>safety </em>of its inhabitants is the aim and goal of this provision of the ordinance, the criterion of such safety is the presence or absence of the requisite written consent. Written consent to use a firearm for hunting neither lessens the danger inherent in such use nor provides safety in such use. The fact that a potential hunter has secured, from the landowner or land-lessee upon whose land he intends to hunt, a con<a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>sent in writing in no manner assures the public that such potential hunter is a safe and careful hunter. By way of illustration, no person is permitted to hunt in this Commonwealth without obtaining written consent in the form of a license to hunt,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> yet the issuance of such consent or license in no manner insures that the licensee is a safe and a careful hunter. Unfortunately, the annual hunting casualty statistics eloquently bear witness to this fact.</p>
    <p id="b547-4" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[194,849,1151,746]]]'>In its creation of a classification of safe hunters as opposed to unsafe hunters based solely on the presence or absence of a written consent to hunt, the township has clearly overstepped not only its statutorily granted powers but the bounds of reasonableness. The consent provisions of this ordinance insofar as they are aimed to protect the inhabitants of this township from any trespassing upon their land duplicate the provisions of §954 of The Penal Code of 1939 and the township thereby enters a field already regulated by the Commonwealth. Moreover, the consent provisions bear no reasonable relationship whatsoever to the safety of the inhabitants of this township. In such respects, this ordinance is clearly invalid.</p>

Miss Baynes appealed to the Court of Quarter Sessions of York County which quashed the appeal and on appeal from that order, the Superior Court unanimously affirmed. Judge Woodside stated (p. 585) : “It is our opinion, that an action brought against a defendant for the violation of a municipal ordinance is a suit for the recovery of a penalty due the municipality and is a civil proceeding. It is not a summary proceeding, which is a criminal proceeding, even though it may be started by a warrant. A judgment entered against a defendant for the violation of a municipal ordinance is for a penalty, even though it may be referred to by the legislature and the magistrate as a ‘fine’. Appeals from judgments entered by magistrates to recover penalties for violation of municipal ordinances must be taken to the Court of Common Pleas. The Courts of Quarter Sessions have no jurisdiction over such appeals.” <em>York v. Baynes </em>was approved.in <em>Commonwealth v.

The rationale of <em>York v. Baynes, </em>in our view sound, controls this situation. Even though this action were instituted by the issuance of a warrant— which the record before us does not disclose — and even though the penalty under the provisions of the ordinance is termed a “fine”, this is fundamentally an action instituted for the violation of a township ordinance and an appeal from the judgment entered in such action should have been taken to the court of common pleas and not to the court of quarter sessions.</p>
