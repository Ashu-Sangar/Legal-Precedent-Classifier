Sometime thereafter, alleging that Westinghouse had violated the agreement by contracting out maintenance painting to employees outside the bargaining unit, the Union requested Westinghouse to submit the matter to arbitration, a request which Westinghouse refused. Later on, alleging that Westinghouse had required an employee, one Herbert Boczar, a plumber, to perform carpenter work, the Union requested Westinghouse to submit the matter to arbitration, a request which Westinghouse refused.</p>

Capsulized, Westinghouse urges that,even though the Union requests that the two complaints, called grievances, be submitted to arbitration, the complaint fails to attach the alleged written grievances and to aver that such complaints or grievances were processed in the course of the grievance procedure outlined in the agreement between the parties and, therefore, on the face of the record, there is no showing on the record that such complaints or grievances were either ripe for arbitration or arbitrable under the agreement. The thrust of this argument is that, absent the production of facts in proof that the grievance procedure was followed, the court below could not enter judgment on the pleadings.</p>

Copies of the agreement and letters from Westinghouse in reference to such alleged grievances were attached to the complaint. By way of answer, Westinghouse admitted filing of the complaints or grievances by the Union, denied such complaints constituted “grievances” under the agreement (Section XXI, 1, (c)), admitted discussion of such complaints and its refusal to arbitrate such complaints. Neither in the answer nor new matter does Westinghouse aver that the processing of the complaints did not follow the grievance procedure outlined in the agreement.</p>

In holding that a dispute between a union and management concerning the right of management to “contract out” work constituted an arbitrable issue, the Court stated (pp. 581-585) : “Contracting-out work is the basis of many grievances; and that type of claim is grist in the mins of the arbitrators. A specific collective bargaining agreement may exclude contracting-out from the grievance procedure. Or a written collateral agreement may <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>make clear that contracting-out was not a matter for arbitration. In such a case a grievance based solely on contracting-out would not be arbitrable. Here, however, there is no such provision. Nor is there any showing that the parties designed the phrase ‘strictly a function of management’ to encompass any and all forms of contracting-out: In the absence of any express provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration, we think only the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration can prevail, particularly where, as here, the exclusion clause is vague and the arbitration clause quite broad. . . . The grievance alleged that the contracting-out was a violation of the collective bargaining agreement. There was, therefore, a dispute ‘as to the meaning and application of the provisions of this Agreement’ which the parties had agreed would be determined by arbitration. . . . Whether contracting-out in the present case violated the agreement is the quéstion. It is a question for the arbiter, not for the courts.” See also: <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. v.

While the grievances alleged in <em>Carey, </em>i.e., improper work assignments by management, were only in part similar to the grievances in the case at bar, the sweep of <em>Carey </em>clearly indicates that both instant grievances are arbitrable. In <em>Carey </em>the Supreme Court <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>held that the grievances were arbitrable under the agreement and thus reversed an order of the New York Court of Appeals which had refused to compel arbitration. <em>Carey </em>contraindicates the contention now raised by Westinghouse that the instant grievances are not arbitrable under the agreement.</p>
