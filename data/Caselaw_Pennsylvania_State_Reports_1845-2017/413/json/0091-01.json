        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal from the Decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Northumberland County which reversed the Decree of the Register of Wills which had admitted to probate the hereinafter quoted written instrument as the last Will of George H. Glace.\nGlace died June 24, 1962, at the age of 74 years. On June 23,1962, Charles E. Wray, an Alderman, came to the hospital where Glace was a patient, for the purpose of drawing Glace\u2019s Will. The alleged will was written on a printed legal form with blank spaces\u2014 consisting of a single printed sheet of paper 8%\" in width and 13\" in length. The handwritten parts were all written by an Alderman, Charles E. Wray, with the exception of the signature, \u201cGeorge Glace.\u201d The words \u201cGeorge Glace\u201d were written by him on the front page after the word \u201cI\u201d, and again in the testimonium clause after the words \u201cIn Witness Whereof, I\u201d. The alleged will was signed at the end of the testimonium clause, \u201cChas. E. Wray\u201d on the line intended for the signature of the testator, with a seal opposite; and the word \u201cAlderman\u201d was written by Wray underneath his own signature.\nThe instrument is short and is as follows:\n\u201cI, George Glace , of Sunbury, Pa., of the County of North\u2019d and State of Pennsylvania, being of sound mind, memory and understanding do make and publish this my last will and testament, hereby revoking and making void all former wills by me at any time heretofore made.\n\u201cAnd first, I direct that my funeral be conducted in a manner corresponding with my estate and situation in life and that all my just debts and funeral expenses be fully paid and satisfied as soon as conveniently may be after my decease.\n\u201cAnd to such estate as it hath pleased God to intrust me with, I dispose of the same as follows, viz: all my belongings, Personal & Real Estate be [an illegible word] Divided between (my Daughter Mrs. Map-stone 101 Ind. St. Selinsgrove Pa.) and my (Lady Friend, Lillian F. Harvey 37 So. 6th St. Shamoldn Pa.)\n\u201cWitness\n\u201cRobert B. Rice\n\u201c408 So 10th St Sunbnry\n\u201cManlin W. Glace\n\u201c929 Eidson Ave Sunbury\nand on the reverse side of the printed paper:\n\u201cAnd I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint Mrs. Mapstone & Lillian F. Havery,* Executrix\u2019s of this, my last will and testament.\n\u201cIn Witness Whereof, I, George Glace the Testa ment, have to this, my will, written on one sheet of paper, set my hand and seal, this 23rd day of June A. D., One Thousand, Nine Hundred and 1962.\n\u201cChas. E. Wray (Seal)\n\u201cAlderman.\n\u201cSigned, sealed, published and declared by the above-named George Glace as and for his last will and testament, in the presence of us, who have hereunto subscribed our names, at his request as witnesses thereto, in the presence of the said Testa , and of each other.\u201d\nThe lower Court held that this instrument was not the will of George Glace, since it did not comply with Section 2 of the Wills Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, 20 P.S. \u00a7180.2. Section 2 pertinently provides, \u201cEvery will . . . shall be . in writing and shall be signed by the testator at the end thereof . . .\u201d The language of the Statute could not be clearer; to constitute a valid will, the writing must be signed by the testator at the end thereof \u2014 any exceptions, modifications or \u201cifs ands or buts\u201d would not only erode but would soon make the statutory requirement meaningless.\nGlace\u2019s lady friend, Lillian F. Harvey, appeals, contending that (1) the writing was signed, at the end because Glace\u2019s signature followed the dispositive clause, and (2) Glace\u2019s testamentary intention which is the polar star in the construction of every will, would be defeated if the instrument was not accepted as a valid will.\nThe law is well settled as to what is meant by the end of a will. In Kretz Estate, 410 Pa. 590, 189 A. 2d 239, the Court said, \u201cSince the adoption by the Legislature of the statutory requirement that a will be signed 'at the end thereof,\u2019 'This Court has consistently resisted attempts to weaken or modify the rule .... Justice Kephakt (later Chief Justice) said in Maginn\u2019s Estate, 278 Pa. 89, 91, 122 A. 264: \u201cIn interpreting the legislature\u2019s thought, courts have rigidly opposed any exception tending to weaken the basic principle underlying the law, the chief purpose of which is to see that the testator\u2019s wishes are observed. It is possible, in some cases, a 'decedent may have thought he had made a will, but the statute says he had not. The question is not one of his thought in that respect, but what he actually did, or . . . failed to do . . . .\u201d\u201d Baldwin Will, 357 Pa. 432, 440, 55 A. 2d 263, 267 (1947). As early as Wineland\u2019s Appeal, 118 Pa. 37, 41, 12 Atl. 301, 302 (1888), Mr. Justice Paxson\" rather appropriately remarked: 'It says a will must be signed at the end thereof, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u2019 The end contemplated by the Act is not the point which is physically furthest from the beginning of the writing. As we said in Kehr Will, 373 Pa. 473, 479, 95 A. 2d 647 (1953) : \"'The end contemplated by the statute is the logical end of the language used by decedent in expressing his testamentary purpose,\u201d \u2019 or, as was said in Coyne Will, 349 Pa. 331, 333, 37 A. 2d 509 (1944); \u2018 \u201c. . . there must be a sequence of pages or paragraphs which relates to its logical and internal sense, and the signature must be placed at the sequential end.\u201d \u2019 See, also, Baldwin Will, 357 Pa., supra.\u201d\nJudge Fortney, in a very able opinion, held that Churchill\u2019s Estate, 260 Pa. 94, 103 A. 533, controlled this case. With this we agree. Churchill\u2019s Estate is factually on all fours with the Glace instrument; indeed it is stronger for probate than the instant one. In Churchill\u2019s Estate, the alleged will was written\u2014 as was Glace\u2019s \u2014 by filling in blank spaces on a printed form. Churchill wrote his name in three blank spaces in the printed paper, first at the top, then in the testimonium clause, and then in the attestation clause. He did not sign his name at the end of the paper. The. Court said, \u201cIt is apparent that in writing his name in the three blank spaces in the form, decedent did not intend his name as a signature. A writing in of a name, in those circumstances, was not a signature and did not constitute an execution of a Will in conformity with the Wills Act. The place chosen by this decedent to affix his signature was at the point where the appointment of his executors was consummated\u201d. Churchill\u2019s Estate, we repeat, governs the instant case. Our conclusion is further supported by Griffith Will, 358 Pa. 474, 483, 57 A. 2d 893, and Baldwin Will, 357 Pa. 432, 436, 55 A. 2d 263, each of which reaffirmed Churchill\u2019s Estate.\nAppellant contends that we. should consider and be governed by the intention of the testator in our determination of this matter. Applicable is the succinct maxim, \u201cHard cases make bad law\u201d; it could be more accurately expressed: \u201cHeart-touching claims which appeal to our sense of Justice often beget bad law.\u201d Coyne Will, 349 Pa., supra, well answers appellant\u2019s plea (page 334) :\n\u201cIt is perhaps unfortunate that decedent\u2019s testamentary intentions are frustrated. The strictness with which this section of the Wills Act must be enforced is a matter of legislative mandate. As we said in Brown Estate, supra [347 Pa.] (p. 246) : \u2018The Wills Act requires signing at the end. The purpose of the Act was to remove all possibility of fraud .... Even if the testamentary intention of this particular testatrix is frustrated, it is much wiser to refrain from weakening the sound and well established mandate of the legislature. Were we to do so, we might in future cases facilitate fraudulent or unauthorized alterations or additions to wills.\u2019 \u201d\nThe question in this case as to whether decedent signed the writing at the end thereof is not one of decedent\u2019s intention but of what decedent actually did or failed to do. We cannot add anything to the clear and convincing opinion in Churchill\u2019s Estate, supra.\nDecree affirmed, each party to pay own costs.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents.\n\u2014 written by Glace.\nIt will be noticed that Lillian\u2019s surname is spelled Harvey in the dispositive clause, and Havery in the appointment clause.\n\u2014 written by Glace.\n\u201cment\u201d was written by Wray.",
