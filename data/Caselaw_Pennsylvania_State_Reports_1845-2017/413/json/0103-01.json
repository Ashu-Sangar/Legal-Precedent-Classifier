        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal from an Order of the Court of Common Pleas No. 6 of Philadelphia County which, without taking any additional testimony, affirmed the findings and conclusions of the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Board had denied the use permit which Coleman sought.\nOn October 16, 1958, Coleman, the appellant here, obtained a Use Begistration Permit from the Department of Licenses and Inspections (Zoning Section) of the City of Philadelphia to use property at 4957-59 Kershaw Street for \u201cBoofing Contractor\u2019s Office, Garage & Accessory Storage of Solvents.\u201d Since that time, appellant has actively conducted this business on his premises.\nOn April 6, 1962, the Department of Licenses and Inspections served on appellant a notice of violation of the Philadelphia Code of General Ordinances (Zoning). The specific violation averred in the notice was \u201cStorage of roofing contractor\u2019s supplies without obtaining a Use Begistration Permit as required by the Philadelphia Zoning Ordinance.\u201d Appellant then applied to tbe Zoning Board for the required permit. At the public hearing the Board treated this as an application for a variance and denied appellant the relief sought.\nWe find no clear abuse of discretion or error of law by the Board of Adjustment. Valley Forge Industries Inc. Appeal, 406 Pa. 387, 177 A. 2d 450; Brennen v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, 409 Pa. 376, 187 A. 2d 180.\nOrder affirmed.\nThe notice was actually served on Coleman\u2019s lessor.",
