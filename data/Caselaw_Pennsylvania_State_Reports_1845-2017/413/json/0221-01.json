        "text": "Opinion\nPee Curiam,\nTh\u00e9 appeal in this habeas corpus proceeding is by the maternal grandparents from the award of custody of their two granddaughters, ages eight and six years, to the natural father. Both children have resided with the grandparents since their mother\u2019s death (September 27, 1961), and have expressed strong preferences to remain in that household. The older child is diabetic and requires a great deal of daily special medical and dietary care and supervisi\u00f3n. All agree that the children should not be separated.\nDespite the approximately 750 pages of testimony, the record is essentially free from basic conflicts or material contradictions in the testimony offered by the contesting parties. Furthermore, there is no challenge to the good character or reputation of either party. The ability and desire of the parties to provide the children with an adequate, wholesome and affectionate home environment is not contested. As found by the trial court, both the grandparents and the father have always \u201cunselfishly given\u201d the children \u201cloving care and affection.\u201d\nThe grandparents earnestly contend that because of the diabetic condition of the older grandchild, it would be hazardous and unwise to subject her to a change of custody and to the attending nervous and emotional reactions she may undergo. It is primarily on this basis and on the showing that they have met the special needs of the child, together with the expressed preferences of the children, that the grandparents seek to retain custody.\nOur review of the record satisfies us that the hearing judge properly considered all the evidence and has understandingly evaluated the present and future welfare of the children, and particularly, the difficulties and uncertainties surrounding the diabetic condition of the older child, the expressed preferences of the children, their ages, the stages of their physical, emotional and educational development, the difference in the ages of the litigants, the father\u2019s prima facie right to custody, as well as the importance of \u201cthe continuance of a proper relationship with their father and the grandparents.\u201d\nThe hearing judge appropriately voiced the law\u2019s continuing concern for the welfare of the children and the court\u2019s genuine awareness of the special problems presented by the older child\u2019s aliment: \u201cOur recognition of the father\u2019s rights are not inflexible. We do not believe he will stand by idly if the health of his children is seriously prejudiced. Any finality evolving from this decision as to the rights of the parties cannot foreclose a future change of custody based upon a showing of a change in conditions.\u201d\nWe share the unanimous opinion of the Superior Court that the order of the court below should not be disturbed.\nThe decision of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents.",
