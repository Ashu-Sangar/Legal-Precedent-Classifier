The owner now seeks to use the premises for the storage and wholesale jobbing of paper products, also a nonconforming use.\nThe zoning ordinance permits the change from one nonconforming use to another if the new use is not included in a higher use classification under the provisions of the ordinance. The lower court concluded that the new use met this test and was not one included in a higher classification. We find no abuse of discretion or error of law.\nOrder affirmed.",
