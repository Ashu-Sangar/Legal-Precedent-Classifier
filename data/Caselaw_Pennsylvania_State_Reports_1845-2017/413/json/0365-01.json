        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Jones,\nThese appeals present one narrow issue: whether Section 18 of the Public School Employes\u2019 Retirement Act (Act), exempts from inheritance taxation proceeds of the Retirement Fund (Fund), established under the Act, when such proceeds are payable and paid to the legal representative of a deceased contributor to the Fund and, thereafter, pass to those entitled thereto under the Wills Act or the Intestate Act.\nAlthough each appeal arises in a separate estate, the factual background in both estates is identical insofar as disposition of both appeals is concerned. Both Mary Belefski and Helen Elward, at the times of their respective deaths, were public school teachers in active service and members of and contributors to the Fund. Each decedent had exercised an option provided by the Act and had designated a beneficiary to receive the Fund benefits but such designated beneficiary had predeceased the decedent. On decedent\u2019s death, the Fund benefits were paid to decedent\u2019s legal representative in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\nIn each estate, the Commonwealth included the proceeds received by the legal representative from the Fund among the assets of the decedent\u2019s estate in arriving at the balance of such estate upon which the inheritance tax was appraised. In each estate, an appeal was taken from the tax appraisal to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Luzerne County and that court decreed that the proceeds received from the Fund were exempt from inheritance taxation under Section 18 of the Act. From both decrees the Commonwealth has appealed.\nDetermination of the issue on these appeals depends upon the interpretation and construction of \u00a718 of the Act which provides, inter alia: \u201cExceptions from taxation, garnishment, etc. The right of a person to an employe\u2019s annuity, a State annuity, or retirement allowance, to the return of contributions, any benefit or right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this act, and the moneys in the fund created under this act, are hereby exempt from any 'State \u25a0or municipal tax, and exempt from levy and sale, garnishment, attachment, or any other process whatsoever, and shall be unassignable, except as in this- act specifically otherwise provided, . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nAt the outset it must be noted that the Commonwealth concedes that, had the designated beneficiary in each instance survived the decedent, the proceeds of the Fund which would have been paid to such designated beneficiary would not have been subject to an inheritance tax. The rationale of the Commonwealth in taking this position is that the \u201cright\u201d of the designated beneficiary arises under the Act, that such designated beneficiary alone becomes entitled to the proceeds from the Fund, and such proceeds never become a part of the decedent\u2019s estate, subject to the claims of creditors and inheritance tax. Apparently, the basic distinction drawn by the Commonwealth is that (1) where a beneficiary is designated and survives decedent, the proceeds from the Fund are paid directly to such beneficiary, whereas (2) if no beneficiary is designated or if the designated beneficiary predeceases the decedent, the proceeds are paid to the legal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate and, upon such payment, the proceeds lose their .identity as retirement funds.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s contention is two-fold: (a) that the nature of an inheritance tax is such that it is \u201creally not a tax at all in the ordinary meaning of the word, but rather a distributive share of the estate which the State retains for itself\u201d and an inheritance tax is not \u201ca tax on the decedent\u2019s property ... or on the transaction of transferring it . . . but an excise on the privilege of inheritance\u201d (Tack\u2019s Estate, 325 Pa. 545, 548, 191 A. 155) and, therefore, an inheritance tax is not a \u201cState tax\u201d within the language of the exemption clause of \u00a718; (b) even if such exemption clause be construed to embrace an inheritance tax, the proceeds from the Fund were paid to the decedent\u2019s estate and; upon such payment, the estate became the owner of the proceeds and it is the devolution of such proceeds from the estate to those persons entitled, either under decedent\u2019s will or the intestate laws, which is taxable for inheritance tax purposes.\nTack\u2019s Estate, supra, \u2014 upon which the Commonwealth relies so heavily- \u2014 -determined a very narrow issue: whether \u201cthe tax imposed by the Act of 1919 [the inheritance tax statute] is a tax upon the transfer of\u201d certain Delaware River Bridge Joint Commission bonds issued under the authority of identical statutes of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Both enabling statutes provided, inter alia: \u201cthe bonds . . . issued by the commission, their transfer and the income therefrom (including any profits made on the sale thereof), shall, at all times, be free from taxation within [Pennsylvania and New Jersey]\u201d and each bond contained a clause stating that, under the enabling statutes, \u201cthis Bond is exempt from taxation.\u201d The decisional point in Tack\u2019s Estate was that an inheritance tax was not a tax on the transfer of these bonds within the meaning of the exemption clauses of the enabling statutes. The rationale of the Court was that an inheritance tax is not a tax either on the property of a decedent or on the transfer of such property but on the right of succession or of inheritance of the estate of a decedent, hence, not within the provisions of the exemption clause of the enabling statutes. With such holding and rationale we are in full agreement. If the wording of \u00a718 does not exempt a State tax on the right of succession to, or of inheritance of, the proceeds received from the Fund, then clearly Tack\u2019s Estate requires that an inheritance tax be paid on the proceeds received from the Fund in the case at bar.\nThe Commonwealth further places great reliance on Estate of Simpson, 43 Cal. 2d 594, 275 P. 2d 467, a 4-3 decision of the Supreme Court of California. The decisional point in Simpson was that, under the wording of the exemption clause in the California County Employes\u2019 Retirement Law, where a county employee died having designated his widow as his beneficiary to receive death benefits under the statute, the benefits which the widow, as designated beneficiary, received were subject to the payment of an inheritance tax. Simpson is presently inapposite. In the first-place, in holding that a designated beneficiary under the retirement statute must pay an inheritance tax on the proceeds received by such beneficiary from the retirement fund, Simpson takes a position directly contrary to that now taken by the Commonwealth, i.e., that, under such circumstances, the proceeds received by a designated beneficiary are not subject to inheritance taxation. In the second place, the California statute employed the language \u201cexempt from taxation, whether state, county, municipal or district\u201d whereas the language in our statute reads \u201cexempt from any State or municipal tax.\u201d In fact, as the opinion in Simpson clearly and explicitly indicates, the Court deemed of great significance the fact that the California legislature had not adopted the language of the exempting clause in the New York retirement statute\u2014 \u201cexempt from any state or municipal tax\u201d \u2014 which had been construed by the New York courts as exempting retirement benefits from inheritance taxation. The Court in Simpson considered the word \u201cany\u201d as \u201ca word broad enough to comprehend, in its enlarged and plural sense, all state or municipal taxes without limitation\u201d and noted that the California legislature \u201cchose not to include the word Any\u2019 in the tax exemption clause, a deletion consistent with an intent to effect a different application.\u201d In this respect, Simpson supports the appellees\u2019, rather than the Commonwealth\u2019s, construction of the wording of \u00a718.\nCritical in determination of these appeals is the exact language of the exemption clause of \u00a718. That which \u00a718 exempts from \u201cany State or municipal tax\u201d is the \u201cright of a person\u201d to certain specifically named benefits under the Act which benefits fall into six categories. Four of the six categorized benefits receive specific definition in the Act while two of such categorized benefits are not so defined. Bearing in mind the statutory definitions of the benefits in the first four stated categories, it is obvious that the \u201cright of a person\u201d under the exempting clause to such benefits refers to the \u201cright\u201d of a living contributor to the Fund, a \u201cright\u201d not presently in issue. An analysis of \u00a718, construed in the light of and in connection with other provisions of the Act, discloses that the words, \u201cany benefit or right accrued or accruing to any person under the Act\u201d mean and include the. benefit or right accrued or accruing to any contributor as well as to. any beneficiary. In other words, this benefit or right accrues not only to any contributor but also to any. \u201cperson\u201d, i.e., any beneficiary and any person who acts for a living contributor (i.e., a guardian for a living contributor) or to a person who acts for a deceased contributor to the fund (i.e., a designated beneficiary or the legal representative of a deceased contributor). The sixth category refers and is limited to \u201cmoneys in the fund created under the Act,\u201d and the right thereto and such fund and the moneys therein and the right thereto are likewise specifically exempt from any State or municipal tax.\nOur analysis of the wording of \u00a718, construed in the light of other provisions of the Act, clearly indicates that the \u201cperson\u201d whose \u201cright\u201d is exempted from \u201cany\u201d state tax is (1) a living contributor to the Fund under the first four categories of benefits, (2) either the \u201cperson\u201d acting for a living contributor or the designated beneficiary or the \u201clegal representative\u201d- of a deceased contributor under the fifth category of benefits and (3) the right to \u201cmoneys in the-Fund created under the Act,\u201d under the sixth category of benefits. Insofar as the benefits mentioned under the fifth \u00e1nd sixth categories be concerned, in the case of a deceased contributor, it was clearly the legislative intent to exempt from state taxation the right of succession to the proceeds of the Fund either by a designated beneficiary or by those who take, either under the Wills Act or the Intestate laws, the ultimate distribution of such proceeds. As a matter of fact, insofar as a designated beneficiary is concerned, the Commonwealth itself construes the language of \u00a718 to constitute an exemption of inheritance taxation on the right of succession to the proceeds of the Fund by such designated beneficiary and such construction by the Commonwealth has long prevailed. This position of the Commonwealth is significant; even if we were to adopt the position of the Commonwealth (which we do not) that the language of \u00a718 is not clear and explicit, \u201cthe contemporaneous construction of [\u00a718] by those charged with its execution and application [the Commonwealth], especially when it has long prevailed, is entitled to great weight and should not be disregarded or overturned except for clear language in the Act itself or very strong cogent and convincing reasons, [citing cases]\u201d: Loeb Estate, 400 Pa. 368, 373, 162 A. 2d 207; Pickering Estate, 410 Pa. 638, 650, 651, 190 A. 2d 132. The Commonwealth would have the exempting language of \u00a718 depend upon the survival of the designated beneficiary, a result clearly not within the legislative contemplation.\nThe Commonwealth further urges that, even though it be conceded that the language of \u00a718 grants an exemption from inheritance taxation even where there is either no designated beneficiary or the designated beneficiary has predeceased the contributor to the Fund and the proceeds of the Fund are payable to the legal representative of the estate of the deceased contributor, once the proceeds from the Fund are paid to the \u201clegal representative\u201d of the deceased contributor\u2019s estate the exemption, at the time of such payment, ceases to apply and those to whom such proceeds are distributed, through the medium of the estate, must pay an inheritance tax on such proceeds. Such contention renders meaningless and unreasonable the legislative intent. In the absence of a living designated beneficiary, the Act provides that the proceeds from the Fund are to be paid to the \u201clegal representative\u201d of the deceased contributor\u2019s estate. It has long been settled \u2014 many years prior to passage of the Act \u2014 that while it is the duty of the \u201clegal representative\u201d of a decedent to make sure that an inheritance tax appraisal is proper and that the tax, when settled, is paid, the duty of actual payment of the tax falls upon those persons entitled to distribution of the estate and not upon the \u201clegal representative\u201d: Brown\u2019s Estate, 208 Pa. 161, 57 A. 360; Oroxton\u2019s Estate, 289 Pa. 433, 137 A. 608; Loeb Estate, supra. When the legislature passed the Act and the amendments thereto, it can be assumed that the legislature knew that the responsibility for the actual payment of inheritance taxes was not upon the \u201clegal representative\u201d of the estate but upon those entitled to distribution of the assets of the estate. If we were to adopt the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, we would be led to conclude that the legislature intended to exempt from payment of inheritance taxes on the proceeds of the Fund the \u201clegal representative\u201d of the estate who had no duty to pay such taxes but not to exempt those persons upon whom did rest the duty of payment of inheritance taxes. Such a construction of the exemption clause would be absurd and cannot be ascribed to the legislative intent. The only sound construction is that the legislature intended to exempt those to whom the proceeds are given, whether a designated beneficiary or the persons entitled under the deceased contributor\u2019s will or the intestate laws.\nIllustrative of a statute of exemption upon which Tack\u2019s Estate, supra, has no impact is Schmuchli\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 36, 17 A. 2d 876. An Act of the Congress granted a bonus to members of the armed services who served in World War I, a bonus payable to the veteran twenty years after date of the certificate, or, upon the veteran\u2019s prior death, to a named beneficiary, or, in the absence of a surviving named beneficiary, to the veteran\u2019s estate. As amended, the Act provided: \u201cNo sum payable under this Act to a veteran or his dependents, or to his estate, or to any beneficiary named . . . shall be subject to . . . National or State taxation, . . . .\u201d In holding that the value of such bonds held by a deceased veteran at the time of his death was not subject to inheritance taxation by the Commonwealth, this Court, noting that it was in full agreement with the principles enunciated in Tach\u2019s Estate, stated: \u201cThat principle has no application here, for Congress has endowed these bonds with special characteristics which show a clear intent, particularly since the veteran did not exercise his right to redeem the bonds during his lifetime, that the estate was used as a mere conduit through which the gratuity was to pass to the ultimate donees thereof.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nLastly, it is highly significant that the legislature, in its description of the taxes to be exempted, stated that the exemption was to be extended to any state tax. The word \u201cany\u201d is generally used in the sense of \u201call\u201d or \u201cevery\u201d and its meaning is most comprehensive: Hoffmann Estate, 399 Pa. 96, 100, 160 A. 2d 237; Beaver Falls B. & L. A. v. Allemania Fire Insurance Co., 305 Pa. 290, 295, 157 A. 616; Glen Alden Coal Company v. Scranton City, 282 Pa. 45, 48, 127 A. 307. Cf.: Benat v. Mutual B. H. & A. Association, 191 Pa. Superior Ct. 547, 552, 159 A. 2d 23. Construed in connection with the other language employed in \u00a718 and other provisions of the Act, the legislative employment of the word \u201cany\u201d adds further emphasis to the conclusion that it was the legislative intent to exempt the proceeds of the Fund from all taxes, whether such taxes be on the property, the transfer of such property or on the privilege of succession after death to such property. See also: Simpson, supra.\nSection 18 indicates a clear legislative purpose to exempt from inheritance taxation proceeds received from the Fund by the persons who possess the right of succession to such proceeds upon the death of the contributor to the Fund. The legislative purpose is that, in the absence of a living designated beneficiary, the proceeds of the Fund are to go, free of inheritance taxation, to those who, either under the Wills Act or the Intestate laws, are to take distribution of the deceased contributor\u2019s assets and the estate is merely a \u201cconduit\u201d through which such persons receive the proceeds. Unlike Tach\u2019s Estate, that which \u00a718 exempts is the right of succession to the proceeds of this Fund.\nDecrees affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nAct of July 18, 1917, P.

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen :\nSection 18 of the Public School Employes\u2019 Retirement Act states as follows: \u201cThe right of a person to an employe\u2019s annuity, a State annuity, or retirement allowance, to the return of contributions, any benefit or right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this act, and the moneys in the fund created under this act, are hereby exempt from any State or municipal tax, and exempt from levy and sale, garnishment, attachment, or any other process whatsoever, and shall be unassignable, except as in /his act specifically otherwise provided. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nThe majority of this Court apparently read \u201cThe right of a person\u201d as being limited by six succeeding categories, i.e., \u201cThe right of a person to\u201d (a) an employe\u2019s annuity, (b) a State annuity, (c) a retirement allowance, (d) a return of contributions, (e) any benefit, etc., (f) the monies in the Fund \u201care exempt.\u201d\nI disagree. The provision quoted is hardly a model of proper sentence structure; but I conclude that, correctly read, it means that three categories are exempt from tax, levy, sale, etc.: (1) the right of a person.t.0 an employe\u2019s annuity, a State annuity, .a retirement allowance or a return of contribution; (2) .any benefit or right accrued or accruing.to any person under the provisions of the Retirement Act; (3) the moneys in the Fund created under the Retirement Act.\nMy conclusion on this point of construction is supported by several factors. First, the verb in the above-quoted exemption provision is the plural \u201care\u201d (i.e., \u201c. . . are hereby exempt from.....\u201d); read as the majority would have it, the provision must contain the singular verb \u201cis\u201d. Second, my conclusion is consonant with traditional exemption clauses; that is, the property itself is exempt from tax, not necessarily its transfer, etc. (subject here, however, to. the apparent intent of the second category of exemption to free from inheritance tax the direct receipt of benefits by a specifically designated beneficiary). See Tack\u2019s Estate, 325 Pa. 545, 191 Atl. 155 (1937). Third, under the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, \u00a7316, retirement benefits paid to the decedent\u2019s estate are subject to inheritance tax when ultimately received by the heir or legatee; and the comments to this section indicate that the provision conforms to existing law (both decedents in the present appeal died prior to the time the Act of 1961 took effect and would be subject to the inheritance tax provisions of the Act of 1919 \u2014 the \u201cexisting law\u201d). Fourth, the reasoning of the majority leads to some absurd results. For example, suppose a school employee retires and receives a retirement allowance under the Act of 1917. Suppose, further, he carefully places each and every periodic payment in a savings account and inserts a provision in his will making a specific bequest of the \u201cretirement moneys in the savings account.\u201d Can it be doubted that such a bequest is subject to inheritance tax? I think not, but the majority would raise such a doubt. For example, also, suppose an employee dies while in service and actually has designated his estate as beneficiary. The retirement moneys credited to him are paid by the Fund to his estate. Are such moneys still exempt from claims of the decedent\u2019s creditors? I cannot believe so, but the majority apparently would so hold.\nIn short, I believe \u00a718 was intended only to exempt from tax rights and moneys while held by the Fund itself for someone. Once the moneys are paid from the Fund, they enjoy no special privilege. Receipt from the Fund itself is explicitly freed from inheritance tax, whether received by specific persons or by the estate; but receipt thereafter from the estate is taxable. In this light all of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument here about the true nature of the inheritance tax is beside the point. At this late date it seems quite clear that it is a tax, a tax on the privilege of inheritance; and as such it is included within the breadth of \u00a718 of the Retirement Act as well as any other tax. Therefore, the benefit or right accruing to a person (be he individual or the estate) to receive retirement funds, in cases like the present ones, from the Fund itself upon the death of an employee is exempt from inheritance tax. The right or privilege of a person to inherit or take from the. estate itself moneys which were formerly in the Fund is not exempt. Hence, I would hold the assets involved in the estates here subject to appraisement for inheritance tax purposes and must dissent.",
