The abutment was located at the west boundary of an underpass, the approach to which was a wide sweeping curve. The evidence, including a photograph, justifies the conclusion that the decedent was negligent in the manner in which he made the turn and was traveling at a speed in excess of that which the physical situation, consistent with safety to human life, warranted.\nJudgment affirmed.",
