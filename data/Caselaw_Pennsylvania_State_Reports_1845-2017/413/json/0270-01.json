        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nThese appeals are from judgments entered on jury verdicts by the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County which refused to grant motions for new trials in trespass actions.\nThe actions were instituted as a result of a collision of automobiles. The facts concerning this collision are fully set forth in Thomas v. Tomay, 394 Pa. 299, 147 A. 2d 321 (1959). The facts are summarized as follows : On November 4, 1951, at about 1:45 A.M., a sedan, driven by Theodore Wade Frazee, of Friendsville, Maryland, while going south towards Uniontown from Pittsburgh on Highway Route No. 51, collided with a car driven by Frank Tomay, Jr.\nThe appellants, Richard C. Thomas, and James Vernon Shultz, were passengers in the Frazee automobile and were severely injured as a result of the collision. Tomay, Jr., the sole occupant of his car, died a few hours after the collision.\nFive years more have elapsed since we said \u201cAt the outset, we are impelled to remark the great length of time that was allowed to elapse before these cases were brought to trial \u2014 a circumstance which is all the more regrettable since they must go back for retrial because of reversible error, harmful to the appellant, which the record discloses\u201d. Thomas v. Tomay, supra, at page 300. Once again, the cases must go back for retrial because of reversible error, harmful to the appellants.\nThere were three separate actions instituted. Mary Tomay, administratrix of the Estate of Frank Tomay, Jr., sued Theodore Wade Frazee under the wrongful death and survival statutes, to recover damages for decedent\u2019s death. The respective guardians of Richard C. Thomas, a minor, and James Vernon Shultz, a minor, brought separate suits against Mary Tomay, administratrix of the Estate of Frank Tomay, Jr., to recover damages for their personal injuries. In the actions by the passengers Thomas and Shultz against the Estate of Tomay, Jr., Frazee was joined as an additional defendant.\nAll three cases were consolidated and tried in 1958. Verdicts were returned against the Estate of Tomay and Frazee in favor of the passengers, Thomas and Shnltz. These verdicts were appealed and we granted a new trial. Thomas v. Tomay, snpra.\nThe cases were retried in 1959 and resulted in verdicts in favor of the defendant, Mary Tomay, administratrix of the Estate of Frank Tomay, Jr., and Theodore Wade Frazee, additional defendant in the cases wherein Shultz and Thomas were plaintiffs, and in favor of the defendant, Frazee, in the suit against him by the Estate of Tomay, Jr.\nAt the second trial, the jury was permitted to pass upon the contributory negligence on the part of the guest passengers, Shultz and Thomas, appellants. It is the contention of appellants that the issue of contributory negligence should not have been submitted to the jury.\nWe have examined the records and are unable to find any evidence of contributory negligence on the part of Thomas or Shultz. The defendants offered no evidence to establish contributory negligence of the plaintiffs or any evidence from which contributory negligence could be inferred on the part of plaintiffs.\nIn such circumstances, it was error to submit the question of contributory negligence to the jury when no evidence existed from which the jury could find it. The plaintiff\u2019s cases revealed no contributory negligence and no evidence was offered by defendants. A jury should not be permitted to make a finding of material fact in the absence of evidence to support th\u00e9 finding.\nIn Greet v. Arned Corporation, 412 Pa. 292, 295, 194 A. 2d 343 (1963), quoting from Miller v. Montgomery, 397 Pa. 94, 152 A. 2d 757 (1959), we said: \u201cSince the burden of establishing contributory negligence is on the defendant it follows that where there is no evidence in the record to justify a jury in inferring that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligenee, it is the duty of the court to give binding instructions that as a matter of law, no such question exists in the case. Hepler v. Hammond, 363 Pa. 355, 69 A. 2d 95; McCracken v. Curwensville, 309 Pa. 98, 163 Atl. 217; 38 Am. Jur., 1080, Negligence, Sec. 367; Summary of Pennsylvania Jurisprudence, Torts I, Sec. 134. In Hepler v. Hammond, supra, at page 357, this Court said: \u2018It is elementary that a trial judge should not instruct a jury to find a material fact in the absence of evidence to support this finding\u2019. In the present case, the court either should not have instructed the jury on contributory negligence; or, if it was thought necessary to instruct them on that subject, the Trial Judge should have told them specifically that such an issue was not in this case.\u201d\nIt was reversible error for the trial judge to submit the question of plaintiffs\u2019 contributory negligence under the circumstances.\nJudgments reversed with a venire facias de novo.",
