      {
        "text": "OPINION\nJustice NEWMAN.\nWe granted allocatur in this case to address whether a police officer who suffers an injury in the course of his duties, which is compensable pursuant to the statute commonly referred to as the Heart and Lung Act, can collect and retain, in addition to Heart and Lung Act compensation, benefits pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for the loss of earning power he suffered in concurrent, supplemental employment. The Commonwealth Court determined that Jeffrey Annunziata (Annunziata), the claimant in the present case, was entitled to receive and keep both Heart and Lung Act and workers\u2019 compensation benefits concurrently. For the reasons discussed herein, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and vacate in part the Order of the Commonwealth Court.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nAnnunziata sustained a fracture of his right tibial plateau on April 22, 1998, when another vehicle struck the motorcycle that he was then operating. At the time of the accident, Annunziata was performing his duties as a police officer for the City of Erie (City). At the time of the injury, to supplement his police officer salary, Annunziata served as a part-time security guard for the Holiday Inn Downtown hotel (Holiday Inn) and a part-time automatic teller machine (ATM) maintenance person for Great Lakes Armored, Inc. (Great Lakes). By Notice of Compensation Payable (NCP) dated May 13, 1998, the City accepted its liability to Annunziata for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, but stated that the injured officer would continue to receive his full salary, pursuant to the Heart and Lung Act, \u201cin lieu of [workers\u2019] compensation\u201d benefits. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 2a.\nThe City continued to pay Annunziata his $777.81 full weekly salary for his police position. On August 5, 1998, the injury fully resolved and Annunziata returned to his pre-injury positions with the City, Holiday Inn, and Great Lakes. On November 4, 1999, Annunziata filed a Claim Petition, seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the City for the loss of earnings from his employment with Holiday Inn and Great Lakes during the period of his disability, from April 22, 1998, through August 5, 1998. In support of his Claim Petition, Annunziata provided the City with a record of his wages earned at Holiday Inn and Great Lakes during the year immediately preceding his injury. The City revised the NCP to reflect these additional earnings pursuant to Section 309(e) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which provides that where an employee was \u201cworking under concurrent contracts with two or more employers, his wages from all such employers shall be considered as if earned from the employer liable for compensation.\u201d 77 P.S. 582(e). The City calculated Annunziatas pre-injury average weekly wage as $988.37, which included $210.56 per week for his jobs at Holiday Inn and Great Lakes, and the $777.81 full weekly salary he received for his police position. R.R. at 40a.\nPursuant to Section 105.2 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an average weekly wage of $988.37 would entitle a claimant to $561.00 in benefits. 77 P.S. 25.2 (statewide maximum in effect in 1998). In its Answer to the Claim Petition, the City denied any obligation to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits because the amount it was already paying Annunziata in Heart and Lung benefits ($777.81) exceeded the $561.00 he would have been entitled to as workers\u2019 compensation. The City relied on Section 1(a) of the Heart and Lung Act, which provides in relevant part as follows:\nDuring the time salary for temporary incapacity shall be paid by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or by the Delaware River Port Authority or by the county, city, borough, town or township, any workmen\u2019s compensation, received or collected by any such employe for such period, shall be turned over to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or to the Delaware River Port Authority or to such county, city, borough, town or township, and paid into the treasury thereof, and if such payment shall not be so made by the employe the amount so due the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Delaware River Port Authority or the county, city, borough, town or township shall be deducted from any salary then or thereafter becoming due and owing.\n53 P.S. 637(a) (emphasis added). The City contended that the receipt of Heart and Lung benefits forecloses the possibility of concurrent workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\nThe WCJ denied the Claim Petition, stating that where \u201cthe cause of disability is related to a work injury, the workers\u2019 compensation benefit the injured employee is entitled to is reimbursed to the municipality for the period he received Heart and Lung benefits.\u201d Decision of the WCJ at 2. Because Annunziata was \u201cbetter off than other injured employees who have [a similar] average weekly wage, [Annunziata] ... is not entitled to partial worker\u2019s compensation benefits because of his loss in concurrent employment earnings in addition to his [full salary] Heart and Lung benefits.\u201d Id. at 3.\nAnnunziata appealed to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB), which reversed the determination of the WCJ. The WCAB concluded that wage loss benefits paid pursuant to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, as a result of concurrent employment, \u201care not subject to the reimbursement requirement of the Heart and Lung Act.\u201d Opinion of the WCAB at 5. The WCAB reasoned that \u201cit would be inequitable to require the reimbursement of wage loss benefits arising from concurrent employment\u201d as such \u201cwould deprive [Annunziata] of compensation for wages he would have earned had he not sustained a work-related injury.\u201d Id. at 6.\nThe Commonwealth Court affirmed the Order of the WCAB in a published Opinion. City of Erie v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Annunziata), 799 A.2d 946 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2002). The court noted that \u201cthe compensation programs and the employers\u2019 obligations under the two statutes are separate and conceptually different,\u201d thus implying that compensation pursuant to the Heart and Lung Act should not foreclose the collection of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Id. at 951-952. The Commonwealth Court explained that the goal of workers\u2019 compensation is to \u201ccreate a reasonable picture of a claimants pre-injury earning experience for use as a projection of potential future wages and, correspondingly, earnings loss.\u201d Id. at 952 (quoting Triangle Building Center v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Linch), 560 Pa. 540, 746 A.2d 1108, 1112 (2000)). The court held that the set-off provision in the Heart and Lung Act applies only where the employee seeks or receives workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the same employment for which he is receiving Heart and Lung benefits, not concurrent employment. The Commonwealth Court remanded the matter to the WCAB with instructions for that tribunal to remand to the WCJ for a calculation of the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for which Annunziata would be eligible.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this case, we are asked to define the parameters of the interrelation between the Heart and Lung Act and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Specifically, we must resolve two issues: (1) whether an injured worker, who receives Heart and Lung benefits for his primary police employment, can also receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits for concurrent employment; and (2) if yes, whether the employee can retain those benefits, or whether the employee must forward that money to his employer pursuant to the subrogation/reimbursement provision of the Heart and Lung Act. As a foundational matter, a brief discussion of the two acts and their purposes is in order.\nAs we have described, \u201c[t]he Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is remedial legislation designed to compensate claimants for earnings loss occasioned by work-related injuries.\u201d Triangle Building Center, 746 A.2d at 1111. The statute seeks \u201cto provide recompense commensurate with the damage from accidental injury, as a fair exchange for relinquishing every other right of action against the employer.\u201d Rudy v. McCloskey Co., 348 Pa. 401, 35 A.2d 250, 253 (1944) (citing Blake v. Wilson, 268 Pa. 469, 112 A. 126 (1920)). Accord Vescio v. Pennsylvania Electric Co., 336 Pa. 502, 9 A.2d 546, 549 (1939) (the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is \u201cto substitute a method of accident insurance in place of common-law rights and liabilities for ... all employees\u201d covered by its provisions). The goal of the workers\u2019 compensation legislative scheme is to relieve the employee \u201cfrom the economic consequences of his injury and make [those consequences] a part of the cost of operation of the business, to be paid ultimately by the consuming public----\u201d Rudy, 35 A.2d at 253. It is well settled that, \u201c[i]n construing the Act, we are mindful that, being remedial in nature and intended to benefit the Pennsylvania worker, the Act must be liberally construed to effectuate its humanitarian objectives.\u201d Krawchuk v. Philadelphia Electric Co., 497 Pa. 115, 439 A.2d 627, 630 (1981). See LTV Steel Co., Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Mozena), 562 Pa.205, 754 A.2d 666, 674 (2000) (holding that \u201c[c]ourts should liberally construe the Act in favor of the claimant\u201d); Pater v. Superior Steel Co., 263 Pa. 244, 106 A. 202, 202 (1919).\nWhere an employee is totally disabled, meaning that the injury results in a total loss of earning power for a period of time, he or she is entitled to receive benefits amounting to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of his or her average weekly wage. 77 P.S. \u00a7 511(1). The legislature justified this substantial, percentage-based reduction of average weekly pay as an amelioration of potential unfairness to employers. Triangle Building Center, 746 A.2d at 1112. Where, immediately prior to the injury, the employee worked more than one job for more than one employer, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act ensures that he or she will be compensated for that position as well. 77 P.S. \u00a7 582(e). See Triangle Building Center, 746 A.2d at 1112 (\u201cthe General Assembly directed inclusion of concurrent wages in the benefits computation ... to create a reasonable picture of a claimant\u2019s pre-injury earning experience for use as a projection of potential future wages and, correspondingly, earnings loss\u201d).\nIn contrast, \u201c[t]he Heart and Lung Act covers specified public employees engaged primarily in police work, firefighting, or other jobs involving public safety. The Act was created to ensure that, if these employees were injured or otherwise disabled in the course of carrying out their hazardous duties, they would be guaranteed continued full income until their return to duty.\u201d Cunningham v. Pennsylvania State Police, 510 Pa. 74, 507 A.2d 40, 43 (1986) (emphasis added). \u201c[T]he best interest of the municipality and not the disabled officer was the prime consideration prompting its enactment. Efficient firemen and police officers must take chances; the performance of their duties are hazardous. The prospect of uninterrupted income during periods of disability well may attract qualified persons to these vocations.... \u201d Kurtz, 133 A.2d at 177 (quoting Iben v. Borough of Monaco, 158 Pa.Super. 46, 43 A.2d 425, 427 (1945)). See also 63 Corpus Juris Secundum Municipal Corporations 578 (citing Iben with approval).\nThe amount of compensation that the Heart and Lung Act provides is the \u201cfull rate of salary,\u201d 53 P.S. 637(a), which, unlike \u201cwages\u201d contemplated by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, does not include vacations and overtime. Homer v. Borough of California, 698 A.2d 1360 (Pa.Cmwlth.1997); Schmidt v. Borough of Stroudsburg, 670 A.2d 208 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1996), affirmed per curiam, 547 Pa. 159, 689 A.2d 223 (1997). \u201c[A]lthough the LHeart and Lung! Act grants full compensation and continuation of employee benefits to eligible employees, and thus in one sense is more generous towards injured employees than the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, its scope is in fact much narrower.\u201d Allen v. Pennsylvania State Police, 678 A.2d 436, 438 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996), petition for allowance of appeal denied, 546 Pa. 696, 687 A.2d 379 (1997). The Heart and Lung Act makes no mention of concurrent employment.\nAnother significant distinction between the Heart and Lung Act and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is that the Heart and Lung Act is to be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S. 1928(b)(8) provides that \u201c[pjrovisions enacted finally prior to September 1, 1937 which are in derogation of the common law ... shall be strictly construed.... \u201d The Heart and Lung Act was enacted in 1935 and varies the common law in that it imposes a liability on employers, whether or not they are at fault for the injuries of their employees. See Organ v. Pennsylvania State Police, 112 Pa.Cmwlth. 352, 535 A.2d 713, 714 n. 5 (1988). See also Justice v. Department of Public Welfare, 829 A.2d 415, 416 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003); Hollenbush v. Department of Corrections, 736 A.2d 48, 50 (Pa.Cmwlth.1999); Donnini v. Pennsylvania State Police, 707 A.2d 591, 593 (Pa. Cmwlth.1998); McCommons v. Pennsylvania State Police, 165 Pa.Cmwlth. 280, 645 A.2d 333, 335 (1994), petition for allowance of appeal denied, 539 Pa. 671, 652 A.2d 841 (1994); Colyer, 644 A.2d at 233. This operates in stark contradistinction to the liberal, pro-employee construction afforded the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. LTV Steel, 754 A.2d at 674.\nIt is within this framework that we examine the ability of an injured employee, who is entitled to and receiving Heart and Lung Act benefits, to seek workers\u2019 compensation for concurrent employment. The City contends that, by using the terms \u201cany\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d in section 1(a) of the Heart and Lung Act when referring to the requirement that an injured employee turn over workers\u2019 compensation benefits received to the entity paying Heart and Lung benefits, the General Assembly expressed a clear intent to deprive such an employee of the right to seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Moreover, the City argues, by providing,an increased benefit to those covered by the Heart and Lung Act, the General Assembly already has rewarded individuals, such as Annunziata, for the necessary and sometimes dangerous public functions they perform. The City avers that the Heart and Lung Act, by its clear language, prohibits collection from a collateral source for the same work injury, irrespective of whether the funds the injured worker seeks from the collateral source are for concurrent employment.\nWe cannot accept this argument. The unambiguous language of Section 1(a) of the Heart and Lung Act, to which the City so often refers, clearly contemplates the ability of an injured employee to seek workers\u2019 compensation. That section provides that any workmen\u2019s compensation received or collected by [the employee for the period of injury] shall be turned over.... 53 P.S. 637(a) (emphasis added). See 1 Pa.C.S.1921(b) (\u201c[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit\u201d). This language does not estop an injured employee from seeking workers\u2019 compensation, only from retaining monies collected pursuant to a workers\u2019 compensation Claim Petition. While the effect of this dichotomy may ultimately be rendered hollow by the set-off, as discussed below, nonetheless the Heart and Lung Act does not relieve the employer from its \u201ccontinuing obligations to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the work injury....\u201d City of Erie, 799 A.2d at 952. Likewise, nothing in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act eliminates the responsibility of an employer to pay workers\u2019 compensation to an injured employee who is receiving Heart and Lung benefits. We agree with the Commonwealth Court that the employers obligation to pay Heart and Lung benefits \u201cis concurrent with, not in lieu of, its obligation\u201d pursuant to the workers\u2019 compensation scheme. Id. (emphasis in original).\nAlternatively, the City avers that because Annunziata received $777.81 in Heart and Lung benefits, he is not entitled to receipt of workers\u2019 compensation because his average weekly wage, including concurrent employment, of $988.37, would entitle him to only $561.00 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. However, this argument assumes that the interplay between the Heart and Lung Act and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act allows an injured employee to choose only which set of benefits he desires. There is no authority for such a constraint in either enactment, as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not make any mention of the Heart and Lung Act and, as we have held above, the Heart and Lung Act does not take the place of workers\u2019 compensation, but functions instead concurrent therewith, where the injured employee is entitled to Heart and Lung benefits.\nHowever, it does not necessarily follow from our affirmance of the right of a claimant to seek and receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits for concurrent employment that a claimant can retain those benefits. The clear language of Section 1(a) provides that \u201cany workmen\u2019s compensation benefits received or collected ..! shall be turned over.\u201d 53 P.S. 637(a) (emphasis added). Annunziata advocates, and the Commonwealth Court adopted, an equitable exception to this seemingly mandatory language:\nTo construe the term \u201cany\u201d workers\u2019 compensation in Section 1(a) to include benefits for loss of earnings from the concurrent employment and require the claimant to reimburse such benefits to the employer would result in ignoring the mandate of Section 309(e) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that the wages from the concurrent employment be included in computing wage loss benefits. Under such construction of Section 1(a), the claimant would be inequitably deprived of the compensation for wages that would have been earned had he or she not sustained the work injury while performing the duties of the primary employment.\nCity of Erie, 799 A.2d at 953. Because injured workers\u2019 who are not covered by the Heart and Lung Act can recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits for primary and concurrent employment, Annunziata reasons that he should be able to recover over and above his Heart and Lung benefits for his concurrent employment. In making this argument, Annunziata glosses over the fact that the benefits provided by the Heart and Lung Act are far more generous than those provided by workers\u2019 compensation. If Annunziata had worked for a private employer instead of the City, at the same salary, and also held his positions at Holiday Inn and Great Lakes, he would still be entitled to only $561.00 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Ultimately, though, this equitable argument falls at the knees of the rules of statutory construction.\nIn light of the legislative directive that we construe the Heart and Lung Act strictly pursuant to 1 Pa.C.S.1928(b)(8), we cannot see \u201cany\u201d way around the word any. The Heart and Lung Act explicitly requires an injured employee, such as Annunziata, who is receiving or has received Heart and Lung benefits, to turn over to the employer who continues to pay the employee his full salary during his temporary disability, all workers\u2019 compensation attributable to that period. While it is apparent that the General Assembly in drafting the Heart and Lung Act did not consider the effect of concurrent employment on the rights of the enumerated professionals to collect benefits, and the amounts thereof, it is not within the province of this Court to attempt to presume how the legislature would have spoken in the face of clear language.\nWe are not unmindful of the harshness of this result. We recognize that the community directly affected by the disposition of this case is comprised of individuals whom we ask, on a daily basis, to perform some of the most hazardous duties in our society, made evermore perilous in this post-9/11 era. Unfortunately, the compensation that firefighters and police officers earn is not commensurate with the importance of their jobs in our society and the dangers they encounter. Therefore, it is understandable that these individuals will seek concurrent employment to supplement their salaries. It is neither our goal nor our intention to approve of a legislative landscape that wholly fails to take this into account. However, where, as here, the language of a statute is clear, our hands are tied, and it is for the General Assembly to ameliorate this inequity, if it so chooses.\nCONCLUSION\nIn accordance with the foregoing discussion, we affirm in part and vacate in part the Order of the Commonwealth Court. Annunziata is entitled to seek workers\u2019 compensation for his concurrent employment, but Section 1(a) of the Heart and Lung Act, 58 P.S. \u00a7 637(a), requires him to reimburse any benefits so received to his employer, the City. This Court is bound to apply the plain language of a statute, even if we would have drafted the statute differently or believe that the statute is bad public policy. It is up to the legislature, not this Court, to examine the perceived inequity and take appropriate action. Therefore, we reverse the portion of the Order of the Commonwealth Court that would have allowed Annunziata to retain workers\u2019 compensation benefits he could collect for his concurrent employment and, accordingly, we vacate that part of the Order of the Commonwealth Court that remanded the matter for a calculation of benefits. Because the City is self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation purposes, rather than mandating the City to pay benefits to Annunziata and then requiring Annunziata to turn around and remit them, as a matter of policy, it was proper for the City to issue a revised NCP and refuse to pay benefits.\nChief Justice CAPPY files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Justice LAMB joins.\n. Act of June 28, 1935, P.L. 477, as amended, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 637-638.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1041.4, 2501-2626.\n. Annunziata alleges that his average weekly wage from his concurrent employment was $240.51. Brief of Annunziata at 2. Because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge (WCJ) denied the Claim Petition, it never calculated the average weekly wage Annunziata earned at his concurrent employment with Holiday Inn and Great Lakes.\n.

The term \"wage\u201d includes salary, reported gratuities, bonuses, incentives, and vacation pay. 77 P.S. \u00a7 582(e).\n. As we described in Camaione v. Borough of Latrobe, 523 Pa. 363, 567 A.2d 638 (1989), \"[c]ompensation for total disability is not permitted under the statute and has not been allowed by this Court.\" Id. at 640 (citing Creighan v. City of Pittsburgh, 389 Pa. 569, 132 A.2d 867 (1957)). The Heart and Lung Act provides benefits only for temporary disability. Camaione, 567 A.2d at 640; Kurtz v. City of Erie, 389 Pa. 557, 133 A.2d 172, 177 (1957) (\u201d[w]hile the Act provides for compensation for total disability for a temporary period, it excludes compensation for any disability which is permanent\u201d). Accord Griffin v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, 756 A.2d 1203, 1208 (Pa.Cmwlth.2000); Colyer v. Pennsylvania State Police, 165 Pa.Cmwlth. 41, 644 A.2d 230, 233 (1994).\n. Nevertheless, in circumstances where the employer is self-insured, it would be an exercise in futility to mandate that the employer pay benefits to the claimant and then require the claimant to turn around and remit them back to the employer. To avoid this absurdity, in such a situation, it would be proper for the employer to issue a revised NCP and refuse to pay benefits.\n. This should not be read to imply that an injured employee can, in good faith, seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the same job that gives rise to Heart and Lung benefits. That possibility has been foreclosed by the Commonwealth Court, see Wisniewski v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (City of Pittsburgh), 153 Pa.Cmwlth.403, 621 A.2d 1111, 1113 (1993), and Tyson v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 67 Pa.Cmwlth. 213, 446 A.2d 733, 734 735 (1982), and is beyond the scope of our grant of the Petition for Allowance of Appeal in the instant case. City of Erie v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Annunziata), 572 Pa.693, 819 A.2d 1191 (2003).\n. It is theoretically possible that a situation could arise where an injured worker would receive more in workers\u2019 compensation than that to which he or she would be entitled as Heart and Lung Act benefits. However, this is not that case.",

        "text": "Chief Justice CAPPY\nconcurring and dissenting.\nI join the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion that a police officer, who suffers an injury in the course of his duties, may collect benefits pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in addition to Heart and Lung Act compensation. I dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion that police officers cannot retain workers\u2019 compensation benefits received for the loss of earning from concurrent employment. Rather, I believe that the mandates contained in the Statutory Construction Act lead to the opposite conclusion and that police officers may retain those workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\nThe Heart and Lung Act provides in relevant part that: \u201cDuring the time salary for temporary incapacity shall be paid by the ... city ... any workmen\u2019s compensation, received or collected by any such employe for such period, shall be turned over to the ... city....\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 637(a). Based on this portion of Section 637(a), the majority determines that the \u201cclear language\u201d contained in the statute requires that police officers turn over all workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u2014 even those received for the loss of earning from concurrent employment, such as in this case, benefits received by Officer Annunziata for his loss of earning from his employment as a guard and maintenance worker.\nThis approach treats those police officers whose only employment is service as an officer in exactly the same way it treats those police officers who work one or more additional non-service related jobs to make ends meet. By treating these police officers the same, regardless of their different employment situation, the majority\u2019s approach fails to give effect to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by depriving police officers who work multiple non-service jobs of any benefits for the loss of earnings from their concurrent employment.\nAs its opinion shows, the majority is not unaware of or uncaring of this result. Indeed, the majority readily acknowledges that \u201cit is apparent that the General Assembly in drafting the Heart and Lung Act did not consider the effect of concurrent employment\u201d and that it is \u201cnot unmindful of the harshness of this result,\u201d yet the majority laments that \u201cwe cannot see any way around the word \u2018any\u2019,\u201d Majority Opinion, 575 Pa. at p. 607, 838 A.2d at p. 606 and that \u201cour hands are tied.\u201d Majority Opinion, 575 Pa. at p. 608, 838 A.2d at p. 606.\nThe Statutory Construction Act, however, provides relief for the majority\u2019s understandable concern and for the \u201charshness\u201d faced by police officers working multiple jobs. Specifically, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1932(a) states that \u201c[sjtatutes or parts of statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things.\u201d In fact, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1932(b) mandates that \u201c[statutes in pari materia shall be construed together, if possible, as one statute.\u201d See Kelly v. City of Philadelphia, 382 Pa. 459, 115 A.2d 238, 245 (1955) (statutes in pari materia should be construed concurrently whenever possible and if they can be made to stand together, effect should be given to both as far as possible); see also Lewis v. Erie Ins. Exchange, 568 Pa. 105, 793 A.2d 143, 149 (2002); Hamilton v. Unionville-Chadds Ford School District, 552 Pa. 245, 714 A.2d 1012, 1015 (1998).\nHere, both the Heart and Lung Act and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act relate not only to the same person, but also to the same thing \u2014 compensation for a work-related injury. Thus, the two statutes are in pari materia. Moreover, the Legislature clearly intended the two statutes to be construed together in a consistent fashion by the fact that the Heart and Lung Act, by its terms, specifically recognizes a police officer\u2019s concurrent receipt of benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\nThus, pursuant to the Statutory Construction Act, this Court is mandated to construe the statutes together and to give effect to both of these statutory enactments, if possible. The majority, however, fails to do so. Giving effect to the two statutes is clearly possible in the situation regarding concurrent employment. Indeed, without so stating, the Commonwealth Court did just this in construing the Heart and Lung Act.\nSpecifically, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s approach requiring officers to return workers\u2019 compensation benefits received for police employment to the employer, but allowing officers to retain benefits received for loss of concurrent employment, gives effect to both statutes, is consistent with the policies underlying both statutes, and is eminently fair. It gives no windfall to police officers and yet takes into account any concurrent employment and recognizes the loss in earning power regarding the other non-service related employment due to the injury occurring while on duty as a police officer. For these reasons, I concur in and dissent from the majority\u2019s decision today and would affirm the Commonwealth Court.\nJustice LAMB joins this concurring and dissenting opinion.",
