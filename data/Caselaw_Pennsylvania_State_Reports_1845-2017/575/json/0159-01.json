Mendel, 510 Pa. 213, 507 A.2d 351 (1986) \u2014 the appellate court decided it in a way not in accord with Post by deciding Respondents were protected by that privilege even as to statements (a) contained within and in addition to an utterly scandalous complaint filed in court then faxed to a newspaper which republished them, (b) an e-mail they published to Petitioners\u2019 legal malpractice insurance carrier, and (c) a letter they published to third parties.\nStated another way, was it an abuse of the judicial privilege when Respondent intentionally included scandalous and utterly false accusations in a Complaint, intending to send that Complaint to the media with other extraneous, defamatory statements for the purpose of embarrassing Petitioner into a settlement?\nJustice LAMB did not participate in the decision or consideration of this matter.",
