According to Appellant, he was at Frick and Frack’s bar on the night of March 6, 1999, when Smith and three friends came into the bar, looking for “Derrick,” who worked as a bartender there.

According to Appellant, he was walking back to the bar when he saw Smith turn the Explorer around, drive back to the bar and begin shooting towards him from across the street. <em>Id. </em>at 196.

In that regard, on the second day of deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge, indicating that they were unable to reach a verdict, <em>see </em>N.T., 8/2/2000, at 287 (“If we have not come close to a unanimous verdict by the end of today what would be your ruling[?]”), and at the same time, requesting that it be permitted to see the diagram.

Later that day, the jury reached a unanimous verdict.

Not only did Appellant call the credibility of the Commonwealth’s witnesses into question with probing cross-examination,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a> but, as stated above, the testimony of the only arguably neutral eyewitness, Joshua Crankshaw, supported Appellant’s assertion that Diddle was the shooter. Moreover, the testimony of defense witnesses regarding Appellant’s confrontation with Smith provided a basis on which <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>the jury could have found that Smith and his friends were motivated by revenge in identifying Appellant as the shooter. And finally, as emphasized above, the testimony of the detective regarding the shell casings supported Appellant’s assertion that Diddle shot at the Explorer car from behind the truck parked in front of the bar. Thus, contrary to the majority’s conclusion, there was more than sufficient evidence from which a jury could have concluded that Appellant was not, in fact, the shooter.</p>

However, I take little solace in the fact that the viewing of the diagram was “brief’ when the jury really only needed enough time to view what amounted to a simple picture on a single page.

That the trial court nevertheless permitted the jury, during deliberations, to view a diagram that contradicted the evidence on this point and itself was never admitted into evidence, surely had the potential to be highly prejudicial. Accordingly, unlike the majority, I would find that there is a reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the conviction and would therefore grant Appellant a new trial.</p>
