At the time of the accident, Annunziata was performing his duties as a police officer for the City of Erie (City). At the time of the injury, to supplement his police officer salary, Annunziata served as a part-time security guard for the Holiday Inn Downtown hotel (Holiday Inn) and a part-time automatic teller machine (ATM) maintenance person for Great Lakes Armored, Inc. (Great Lakes). By Notice of Compensation Payable (NCP) dated May 13, 1998, the City accepted its liability to Annunziata for workers’ compensation benefits, but stated that the injured officer would continue to receive his full salary, pursuant to the Heart and Lung Act, “in lieu of [workers’] compensation” benefits. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 2a.</p>

On August 5, 1998, the injury fully resolved and Annunziata returned to his pre-injury positions with the City, Holiday Inn, and Great Lakes. On November 4, 1999, Annunziata filed a Claim Petition, seeking workers’ compensation benefits from the City for the loss of earnings from his employment with Holiday Inn and Great Lakes during the period of his disability, from April 22, 1998, through August 5, 1998. In support of his Claim Petition, Annunziata provided the City with a record of his wages earned at Holiday Inn and Great Lakes during the year immediately preceding his injury. The City revised the NCP to reflect these additional earnings pursuant to Section 309(e) of the Workers’ Compensation Act, which provides that where an employee was “working under concurrent contracts with two or more employers, his wages from all such employers shall be considered as if earned from the employer liable for compensation.” 77 P.S. 582(e). The City calculated Annunziatas pre-injury average weekly wage as $988.37, which included $210.56 per week for his jobs at Holiday Inn and Great <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>Lakes, and the $777.81 full weekly salary he received for his police position.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> R.R. at 40a.</p>

The City relied on Section 1(a) of the Heart and Lung Act, which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>

Because Annunziata was “better off than other injured employees who have [a similar] average weekly wage, [Annunziata] ... is not entitled to partial worker’s compensation benefits because of his loss in concurrent employment earnings in addition to his [full salary] Heart and Lung benefits.” <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>

The City contends that, by using the terms “any” and “shall” in section 1(a) of the Heart and Lung Act when referring to the requirement that an injured employee turn over workers’ compensation benefits received to the entity paying Heart and Lung benefits, the General Assembly expressed a clear intent to deprive such an employee of the right to seek workers’ compensation benefits. Moreover, the City argues, by providing,an increased benefit to those covered by the Heart and Lung Act, the General Assembly already has rewarded individuals, such as Annunziata, for the necessary and sometimes dangerous public functions they perform.

This language does not estop an injured employee from seeking workers’ compensation, only from retaining monies collected pursuant to a workers’ compensation Claim Petition.

However, this argument assumes that the interplay between the Heart and Lung Act and the Workers’ Compensation Act allows an injured employee to choose only which set of benefits he desires. There is no authority for such a constraint in either enactment, as the Workers’ Compensation Act does not make any mention of the Heart and Lung Act and, as we have held above, the Heart and Lung Act does not take the place of <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>workers’ compensation, but functions instead concurrent therewith, where the injured employee is entitled to Heart and Lung benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

This Court is bound to apply the plain language of a statute, even if we would have drafted the statute differently or believe that the statute is bad public policy. It is up to the legislature, not this Court, to examine the perceived inequity and take appropriate action. Therefore, we reverse the portion of the Order of the Commonwealth Court that would have allowed Annunziata to retain workers’ compensation benefits he could collect for his concurrent employment and, accordingly, we vacate that part of the Order of the Commonwealth Court that remanded the matter for a calculation of benefits. Because the City is self-insured for workers’ compensation purposes, rather than mandating the City to pay benefits to Annunziata and then requiring Annunziata to turn around and remit them, as a matter of policy, it was proper for the City to issue a revised NCP and refuse to pay benefits.</p>

I dissent, however, from the majority’s analysis and conclusion that police officers cannot retain workers’ compensation benefits received for the loss of earning from concurrent employment. Rather, I believe that the mandates contained in the Statutory <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>Construction Act lead to the opposite conclusion and that police officers may retain those workers’ compensation benefits.</p>
    <p id="b753-4" data-blocks='[["BL_753.5",753,[215,498,1152,627]]]'>The Heart and Lung Act provides in relevant part that: “During the time salary for temporary incapacity shall be paid by the ... city ... any workmen’s compensation, received or collected by any such employe for such period, shall be turned over to the ... city....” 53 P.S. § 637(a). Based on this portion of Section 637(a), the majority determines that the “clear language” contained in the statute requires that police officers turn over all workers’ compensation benefits — even those received for the loss of earning from concurrent employment, such as in this case, benefits received by Officer Annunziata for his loss of earning from his employment as a guard and maintenance worker.</p>
    <p id="b753-5" data-blocks='[["BL_753.6",753,[212,1161,1153,472]]]'>This approach treats those police officers whose only employment is service as an officer in exactly the same way it treats those police officers who work one or more additional non-service related jobs to make ends meet. By treating these police officers the same, regardless of their different employment situation, the majority’s approach fails to give effect to the Workers’ Compensation Act by depriving police officers who work multiple non-service jobs of any benefits for the loss of earnings from their concurrent employment.</p>
    <p id="b753-6" data-blocks='[["BL_753.7",753,[209,1659,1154,477]]]'>As its opinion shows, the majority is not unaware of or uncaring of this result. Indeed, the majority readily acknowledges that “it is apparent that the General Assembly in drafting the Heart and Lung Act did not consider the effect of concurrent employment” and that it is “not unmindful of the harshness of this result,” yet the majority laments that “we cannot see any way around the word ‘any’,” Majority Opinion, 575 Pa. at p. 607, 838 A.2d at p. 606 and that “our hands are tied.” Majority Opinion, 575 Pa. at p. 608, 838 A.2d at p. 606.</p>

Specifically, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1932(a) states that “[sjtatutes or parts of statutes <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>are in pari materia when they relate to the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things.” In fact, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1932(b) mandates that “[statutes in pari materia shall be construed together, if possible, as one statute.” <em>See Kelly v.

    <p id="b754-4" data-blocks='[["BL_754.5",754,[262,913,1159,461]]]'>Here, both the Heart and Lung Act and the Workers’ Compensation Act relate not only to the same person, but also to the same thing — compensation for a work-related injury. Thus, the two statutes are in pari materia. Moreover, the Legislature clearly intended the two statutes to be construed together in a consistent fashion by the fact that the Heart and Lung Act, by its terms, specifically recognizes a police officer’s concurrent receipt of benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act.</p>
    <p id="b754-5" data-blocks='[["BL_754.6",754,[262,1404,1159,409]]]'>Thus, pursuant to the Statutory Construction Act, this Court is mandated to construe the statutes together and to give effect to both of these statutory enactments, if possible. The majority, however, fails to do so. Giving effect to the two statutes is clearly possible in the situation regarding concurrent employment. Indeed, without so stating, the Commonwealth Court did just this in construing the Heart and Lung Act.</p>
    <p id="b754-6" data-blocks='[["BL_754.7",754,[262,1843,1162,521]],["BL_755.1",755,[218,322,1151,143]]]'>Specifically, the Commonwealth Court’s approach requiring officers to return workers’ compensation benefits received for police employment to the employer, but allowing officers to retain benefits received for loss of concurrent employment, gives effect to both statutes, is consistent with the policies underlying both statutes, and is eminently fair. It gives no windfall to police officers and yet takes into account any concurrent employment and recognizes the loss in earning power regarding the other non-service related employment due to the injury occurring while on duty as a police officer. <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>For these reasons, I concur in and dissent from the majority’s decision today and would affirm the Commonwealth Court.</p>
