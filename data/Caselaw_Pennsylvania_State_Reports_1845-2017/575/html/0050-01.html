McNeil is a New Jersey corporation with its principal place of business located in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania. McNeil is a pharmaceutical company that manufactures and markets analgesic drugs, such as Tylenol. On November 9, 1994, the Department advised McNeil that it intended to conduct a sales and use tax<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> audit of McNeil’s records and accounts for purposes of determining the amount of tax due for the period from October 1, 1991 through December 31, 1994 (audit period). McNeil made approximately 780,000 purchases related to its pharmaceutical business during the audit period; the auditor reviewed all of these purchases. The auditor “advised McNeil’s representative at the start of the audit that any tax paid on non-taxable purchases during the audit period would <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>reduce any amount of tax determined by the auditor to be due for the audit period.” (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 2, Stipulation of Facts No. 5). Based on requests by the Department, McNeil twice agreed to extend the deadline for the Department to complete the audit; it is common practice for the Department to make such requests of taxpayers with large volumes of purchases.</p>
    <p id="b198-5" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[271,702,1161,734]]]'>During the pendency of the audit, to stop the accrual of interest, McNeil paid $1,599,975.99 to the Department to offset the deficiency that it anticipated the audit would uncover. On June 25, 1996, the Department mailed an assessment notice to McNeil advising the company that it owed $3,533,254.77 for the audit period. Taking into account the anticipatory pre-payment of $1,599,975.99, the Department informed McNeil that it had $1,933,278.78 in outstanding tax liability. McNeil did not advise the auditor of the tax that McNeil paid directly to its vendors on non-taxable purchases, relying on the statement of the auditor that the audit would incorporate overpayments; the auditor did not reduce his determination of the amount of tax due by the amount of these overpayments.</p>
    <p id="b198-6" data-blocks='[["BL_198.6",198,[269,1460,1161,519]]]'>On August 9,1996, McNeil filed a Petition for Reassessment with the Board of Appeals for the Department, challenging the entire amount of tax, the auditor determined was due for the audit period. The Board of Appeals reassessed McNeil’s tax liability and reduced it by $43,479.04 based on certain purchases included by the auditor, which the Board of Appeals deemed exempt from tax. Accordingly, the Board of Appeals set McNeil’s liability for the audit period at $3,489,775.73, which, after subtraction of the anticipatory pre-payment, left McNeil with a $1,899,799.74 outstanding deficiency.</p>
    <p id="b198-7" data-blocks='[["BL_198.7",198,[269,2003,1163,362]],["BL_199.1",199,[200,314,1154,360]]]'>On October 6, 1997, McNeil appealed the Board of Appeals’ reassessment by filing a Petition for Review with the Board of Finance and Revenue (BFR). On November 12, 1997, McNeil amended its appeal and submitted evidence that it paid tax to its vendors on certain non-taxable purchases it made during the audit period. McNeil requested that the tax paid on those non-taxable purchases reduce the amount of tax due for the <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>audit period. In its amended appeal, McNeil explained its position that the “assessment must be offset by overpayments for the audit period because <em>[inter alia] </em>... the sales tax statute requires that the Department determine the proper amount of tax due for the audit period, which necessarily includes considering tax overpayments.” (Reproduced Record at Exhibit A, page 1).</p>
    <p id="b199-4" data-blocks='[["BL_199.5",199,[197,699,1156,1426]]]'>The BFR rejected the request of McNeil as untimely, citing then-applicable Section 253(a) of the Tax Code, which provided that “[a] refund or credit of tax ... shall be made only where the person who has actually paid the tax files with the Department a petition for refund within three years of the actual payment of the tax to the Commonwealth....” 72 P.S. § 7253(a) (emphasis added). The BFR determined that McNeil filed a timely challenge relevant to overpayments where the purchases were made within three years of the date of the amended appeal; therefore, the BFR indicated that it would consider tax payments McNeil made directly to vendors on non-taxable purchases from November 12, 1994 through December 31, 1994. However, because McNeil failed to list purchases on which it paid tax directly to vendors by invoice or payment dates, the BFR could not determine the taxes that were paid after November 12, 1994. Thus, the BFR could not grant relief to McNeil based on any tax paid to vendors on non-taxable purchases. Nevertheless, the BFR did grant McNeil relief on some of the individual purchases, determining that the taxpayer was entitled to some exemptions and exclusions that neither the auditor nor the Board of Appeals granted. Applying these exemptions and exclusions, the BFR reduced the determination of tax due for the audit period to $2,565,514.13, thereby reducing McNeil’s outstanding liability to $965,538.14 (taking into account the anticipatory pre-payment). Two of the six members of the BFR dissented in favor of affording greater relief to McNeil.</p>

The panel rejected the argument of McNeil that the act of auditing requires the Department to determine the proper amount of tax due during the audit period, which, according to McNeil, necessarily includes consideration of tax paid on non-taxable purchases. The panel agreed with the BFR that the failure of McNeil to file a refund claim within three years of the alleged overpayments rendered the refund request untimely. Judge Leadbetter dissented from the panel decision without opinion. Pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1571(f), McNeil filed exceptions to the Order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b200-4" data-blocks='[["BL_200.6",200,[270,976,1158,637]]]'>In a published, <em>en banc </em>opinion, the Commonwealth Court denied the exceptions filed by McNeil. The court determined that “McNeil should have been sufficiently familiar with statutory requirements to know that it had to file a petition for a refund of its sales tax overpayments within the appropriate time period.” <em>McNeil-PPC, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/a2d/802/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="802 A.2d 26" data-case-ids="9401384" data-case-paths="/a2d/802/0026-01">802 A.2d 26</a>, 31 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002) <em>(en banc). </em>Therefore, because McNeil failed to file a timely request for a refund of overpayments, the Commonwealth Court held that it (and for that matter, the Department itself) had no means by which to grant a credit to McNeil. Again, Judge Leadbetter dissented without opinion.</p>

These questions are so inextricably intertwined, however, that we discuss them in tandem.

To determine the proper amount of tax due, McNeil posits, the Department must ascertain for each purchase made during the audit period: (1) whether McNeil paid tax; and (2) whether McNeil was required to pay tax. For taxable purchases for which McNeil did not pay tax, the Department should assess tax liability, and from that amount, McNeil contends, the Department should subtract the tax McNeil paid on non-taxable purchases. The amount remaining is the deficiency, according to McNeil.</p>

However, the Commonwealth asserts that McNeil’s Petition for Reassessment operated as a challenge only to the specific use tax deficiencies uncovered by the auditor. The Commonwealth maintains that McNeil had to file a separate refund petition for a credit of sales tax it paid to vendors in order to be entitled to a credit for “taxes, interest and penalties paid to the Commonwealth ... to which the Commonwealth is not rightfully entitled.” 72 P.S. § 7252. Because McNeil failed to file a refund petition within three years of the non-taxable purchases on which it allegedly paid tax to vendors, the Commonwealth contends that McNeil is not entitled to use those overpayments to reduce its deficiency as determined by the audit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> McNeil counters that it did not file a Petition for Refund because the auditor told it that the audit would grant it a credit for the amount of overpayments made during the audit period.</p>

Jur.2d § 7.2, pages 7-6 to 7-7 (updated 12-1998).

The parties stipulated that McNeil was subject to a “sales and use tax (tax) audit” and that the auditor assigned to McNeil informed a representative of the taxpayer that “any tax paid on non-taxable purchases during the audit period would reduce any amount of tax determined by the auditor to be due for the audit period.” (R.R. at 2, Stipulation of Facts Nos. 8 and 5) (emphasis added). The clear inclination of the taxing scheme and the principles of equality in taxation articulated in <em>Henneford </em>are to ensure that each purchase at retail for which the taxpayer is not exempt from paying tax should result in the payment of the appropriate percentage of tax (either six percent or seven percent, depending upon geography) once.</p>

The taxing statute makes a distinction between the payment of sales tax and the payment of use tax because the taxes are paid to different entities, but the result is the same whether the purchaser or the vendor ultimately remits the tax to the Commonwealth.

Section 231(b) of the Code, quoted above, provides that, where the Department finds that the tax return of a taxpayer “understate^] the amount of tax due, it shall determine the proper amount” of tax due and assess a deficiency accordingly. 72 P.S. § 7231(b) (emphasis added). The language of Section 231(b) speaks to the propriety of an audit where the Department uncovers an understatement of <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>tax due on a tax return. We refer to the following example to clarify the dispute <em>sub judice. </em>Assume that A has paid $600 in taxes for purchases made during year 1. The Department finds that A has not paid enough tax for year 1, so it conducts an audit of all of A’s purchases for that year. The Department ultimately determines that A should have paid taxes totaling $3,000 on purchases for which it has not paid tax, but that A owed only $200 in taxes for the purchases made for which A paid tax. The Department wants to assess a deficiency of $3,000 and require A to seek a timely refund for the $400 in overpayments; A contends that it should have paid $3,200, but paid only $600, so it owes $2,600.

The Commonwealth sought to offset those overpayments with a deficiency that it uncovered that had occurred outside of the eighteen-month refund period, but within the three-year period for the Department to conduct an audit. The taxpayer then sought to offset that deficiency by the amount of overpayments it made outside of the eighteen-month refund period but within the three-year audit period.

      <em>Sperry Rand </em>stands for the proposition that a taxpayer does not have to file a timely refund request for overpayments that occurred during an audit period. Rather, when conducting an audit, the Department has the responsibility to determine the “proper amount” of tax due for the entire period, which includes uncovering both underpayments and overpayments. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court erred in determining that McNeil’s failure to petition for a refund of overpayments pursuant to Section 252 of the Code, 72 P.S. § 7252, barred its assessment from being reduced by the amount of its overpayment to the Department.</p>
