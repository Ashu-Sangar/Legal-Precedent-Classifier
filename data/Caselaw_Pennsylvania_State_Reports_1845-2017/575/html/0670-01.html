One of the seminal cases was <em>In re Supervisors of Milford Township, Somerset County, </em><a href="/pa/291/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="291 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="1107315" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0046-01">291 Pa. 46</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20623" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="139 A. 623">139 A. 623</a> (1927), which involved a petition to the court of quarter sessions to have certain township supervisors’ offices declared vacant due to alleged dereliction of duty by the office holders. The petitioners sought removal pursuant to section 192 of the General Township Act of July 14,1917, P.L. 840, § 192 (a predecessor to the removal provision at issue, 53 P.S. § 65503). This court construed the statute as creating the office of township supervisor with a “conditional” six-year term of office, the condition being that the supervisor could not refuse or neglect to perform his duties. We determined that the authority to <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>make the term of office a conditional one was implied in a constitutional provision (former Art. XII, § 1, presently Art. VI, § 1), which indicated that officers who were not provided for in the constitution “shall be elected or appointed as may be directed by law”. Recognizing that when a term of office was subject to the legislature’s control, it could abolish the office and oust officers during their term, we reasoned that an act providing for removal following a judicial determination of a breach of the constitutional “condition that they behave themselves well while in office” (Art. VI, § 4) should also be permissible. We thus concluded that Article VI, § 4 (present Art. VI, § 7)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> did not apply “where the Legislature, having the right to fix the length of a term of office, has made it determinable by judicial proceedings, on other contingencies other than the mere passage of time.” <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20623" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="139 A. 623">139 A. at 625</a>. Accordingly, we held that the statutory removal provision was constitutionally permissible.</p>

Instead, we reasoned that Article VI, § 7 applied “to <em>all elected </em>officers” (emphasis in original).

    <p id="b819-5" data-blocks='[["BL_819.6",819,[215,1601,1154,514]],["BL_820.1",820,[261,314,1156,256]]]'>Appellants advance several arguments as to why <em>Reese </em>is not controlling. Appellants contend that <em>Reese </em>is distinguishable since it involved the recall provisions in the Kingston Home Rule Charter, which did not provide for due process in the removal of municipal officers. Appellants argue that Section 503 was enacted to complement then-Article VI, § 4 (now Art. VI, § 7), to afford a township supervisor the same due process rights afforded to all civil officers under Article VI, § 7.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellants point out that Section 503 provides more due process rights that a township supervisor would be enti<a id="p676" href="#p676" data-label="676" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*676</a>tied to under Article VI, § 7. We do not agree with Appellants’ focus. The level of due process afforded to a civil officer under the statute or the statute’s purpose is not the pertinent concern. The issue is whether the provisions of Section 503 conflict with the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b820-4" data-blocks='[["BL_820.6",820,[259,604,1156,362]]]'>Appellants further maintain that Article VI, § 7 does not grant township officers a constitutional right to only be removed by the Governor and Senate; rather, the only right afforded is a right to due process before removal. Again, we cannot agree. Article VI, § 7 confirms both that officers are entitled to “due notice and full hearing”, and sets forth the permissible process of removing such officers.</p>
    <p id="b820-5" data-blocks='[["BL_820.7",820,[257,1000,1160,793]]]'>Appellants next claim that the General Assembly has not indicated its interest in repealing Section 503. Appellants note that twenty-three days after this court’s decision in <em>Reese </em>(holding that Art. VI, § 7 provided the exclusive method of removing elected officers), the General Assembly deleted and reenacted several provisions of the Second Class Township Code; Section 503 was not deleted, but was reenacted and amended. Nor did the Legislature repeal Section 503 when Article VI, § 4 was amended and renumbered as Article VI, § 7. Even assuming that the General Assembly wanted to provide for an alternative means to remove township supervisors, those alternative means cannot conflict with the provisions of Article VI, § 7. The General Assembly’s failure to repeal an unconstitutional statute does not make that statute constitutionally permissible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

      <a id="p677" href="#p677" data-label="677" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*677</a>Appellants further assert that the General Assembly, having created the office of township supervisor (53 P.S. § 65601), may also provide for the manner in which that officer is to be removed. Yet this rationale, which was adopted in <em>Milford Township, </em>was rejected by the later decision in <em>Reese.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b821-4" data-blocks='[["BL_821.6",821,[205,610,1152,851]]]'> Finally, Appellants argue that public policy supports a finding of constitutionality. They contend that a contrary result will allow township electors to burden the Governor and Senate with affairs that are not of statewide importance, which would waste government resources. Moreover, they assert that deeming Section 503 to be unconstitutional will leave township electors without a remedy — apart from the four-year election cycle — because Article VI, § 7 is impractical, does not provide an unambiguous procedure for removing civil officers, and essentially is not accessible to township electors. We disagree. The fact that Article VI, § 7 does not explicitly spell out the manner in which Article VI, § 7 is to be invoked does not make the method of removal unclear. Moreover, even if we agreed that the constitutional removal method is not as practical as the one provided for in Section 503, we cannot disregard a controlling constitutional provision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The causes of removal for township supervisors as well as the methods that existed before the passage of the 1874 Constitution differed from those that existed after its passage. For example, with regard to the causes of removal, under Section 503, removal is permitted if the supervisor “fails to perform the duties of the office”. However, the pre-1874 constitutional statutes did not <a id="p680" href="#p680" data-label="680" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*680</a>allow for removal for such neglect of duties. Under the 1834 Act, for example, the penalty for neglect of duty was payment of a sum — not removal. The 1860 Act did permit removal of the township supervisor, but only upon the officer’s refusal to give a required security — not for neglecting the duties of the office.

In <em>Rizzo, </em>a plurality of the court determined that the recall provisions of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter were unconstitutional. In the lead opinion, then-Chief Justice Jones endorsed the view from <em>Milford Township </em>that Article VI, § 1 implied a power for the legislature to establish methods of removal for officers whose selection was not provided for in the Pennsylvania Constitution. However, he further reasoned that those methods of removal were limited by the requirement of Article VI, § 7 that all such officers only be removed for cause, demonstrated after notice and a hearing were afforded. <em>Id. </em>at 245-47. This reasoning was not joined by a majority of the Justices.</p>
