Then appellant, with his hand in his back pocket, approached Bolton. Appellant’s gun accidentally discharged, and he immediately pulled it out and began firing at Bolton.

It is the specific intent to kill that distinguishes first degree murder from lesser grades of murder. <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em><a href="/pa/548/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="548 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="960583" data-case-paths="/pa/548/0065-01">548 Pa. 65</a>, <a href="/a2d/694/1086-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="694 A.2d 1086" data-case-ids="11989191,11989370,960541,960583" data-case-paths="/a2d/694/1086-01,/a2d/694/1086-02,/pa/548/0064-01,/pa/548/0065-01">694 A.2d 1086</a>, 1088 (1997).

It is not necessary, however, that he be retried on the issue of guilt. <em>See, e.g., Turner v. Murray, </em><a href="/us/476/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="476 U.S. 28" data-case-ids="12414" data-case-paths="/us/476/0028-01">476 U.S. 28</a>, 37, <a href="/us/476/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="476 U.S. 28" data-case-ids="12414" data-case-paths="/us/476/0028-01">106 S.Ct. 1683</a>, <a href="/us/476/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="476 U.S. 28" data-case-ids="12414" data-case-paths="/us/476/0028-01">90 L.Ed.2d 27</a> (1986) (death sentence vacated but conviction upheld after trial court erroneously refused to permit questioning of prospective jurors on racial bias). The error in this case was the undue restriction of appellant’s ability to question venirepersons to uncover those who might harbor fixed opinions concerning imposition of the death penalty. The risk of such a venireperson serving on a petit jury is that the jury would be biased toward imposing a death sentence. In other words, the jury’s sentencing discretion could be improperly swayed in favor of a death sentence <em>once the jury found the defendant guilty. </em>For such a juror to taint the guilt phase, one would have to assume a juror with a predilection for death sentences would be more likely than other jurors to wrongly convict an <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>innocent defendant in order to indulge that predilection. We find this tenuous assumption an insufficient reason to overturn the jury’s assessment of appellant’s guilt. Accordingly, we vacate appellant’s death sentence and remand for a new penalty hearing only.</p>

Appellant does not assert, and there is nothing in the record to suggest, he was in any way prejudiced by the court’s decision to complete <em>voir dire </em>that day. If the jury harbored any animosity toward appellant for the lengthy <em>voir dire </em>process, the trial court’s instruction to the jury on the first day of trial was sufficient to redirect it: the court informed the jury it was the court’s decision, not trial counsel’s, to extend jury selection until its completion the prior evening. The court did not abuse its discretion; accordingly, appellant’s claim fails.</p>
