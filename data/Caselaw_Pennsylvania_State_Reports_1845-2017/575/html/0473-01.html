As noted in Judge Klein’s concurrence in the Superior Court’s decision in this case, the denial of goal changes which are in the best interest of the child should not be sheltered, permanently, from independent review: “[As a practical matter], these petitions go to the same trial judge. If a trial judge erroneously denies these motions and improperly maintains the <em>status quo, </em>and keeps doing that on periodic review, such an improper order will <em>never </em>be subject to appellate review.” <em>In the Interest of HSWC-B and SEC-B, </em>Nos. 1965 &amp; 2024 MDA 2001, <a href="/citations/?q=806%20A.2d%20471" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="806 A.2d 471">806 A.2d 471</a>, unpublished memorandum at 2 (Pa.Super. filed June 28, 2002) (Klein, J., concurring).

The only matters before the trial court were those raised by the petition of Appellant, York County Children and Youth Services. The trial court’s order here at issue resolved those matters adversely to Appellant, thereby disposing of all claims and parties. Since Appellant’s requests for relief were denied, the order had the effect of maintaining the status quo but this is the usual circumstance when all requests for relief are denied. The finality of an order does not turn on whether the moving party has prevailed. It turns on whether further proceedings remain prior to disposition of the claims and, here, none remained. The order was final.</p>
