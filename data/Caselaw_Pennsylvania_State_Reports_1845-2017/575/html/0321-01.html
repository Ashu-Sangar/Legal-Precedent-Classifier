Appellees Louis and Mary Ellen Theodore, whose two daughters were subject to the policy, filed a complaint seeking to enjoin the testing policy on grounds that, <em>inter alia, </em>it violated their daughters’ right to privacy under <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The primary question in this appeal is whether, for purposes of the preliminary objections subsequently filed by the School District, the policy must be deemed constitutional as a matter of law. Because we reject the District’s argument that the policy is constitutional as a matter of law, we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court which reinstated the complaint and permitted the case to go forward.</p>

Apart from psychological effects, which include impairment of judgment, slowing of reaction time, and a lessening of the perception of pain, alcohol and the particular drugs screened by this policy pose substantial physical risks to athletes and drivers. Extracurricular participants, whether athletes or not, are student leaders and, as such, serve as role models for their peers and for young children as well. The use of drugs and alcohol by these role models exacerbates the problem of illegal substances in our schools.</blockquote>

Moreover, at least at this stage of the proceeding, it appears that certain students non-athlete, non-driving extracurricular participants deemed, by that status, to be “student leaders”) were targeted for symbolic reasons, since they were deemed to be “role models.”</p>

The samples cannot be used to test for any medical condition other than the presence of a specific list of intoxicants. Students may not refuse to submit to a test without penalty, for any such refusal (or any alteration of a test sample) is considered the equivalent of a positive test result. Policy 227 defines a positive test result as one that reflects either a blood alcohol content (BAC) level of at least .02 percent or the presence of any level of a controlled substance. The School District bears all costs associated with the testing.</p>

Random testing is unannounced and occurs throughout the school year. The selection of students for random testing is accomplished “by a scientifically valid method,” and each student has an equal chance of being selected with each random sampling. When the sponsor of an extracurricular activity or another authorized adult has reasonable individualized suspicion that an extracurricular student or student with parking privileges has used alcohol or an enumerated controlled substance, the District conducts reasonable suspicion-based testing. Before a student who tests positive for any banned substance may resume extracurricular activity or parking privileges, he or she must undergo retumto-activity testing. Follow-up testing, which proceeds unannounced, is implicated when a covered student needs assistance in resolving problems associated with drug or alcohol use as determined by a substance abuse professional.</p>

The student and the student’s parents are provided an opportunity to address a positive result. If no alternative explanation exists, the positive result is reported to the school’s athletic director and principal. Within three days of that report, the student or parents may request a retest of the sample.</p>

A student who tests positive for the first time must also participate in a drug assistance program, must submit to weekly testing for six weeks, and is suspended from athletics, club events, and performances and/or parking privileges for a period of time. The suspension extends to one calendar year upon a second positive test, and to all remaining school years upon a third.

Both girls were required to provide urine samples: Kimberly on August 27, 1998, and Jennifer on or about November 4, 1998. Both tests returned negative for any banned substance. In January, 1999, the students’ parents, Louis and Mary Ellen Theodore (appellees), filed suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Pike County, both individually and as their daughters’ natural guardians, seeking to enjoin the School District from continuing to test students. In their amended complaint, appellees contended that their daughters had been forced to submit urine samples against their wills and asserted that Policy 227 deprives students of their right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as guaran<a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>teed by Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Appellees also alleged that the policy violated their parental rights because test results are disclosed to others and the mandatory counseling contemplated by the policy, upon a test returning positive, invades their fundamental right to make decisions involving their children’s health care.</p>

In its accompanying brief, the District included a brief argument under the ripeness objection, apparently responding to the merits of appellees’ Article I, Section 8 claim and asserting therein that the Commonwealth and the District have a compelling interest to see that public school students not use drugs and that this interest outweighed the privacy rights of the students and appellees.</p>

With respect to the Article I, Section 8 question, appellees argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that resolution of the claim on the merits would depend upon whether the District could make a particularized showing of a special need for random, suspicionless testing of the targeted students. Appellees noted that the District had not even attempted to justify its program by proving the existence of an actual drug crisis in the District, much less within the targeted class of students. Appellees argued that, at a minimum, the issue of special need could not be resolved absent discovery and, accordingly, the District’s preliminary objections were premature. Appellees argued in the alternative that, under the heightened protections of Article I, Section 8, even a showing of special need should not be <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>viewed as justifying the sort of random, suspicionless searches conducted under Policy 227.</p>

The District also adverted to recent “publicity surrounding the drug problem in Delaware Valley.” In support of that assertion, the District attached and cited to a February 24, 1998 local newspaper article reporting a single arrest of a student at Delaware Valley High School for delivering a $3 packet of heroin to another student at the school. According to the article, the Westfall Township Police Chief had “confirmed ... that the arrest was the first ever involving heroin at the 1,150 student high school,” but that the school “averages three or four drug-related arrests each school year, usually for marijuana.” The article did not address whether either of the students involved in the heroin sale was involved in extracurricular activities or had parking privileges.</p>

In addition, Judge Friedman believed that the policy did not provide sufficient notice of what criteria must be present before a search is performed and the manner in which the search is conducted, and questioned the proposition that students could be deemed to be subjecting themselves to the tests voluntarily, since extracurricular activities play such an integral role in the life of the modern student. The concurrence agreed with the plurality on the key point that the District had failed to demonstrate any special need to search only those pupils involved in extracurricular activities or seeking parking privileges. Because the students might prevail on that claim, Judge Friedman concurred in its reinstatement. Finally, Judge Friedman agreed that appellees’ parental claims were properly dismissed as their daughters’ tests were negative; hence, any controversy relating to parental rights was unripe. <em><a href="/a2d/761/0652-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="761 A.2d 652" data-case-ids="11156745" data-case-paths="/a2d/761/0652-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/761/0652-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="761 A.2d 652" data-case-ids="11156745" data-case-paths="/a2d/761/0652-01">at 662-67</a> (Friedman, J., concurring).</p>

In ultimately approving the drug-<a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>testing policy, the Court emphasized that: public school students have a lower expectation of privacy than citizens generally; student-athletes’ expectations of privacy are necessarily lower still, given pre-season physical examinations and the communal undress inherent in the locker rooms; the search was relatively unobtrusive; the district had a demonstrated need to address the well-documented drug crisis extant in the school; the district had an interest in deterring drug use among students generally and student athletes in particular, because of the increased risk of physical injury attendant upon the mixture of drugs and athletics; the governmental concern was important and immediate; and this program was an efficacious way to address the demonstrated problem because it was aimed directly at the student-athletes who were a major part of that problem.

Rather, the Court deemed it appropriate under the three-factor <em>Vernonia </em>test simply to weigh the intrusion upon the children’s Fourth Amendment rights against the promotion of a legitimate governmental interest. <em>Earls, </em><a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">536 U.S. at 830</a>, <a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">122 S.Ct. at 2565</a>. Concerning the students’ privacy interests, the Court perceived no controlling distinction between athletic and non-athletic activities, thus concluding that all participants in extracurricular activities had a diminished expectation of privacy. <em>See <a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">id. </a></em><a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">at 831-32</a>, <a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">122 S.Ct. at 2565-66</a>. As for the second <em>Vernonia </em>factor, the Court recognized that the intrusion upon privacy was twofold: the intrusion created by the collection of urine samples, and that resulting from disclosure of the test results. The Court dismissed the first component of the intrusion as trivial, noting that the collection method was essentially the same as that in <em>Vernonia. <a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">at 833</a>, <a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">122 S.Ct. at 2566</a>. As to the second component, the Court noted that the test results are only released to those with a “need to know,” are used only to regulate participation in school activities, and are not forwarded to law enforcement authorities, which rendered “the invasion of the students’ privacy ... not significant.” <em><a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">at 834</a>, <a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">122 S.Ct. at 2567</a>. Turning to the final <em>Vernonia </em>factor, the Court apparently removed any inquiry into the actual efficacy of the program from the Fourth Amendment analysis employed in <em>Vernonia, </em>instead stating categorically that testing extracurricular participants is an effective means of achieving the goal of deterring student drug use generally. <em><a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">at 837-38</a>, <a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">122 S.Ct. at 2569</a>.

      <em>In re F.B. </em>considered a search of all students entering a public high school for weapons. All students were required to pass through a stationary metal detector with the potential for a follow-up scan of their bodies with a hand-held metal detector. In addition, the students’ book bags, purses and coats were physically inspected, and each student was required to empty his or her pockets for examination. Looking to the students’ privacy interest, we found that “the search of a person always involves a greater degree of intrusion upon one’s privacy interest than the search of a thing.” <em><a href="/us/536/0822-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="536 U.S. 822" data-case-ids="1254855" data-case-paths="/us/536/0822-01">Id.</a> </em>(citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Turning to the nature of the intrusion, we found the intrusion to be minimal given that the search was non-invasive; indeed, it was no different from the intrusion experienced by air travelers and those seeking to enter government buildings, where metal detectors, hand-held scanners and x-ray machines are routinely employed. The third factor, notice, weighed in favor of upholding the search, because the school’s policy manual contained information regarding point-of-entry weap<a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>ons searches and notices were routinely mailed to students’ homes and were posted prominently in the school building. As to the fourth factor, this Court noted that the need to ban weapons entirely from the school environment is “obvious” and there was no “logical argument” in opposition to such a policy. This was so much so that we held that the absence of a record concerning the purpose or immediate reasons for the challenged search was not fatal to its validity. As the reasons supporting the search comported with the school’s core duty to keep students safe, the school was “not required to wait for a tragedy to occur within [its] walls to demonstrate that the need is immediate.” <a href="/a2d/726/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="726 A.2d 361" data-case-ids="11589268,1701910" data-case-paths="/a2d/726/0361-01,/pa/555/0661-01">726 A.2d at 366-67</a>.</p>

While students’ <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>privacy expectations are lessened by virtue of their presence at school, students may reasonably anticipate that the privacy associated with their excretory functions will be diminished at school only modestly via the need to use public restrooms.

This case thus stands in stark contrast to <em>Vemonia. </em>Policy 227 was not adopted by a school district at its “wit’s end” as a last-ditch effort to address a pervasive and disruptive “drug culture” which other, lesser measures had failed to eradicate.

Moreover, the District does not claim that the particular students selected for these random intrusions were likely to be drug users, much less that they were the leaders of a scholastic “drug culture.” In addition, while the policy targeted some students who were involved in activities where drug or alcohol use presents an inherent danger <em>(e.g., </em>student athletes and drivers), it included others involved in activities where no such inherent physical danger exists <em>(e.g., </em>other extracurricular programs in which Jennifer Lynn Theodore participated, such as the National Honor Society, Science Olympiad and Scholastic Bowl). Finally, Policy 227 entirely ignored another segment of the school population which was probably more likely to be involved with drugs, <em>i.e., </em>student slackers who chose to be completely uninvolved in any extracurricular activities whatsoever.

The program in <em>Joye, </em>like the program in <em>Vemonia, </em>was adopted in response to a documented drug problem within the high school.

The program was adopted as a result of a “meticulous two-year process” which included appointing a community task force, which was comprised of student representatives, parents, the booster club, school counselors, school administration, teachers, coaches, and drug testing experts. The task force evaluated the existing substance-abuse programs at the school (including an existing suspicion-based drug-testing program as well as program which randomly tested student athletes for drugs); collected information on reported day-to-day drug and alcohol problems among students in the school; and solicited public input by writing to parents and holding a public meeting. It was this task force which initially recommended expanding the existing random drug-testing policy from student-athletes to include students holding parking permits and students engaged in other extracurricular activities. Even then, the school district did not simply adopt such a policy but, instead, it held further public hearings and attempted to gauge then-existing drug use among the high school’s students by conducting a follow-up survey and consulting again with other school personnel about the persistence of the problem. The school district determined that drug use had declined, in part, due to the very success of the random drug testing of student athletes (thus suggesting the efficacy of that program), but that it was still unacceptably high. It was only then that the school district adopted and implemented the recommendation of the task force. <em>Id, </em>at 627-30.
