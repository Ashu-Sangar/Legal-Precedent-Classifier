Granted, society as a whole may receive a collateral benefit when landlocked property may be accessed by motorized vehicles, and thus presumably be put to its highest economic use; yet, it cannot seriously be contended that the general population is the primary beneficiary of the opening of a road that is limited to the use of the person who petitioned for it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Thus, as the opening of a private road pursuant to the <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>Act does not accomplish a public purpose, it cannot be seen as the exercise of the power of eminent domain.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> As such, the opening of a private road pursuant to the Act in an ASA did not require the prior approval of ALCAB.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Importantly, the Legislature enacted the 1735 statute, which authorizes the laying out of roads at the request of private individuals to create access to public highways, to address “the great increase of our inhabitants [that] has been found to be very inconvenient and burdensome as well to the public as to private persons.” Act of February 20, 1735, Statutes at Large, p. 296. (Emphasis supplied). This language further reinforces my conclusion that the statutory scheme that allows for the creation of “private roads” is historically intertwined with the interests the public derives from the existence of such roads.</p>

The Majority chooses not to address my reasoning, because "the constitutionality of the [PRA] is not before this [C]ourt.” MO, p. 106, n. 4. I note, however, that the invalidation of the PRA is the natural result of the analysis advanced by the Majority. Respectfully, while I agree that this Court should not address issues that were not raised by the parties (particularly issues of constitutional dimension), I 1'eel compelled to comment on what, I maintain, will be the fallout from the disposition of this matter and its supporting rationale.</p>
