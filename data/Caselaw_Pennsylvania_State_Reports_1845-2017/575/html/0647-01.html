Two years later, Mother left Husband, taking their three children, including Tenaya. On February 27, 1987, Mother sought child support from Husband for all three children. On March 30, 1987, although an Order for support was entered for the two other children, there was no disposition made as to Tenaya. Mother filed a Complaint for Support against Robert M.

The only evidence of record regarding these five years is an Order issued March 29, 1995 by Judge Woelfel of the Snyder County trial court, stating that Snyder County relinquished responsibility for collection and disbursement of support payments and that Union County would be responsible for their distribution and disbursement. RR at 2. This Order was docketed at 109-1988, the same number used for Mother’s First Complaint against Ely (this docket number was subsequently changed to 88-9138 when it was certified to Union County). Ely filed Preliminary Objections raising the defenses of laches and estoppel. In his Brief in Support of Preliminary Objections, Ely argued that the presumption of paternity of Husband, who had not yet taken a paternity test, had not been overcome. Ely did not admit paternity, as he had won his appeal regarding the Order that he undergo genetic testing. Prior to the disposition of Preliminary Objections, on February 3, 1998, Mother executed a Petition to Withdraw and Terminate Action in Support, stating as her reason: “the first complaint is STILL OPEN i.e. NO NEED FOR TWO!” RR at 15. (emphasis in original). On February 18, 1998, the trial court issued an Order dismissing this Complaint for Support. Mother did not explain why she did not move forward on her first Complaint. However, the chronology of the case shows that although she was litigating against Husband and Ely since 1987 and 1988, respectively, it took until 1998 to obtain a determination that Husband was not the father and until 2000 to get Ely to acknowledge paternity. It appears that Mother did not pursue what she filed very vigorously, and when she did move forward, Ely resisted and dragged it out.</p>

Following a hearing on June 10, 1999, the trial court found that the presumption of paternity was overcome and ordered the parties to appear for genetic testing. The testing showed that Husband was not the biological father <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>of Tenaya. As a result, the court dismissed the support action against him. Although it seems perplexing that the trial judge found the presumption of paternity was overcome before ordering genetic testing, the fact that Mother had filed previous support Complaints against Ely may well have lead the trial court to make a rational assumption that Husband’s paternity was in question. The record does not include the June 10, 1999 hearing transcript, which lead to the trial court’s Order for genetic testing.</p>
    <p id="b797-5" data-blocks='[["BL_797.5",797,[201,811,1152,571]]]'>On September 21, 1999, Mother filed a third Complaint for Support against Ely, which was docketed at 137-1997, even though the Complaint originally filed at that number had been withdrawn. Ely filed Preliminary Objections, asserting estoppel and laches, which the trial court denied on February 9, 2000. It issued an Order to appear for genetic testing and scheduled a bench trial to establish paternity. On September 22, 2000, Ely executed an Acknowledgement of Paternity/Waiver of Trial. The genetic testing was conducted on July 10, 2000 and resulted in a 99.91% probability of paternity for Ely. RR at 33A.</p>
    <p id="b797-6" data-blocks='[["BL_797.6",797,[198,1408,1152,679]]]'>As a result of the genetic testing, Ely no longer denied paternity, and the parties proceeded to a support conference. The trial court issued a Temporary Order on September 22, 2000, which imposed on Ely a monthly obligation of $562.45 on behalf of Tenaya. The parties were unable to agree on the effective date of the support Order and, hence, the amount of the arrearages. Ely argued that the effective date should be September 21, 1999, the date when the third Complaint was filed against him, since it was this Complaint to which he stipulated paternity. Mother argued that the effective date should be July 8, 1988, when she filed her first Complaint for Support against Ely. Mother then filed a Motion to Determine Arrearages on October 19, 2000.</p>

No one sought to remove the 1988 Complaint, and the trial and Superior Court found that it remains open. Therefore, the courts determined that arrearages begin from 1988, since the Complaint is still open. As a result, the court found that “the equities lie with Tenaya and not Mr. Ely.” Trial Court Opinion dated December 21, 2000 at 5. Pursuant to its Opinion, the court issued an Order on December 27, 2000, establishing that the effective date of Ely’s support obligation was July 8,1988.</p>

Mother contends it is July 8, 1988, the date when she filed her first Complaint against him. Ely no longer objects to his duty to support Tenaya; rather, he argues that his obligation should accrue from September 21, 1999, the date when Mother filed her third Complaint against him, which resulted in his admitting paternity.

Mother did not move to terminate or discontinue the action — indeed, she specifically withdrew her 1997 Complaint because the 1988 Complaint was still open and there was no need for two. Ely did not undertake to terminate the 1988 Complaint, by filing an action for judgment of non pros. The trial court correctly found that the 1988 action “was neither discontinued nor terminated.

While Ely argues that equity must prevent an outcome requiring him to pay $87,000 to Tenaya, and that, impliedly, such a large amount of money is “confiscatory” or “punitive,” our view comports with that of the trial court, as affirmed by the Superior Court. The 1988 Complaint was not terminated, the support rules mandate retroactivity to the date of filing, and parents owe a duty of support to their children that accrues at birth.

There are no currently relevant proceedings pursuant to the 1988 complaint; indeed, there have been none since the trial court ordered, unsuccessfully, the “final processing” of this stagnant matter. The rule of retroactivity makes support presumptively applicable from the filing the complaint <em>which results in the order, </em>which is 1999; it should not be retroactive to the filing of a complaint abandoned long ago.</p>

The filing of subsequent complaints did not resuscitate the 1988 complaint, nor were any of them an amendment of the last; amendments require consent or court approval, and appellee had neither. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1033. Even if they were amendments, they would replace, not revive, the first complaint; either way, their filing took the 1988 complaint off the table. <em>See, e.g., Skelton v.

These filings did not incorporate the 1988 complaint by reference, and it must be deemed withdrawn.

Appellant was not the moving party; there was no obligation on his part to pursue anything.

He is very likely incapable of accomplishing this while the child will be a minor. Retroactivity for 11 more years will not increase his monthly obligation from this order, which is already at the maximum; what it will do is extend by many years the time he will need to pay the accumulated arrears. Arrears of $87,000 will not benefit this child-it will only benefit the litigationally lethargic appellee to whom the money will flow after the child is gone from her care.
