Appellee claimed he awoke just before the van collided with the rear end of a Saturn sedan driven by Charles P. Bayly. The front left section of the van struck the right rear portion of the Saturn, after which the van veered sharply to the right, crossed the right travel lane, and went onto the right shoulder of the road where it hit an embankment. The van rode up the embankment, flipped, and came to rest on its passenger side, half on the right shoulder of the highway, and half on the right lane of travel. At the time of the collision, Mr. Bayly’s Saturn was in the left lane of travel, traveling at approximately sixty to sixty-five miles per hour (m.p.h.). Mr. Bayly testified that he did not see appellee’s van until the collision.</p>

All but one of the minors was under the age of twelve. Two of the children were killed in the crash and numerous others were taken to various hospitals with injuries. Because the van had only fifteen passenger seats, some of the twenty-three passengers were crowded into seats while others were seated on the floor. A subsequent investigation by an accident reconstruction expert revealed that, at the time of the collision, none of the passengers was restrained by a seatbelt and appellee’s approximate speed was at least seventy-eight m.p.h., well in excess of the posted speed limit of fifty-five m.p.h.</p>

Rather, appellee did so while driving a van full of children — indeed, a van severely overloaded with children, at least some of whom were not seated in the van’s seats, much less protected by safety restraints. The risks attending that initial reckless decision, the Commonwealth submits, should have counseled “strict compliance” with the traffic laws and yet appellee “compounded his initial recklessness” by intentionally driving at an excessive rate of speed directly before he fell asleep. The Commonwealth further argues that the Superior Court erred by failing to consider the totality of the circumstances in assessing appellee’s mental state.

Citing to cases involving charges of aggravated assault or murder, appellee also suggests that involuntary manslaughter requires a showing of “a much higher degree of culpability than merely reckless behavior.” Appellee articulates this heightened requirement in various ways: “a sustained purposeful recklessness,” or “knowingly tak[ing] a gamble that an accident is likely to happen.” Ap<a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>pellee does not respond to the argument of the Commonwealth, and the suggestion by Judge Lally-Green below, that a showing of a level of conduct less than recklessness may suffice, given the statute’s reference to gross negligence.</p>

The negligence required to merit criminal sanctions under Section 302 is certainly a heightened deviation from the standard of care applicable when civil tort liability is at issue, and it may indeed be convenient to refer to this heightened level of conduct as “criminal negligence,” even though the Code does not employ that terminology. However, the fact that criminal negligence differs from tort negligence does not mean that the negligence defined in Section 302 of the Code is the equivalent of the “gross negligence” contemplated in Section 2504. If the General Assembly had intended for Section 302 negligence to be sufficient to establish the <em>mens reas </em>necessary for involuntary manslaughter, it need not have added the modifier “gross.” Given the principle of statutory construction requiring that we view the language of a statute in such a way as to give effect to all of its terms, <em>see </em>

And, as the Superior Court majority below properly noted, this Court has construed the terms “reckless” and “grossly negligent” as defining the equivalent state of mind for purposes of the involuntary manslaughter provision. <em>See Commonwealth v.

There are sound reasons for this conclusion. First, the General Assembly did not separately define the concept of gross negligence either in the involuntary manslaughter statute itself or in the default provisions of the Crimes Code setting forth general requirements of culpability. If we were to recognize the theoretical distinction posed, there would be no statutory guidance as to the contours of this additional basis for the imposition of criminal liability. Given the requirement that penal statutes be strictly construed, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1); <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[272,1088,1160,584]]]'>We likewise reject appellee’s suggestion that some heightened form of recklessness is required for the Commonwealth to prove involuntary manslaughter. The plain language of Section 2504 suggests no such heightened requirement. Moreover, as the reasoning in <em>Comer </em>teaches, the General Assembly is perfectly capable of drafting a statute, such as the aggravated assault statute, which requires a showing of more than mere recklessness, when such is its intent. It did not do so in defining involuntary manslaughter. Appellee’s citations to various cases involving aggravated assault or third degree murder, therefore, are inapposite.</p>

The question for review becomes whether the Commonwealth produced <em>prima facie </em>evidence that, in operating the van in the circumstances that preceded the collision that resulted in the death of the two children, appellee disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the direct result of his behavior would be the death of one or more of his passengers or another person on the highway.

Driving is a correspondingly heavily regulated privilege, both as to licensure and the rules of the road, the regulation being a necessary concomitant of the dangers to self and others inherent in driving. The danger increases with the speed at which a vehicle is operated, since speed both reduces reaction times and heightens the consequences of any collision. The danger also may increase if other safety measures are ignored — whether those measures involve vehicle maintenance, internal safety features such as seating capacity or restraints, or the rules of the road. No driver can get behind the wheel without an acute awareness of the “responsible post of duty,” <em>Bernosky, </em><a href="/citations/?q=38%20A.2d%2035" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="38 A.2d 35">38 A.2d at 36</a>, he is assuming.</p>

A momentary lapse leaves the driver unprepared for the unexpected or extraordinary. A loss of consciousness, on the other hand, leaves one totally unprepared even for the ordinary requirements for safe driving. Drivers have an unflagging duty either to remain vigilant and awake or to immediately desist from driving. It is therefore not surprising that this Court, like many other courts, has deemed the act of falling asleep at the wheel alone to be enough to raise a jury question of negligence in the tort arena. <em>See Bernosky, </em><a href="/citations/?q=38%20A.2d%2035" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="38 A.2d 35">38 A.2d at 36</a>.</p>

Of course, appellee is in the best and perhaps only position to know if the common signs of fatigue and impending sleep came upon him, which he ignored; the Commonwealth was not required to obtain a confession from appellee in order to make out its <em>prima facie </em>case. Rather, the Commonwealth could rely upon the fact that it is common knowledge that sleep is preceded by some internal warning. As Chief Justice Maxey noted in <em>Bemosky:</em>

Human affairs would be in a precarious state if locomotive engineers, aviators, chauffeurs, motormen and others in charge of machinery in motion were liable to “fall asleep” at any time without first becoming consciously aware of sleep’s approach and taking immediate steps to bring to a stop the mechanism under their control or placing it in the hands of one who is completely awake and alert. The Creator wisely provided that sleep does not come upon human beings unannounced. Therefore when a driver of an automobile falls asleep while driving, it is a legitimate inference that he was negligent either (1) in permitting himself to fall asleep while at such a responsible post of duty, or (2) if he possessed no such will power as would enable him to keep awake under the circumstances in not ceasing to drive the vehicle.</blockquote>

Or perhaps appellee will claim that in this one instance no warning signs came in advance of his sleeping at the wheel. Such is a matter for defense, however; and the Commonwealth was entitled to rely upon “the facts of life” recognized by this Court in <em>Bernosky </em>in proving its <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>

However, such conduct also is probative of recklessness. Since we have concluded that it is fair to infer that, in falling asleep, appellee ignored the warning signs of sleep, the very fact that appellee fell asleep is evidence of a conscious decision to run that risk, with the concomitant risk of injury or death attending it, given his specific situation. As Judge Lally-Green persuasively reasoned below: “by continuing to drive after receiving the warning signs of sleep, a person does indeed consciously disregard a substantial risk of death on our highways.” <em>Huggins, </em><a href="/a2d/790/1042-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="790 A.2d 1042" data-case-ids="9395953" data-case-paths="/a2d/790/1042-01">790 A.2d at 1052</a> (Lally-Green, J., concurring and dissenting).

Appellee allowed himself to fall asleep despite the fact that he was driving a van filled with children. The presence of these children would have led a prudent person to be extra-cautious; far from acting cautiously, however, appellee’s van was filled to over-capacity and, in addition, the children were not secured with safety belts. Appellee elected to drive at an excessive rate of speed — at least twenty-three miles beyond the 55 m.p.h. speed limit — at the time he allowed himself to fall asleep. Each of these additional factors, beyond the mere fact of falling asleep at the wheel, increased the risk of collision, injury, and death. Moreover, each was a circumstance within appellee’s knowledge and control. Viewed in their totality, the circumstances here reveal a pattern of conscious disregard for circumstances that placed the lives of these children in increasing danger. We are also satisfied that the Commonwealth proved that the circumstances here revealed a disregard of duty and risk which would warrant a jury in finding “a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor’s situation.” Accordingly, we hold that the Commonwealth sufficiently proved a <em>prima facie </em>case of two counts of involuntary manslaughter so as to warrant submission of those charges- to a jury.</p>
