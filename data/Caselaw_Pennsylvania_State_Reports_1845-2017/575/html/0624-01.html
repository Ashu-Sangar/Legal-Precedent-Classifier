On November 16, 2000, Husband filed a Petition for Adoption with respect to Child, and Mother and B.W., the other potential father, consented. B.W. signed a Consent of the Putative Father of Adoptee, which stated “I understand that I have been identified by [Mother] to be the putative biological father of [Child].... I admit that I have been named as the putative biological father. I further understand that by signing this Consent I do not admit that I am the biological father.” RR at 14. Mother was never married to B.W. and never lived with him, although she was having sexual relations with him at the time that Child was conceived. Neither Husband nor Mother identified Appellant in the Petition for Adoption or provided him with notice of Husband’s action to adopt Child. In the adoption proceeding, instead of using the attorney Mother used in the 1989 and 1990 support and custody matters, Husband and Mother hired someone else who did not know of the existence of Appellant.</p>

She said that she did this because she had been having sexual relations with B.W. at the time of conception and because Appellant had denied paternity. She also stated that she obtained the consent of B.W., not Appellant, because “I needed one consent.” RR at 34. She stated that she had identified Appellant as the natural father in her Complaint for child support because “he was pursuing me. He took me into court first. I did nothing to take him in except for the support action.” RR at 29. At the time of this hearing, Child was twelve years old and living as a family with Mother and Husband. In the ten years that Mother, Husband, and Child were living together, Appellant did not help in any way, visit, provide support, or make any demands to be part of the life of Child.</p>

The trial judge, who was the same judge who signed the adoption decree on January 31, 2001, expressed his understandable displeasure that Mother and Husband did not notify Appellant of the proceedings or disclose his existence to the court. Ascribing reprehensible motives to Mother, the trial court issued an Opinion on June 25, 2001, and granted the Petition to Vacate Judgment. The trial court lamented the effect its ruling would have on Child stating, “because of what has happened here, a child’s life is once again thrown into chaos----Once again, the relative innocent is the one who pays the price for the apparent inappropriately expedient behavior of the adults in her life.” Opinion of the Trial Court at 13.</p>

When he denied paternity, Child was just over one year old. When Appellant filed for partial custody and then to vacate the adoption by Husband, Child was eleven years old. In all that time, he never took a blood test or DNA test to establish paternity. He also never provided support for Child, never played any role in her life, and never made any demands on Mother and Husband to do so. He did not contest the termination of visitation in 1990 and did not pursue his 1990 case for partial custody, which the court terminated in 1993 after issuing a warning and notice to him. The warning and notice clearly advised Appellant that because there had been no docket activity for a period of 670 days, the case would be dismissed unless he took action within 60 days.

Mother’s husband (Husband) filed a petition seeking to adopt S.A.J. on November 16, 2000. Attached to the petition for adoption was Mother’s consent to the adoption along with B.W.’s consent to the adoption, in which B.W. stated that he had been named by Mother as the biological father, suggesting to the court that he was the biological father of S.A.J. In fact, the petition for adoption, which was verified by Husband, read as follows: “The natural father of said child is [B.W.]. He has had no contact with the child. He has not paid any financial support for the child. He has signed a Consent to give up his rights to said child. This Consent is attached.... ” Trial Ct. slip op. at 5. (citing Petition for Adoption, Paragraph 9). Relying on B.W.’s consent, the trial court signed the proposed adoption decree. Upon the filing of Appellant’s Petition to Vacate, the trial court determined that Appellant had been previously named as the father of the child by Mother in a 1990 support action and that Mother had admitted that Appellant was S.A.J.’s father in a 1989 custody action filed by Appellant. The trial court noted that Appellant “was not named, mentioned, or served with any notice of the termination of parental rights proceeding or the adoption proceeding.” Trial Ct. slip <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>op. at 3.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Further, the trial court noted that Mother hired an attorney different from the one who represented her in the custody and support actions in 1989 and 1990. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The trial court concluded that Mother’s selection of new counsel was motivated by a desire to conceal from the court her prior assertion of Appellant’s paternity, and possibly even his existence as a putative father. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. Mother could not utilize the attorney who knew Appellant was a putative father if she was to avoid apprising the court of Appellant’s existence. <em>Id. </em>In the view of the trial court, Mother and Husband deliberately concealed Appellant’s existence and named a putative father who would consent to termination of his alleged parental rights in order to allow the adoption to proceed. <em>Id. </em>at 12.

In the instant case, the termination of the alleged biological father’s parental rights, and ultimately the adoption, were based on the consent of B.W., without any notice to Appellant, whose existence, because of Mother and Husband’s deception, was never revealed to the trial court.

Nonetheless, the notice requirements in this convoluted scenario are not a matter of convenience for Mother and Husband. The trial court concluded that Appellant’s failure to receive notice deprived him of constitutional and statutory rights. Trial Ct. slip op. at 3-5. As the majority states: “Pursuant to the Adoption Act, the consent of parents of a child under 18 is required, unless parental rights are terminated.” 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2711(a)(3), 2714.

The effect of the decision today would appear to be to empower one party to the matter, here the Mother and Husband, to decide in advance of the judicial proceedings that another party with a potential interest is undeserving of notice or an opportunity to be heard. I would not interfere with the fact-finding function of the trial court, which found that Mother and Husband deceived the court with the result of depriving Appellant of the notice and opportunity to be heard. The trial court was legitimately concerned that if Appellant turned out to be the biological father, the adoption would be subject to challenge.
