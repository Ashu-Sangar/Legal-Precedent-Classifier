In language taken straight from the statute allowing trial courts to certify interlocutory appeals, 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b), the trial court found that “this case involves a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an intermediate appeal may advance the ultimate termination of the matter.” <em>Allburn, </em><a href="/a2d/721/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="721 A.2d 363" data-case-ids="11790040" data-case-paths="/a2d/721/0363-01">721 A.2d at 365</a>.

The present appeal raises a more difficult question: should the Commonwealth ever be permitted to appeal as of right from a pretrial decision which would admit defense evidence, evidence which the Commonwealth believes is both inadmissible and will compromise society’s symmetrical right to a fair trial in a criminal matter? I agree with the Majority that a ruling admitting defense evidence differs in kind from a ruling which has the effect of diminishing or eliminating the Commonwealth’s case-in-chief. But, it seems to be indisputable that certain erroneous rulings on defense evidence can also be devastating to the Commonwealth’s right to a fair trial. Mr. Justice Eakin’s Dissenting Opinion cogently suggests some not-implausible scenarios where that result just might obtain: <em>i.e., </em>erroneous Rape Shield Act rulings or rulings permitting expert testimony on witness credibility. Permitting a pretrial Commonwealth appeal in such instances does not augur the prospect of the Commonwealth wearing the accused down through repeated trials or vexatious pretrial tactics; rather, it merely provides a limited symmetrical means to vindicate the Commonwealth’s right to a fair trial which, in turn, inures to the benefit of society as a whole. Trials are supposed to be fair inquiries into the truth based upon the prevailing law of the land: their results should not be pre-destined by arbitrarily-insulated and erroneous legal rulings.</p>

The Dissents, on the other hand, would always permit such appeals, so long as the Commonwealth provided a Rule 311(d) certification that the ruling on the defense evidence substantially handicapped the prosecution. As a matter of Rule 311 interpretation, there is rational support for each position. The Majority understandably cites the “under circumstances provided by law” qualifier, viewing this decision itself as that controlling circumstance, and also stresses the fact that <em>Bosurgi </em>and its progeny involve the suppression/exclusion of evidence paradigm. The Dissents, meanwhile, note that the actual language of Rule 311(d) is not restricted to situations involving suppression or exclusion of Commonwealth evidence and also cite to the importance, squarely acknowledged in the <em>Bosurgi </em>line of cases, of the fact that the Commonwealth, unlike the defendant, has no post-trial right of review.</p>

The better approach would be to view this case in the manner in which the <em>Bosurgi </em>Court approached the issue of appellate jurisprudence presented to it: as a novel question requiring a fresh view that reasonably accommodates both the accused’s right to a speedy trial and the Commonwealth’s right to a fair one. The defense evidence posture of this case implicates concerns which, though related, are nevertheless distinct from the suppression/exclusion paradigm that led to the <em>Bosurgi </em>rule and, eventually, to Rule 311.

The procedural mechanism to accomplish such a screening of Commonwealth appeals could proceed as a preliminary determination by the appellate court that the issue presents a substantial question affecting the ability of the Commonwealth to obtain a fair trial; or by a trial court certification that the Commonwealth’s claim that the ruling substantially affected its ability to receive a fair trial is not frivolous. <em>See Brady, </em><a href="/pa/510/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="510 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1797026" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0336-01">508 A.2d at 291</a>.

Where the trial court ruling allows in defense evidence, rather than excluding Commonwealth evidence, it will be exceedingly rare for the Commonwealth to make a certification that prosecution of the case is so hampered. However, I can envision a set of circumstances where the defense seeks to introduce controversial and questionably relevant evidence of a perfect defense that, if allowed, would tie the hands of the Commonwealth to such an extent that disallowing an appeal at that time would foreclose the administration of justice. Therefore, I cannot sign on to the approach taken by the majority, which holds that, as a matter of law, the Commonwealth can never appeal as of right from a trial court ruling denying a Commonwealth motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude defense evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Accordingly, I would affirm the Opinion of the Superior Court.</p>

The majority points to Rule of Appellate Procedure 1311 and Section 702(b) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b), to demonstrate that the Commonwealth can request certification of an interlocutory appeal from an adverse pre-trial order or, where the trial court refuses to certify, file a Petition for Review in the intermediate appellate court. However, the plain and unambiguous language of Rule 311(d) obviates the need for the Commonwealth to jump through these hoops in appropriate cases.</p>

If the Commonwealth’s motion <em>in limine </em>is denied and the accused is acquitted, double jeopardy precludes review of the ruling. If <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>the accused is convicted, the Commonwealth is also precluded from appealing because it is not an aggrieved party.</p>
    <p id="b575-4" data-blocks='[["BL_575.5",575,[219,444,1153,572]]]'>When the victim of a sexual assault, for example a child victim, is asked to testify in court about the intimate personally invasive details of the crime, the embarrassment is not inconsiderable. If the trial court incorrectly orders that evidence precluded by the Rape Shield Act may be admitted by the defense, the mortification cast on the victim is multiplied. Such a ruling will cause many victims to decline to testify; they understandably choose not to be put on trial themselves, revictimized by allegations of and about past behavior that is irrelevant and statutorily prohibited. Does this not hamper the case in the most significant way possible?</p>
    <p id="b575-5" data-blocks='[["BL_575.6",575,[215,1040,1160,893]]]'>If the Commonwealth cannot appeal such a ruling pretrial, where is the justice? When may improper rulings under the Rape Shield Law <em>ever </em>be reviewed? The same can be said of pretrial rulings allowing dubious expert testimony on all manner of things, some vouching for matters as inappropriate as the intent or credibility of the witnesses or the accused. Without providing an immediate right of appeal, decisions allowing such evidence or interpreting this aspect of the Rape Shield Law will escape review. <em>See also Commonwealth v. Jones, </em><a href="/a2d/826/0900-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="826 A.2d 900" data-case-ids="9112045" data-case-paths="/a2d/826/0900-01">826 A.2d 900</a> (Pa.Super.2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (Commonwealth permitted to appeal denial of its motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude victim’s prior sexual history). The defense may appeal any and all evidentiary rulings, those that admit prosecution evidence, and those that deny defense evidence, in the name of assuring a fair trial. To limit the prosecution’s appeal to half the matters that assure a fair trial is inherently unfair to the victim, and to the people that the prosecution represents.</p>

Until experience shows actual abuse by the elected prosecutorial representatives of our counties and our Commonwealth, something certainly not of record in any way, the Rule should be applied as written.

    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[276,785,1156,366]]]'>Simply put, the existing Rule and precedent should be followed. I find no reason in logic or fairness to create a new shortsighted, unilaterally applicable rule. If there is a good faith certificate that a pretrial ruling substantially hampers the case of the party whose one job is to seek justice, and the only possible time to appeal is before jeopardy attaches at trial, the appeal should be allowed. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>
