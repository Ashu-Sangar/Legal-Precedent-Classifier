Officer Vines recognized Appellant as one of his parolees and wanted to question him about several recent parole violations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The officers drove around the block in an attempt to speak with him, but by the time they had returned, Appellant had left the corner.</p>

At around ten <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>o’clock p.m., when the officers arrived at the parole residence, there were several teenage girls standing on the front porch. The officers asked the girls if Appellant was home and the girls responded that he was not there. Officer Vines inquired if he and Officer Aldrich could go inside the house to look for Appellant. The girls consented; two of the girls opened the door and followed the officers inside the house.</p>
    <p id="b598-5" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[271,719,1160,527]]]'>Once inside the residence, the officers saw yellow headphones similar to the ones that they noticed Appellant wearing earlier in the evening outside of the bar. Officers Vines and Aldrich walked throughout the house looking for Appellant. They looked in his bedroom on the first floor. When they stepped into Appellant’s bedroom, they immediately noticed a clear plastic sandwich bag containing marijuana on the headboard of the bed. They also found a blue tinted Ziploc® bag filled with marijuana and another plastic bag containing numerous empty plastic bags.</p>

When Griffin arrived, she consented to a full search of the house. The officers thoroughly searched the bedroom of Appellant and found 2.41 grams of crack cocaine, a cellular phone, and a pager hidden in a bedroom closet.</p>

The trial court granted the motion with regard to the prior criminal record of Appellant, but ruled that any evidence concerning his parole status would be admissible for the purpose of showing how Officer Vines knew Appellant and why he went to meet with Appellant at his approved parole address.</p>

Appellant appealed to the Superior Court. In a Memorandum Opinion, the Superior Court affirmed the Judgment of Sentence imposed by the trial court.</p>

The Superior Court determined that the officers did have reasonable suspicion to believe that Appellant violated his parole, but that the search of his residence for drugs did not reasonably relate to his parole violations for failing to begin community service and maintain employment, or to the parole officer’s duty in confirming them. Furthermore, the Superior Court noted that the officers entered the house only to discuss his parole violations with him, and not to search the home for evidence.</p>

Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 4/28/00, at 11-12. The girls voluntarily gave the officers consent to enter the home; they did not hesitate in giving the officers their consent — they even opened the door to the residence for the officers. Additionally, the girls followed the officers into the house. The actions of the girls provided the officers with the reasonable belief that the girls possessed common authority over the premises permitting them to provide valid consent to enter the residence. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution only requires police officers to act reasonably when determining whether authority to consent is present. We believe that Officers Vines and Aldrich acted reasonably. Therefore, we conclude that based on the totality of the circumstances, the police officers reasonably believed that the teenage girls standing on the porch had valid authority to allow them to enter the house.

A co-inhabitant of a residence does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is willing to protect in the third party consent context. He or she should recognize that any of the co-inhabitants of the residence have the right to permit the inspection of the premises in their own right. Therefore, by virtue of living in a residence with other inhabitants, a co-inhabitant assumes the risk that one of the residents may permit the common area to be searched. The “apparent authority exception” allows the admission of evidence where the police officers reasonably, and even mistakenly, relied upon the consent of a third party who did not have actual authority to consent to the search. The question of reasonableness is paramount to the functioning of this exception. Police officers must make further inquiries to determine the status of a consenting party, where the situation is ambiguous and would cause a reasonable person to question the authority of the party who gave consent or where the authority of the party who gave consent appears to be unreasonable. <em>Rodriguez, </em><a href="/us/497/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="497 U.S. 177" data-case-ids="6214176" data-case-paths="/us/497/0177-01">497 U.S. at 189</a>, <a href="/us/497/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="497 U.S. 177" data-case-ids="6214176" data-case-paths="/us/497/0177-01">110 S.Ct. 2793</a>.</p>

All that was known was that the girls were present outside the residence and that they opened the (apparently unlocked) door and accompanied the officers inside. These facts include no objective indicia of consensual authority. Moreover, the knowledge of Parole Officer Vines concerning Appellant’s familial and living circumstances provided no basis for and, in fact, militated strongly against any conclusion that these girls possessed such authority.</p>

However, as it reasonably appeared to the officers, the teenage girls, for reasons unknown, were falsely denying Appellant’s presence. In my view, these facts are sufficient, in the case of a parolee like Appellant who has consented in advance to warrantless searches of his residence by his parole agent, to justify a cursory inspection of each room of the residence, beginning with Appellant’s room, sufficient only to determine whether Appellant was present. It appears that this is the course taken by the officers. The officers’ plan to discuss with Appellant his recent reported parole violations was a legitimate part of the investigation of “violations of the conditions <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>of supervision” for which authority to conduct a warrantless search of a parolee’s property has been granted by 61 P.S. § 331.27b(d)(2). Moreover, the circumstances expressly justifying the conduct of a warrantless search of a parolee’s residence by a parole officer as codified at 61 P.S. § 331.27b(d)(6)(viii) include “[t]he need to verify compliance with the conditions of supervision”; precisely the subject on which the officers here wished to question Appellant.
