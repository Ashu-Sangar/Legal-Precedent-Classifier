This order thus purported to vacate the August 2, 1999 order dismissing appellee’s second PCRA petition, and granted appellee PCRA relief in the form of the right to file an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>from the June 29, 1998 order dismissing appellee’s first PCRA petition.

Since the PCRA court had no jurisdiction over the serial petition, it had no power to grant appellee any relief, including relief in the form of awarding an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The Commonwealth accurately notes that Superior Court’s “extension” theory is not one of the three exceptions to the time-bar recognized in the PCRA itself, and then argues that the theory should not be permitted to operate as an extra-PCRA <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>conduit by which the jurisdictional time-bar may be nullified. The Commonwealth notes that the calculus would be different if the Superior Court in these cases had retained jurisdiction over the initial PCRA appeals, or had remanded the appeals, when faced with PCRA appeal counsel’s failure to file a brief. But, in ordering the appeals dismissed, the Superior Court put an end to those first PCRA petitions; they became final. By definition, the Commonwealth argues, any serial collateral attack cannot have been an “extension” of the previous, finally litigated one. We agree with the Commonwealth that the Superior Court erred in attempting to circumvent the PCRA time-bar by deeming this serial petition to be an extension of appellee’s previously filed, and finally decided, initial petition.</p>

Since neither the language of the statute nor this Court’s decisional law authorizes suspension of the time-bar in instances where the petitioner is seeking <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appellate relief or reiterating claims which were litigated on a previous petition, the statute obviously cannot bear Superior Court’s interpretation.</p>

Once a PCRA petition has been decided and the ruling on it has become final, there is nothing for a subsequent petition or pleading to “extend.” Far from continuing into perpetuity, the trial court’s jurisdiction over a matter generally ends once an appeal is taken from a final order or, if no appeal is taken, thirty days elapse after the final order. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5505 (“Modification of orders: Except as otherwise provided or prescribed by law, a court upon notice to the parties may modify or rescind any order <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>within 30 days after its entry, notwithstanding the prior termination of any term of court, if no appeal from such order has been taken or allowed.”). Appellee’s initial PCRA petition was decided when Judge Richette entered her final order of dismissal on June 29, 1998. Appellee appealed that order, but his appeal was dismissed because his counsel failed to file a brief. Contrary to the assertions found in both <em>Peterson, </em><a href="/a2d/756/0687-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="756 A.2d 687" data-case-ids="11243754" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/0687-01">756 A.2d at </a>689 and <em>Leasa, </em><a href="/a2d/759/0941-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="759 A.2d 941" data-case-ids="11233745" data-case-paths="/a2d/759/0941-01">759 A.2d at 942</a>, such outright dismissals, even when accompanied by the notation that they are entered “without prejudice to [the appellant’s] rights under the [PCRA],” do not operate to “remand” the matters to the PCRA courts, absent an actual mandate to that effect.

In addition, appellee did not seek discretionary review in this Court. By operation of law, Judge Richette’s order denying relief on the merits of the first petition became final thirty days after the Superior Court dismissed the appeal. Neither Judge Richette nor the Superi- or Court retained any sort of residual jurisdiction to tinker with that final judgment. Instead, the only way for appellee to secure further collateral review of the claims he would now raise was via the PCRA, which provides the exclusive vehicle for obtaining state collateral relief on claims which are cognizable under the PCRA. <em>Eller, </em><a href="/a2d/807/0838-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="807 A.2d 838" data-case-ids="11354551,312757" data-case-paths="/a2d/807/0838-01,/pa/569/0622-01">807 A.2d at 842-43</a>; <em>Hall, </em><a href="/a2d/771/1232-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="771 A.2d 1232" data-case-ids="11105213,11105256,11105298,124716,124721,124765" data-case-paths="/a2d/771/1232-01,/a2d/771/1232-02,/a2d/771/1232-03,/pa/565/0092-02,/pa/565/0091-01,/pa/565/0092-01">771 A.2d at 1235-36</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

In light of the heavy appellate burden faced by our front-line criminal appeals court, we do not doubt the necessity of some such practice. Prior to the <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>1995 enactment of the time-bar, the notation “without prejudice to the appellant’s rights under the PCRA” on a first PCRA appeal did not preclude the PCRA petitioner from seeking <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief via a serial PCRA petition, albeit the petitioner would face the heightened judicial burden applicable to a serial petition. <em>See Commonwealth v.

If the Superior Court had (and still has) a concern with the effect of its administrative orders in light of the greater restriction represented by the time-bar, the answer is not to seek to circumvent the statute but, perhaps, to revisit (if it has not done so already) the administrative practice. As the Commonwealth notes, the Superior Court could take other measures when faced with a PCRA petitioner’s lawyer’s failure to file a brief on an appeal from the denial of a timely, first PCRA petition. For example, the court could in fact remand the first PCRA petition for a hearing on counsel’s failure and the advisability of sanctioning counsel or appointing new counsel; or, the court could issue a rule to show cause upon appellate counsel to explain his reasons for flouting the court’s briefing order. But, we cannot sanction the indulgence of a fiction which is obviously designed to simply circumvent the statutory time-bar.</p>

Since the petition at issue here was untimely and did not fall within any of the three exceptions to the time-bar, both the PCRA court and the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction in this matter.
