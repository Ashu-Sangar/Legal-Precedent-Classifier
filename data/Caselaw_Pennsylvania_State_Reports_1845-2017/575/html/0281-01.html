The day before, Appellant had paid Naughton to bring a bottle of his parent’s vodka from his home. Appellant and the boys spent the day drinking, swimming and fishing.

Hagan sat down next to Appellant at which time Hagan’s arm brushed Appellant. Appellant became aroused, told Hagan to stand, pulled Hagan’s boxer shorts down, and performed oral sex on him. Appellant then asked Hagan what he was going to do about the incident. Hagan responded that he was going to tell his parents that Appellant had kidnapped him. Appellant then pushed Hagan to the ground, sat on top of him, and choked him for approximately five minutes. When Hagan stopped moving, Appellant removed his hands from Hagan’s throat. Once Hagan started to revive and cough, Appellant choked him a second time for approximately ten minutes until Appellant was satisfied that Hagan was no longer alive. Appellant then rolled Hagan on to his stomach. Appellant again became aroused and performed anal sex on him. Appellant then placed Hagan’s body in the river and kept watch for approximately twenty minutes. Appellant <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>searched the riverbank, found a tire rim and tied it to Hagan’s neck.

Appellant also told the officers that he was concerned that neighbors may suspect him in the disappearance because of a prior sexual contact he had with a young boy. After spending several hours with detectives, Appellant voluntarily agreed to accompany them to the Pittsburgh Police Detective Bureau.</p>

On April 21, 1999, Appellant filed a reply wherein he requested that his appellate rights be reinstated. The trial court vacated its April 19, 1999 order certifying the case for appellate review and reinstated Appellant’s appellate rights. Counsel was subsequently appointed. On June 4, 1999, Appellant filed a notice of appeal and thereafter requested an evidentiary hearing on the issues of ineffective assistance of counsel.

Had the invalid plea supported a <em>separate </em>aggravating circumstance, the process of balancing aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have been offset. That is not the case here. The invalidation of the guilty plea to the second count of IDSI did not invalidate the only aggravating circumstance found, <em>ie., </em>the commission of the killing during the perpetration of a felony. As Appellant was not prejudiced by the entrance of his plea, his related claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for advising him to plead guilty to the second count of IDSI also fails.</p>

While the majority emphasizes counsels observation that Appellant displayed no overt psychotic behavior between the time of the arrest and trial, and trial counsels proffer of Dr. Martone’s testimony as mitigation, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion at 73, it offers little account for the limited scope of Dr. Martone’s evaluation,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> or its impact in terms of implicating further investigation into potential mental health mitigation. <em>Accord Averhart v.
