    <p id="b314-6" data-blocks='[["BL_314.7",314,[262,637,1162,1006]]]'>In this appeal, we consider the boundaries of the statutory-provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act that grants an employer the right of subrogation when a third party is found to have caused an employee’s compensable injury, 77 P.S. § 671 (“Section 319”). Specifically at issue is whether Section 319 permits subrogation when an injured employee who is receiving workers’ compensation benefits returns to work for a third-party employer after partial recovery from a compensable injury, the third-party employer wrongfully terminates the employee, and thereafter, the employee obtains a recovery for his termination pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act. While we reaffirm the significance and the strength of the statutory doctrine of subrogation in our workers’ compensation system, based upon the plain language of Section 319— which only allows subrogation where the third party <em>causes </em>the employee’s compensable injury — we hold that in the context of a wrongful termination of an employee by a third-party employer, subrogation is not available. Thus, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b314-7" data-blocks='[["BL_314.8",314,[260,1679,1163,688]]]'>The facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute. Appellee James Bridges worked as a Master Mechanic for Appellant Brubacher Excavating, Inc. In September 1992, Bridges injured his back while lifting a cylinder head from an engine, and as a result began receiving total disability benefits in the amount of $455.00 per week. In July 1993, Bridges was released by his physician to return to light-duty work. Acting on Brubacher’s referral, Bridges sought and obtained a position with Diesel Services, Inc., as a Service Writer/Service Advisor. Bridges began working for Diesel Services in November 1993, earning approximately $400.00 per week and receiving partial disability benefits of $245.26 per week for his back injury.</p>

      <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>Later that month, however, Bridges was terminated from his employment because Diesel Services’ workers’ compensation insurance carrier refused to extend coverage to Bridges. Upon his termination, Brubacher resumed receiving total disability benefits from Brubacher. Later, in February 1995, Bridges filed suit against Diesel Services in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, claiming that Diesel Services had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 12101">42 U.S.C. § 12101</a>, when it terminated him.</p>

    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[209,1143,1153,524]]]'>The Workers’ Compensation Judge determined that Brubacher was not entitled to subrogation because the two injuries, Bridges’ back injury and the unlawful termination, were different in both type and causation. The Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board affirmed on the same basis. The Commonwealth Court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>similarly concluded that Diesel Services’ discriminatory termination of Bridges was “totally unrelated” to Bridges’ back injury, and therefore affirmed the decision of the lower administrative tribunals. <em>Brubacher Excavating v.

Our Court has stated that the statutory right to subrogation is “absolute and can be abrogated only by choice.” <em>Winfree v. Philadelphia Elec.

This is so because the statute granting subrogation “clearly and unambiguously” provides that the employer “shall be subrogated” to the employee’s right of recovery. <em>Id.; see also Thompson v. Workers’ Comp. Appeal Bd. (USF &amp; G Co.), </em><a href="/pa/566/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="566 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="706231" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0420-01">566 Pa. 420</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="781 A.2d 1146" data-case-ids="706231,9480562" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0420-01,/a2d/781/1146-01">781 A.2d 1146</a>, 1151, 1153 (2001) (Section 319 subrogation is automatic; <em>ad hoc </em>equitable exceptions do not apply to Section 319).

Thus, pursuant to the plain terms of Section 319, an employer is entitled to subrogation when the third party causes a claimant’s work-related physical or mental injury and that injury results in a loss of earning power. <em>Dale Mfg.

While Diesel Services’ actions may have resulted in a loss of earning power, it is not disputed that Diesel Services did not in whole or in part cause Bridges’ physical injury.

    <p id="b318-3" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[262,315,1160,834]]]'>
      <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>In challenging this conclusion, Brubacher relies heavily on the policies underlying the right to subrogation in claiming a right to the settlement monies. Our Court has identified three underlying purposes for the Section 319 right to subrogation: (1) to prevent the employee from receiving a “double recovery” for the same injury; (2) to ensure that the employer is not compelled to pay compensation due to the wrongful act of a third party; and (3) to prevent a third party from escaping liability for its wrongful conduct. <em>Dale Mfg. Co., </em><a href="/pa/491/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="491 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1765689" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0493-01">421 A.2d at 654</a>. Yet, Brubacher’s argument regarding policy cannot trump or avoid the plain words of the statute which require causation of a compensable injury. “[W]hen the words of a statute are clear, the letter is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). Thus, Brubacher’s policy arguments, in light of the plain words of the statute, must fail.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>In sum, the plain language of Section 319 requires an employer to establish that a third party caused the <em>“compensable injury’’ </em>before subrogation is permitted. A compensable injury is both a physical or mental injury and a loss in earning power. Here, Brubacher could not prove that Diesel Services caused Bridges’ compensable injury because Diesel Services’ act of wrongfully terminating Bridges did not cause in whole or in part Bridges’ physical injury. Thus, Section 319’s statutory requirement of causation of a compensable injury has not been met and Brubacher is not entitled to subrogation. 77 P.S. § 671.</p>

The record and administrative findings in this case reflect that Brubacher’s compensation obligation to Bridges increased from the partial disability rate of $245.26 to the total disability rate of $455.00 upon Diesel’s alleged unlawful termination of Bridges. Thus, Brubacher was clearly compelled to make compensation payments by reason of the wrongful act of a third party. <em>See Poole, </em><a href="/pa/570/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="810 A.2d 1182" data-case-ids="270335,9319733" data-case-paths="/pa/570/0495-01,/a2d/810/1182-01">810 A.2d at 1184-85</a> (stating this criterion and implicitly holding it satisfied); <em>Helms Express, </em><a href="/pa-commw/106/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="525 A.2d 1269" data-case-ids="1360272" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/106/0287-01">525 A.2d at 1271-72</a> (same).

Therefore, there is an identity between the fund created by the workers’ compensation arrangement and the fund created by the third-party settlement. <em>See Poole, </em><a href="/pa/570/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="810 A.2d 1182" data-case-ids="270335,9319733" data-case-paths="/pa/570/0495-01,/a2d/810/1182-01">810 A.2d at 1184-85</a> (stating this criterion and implicitly holding it satisfied); <em>Helms Express, </em><a href="/pa-commw/106/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="525 A.2d 1269" data-case-ids="1360272" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/106/0287-01">525 A.2d at 1271-72</a> (same). Moreover, subrogation here is consistent with the three purposes underlying section 319 as it will (1) prevent Bridges from obtaining a “double recovery” by receiving compensation for wage losses from Brubacher and a civil recovery for wage losses from Diesel; (2) prevent Brubacher from being compelled to pay increased compensation based on Diesel’s alleged wrongful act; and (3) operate to ensure that Diesel will not escape liability because Diesel is held solely responsible for the increased compensation owed to Bridges. Consequently, I would find that subrogation is appropriate in this case, but only to the extent that Bridges recovered from Diesel for lost wages, and only in the amount that Bridges’ benefits increased as a result of his alleged unlawful termination by Diesel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

However, because the record does not contain any financial details relating to Bridges’ settlement with Diesel, I cannot ascertain the exact amount of Bridges’ wage loss recovery. Thus, I would remand the matter to permit Brubacher the opportunity to prove whether wage losses were included in the settlement Bridges obtained from Diesel.</p>

While the majority attempts to distinguish <em>Poole </em>from the instant case by emphasizing that the employee's success on his legal malpractice claim hinged on his ability to establish the malfeasance of the underlying tortfeasor and thus, the "subrogation in the context of a legal malpractice action satisfied the statutory requirement of establishing that a third party caused the compensable injury,” Op. at 1277 n. 2, the fact remains that the third-party attorney’s legal malpractice in <em>Poole </em>did not cause the employee’s work-related injury and yet we permitted the employer to be subrogated to the rights of the employee against the attorney. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 671 ("Where the compensable injury is caused in whole or in part by the act or omission <em>of a third party, </em>the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employe ... his personal representative, his estate or his dependents, <em>against such third party </em>....”) Accordingly, in my view, <em>Poole </em>clearly indicates that the third party from whom subrogation is appropriate need not have caused the employee's <em>physical injury.</em>
