The court below granted relief only to the extent that it vacated its original directive that ordered appellee to install an approved ignition interlock system on each of his motor vehicles as a condition precedent to restoration of his operating privileges by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT or the Department). In granting this relief, the panel declared unconstitutional on its face certain provisions of Act 63 of 2000, codified at 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 7001-7003, which amended the Judicial Code to require sentencing courts to order installation of such interlock ignition systems on a serial DUI offender’s motor vehicles and then to certify to the Department that such systems had been installed. <em>Id. </em>§ 7002(b). The trial court found that the Act’s vesting of responsibility in the trial court to order and certify installation of the systems was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds and on grounds sounding in both separation of powers and procedural due process.</p>

Because we find no merit in either claim, we will affirm the court’s modified judgment of sentence. As shall be explained, however, our determination that the portions of the Act which delegate responsibility to the trial courts to perform executive functions relating to the installation of ignition interlock systems cannot stand does not render Act 63’s ignition interlock requirement unenforceable. Rather, we are satisfied that the offending provisions may be severed without rendering the legislative scheme incapable of execution. Indeed, the Department — the administrative agency that properly should discharge the executive function that Act 63 delegated to the judiciary — may employ the remaining valid portions of the Act to effectuate the legislative requirement that serial DUI offenders, who can have their driving privileges restored after an automatic one-year suspension, may do so only after securing an “ignition interlock restricted license” which allows an <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>offender to operate a motor vehicle only if it is equipped with an approved ignition interlock system.</p>
    <p id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.5",154,[265,436,1162,1698]]]'>Act 63 defines an “ignition interlock system” as: “A system approved by the department that prevents a vehicle from being started or operated unless the operator first provides a breath sample indicating that the operator has an alcohol level of less than .025%.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 7001. The Act directs that where a person is convicted of a second or subsequent DUI offense, the sentencing court “shall order the installation of an approved ignition interlock device on each motor vehicle owned by the person,” such installation to be effective at the time the Department would restore the serial DUI offender’s operating privileges. <em>Id. </em>§ 7002(b). The Act further requires that the sentencing court submit a record to the Department of the installation order. <em>Id. </em>If the offender applies to the Department for restoration of his driving privileges after his automatic one-year of suspension has expired, the Act further requires the sentencing court to provide the administrative agency with a “certification” that an appropriate ignition interlock system has been installed on each motor vehicle owned by the offender. <em>Id.; see also id. </em>§ 7003(1). Once the court certifies that the systems are in place, the Act contemplates that the Department will issue an “ignition interlock restricted license,” <em>i.e., </em>one “which will be clearly marked to restrict the person to operating only motor vehicles equipped with an approved interlock ignition system.” <em>Id. </em>§ 7002(b), § 7003(2). After one year of driving under the restricted license, the offender, if otherwise eligible, may apply for a replacement license that does not contain the interlock restriction. <em>Id. </em>§ 7003(4). Serial DUI offenders who do not apply for an ignition interlock restricted license are deemed ineligible to apply for the restoration of driving privileges for an additional year after their automatic one-year suspensions expire. <em>Id. </em>§ 7003(1).</p>

With respect to the latter requirement, the Pennsylvania General Assembly opted to legislate a one-year interlock requirement as opposed to the more severe measure of impounding or immobilizing each of the recidivist offender’s motor vehicles. The September 30, 2000 effective date of Act 63 obviously was designed to avoid the specter of the federal highway fund diversion.</p>

On October 10, 2000, appellee entered a guilty plea. On November 13, 2000, the trial court sentenced appellee to a term of thirty (30) days to twenty-three (23) months of imprisonment. The minimum term was mandated by 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(e)(1)(h) for a second DUI offense. In addition, the court’s judgment of sentence included a directive pursuant to Act 63 which ordered that “an approved ignition interlock device shall be installed on each motor vehicle owned by [appellee] prior to restoration of [appellee’s] operating privileges by the [Pennsylvania] Department of Transportation.”</p>

The matter apparently was consolidated with three other cases (identified only by their docket numbers) for purposes of briefing and argument. On February 12, 2001, a three-judge panel of the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (Bayley, Oler, and Guido, JJ.) issued an order and opinion granting partial post-sentence relief. The panel found that the provisions of Act 63 under which the sentencing judge had ordered installation of the interlock system(s) were unconstitutional on equal protection grounds and separation of powers/due process grounds. Accordingly, the panel vacated the order to the extent it required installation of the ignition interlock devices, but left the other provisions of the sentence in effect.</p>

But, we do not believe that this is so. The statute imposes, among other things, an obligation upon the sentencing court to order installation of ignition interlock devices on all motor vehicles owned by the serial DUI offender. Since the statute refers to “other requirements imposed by the court” and speaks only of situations “where a person <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>has been convicted” of a serial DUI offense, it obviously was appropriate for the Court to attempt to discharge its responsibility under Act 63 by including the directive in its sentencing order.

    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[259,759,1160,1007]]]'>Moreover, it bears noting that the offender is not the only party who may be aggrieved by the trial court’s sentencing order on Act 63 grounds. For example, in <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, Department of Transp., </em><a href="/a2d/805/0671-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="805 A.2d 671" data-case-ids="11434710" data-case-paths="/a2d/805/0671-01">805 A.2d 671</a> (Pa.Cmwlth. 2002), the trial court failed to include the ignition interlock system mandate in its order sentencing a repeat DUI offender, and the Commonwealth failed to appeal. The Department thereafter notified the defendant that she was required to install the systems on all owned vehicles in order to secure restoration of her driving privileges after her mandatory one-year suspension. The trial court sustained the defendant’s appeal of the Department’s imposition of an interlock restriction. Upon further appeal by the Department, the Commonwealth Court affirmed, holding that the Department should have appealed the failure to order installation of the system(s) after the sentencing order was issued, and that the Department had no authority “to override the trial court’s order and require the installation of the ignition interlock system.” <a href="/a2d/805/0671-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="805 A.2d 671" data-case-ids="11434710" data-case-paths="/a2d/805/0671-01">805 A.2d at 676</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The Commonwealth’s argument might have more force if Act 63 had vested executive and compliance responsibilities in the Department, rather than the court. But, the court unquestionably was competent to rule upon a controversy involving the very statute under which it had acted. This is so regardless of whether the ignition interlock requirement, viewed in isolation, is more like a collateral civil consequence of the serial DUI offense than a “penalty.” The Commonwealth’s “jurisdictional” complaint, in reality, implicates a mere procedural question concerning the preferred method of challenge. In this regard, we note, as the trial court did, that “[tjhere is nothing abstract about the prohibition contained in the sentencing order.” Rather, that initial order, which effectuated the explicit directives of the statute, erected a condition precedent to restoration of appellee’s license. Accordingly, the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the challenge at the post-sentence stage.</p>

      <em>Duffey </em>was also a license suspension appeal arising after the operator’s guilty plea to the summary offense of underage drinking. The relevant issue was whether the license suspension was a criminal penalty such that the failure to apprise the operator of that consequence rendered his guilty plea invalid. This Court concluded that the suspension was a collateral civil consequence and not a criminal penalty and, thus, there was <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>no requirement that the operator be apprised of that consequence at the plea stage. <a href="/pa/536/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="639 A.2d 1174" data-case-ids="1843208,7869235" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0436-01,/a2d/639/1174-01">639 A.2d at 1176-77</a>.

With these provisions severed, the legislation still requires recidivist DUI offenders seeking restoration of driving privileges to apply to the Department for an ignition interlock restricted license. 42 Pa.C.S. § 7003(2). The Act also precludes the offender in possession of such a restricted license from operating any motor vehicle on a highway in the Commonwealth unless that vehicle is equipped with an approved ignition interlock system. <em><a href="/pa/571/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="812 A.2d 591" data-case-ids="1070140,11367121" data-case-paths="/pa/571/0375-01,/a2d/812/0591-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 7003(3). The Act thus still prevents recidivist DUI offenders from lawfully operating <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>motor vehicles on the highways in Pennsylvania unless they have an approved limited license and are driving a properly-equipped vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[269,498,1161,891]]]'>Moreover, enforcement of the legislative purpose will still occur in the ordinary course of enforcement of the highway laws — -just as it does, for example, in relation to drivers whose licenses are subject to other restrictions. Indeed, there are still sharp teeth in the law, as accountability may be maintained via enforcement of the Motor Vehicle Code’s proscription of operating a motor vehicle in violation of restrictions imposed, <em>see 75 </em>Pa.C.S. §§ 1512(b), 6502(a); and enforcement of new Section 7514 of the Crimes Code, which was adopted on the same day as Act 63, and which makes it a summary offense for a person required to operate only motor vehicles equipped with an approved interlock ignition system to operate a motor vehicle on the highway without such a system. 18 Pa.C.S. § 7514.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The remaining portions of the Act, so construed, align the enforcement of the ignition interlock restriction with the usual prosaic means of enforcing licensing restrictions in this Commonwealth.</p>

In sustaining the equal protection claim, the trial court focused on two “arbitrary classifications” it detected in the Act: (1) a classification which discriminates against lessees and other non-owners of motor vehicles because the Act allegedly renders them incapable of securing an interlock restricted license since the trial court cannot certify that they have installed devices on owned vehicles; and (2) a classification which allegedly discriminates against owners of multiple. vehicles, by requiring them to install the devices on all owned vehicles. We offer no view on the merits of these claims because it is apparent that, with the constitutionally infirm provisions removed from the Act, the .bases for these challenges disappear. The factual predicate <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>for each challenge arises from the provisions of the Act delegating to the trial court the responsibility of regulating the restoration of operating privileges by ordering the devices installed “on each motor vehicle owned” by the offender and then investigating and certifying compliance to the Department. Since we have struck these provisions as unconstitutional, we need not reach the derivative, facial equal protection challenges. Should appellee or any other serial DUI offender be aggrieved by an actual determination made by the Department in enforcing the remaining provisions of the Act, the administrative setting is the appropriate forum to raise such a challenge.</p>
    <p id="b175-4" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[196,996,1156,636]]]'>In summary, we hold that the provisions in Act 63 which delegate to the courts the executive responsibility, more properly vested in the Department of Transportation, of regulating whether and when repeat DUI offenders are entitled to conditional restoration of their operating privileges, are unconstitutional, but severable. Accordingly, those provisions are invalidated. The remaining provisions of Act 63 still authorize the Department to impose an ignition interlock restriction upon serial DUI offenders who seek restoration of their operating privileges at the expiration of the one-year mandatory suspension of their licenses, and the Commonwealth has available to it ample means of enforcing that provision.</p>
