(Hydropress), which, on November 27, 2000, filed an action for declaratory judgment asking the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County to enter an order declaring Township Ordinance 2001-01(0rdinance) invalid, permanently enjoining the Township from enforcing the Ordinance, and declaring that Hydropress is legally entitled to resume its operations in the Township without having to comply with the requirements of the Ordinance. This appeal presents three issues: whether Hydropress has standing to challenge the Ordinance, whether the Solid Waste Management Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (SWMA) preempts the Ordinance, and whether the Ordinance is a valid exercise of the police powers under the Second Class Township Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>

Desiring to spread its biosolids on agricultural lands within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Hydropress applied for and obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), a beneficial use order approval on May 6, 1997. However, on November 24, 1999, PADEP suspended the use approval. Subsequently, Hydro-press and PADEP entered into an interim agreement that permitted Hydropress to conduct demonstration projects at several locations in Pennsylvania. As of the date of the trial court’s opinion, no demonstration projects had yet been approved by PADEP for farms located in the Township.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> However, Hydropress represents that it intends to conduct demonstration projects in the Township once it obtains all necessary approvals.

In addition, the trial court determined that local regulation of the land application of waste material such as biosolids, septage or sewage sludge is preempted by the SWMA.

Appellant’s Brief at 37-38. While the Township admits that at that time, PADEP had approved Hydropress to conduct various demonstration projects within the Commonwealth, it explains that, according to the stipulated facts between the parties, as described <em>supra, </em>p. 483, 836 A.2d p. 914, no demonstration projects had yet been approved by PADEP for farms located in the Township. This is the basis of Appellant’s claim that Hydropress does not have standing to challenge the Ordinance. As we have noted, Hydropress, at the time of this adjudication, was in the process of submitting application packages for PADEP’s approval of demonstration projects at several farms located in the Township, but the outcome of that process is not a matter of record.</p>

Trial Ct. slip op., February 13, 2001, at 4. In addition to the fact that Hydropress had applied to PADEP to conduct demonstration projects in the Township, we note that the Ordinance does not require that a party receive a permit from PADEP before receiving a permit from the Township. Instead, the Ordinance only requires that a permit be obtained from PADEP prior to the onset of site application. <em>See </em>Ordinance Section 4(a), R14.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Therefore, the Township’s reliance on PADEP approval as a prerequisite to <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>standing is unfounded as Hydropress is free to seek a permit from the Township without PADEP approval as long as it obtains a PADEP permit prior to the onset of the application of biosolids.</p>

Therefore, Hydropress’s interest in the matters regulated by the Ordinance is substantial in that it surpasses the common interest of citizens generally. Hydro-press’s interest is direct because Hydropress has shown that the imposition of the requirements of the Ordinance could cause harm to Hydropress’s interest in conducting its lawful business activity by, according to Hydropress’s argument, imposing regulations in a field that has been preempted by the SWMA, or that goes beyond the Township’s police power. Further, Hydropress’s interest is immediate because Hydro-press has shown that there is a causal connection between the passing of the Ordinance, and the injury to Hydropress, which in this case is its exposure to an ordinance that is allegedly preempted by the SWMA or outside of the realm of the Township’s police power. In <em>Empire Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v.

As the lead opinion correctly recognizes in its discussion of the Township’s police power, the Township has only those powers delegated to it by the General Assembly. While I agree with the lead opinion that the statement of purpose accompanying the SWMA encourages cooperative efforts on the part of state and local authorities, that statement of purpose is not an implied delegation of power to units of local government to add levels of regulation beyond that which is specifically authorized in the SWMA. Rather, it is the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA-<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>DEP), as the expert in this area, which alone is delegated the comprehensive regulatory authority. Absent a similar or reserve delegation of power to local authorities within the SWMA, I do not view this legislation as remotely contemplating some reserved or implied regulatory role for local government. Indeed, the notion that the General Assembly contemplated that a subject such as this should be subject to the inevitable balkanization that would follow from permitting onerous regulations propounded by the myriad of local governmental entities, unskilled in this area, which exist in this Commonwealth, is implausible.</p>

Thus, the trial court did not find that the agreement gave Hydropress the right to operate, which is, in my opinion, what is necessary to have a “direct” and an “immediate” interest to have standing in the present case.

This analysis does not vary because the Ordinance “does not require that a party receive a permit from DEP before receiving a permit from the Township,” <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, p. 487-88, 836 A.2d p. 917, since this observation does not obviate the fact that, irrespective of the requirements set forth in the Ordinance, Hydro-press cannot apply biosolids within the Township without first obtaining a DEP permit.</p>
