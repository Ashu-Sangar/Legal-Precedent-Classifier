Malice in Pennsylvania has a special meaning. It does not mean simple ill will.

Thus, a killing is with malice if the killer acted, first, with an intent to kill, or second, an intent to inflict serious bodily harm, or third, a wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequence, and a mind regardless of social duty indicating an unjustified disregard for the probability of death or great bodily harm and an extreme indifference to the value of human life.

We reasoned that "the concerns that led <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>this Court in <em>Grant </em>to abrogate the <em>Hubbard </em>doctrine and adopt the new general rule deferring consideration of claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel to collateral review are simply not present in this context.” <em><a href="/pa/573/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="826 A.2d 831" data-case-ids="197189,9111753" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0426-01,/a2d/826/0831-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/573/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="826 A.2d 831" data-case-ids="197189,9111753" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0426-01,/a2d/826/0831-01">at 853</a>.</p>
      <p id="b377-10" data-blocks='[["BL_377.3",377,[244,2012,1118,349]]]'>In the instant matter, no post-sentence motions were filed. <em>See </em>Tr. Ct. Opin. dated 3/16/01 at 3. Subsequent to the appeal, trial counsel withdrew and new counsel was appointed. New counsel raised issues of trial counsel's ineffectiveness. Because these issues were not raised before the trial court previously, the case was remanded for an opinion. <em>See </em>Tr. Ct. Opin. dated 5/23/01 at 1. However, as the trial court noted, "[t]he matter was not remanded for an evidentiary hearing or trial counsel's strategy or reasons for his conduct.” <em><a href="/pa/573/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="826 A.2d 831" data-case-ids="197189,9111753" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0426-01,/a2d/826/0831-01">Id.</a> </em>Consequently, the <em>Bomar </em>exception to the rule in <em>Grant </em>does not apply.</p>
