    <p id="b212-5" data-blocks='[["BL_212.6",212,[259,471,1161,1026]]]'>This Court granted review to determine whether, in amending Section 309(d) of the Workers’ Compensation Act (“Act”), <em>see </em>77 P.S. § 582(d), the General Assembly intended that a seriously and permanently injured full-time worker, whose full-time employment was preceded by part-time after-school employment, should be penalized by having the periods of part-time employment included in the calculation of his average weekly wage. Citing to the overall humanitarian purpose of the Act and the unusual circumstances presented here, both the Workers’ Compensation Judge (“WCJ”) and the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (“WCAB”) construed the amended Act as not requiring that the part-time wages be included in the computation of average wages. A panel of the Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that the Act permits no distinction between full-time and part-time employment and, accordingly, the calculation of appellant’s average weekly wage must include earlier quarters of employment during which he was a part-time employee. For the following reasons, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b212-6" data-blocks='[["BL_212.7",212,[258,1548,1159,807]]]'>The industrious appellant worked on a part-time basis for Hannaberry HVAC (“employer”) while he was a high school student. On June 20, 1996, after graduating from high school, appellant accepted a full-time position with employer. Appellant’s work schedule had varied greatly during his part-time employment, with his paychecks generally increasing as graduation neared. Thus, in the three quarterly periods preceding his entry into full-time employment, appellant’s average weekly wages were: $57.25 (for the period from September 20, 1995 to December 20, 1995); $96.87 (December 20, 1995 to March 20, 1996); and $110.56 (March 20, 1996 to June 20, 1996). In contrast, appellant’s average weekly wage for the calendar quarter after he assumed full-time status, the period from June 20, 1996 until September 20, 1996, increased more than four-fold, to $473.65.</p>

      <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>On September 20, 1996, appellant suffered a devastating work injury when a forklift fell on him, injuring his spinal cord and rendering him quadriplegic. Appellant was nineteen years old. There has never been any dispute concerning the severity of the injury, its work-relatedness and permanence, or appellant’s entitlement to workers’ compensation benefits. The dispute is limited to the amount of the benefit.</p>
    <p id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[188,724,1157,960]]]'>Employer issued a notice of compensation payable acknowledging appellant’s injury and calculating his average weekly wage as $207.03 with a corresponding compensation rate of $186.33. Appellant filed a claim petition challenging employer’s computation of the average weekly wage. During the litigation, employer amended the average weekly wage to $229.43 with a corresponding compensation benefit rate of $206.49. Employer based its calculation upon the highest three quarters of employment in the previous year, two of which were periods of part-time employment. Appellant contended that his average weekly wage should be calculated based solely upon the quarter coinciding with his full-time employment, which was also the most recent quarter. Appellant argued that including his part-time high school employment in calculating his average weekly wage artificially decreased the wages he actually earned as a full-time worker, which was the status he enjoyed when injured, and would consign him to a lifetime of insufficient compensation.</p>

The WCJ based the average weekly wage solely on claimant’s last calendar quarter of work. The WCJ noted that “the very unusual circumstances” of the case made it a “difficult one.” The WCJ recognized that the Act, as amended, does not explicitly distinguish between part-time and full-time employment in providing for the calculation of a claimant’s average weekly wage. But, the WCJ concluded, it would be “manifestly unfair” to ignore the “dramatic” distinction between part-time employment as a full-time student and full-time adult employment in this context. In the WCJ’s <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>view, the benefit due appellant should “reflect his adult earnings [and] not his after school activities.” WCJ Op., 15.</p>

The panel noted that the amended Act neither explicitly addressed, nor made a distinction between, part-time and full-time employment. The panel further noted that the 1996 statutory formula, which required that the three highest of the last four quarters of employment be averaged in calculating a claimant’s wages, represented a deliberate change in policy from the prior legislation, which had calculated wages premised upon the single highest earnings quarter of employment in the previous year. The panel deemed itself constrained to hold, as a matter of law, that appellant’s periods of part-time employment during the year preceding his injury could not be excluded from the calculation of his average weekly wages.</p>
    <p id="b214-6" data-blocks='[["BL_214.7",214,[268,1623,1161,742]]]'>In reaching this conclusion, the panel opined that the legislative history behind the 1996 amendments revealed that the General Assembly sought to prevent individuals from receiving more through workers’ compensation than they would have earned had they remained in the workforce. This situation could arise under the previous computational formula since a claimant could cite the highest quarter during the year preceding the injury, even if that quarter reflected aberration-ally high wages: <em>i.e., </em>the claimant may have earned inflated wages due to overtime, a one-time bonus, a temporary assignment to a higher wage position (as on a prevailing-wage contract), etc. In support of its conclusion that such was the legislative intent, the panel quoted the following remarks made by one senator during the legislative debates:</p>

Appellant was, and had been for three months, a continuous full-time employee when he suffered his devastating work injury. Had the Act not been amended, the three month period during which he was a full-time employee would have provided the measure for calculating his average wage, and not just because it was the most recent quarter, or the only quarter during which he was a full-time employee, but because the most favorable quarter to the worker/claimant provided the statutory measure. We agree with the parties and the Commonwealth Court that one obvious purpose of the amendment to Section 309(d) was to prevent a claimant from receiving artificially inflated benefits by being able to select, as the measuring point for calculating his average wage, a work quarter during which his pay was atypically high. Viewed in a broader light, the amendment was thus an attempt to ensure that the calculation of wages would be a more accurate and realistic measure of what the employee could have expected to earn had he not been injured which, in turn, would ensure both that the employee was not over-compensated and the employer not over-burdened. But, the wages appellant was receiving at the time of his work injury were not artificially inflated. Those wages did not reflect a one-time “peak” or “spike” in pay; rather, these were the wages that appellant regularly earned at the time of injury. Moreover, even ignoring the enduring fact of appellant’s permanent total injury, there is no question that, if appellant were to prevail on appeal, he will still be worse off financially than if he had not been injured, since he will <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>receive but two-thirds of the wages that he was actually and consistently earning at the time he was injured on the job.</p>

We emphasize it only because we take seriously this Court’s settled recognition that “[o]ur basic premise in workmen’s compensation matters is that the Workmen’s Compensation Act is remedial in nature and intended to benefit the worker, and, therefore, the Act must be liberally construed to effectuate its humanitarian objectives.” <em>Peterson v.

Appellant’s argument is not a mere equitable one. Appellant submits that, when the General Assembly amended Section 309(d), it did not consider the type of circumstantial calamity that befell him and did not intend the result commanded by the Commonwealth Court’s statutory interpretation. To apply the amendment in the “rigid” fashion adopted by the Commonwealth Court, appellant argues, conflicts with the remedial, humanitarian nature of the overall Act and would permit the General Assembly’s attempt “to address one particular problem to defeat the rights of a worker facing a much different, and much more difficult, problem entirely.” Brief for Appellant, 6, 7.</p>

In that case, this Court considered a prior version of that part of Section 309 which rendered an employer liable to pay compensation for wages earned by an employee who, at the time of injury, had been engaged in concurrent employment with multiple employers. The subsection at issue required that the employer liable for the injury have knowledge of the concurrent employment before those additional wages could be included in the calculation of the average weekly wage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The claimant in <em>Evening Bulletin </em>was a union worker who worked part-time on an as-needed basis as a substitute newspaper “mailer” and “stuffer.” The union served as the hiring agent for both newspaper employers for whom the claimant worked. This Court held that the union/hiring agent’s knowledge of the concurrent employment had to be attributed to the employer/defendant. In arriving at this conclusion, the Court discussed the development of this area of law, noting the obvious tension between employers (whose economic interest was in limiting exposure to the wages they usually paid the worker) and the employee (whose economic interest was in being made whole for the effects of the work injury).

Employer opposes what it characterizes as appellant’s attempt to calculate his benefits based upon “his own private formula.” Employer submits that the very purpose of the amendment was to “remove the practice of allowing a Claimant to choose his highest earning quarter” in calculating his average weekly wage.

The statute attempts to address in a fairly comprehensive manner those general relationships based upon the manner in which compensation is fixed, the length of employment and, to a certain extent (as with seasonal employees), the type of employment. The Section as a whole obviously is designed to ensure an accurate calculation of wages. To this end, the Assembly has provided differing methods of calculation to account for factors unique to different employment arrangements. With respect to employees paid a fixed weekly, monthly, or yearly salary, the computation is fairly straightforward. With other types of employees, however, the statute allows for the flexibility needed for accurate assessment. Thus, as amicus notes, in the case of recently hired workers, the statute permits a projection based upon the number of hours the employee was “expected” to work. 77 P.S. § 582(d.2). Similarly, with respect to seasonal employees, the statute permits deviation from a general formula focusing on the wages in a given year if, “by reason of exceptional causes,” that method of computation “does not ascertain fairly” the employees earnings, “in which case the period for calculation shall be extended so far as to give a basis for the fair ascertainment of his average weekly earnings.”</p>

The “averaging” formula adopted in these provisions should generally result in an accurate assessment of the actual average weekly wages of employees, such as appellant, who are paid on an hourly basis. That such accuracy is the aim of the amendment is corroborated both by a comparison of new subsection (d) with the old— <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>the old subsection permitted the employee to rely upon the highest calendar quarter, even if it were an aberration — and by the legislative history relied upon by the Commonwealth Court, <em>ie., </em>the remarks of Senator Armstrong, suggesting that it was necessary to “level the playing field” by eliminating the injured worker’s prior ability to rely exclusively upon an artificially peaked quarter of wages. By making the average weekly wage of these employees dependent upon an averaging of thirteen-week periods of employment, the amendment obviously was intended to lead to a calculation which would more accurately reflect the hourly worker’s true wages.</p>

We do not share the confidence of employer and the Commonwealth Court that the General Assembly must have intended by that silence to have the actual wages of the injured employee in that circumstance — unlike all other workers under the overall statutory scheme — underestimated. The fact that the General Assembly did not anticipate this precise scenario is no reason to assume that it intended a result totally at odds with the otherwise logical and consistent slant of the legislation and its humanitarian purpose. We think that it would do extreme violence to Section 309 and the overall Act to assume that the Assembly <em>sub silentio </em>intended to single out employees in circumstances such as appellant’s for special, punitive treatment based upon an unrealistic assessment of wages.</p>

Consideration of the “occasion and necessity” for the 1996 amendment, “the circumstances under which it was enacted,” the mischief it sought to remedy, the object it sought to attain, and the former law, 1 Pa.C.S. 1921(c)(1) — (5), all weigh in favor of calculating appellant’s average weekly wage based upon his quarter of full-time employment. The change effected in the legislation, as noted above, was aimed at ensuring more, not less, accuracy in the computation of average weekly wage. The mischief sought to be remedied (as revealed, in part, by the legislative history, <em>id. 1921(c)(7)) </em>— i.e., workers relying exclusively upon artificially peaked periods of pay and thereby receiving more in workers’ compensation than they would have received in the work force — is not at all implicated by appellant’s circumstances. As reflected by the decisions of the WCJ and the WCAB in the case <em>sub judice, </em>our interpretation is also consistent with the administrative interpretation of the amendment. <em>Id. </em>1921(c)(8). Finally, the consequences of our interpretation •will further the overall general purpose of Section 309 — to accurately calculate average weekly wage — while a contrary interpretation would lead, as the Commonwealth Court recognized, to a “grossly unfair weekly wage.” <em>See id. </em>1921(c)(6).

Section 309(d) likewise does not make this distinction; for wage calculation purposes, subsection (d) focuses on the <em>length </em>of employment and the amount of compensation. “Employe” and “wages,” as used in § 309(d), are not subject to two or more reasonable interpretations. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b) (“When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>spirit.”); <em>Energy Pipeline Co. v.

Under the clear language of the statute, appellant was employed for at least four consecutive, 13-week quarters in the year preceding his injury, and his part-time wages are to be included in the wage calculation. The result is not an equitable one, for a part-time employee who assumes full-time status during the last quarter before an injury receives less than if there had been no prior part-time wages.</p>
