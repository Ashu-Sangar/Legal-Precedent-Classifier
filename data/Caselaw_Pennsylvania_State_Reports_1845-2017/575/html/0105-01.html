The 120-foot tower located on the property at the time of the instant application, was erected by the Commission in 1981 and has been continuously used since that time as a critical link in the analog radio communications that serve the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> for such purposes as transmitting toll data, receiving signals from the emergency call boxes available to stranded motorists and located along the length of the highway at one mile intervals, and summoning the assistance of towing services and the state police.</p>

In the decades since their erection, tree growth in the intervening lands between the South Mountain tower and that in Valley Forge<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> has increasingly interfered with the signal.

In a written decision, the Board found and concluded inter alia that the Commission’s proposal included the removal of the existing 120-foot tower and construction at the same location of a tower 200 feet in height to be used by the Commission for radio communications along the Pennsylvania Turnpike’s Northeast Extension, by Omni-Point Communication Enterprises, L.L.P. (“Omni-Point”) as lessee for commercial cellular telephone service and, if the Commonwealth so elected, as a component of a state-wide emergency communication network; that the subject property is located in the South Mountain Conservation Zoning District as defined and regulated by the Township’s zoning ordinance in which a “radio/television transmitter or receptor”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> is a use of <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>land permitted by special exception; that Township zoning ordinance § 312(E)(57)(b) requires that such “antenna or tower shall be set back a distance equivalent to the height of the antenna or tower from all property lines ... ”; that the proposed use fails to comply with this minimum setback requirement; but that the property’s physical characteristics, including its size and configuration, combine with the setback regulation and the demonstrated fact that a tower less than 175 feet in height at this location would not function as required to serve the needs of the Commission and motorists, to produce unnecessary hardship sufficient to justify the grant of variance relief from the setback regulation.</p>

As we have noted above, the hearing transcript reveals that Board member Stefanko cast her vote in opposition to the chairman’s compromise motion, and the chairman was uncertain of and had to inquire as to the nature of member Salasky’s vote before he could announce the decision of the Board. With four members of the Board participating following member Delorenzo’s recusal, the chairman’s uncertainty as to member Salasky’s vote, in combination with the prior negative vote of member Stefanko, negates any implication that the public vote was preordained in private. Indeed, these circumstances, unless entirely disingenuous on the chairman’s part, compel the conclusion that the outcome remained uncertain until the votes were cast and counted. No one has here argued that the chairman feigned his uncertainty as to member Salasky’s vote and the record would provide no support for such an argument.</p>

The open meeting requirement has generated reluctance to discuss certain important matters; and discussions, when they occur, may not contribute to achieving a consensus position. In some agencies the pattern of decisionmaking has shifted from collegial exchanges to one-on-one encounters, transmission of views through staff, and exchanges of memoranda or notation procedure. The inhibition of collegial exchanges, in turn, impedes the members in the collective exercise of their responsibilities, and tends to weaken the role of the collegium vis-a-vis that of the staff and the agency chairman.... Although the legislative history indicates Congress believed that, after the initial period of adjustment, sunshine would not have a significant inhibiting effect on collegial exchanges, unfortunately this has not been the case.</blockquote>

In response to a letter dated February 17, 1995, signed by over one dozen current and former commissioners of multi-member federal executive agencies, the ACUS was again asked to review the federal Sunshine Act with particular emphasis on its effect on the quality of agency decisions.

Similarly, the Chairman of the American Bar Association’s Administrative Law Section opined that the federal Sunshine Act "may well have diminished the collegial character of agency decision making, created a reluctance of agency members even to discuss certain important agency matters, and shifted the decision-making process to one-on-one discussions between members, exchanging views at the staff level, and exchanging views by written memoranda.” William E.

One commentator reports that of thirty-eight states with open meeting laws that authorize invalidation as a sanction, eleven of the said laws provide for automatic invalidation. The remaining twenty-seven laws include some which permit invalidation only if the violation was “willful” or the equivalent and others which exempt from invalidation various categories of agency action such as public contracts or public debt. Others, like that of Pennsylvania, expressly authorize discretion in administration of the sanction and provide for a time limit beyond which invalidation will not be available. Charles N.
