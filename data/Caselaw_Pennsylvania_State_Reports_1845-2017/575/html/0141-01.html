    <p id="Akc" data-blocks='[["BL_288.10",288,[268,1064,1158,635]]]'>This Court granted discretionary review in this criminal appeal to address whether appellant’s two prior armed robbery convictions arose from separate criminal transactions such that appellant was properly sentenced under what is commonly termed the “three strikes” provision of the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S § 9714(a)(2) (as amended December 20, 2000, effective in 60 days). For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the courts below that appellant’s prior convictions arose from separate criminal transactions and, accordingly, appellant was properly given an enhanced sentence as a three strike offender. We therefore affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b288-11" data-blocks='[["BL_288.11",288,[267,1729,1158,633]]]'>On September 15,1999, a jury convicted appellant of escape, aggravated assault (two counts) and related offenses. The assaults occurred on January 28, 1999, when FBI Agent Charles Williams and Harrisburg City Police Officer Deborah Reigle attempted to arrest appellant on an escape charge. Rather than surrender, appellant put his vehicle into reverse and backed directly toward the officers, who had to leap out of the way of the oncoming vehicle in order to avoid being struck. Appellant rammed into Reigle’s police cruiser and, when his own vehicle became disabled, appellant fled on foot. When appellant was later apprehended, he spat in the face of a third officer, stating, “you’re lucky I didn’t have my gun.”</p>

These charges arose from appellant’s conduct on January 27, 1999, when he had a confrontation with a woman in a bar during which he punched the victim in the face, pulled out a gun, pointed it in the victim’s face and said, “I’ll kill you bitch.”</p>
    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[203,705,1154,1430]]]'>Appellant proceeded to a consolidated sentencing hearing on both cases on October 27, 1999. At the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth introduced evidence proving that appellant had previously been convicted of two armed robberies in 1991 and argued that those robbery convictions constituted two prior crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions. The Commonwealth asserted that the assault of Officer Reigle, which was graded as a first degree felony, constituted a third crime of violence for which appellant should receive a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years imprisonment pursuant to the “three strikes” law. In support of its contention, the Commonwealth introduced certified copies of the criminal indictments charging appellant with the 1991 robberies. In addition, the Commonwealth presented testimony concerning the circumstances of the prior offenses. Specifically, the Commonwealth introduced testimony that appellant and two co-defendants, John Straining and Charles Brown, robbed a person as he stood outside of the Maverick Steakhouse in Harrisburg at approximately 8:13 p.m. on the evening of February 7,1991. <em>See </em>N.T. 10/27/1999 at 10-11,16. Later that evening, at approximately 8:41 p.m., appellant and his two co-defendants robbed a second victim as she stood outside of Sisco’s Pizza Shop which is also in Harrisburg. The distance between the two locations is 3.3 miles and, the investigating detective testified, it took him approximately seven minutes to drive that particular distance at a speed of up to 45 miles per hour. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17.</p>

Straining testified that after the Maverick Restaurant robbery, the three confederates divided the money they had stolen and then drove to Sisco’s. <em>Id. </em>at 37-38. Appellant also read into the record the portion of Brown’s testimony from trial in which he testified that, as far as he could recall, Sisco’s was the next place the three men went after committing the Maverick Restaurant robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 38.</p>
    <p id="b290-5" data-blocks='[["BL_290.5",290,[268,837,1159,682]]]'>The trial court concluded that the 1991 robbery convictions constituted two predicate crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions. Accordingly, the trial court held that the instant aggravated assault conviction involving Officer Reigle qualified as appellant’s third crime of violence which triggered the “three strikes” provision. Consistently with that provision, the court sentenced appellant to a 25 to 50 year term of incarceration on this charge. The aggregate sentence imposed on all charges was 39 to 78 years of imprisonment. Appellant filed a motion to modify sentence, renewing his claim that the two prior robberies should be deemed a single transaction for purposes of Section 9714. The trial court denied the motion.</p>

The Superior Court affirmed in an unpublished opinion, with Judge Cavanaugh concurring in the result only. The panel began its analysis of appellant’s “three strikes” claim by noting that it was a challenge to the discretionary aspects of appellant’s sentence and that such a claim may only be entertained by the appellate court when there is a substantial question that the sentence is not appropriate under the Sentencing Code as a whole. Superior Court slip op. at 5. The panel then observed that Pennsylvania courts have not defined the term “transaction” for purposes of the “three strikes” law. The panel noted, however, that the fourth edition of the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines, which were <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>in effect at the time the “three strikes” provision was enacted,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> had defined “transaction” as follows:</p>

Working from this definition, the Superior Court noted that the 1991 crimes were committed approximately 28 minutes apart and more than three miles apart. The temporal and geographical separation of the crimes, the panel reasoned, “constituted a break in criminal activity.” Slip op. at 7. Thus, the Superior Court concluded that the crimes were separate criminal transactions. Accordingly, the court held that there was no substantial question as to the appropriateness of the sentence and affirmed the trial court’s judgment of sentence. This Court granted discretionary review.</p>

Appellant agrees with the Superior Court that, in construing the term “transaction” in Section 9714, this Court should look to the definition of that term which was included in the fourth edition of the Sentencing Guidelines. Appellant contends that under this definition, the two robberies were a same transaction “spree crime:” <em>i.e., </em>it was a continuous action that was not sufficiently separated in time by lawful conduct so as to comprise more than one criminal transaction. In support of this assertion, appellant notes that he received concurrent sentences of seven and one-half to fifteen years’ imprisonment for the 1991 robbery convictions, a fact which suggests that the 1991 sentencing court viewed his crimes as arising from the same transaction. <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>In addition, appellant contends that the underlying facts of the incidents show that they comprised a single criminal transaction. Specifically, appellant asserts that immediately after he and his cohorts committed the first robbery, they divided the proceeds among themselves and then proceeded to the scene of the second robbery. Appellant argues that: “[t]hey never reached a point of safety whereby ending the first conspiracy and robbery. Nor did they ever resume their normal activities.” Brief for Appellant at 10.</p>
    <p id="b292-4" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[260,792,1160,894]]]'>The Commonwealth responds that the 1991 robbery convictions arose from crimes that “were separated in time and space” and thus appellant was properly sentenced as a “three strikes” offender. The Commonwealth notes that the common meaning of “transaction” is “an act, process, or instance of transacting.” Brief for Appellee at 3 (quoting Webster’s Third New International Dictionary). The Commonwealth argues that the two robberies, which occurred twenty-eight minutes apart at different locations separated by over three miles, “constituted separate acts and, therefore, separate transactions.” <em>Id. </em>at 3. The Commonwealth agrees with appellant that it is appropriate to look to the Sentencing Guidelines’ definition of the word “transaction,” but argues that, under that definition, appellant’s two previous robberies were not a spree crime that occurred as a single continuous action, but rather were separated by sufficient time and distance to constitute a break in criminal activity.</p>

The crimes were not committed “at a single time.” Nor did the crimes constitute “temporally continuous actions that are part of the same episode, event or incident.” Rather, the robberies were discrete criminal incidents occurring at different times and in different locations over three miles apart and involving two victims with no connection to one another.

[that] occurred as continuous actions not separated in time by law abiding behavior.” Appellant did not, for example, rob the first victim outside of the Maverick Steakhouse and then immediately rob a second victim at the same location. Instead, appellant and his accomplices completed the first robbery, split the proceeds and left the scene of this crime. The trio then drove to a different location three miles away. In another apparent crime of opportunity, the three then robbed their second victim outside a pizza shop. Although the offenses were committed in relatively short proximity to one another, they were not part of a single, continuous train of criminal events with no break in criminal activity.

There, an undercover police officer bought cocaine from the appellee on four separate occasions, but only arrested him after the last transaction. The appellee pled guilty to two counts of delivering cocaine and the trial court sentenced the appellee on the first count, and then applied 18 Pa. C.S. § 7508(a)(3)(i), which enhances a defendant’s sentence if he <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense at the time of his sentencing, to the second count. Notwithstanding the fact that the appellee’s first and second count arose from a single arrest, a majority of this Court held on appeal that the appellee had properly been sentenced pursuant to the sentencing enhancement provision at § 7508(a)(3)(i). I dissented, primarily because I believed that a sentencing enhancement provision should not apply to defendants, such as the appellee in <em>Vasquez, </em>who have not been given a chance to rehabilitate themselves. <em><a href="/a2d/753/0807-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="753 A.2d 807" data-case-ids="11213327,225946" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0807-01,/pa/562/0120-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/753/0807-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="753 A.2d 807" data-case-ids="11213327,225946" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0807-01,/pa/562/0120-01">at 812</a>.</p>

Thus, while I concur in the disposition of this appeal in light of Appellant’s presentation, I maintain reservations concerning undeveloped counterarguments, particularly the position that ambiguity in the General Assembly’s use of the phrase “separate criminal transactions” entitles defendants who may be subject to the Three Strikes Law to the benefit of the rule of lenity, <em>see 1 </em>Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1) (providing that the provisions of a penal statute be strictly construed); <em>Commonwealth v.

Notably, the legislative history reflects that at least some members of the General Assembly believed that the statute would apply only where a defendant had been subject to both a first and second strike under the statute. <em>See generally </em>Legis. J. — Senate at 255 (Sept. 18, 1995) (comments of Senator Greenleaf) (explaining that, for the third strike provision to apply, the defendant would be in his late 20s or early 30s because of having served the mandatory sentences imposed under the first and second strike provisions); <em>accord id. </em>at 265 (Sept. 19, 1995); Legis. J. — House at 414 (Oct. 3, 1995). Moreover, other jurisdictions are divided concerning how to treat convictions arising out of spree type crimes under their respective habitual offender statutes, <em>see generally </em>Annotation, <em>Chronological or Procedural Sequence of Former Convictions as Affecting Enhancement of Penalty Under Habitual Offender Statutes, </em>7 A.L.R.5th §§ 2-5 (2003) (collecting cases),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> further suggesting that such relevant counterarguments should not be dismissed out of hand for purposes of future cases.</p>

For example, courts in other jurisdictions have focused upon: the location and time between the offenses, the number of victims involved, the existence of sequential docket numbers, and whether the defendant entered guilty pleas on the same date, was represented by the same • attorney, and received concurrently imposed sentences. <em>See, e.g., Chronological or Procedural Sequence of Former Convictions as Affecting Enhancement of Penalty Under Habitual Offender Statutes, </em>7 A.L.R.5th at § 2b.

Under Section 110, crimes are treated as arising from the same criminal episode where there is a temporal and logical relationship, with the latter requirement focusing upon the existence of common issues of law and fact. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hude, </em><a href="/pa/500/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="500 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1781019" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0482-01">500 Pa. 482</a>, 491-92, <a href="/pa/500/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="500 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1781019" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0482-01">458 A.2d 177</a>, 181-82 (1983). In this case, the crimes were separated by only eighteen minutes. Moreover, shared issues of law and fact arguably existed, as the crimes were perpetrated by the same co-defendants, involved identical offenses, including conspiracy, and were subject to a single investigation by the same detective. In addition, evidence of one offense would have been admissible in the trial of the other to establish, <em>inter alia, </em>identity, motive, and intent. <em>See generally </em>Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2) (providing for the admission of other crimes evidence). Indeed, in apparent recognition of such circumstances, the offenses were consolidated and charged sequentially as 1625 and 1625-A in the criminal information. <em>See generally </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 563 (governing joinder of offenses).</p>
