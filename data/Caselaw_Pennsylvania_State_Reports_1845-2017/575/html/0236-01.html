Anderson (“Anderson”) and Dr. John Doe.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The facts as alleged by Zane, and which serve as the basis for her complaint, are as follows. Zane had been admitted to the Hospital for therapy as an inpatient in August 1994. While Zane was receiving treatment at the Hospital, she befriended Anderson, a fellow inpatient. Although Zane was discharged from the Hospital on September 3, 1994, she nevertheless maintained her friendship with Anderson, visiting him on a number of occasions at the Hospital.</p>

Specifically, Anderson arranged to procure a day pass from the Hospital to visit his doctor. Zane was to meet Anderson at the Hospital and to drive him to his physician’s office. After the appointment, Anderson offered to help Zane locate an apartment in the area. However, upon meeting her, Anderson drugged Zane, kidnapped her and repeatedly assaulted her physically and sexually for the next two to three days.</p>

The Hospital requested reconsideration of the court’s order. Thereafter, on May 6, 1997, Judge Sheppard entered a second order providing that the Hospital must produce, for <em>in camera </em>inspection, all documents concerning the history Anderson gave to the Hospital, including his date of birth and social security number.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Hospital again sought reconsideration, which was denied by the court, however, the court certified the issue to the Superi- or Court for consideration pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b)(in-terlocutory appeals by permission).

The Superior Court concluded that Judge Alejandro’s order violated the coordinate jurisdiction rule. Thus, the court vacated Judge Alejandro’s order, as well as the lower court’s order granting summary judgment in favor of the Hospital, and remanded the matter for further proceedings. <em>Zane v.

To accede to a coordinate judge’s order that is clearly erroneous would be not only to permit an inequity to work on the party subject to the order, but would allow an action to proceed in the face of almost certain reversal on appellate review. Moreover, the requirement that the prior holding also create a manifest injustice serves as a significant curb on the exception so that it would apply to only those situations in which adhering to the prior holding would be, in essence, plainly intolerable.</p>

Furthermore, the Hospital maintains that if followed, Judge Sheppard’s order would have created a manifest injustice.

Similarly, it should not be considered a “manifest injustice” that an erroneous prior order will merely delay correct resolution of a case, but rather, adherence to the prior order must be such that it will cause considerable substantive harm aside from delay and, as the majority states, will result in a situation that is “plainly intolerable.” Op. at 30.

While the majority dubs this exception the "clearly erroneous” exception, which emphasizes the first prong of the test, I favor emphasizing the second prong and calling the exception the "manifest injustice” exception. My ongoing concern regarding this exception is that without strict limitations, judges will use it too liberally to reverse prior orders with which they merely disagree.
