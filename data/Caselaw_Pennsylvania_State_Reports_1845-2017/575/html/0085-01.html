    <p id="b231-7" data-blocks='[["BL_231.8",231,[200,693,1155,526]]]'>In this zoning appeal, we consider questions arising from a local zoning board’s determination that a long-standing home accounting office did not qualify as a valid nonconforming use in a residential zoning district because the homeowner did not memorialize the professional use by securing a use and occupancy permit, a requirement not previously existing. Because we find that the tribunals below erred in depriving appellant of a valid nonconforming use based upon an unsubstantiated, technical requirement, we reverse and remand the matter for issuance of a certifícate of nonconforming use.</p>
    <p id="b231-8" data-blocks='[["BL_231.9",231,[198,1244,1157,1112]]]'>Appellant owns a property in Levittown, Middletown Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in a district zoned R-2, residential. The property measures 7,320 square feet (slightly more than a sixth of an acre) and contains a single family residence. Appellant has operated a tax accounting practice out of his home since 1982. To accommodate the practice, appellant converted his dining room, which measures thirteen (13) by ten (10) feet, into an office. In 1990, appellant converted an upstairs bedroom, measuring nine (9) by thirteen (13) feet into a computer room to support the practice. In 1991, Middletown Township amended its Zoning Ordinance. Ord. 91-16, 3/26/91. In the parts relevant here, the amended Ordinance: (1) established a requirement of “a minimum lot area of one (1) acre” to conduct a “professional office” at a residential location, Ord. § 2307B (1) (b) (ii); and (2) established a requirement that “a professional office shall provide one (1) off-street parking space for each employee, plus one (1) additional space for each two hundred (200) square feet of office space.” Ord. § 2307B(l)(b)(iv). Appellant’s existing home-based business was in violation of both the minimum lot area and parking space requirements of the amended Ordinance.</p>

      <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>On September 14, 1999, in response to a notice of a zoning violation arising from his use of his residence as a professional office, appellant filed an application with appellee, Middletown Township Zoning Hearing Board (“ZHB” or “Board”), for a special exception under section 2307B and/or for variances to permit the continued operation of the accounting office as an accessory home occupation. Appellant later retained counsel and amended his application, withdrawing his request for a special exception and variances and requesting instead a certificate of nonconforming use based upon the fact that his home-based accounting practice predated the 1991 amendments to the Ordinance and was in conformity with the provisions of the prior Ordinance. On October 13, 1999, the ZHB held a hearing at which appellant, his two employees, three of his clients, and several of his neighbors testified. The matter was then continued by the ZHB to secure a legal opinion as to whether appellant had satisfied his burden. In the meantime, appellant offered to attempt to find a means to alleviate the parking and traffic congestion problems which had arisen in the past few years and had been the subject of complaints from his neighbors. At the next hearing on December 15, 1999, appellant presented evidence concerning his efforts to ease the congestion, including the fact that he was opening a second office in Philadelphia in order to divert a sizable portion of his clients from his home office and had arranged with a neighbor to lease parking space from her. The ZHB also heard additional testimony from neighbors who remained opposed to appellant’s request for a certificate of nonconforming use. At the conclusion of the second hearing, one of the ZHB members moved to grant the certificate of nonconforming use, but that motion failed by a 3-2 vote. N.T. 12/15/99, 38-42.</p>

In relevant part, the ZHB reasoned that, although it found that appellant used his home as an accounting office since prior to the 1991 amendments to the Ordinance, that use was “not a lawful use of the property” for purposes of establishing a valid noncon<a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>forming use because “[a]t no time did [appellant] apply for or receive a use and occupancy permit for the use of the property as an accounting office whether as a home occupation or otherwise.” Findings of Fact, ¶¶ 9-10. The ZHB cited to no provision in the previous Ordinance, nor any other source, which required a homeowner to secure such a permit for a home office to be deemed lawful. The ZHB also noted that, in 1997, appellant had applied for and secured a variance to permit an addition to his kitchen, without disclosing that other portions of the residence were used to conduct his accounting practice. <em>Id. </em>at ¶¶ 11-13. Apparently, the ZHB viewed appellant’s failure to mention the office in the 1997 variance application as evidence that his home accounting office was not a lawful use of his property under the township zoning restrictions in existence before the 1991 amendments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The court agreed with the ZHB that, because appellant had never obtained a use and occupancy permit reflecting the home occupation under the prior Ordinance, he could not establish a valid nonconforming use. According to the trial court, the absence of a permit rendered appellant’s long-term use of the property as a professional office unlawful. The trial court further held that the decision of the ZHB was correct for the independent reason that appellant’s operation of a professional office from his residence was now having an adverse impact on the neighborhood in the form of parking <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>and traffic problems due to recent growth in appellant’s business. In the trial court’s view, that fact supported the ZHB’s finding that appellant’s business “posed a detriment to the neighborhood” which could not be justified under the “natural expansion” doctrine.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[262,610,1166,692]]]'>Appellant appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed in a memorandum opinion that merely relied upon the trial court opinion.

As support for its argument, appellee cites to the unsworn statement of the township zoning officer at the hearing below that the township had no record that <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>appellant had ever made a “change in use application” to memorialize his home accounting office.

But, we need not reach that question here because there is simply no support in this record for the ZHB’s conclusion that such a registration of use was required under the zoning scheme in effect in this township before the 1991 amendments.

Evidence presented before the Board indicated that the use of the property had changed in the intervening years. Therefore, it would appear that in 1999, when Appellant was actually seeking the certificate, he needed to establish that the use at that time was “frozen,” i.e., the same as it was in 1991, or was within the doctrine of natural expansion. The Board made no findings of fact or law regarding the use of the property during that time period, since it denied Appellant’s request on <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>an alternative basis. The Board should address this question so that it will not be deprived of an opportunity to determine whether the expansion of Appellant’s use is detrimental to the public welfare, safety and health.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Otherwise, under the majority’s approach, Appellant may receive a certificate of nonconforming use to which he is not entitled.</p>

The trial court looked at the question related to natural expansion and concluded that the change to the property was not within the parameters of the doctrine. As the majority alludes to in its opinion, the trial court's decision to review this issue was erroneous. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 544.</p>
      <blockquote id="b246-7" data-blocks='[["BL_246.9",246,[302,1817,1130,541]]]'>"In reviewing the decision of a zoning hearing board where the trial court has not taken any additional evidence, as occurred here, our review, like that of the courts below, is limited to determining whether the board abused its discretion or committed a legal error.” Majority Opinion at 538-39 (citations omitted). Thus, the trial court’s review of the Board’s determination was limited by the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the Board. Even though Appellant raised the issue before the trial court, the trial court exceeded this limited review when it decided the natural expansion question, since the Board did not make any findings of fact or conclusions of law on this issue. If the trial court determined that this question was necessary to the resolution of the case, then the proper remedy was a remand to the Board to make findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding that issue.</blockquote>
