In support of its argument on separability, the Bureau cited the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <em>In re Ford Motor Co., </em><a href="/f3d/110/0954-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="110 F.3d 954" data-case-ids="695137" data-case-paths="/f3d/110/0954-01">110 F.3d 954</a> (3d Cir.1997), in which the appellate court held to be an appealable, collateral order, the trial courts refusal to protect as attorney work product or under the attorney-client privilege, certain internal corporate documents pertinent to the Bronco II product liability litigation. <em>Schwartz, </em><a href="/a2d/729/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="729 A.2d 547" data-case-ids="11620501,607217" data-case-paths="/a2d/729/0547-01,/pa/556/0475-01">729 A.2d at 551</a>.

The main cause of action is a defamation claim based on the allegedly defamatory statements made about Appellee. Appellate review of the constitutionality of the discovery order is not directly related to or impermissibly intertwined with the resolution of the underlying defamation claim. Consideration of whether a harmful defamatory statement was made (i.e., publication, falsity, defamatory meaning, actual malice, and actual harm) is <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>not necessary.

However, these ideals have not been said to prevent the States from effectively protecting even public officials from anonymous defamation, provided that no damages are awarded until after the public official plaintiff has proved actual malice. Additionally, the cases dealing with the right to anonymous free speech have been decided by the United States Supreme Court in the context of regulatory bans on handbills and have not been applied in the area of libel suits against public officials. Despite this contextual disconnect, this Court does not take lightly the importance of anonymous political speech.</p>

Because we determined that the privileges the Bureau had raised concerned rights rooted in public policy, we concluded that the Rule’s second prong was met. <a href="/a2d/729/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="729 A.2d 547" data-case-ids="11620501,607217" data-case-paths="/a2d/729/0547-01,/pa/556/0475-01">729 A.2d at 552</a>. In this part of our opinion, we did not consider whether the privileges or other rights the Bureau was asserting actually applied in the circumstances its case presented. Rather, it was later in our opinion, when we moved to the merits of the Bureau’s appeal, that we decided whether the Bureau’s files were privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure because of the privacy interests of third parties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Ultimately, we rejected the Bureau’s claims of privilege and other interests, and held that its files were subject to discovery. <em><a href="/a2d/729/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="729 A.2d 547" data-case-ids="11620501,607217" data-case-paths="/a2d/729/0547-01,/pa/556/0475-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/729/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="729 A.2d 547" data-case-ids="11620501,607217" data-case-paths="/a2d/729/0547-01,/pa/556/0475-01">at 553-54</a>.</p>

Accordingly, I join the majority opinion, except for those portions of the majority opinion that discuss those matters.</p>
