While there, Appellant repeatedly checked the time. Fifteen minutes later, Appellant left the home and walked to an intersection where he came across Eric Wiley, Catherine McCants’ godson. As Appellant and Wiley walked together, Appellant reiterated his plan, which he had told Wiley about a few days earlier, to rob Milton Wise and Rodney Walters because they “ran numbers” and would have cash. N.T., 3/5/01, at 106. After Wiley told Appellant that he did not want to partake in the plan, Appellant replied, “I’ll do it without you.” N.T., 3/5/01, at 111. Wiley then left Appellant and headed for McCants’ house. As he did so, Wiley saw Appellant standing in front of a vacant lot and he believed, but could not be sure, that he saw Wise and Walters standing in front of a pool hall on the opposite side of the street.</p>

Wiley saw Appellant standing over Wise, with a gun pointed at him as he lay on the ground, and then saw Walters run to Wise’s aid. Although Wiley did not see what happened next, other witnesses heard two gunshots and then saw Walters fall to the ground with his hands on his stomach. The police arrived at the scene, and Wiley gave a statement to the police describing the events as delineated above. The police also found a black ski hat and a pair of dark sunglasses at the crime scene, which were identified as the same hat and sunglasses worn by Appellant just prior to the shooting.</p>

At Appellant’s trial, the medical examiner testified that Wise died of a single gunshot wound to his left chest. McCants and her daughter-in-law also testified, placing Appellant at the scene of the crime near the time of the killings. Wiley took the stand as well, but he denied the veracity of the statement that he had made to police at the time of the shootings, asserting instead that the police had forced him to sign the statement by telling him that he would be held accountable for the murders unless he made <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>a statement implicating Appellant.

    <p id="b404-6" data-blocks='[["BL_404.6",404,[253,967,1163,1387]]]'>Appellant argues, however, that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain his first-degree murder conviction because the conviction was based primarily on Wiley’s statement to the police, which Wiley subsequently recanted at trial. Contrary to Appellant’s assertion, the mere fact that Wiley recanted a statement he had previously made to the police certainly does not render the evidence insufficient to support Appellant’s conviction. Rather, the jury was free to evaluate both Wiley’s statement to police as well as his testimony at trial recanting that statement, and free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Pitts, </em><a href="/pa/486/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="486 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="1757611" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0212-01">486 Pa. 212</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="486 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="1757611" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0212-01">404 A.2d 1305</a> (1979) (jury is free to believe all, part or none of the evidence presented). It is not for this Court to reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the fact-finder. <em>See Commonwealth v. Gibson, </em><a href="/pa/553/0648-02" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="553 Pa. 648" data-case-ids="356257,356274" data-case-paths="/pa/553/0648-02,/pa/553/0648-01">553 Pa. 648</a>, <a href="/a2d/720/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="720 A.2d 473" data-case-ids="11801152,356257" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0473-01,/pa/553/0648-02">720 A.2d 473</a>, 480 (1998) (“Credibility determinations are strictly within the province of the finder of fact; therefore, an appellate court may not reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the finder of fact.”). Moreover, in making his claim, Appellant ignores the additional circumstantial evidence that pointed to him as the killer, including the testimony of several other individuals that placed him at the scene of the crime near the time of the shooting, as well as the fact that his personal effects were found at the crime scene. Thus, Appellant’s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his first-degree murder conviction fails.</p>

Appellant appears to argue that he only had two convictions that were admissible for purposes of rebutting the Section 9711(e)(1) mitigating circumstance. As noted above, Appellant did have only two convictions that were admissible for purposes of the Section 9711(d)(9) aggravating circumstance. However, as the language of Section 9711(d)(9) and Section 9711(e)(1) make clear, a broader range of convictions are admissible for proving, and rebutting, the Section 9711(e)(1) mitigator than those that are admissible for purposes of proving the Section 9711(d)(9) aggravator. <em>Compare </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9) (listing defendant's "history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person” as an aggravator) (emphasis added) <em>with </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1) (listing defendant’s lack of "significant history of prior convictions” as a mitigator). <em>See also Wharton, </em><a href="/pa/542/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="665 A.2d 458" data-case-ids="459078,7865662" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0083-01,/a2d/665/0458-01">665 A.2d at 460</a> (if the defendant presents evidence of a mitigating factor under Section 9711(e)(1), the Commonwealth is permitted to present as rebuttal <em>all </em>of the defendant’s prior convictions)(emphasis added).</p>
