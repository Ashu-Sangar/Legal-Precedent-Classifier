At approximately 11:20 a.m., a Greyhound bus en route from New York to Pittsburgh made a scheduled stop at the terminal. Agent <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>Paret and Trooper Hodges approached the driver of the bus, identified themselves officially, and requested to examine the bus tickets of the passengers. After first allowing passengers to board or to exit the bus, Agent Paret and Trooper Hodges boarded the bus.</p>
    <p id="b352-5" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[268,602,1161,948]]]'>Once inside the bus, Trooper Hodges identified himself as a police officer and explained to the passengers the purpose of the interdiction. Agent Paret and Trooper Hodges were dressed in plain clothes, but wore jackets which clearly identified them as police officers. The officers proceeded to the rear of the bus and, while Agent Paret examined the restroom for illegal drugs, Trooper Hodges began to question the passengers. The officers physically situated themselves so that the aisle remained clear for passenger movement and the bus door was open at all times. Testimony established generally that, while performing a drug interdiction, the officers would abide by the schedule of the bus; thus, once the driver indicated that it was the scheduled time to depart, the officers would conclude their investigation and leave the bus. Additionally, in order to place the passengers at ease, Agent Paret and Trooper Hodges spoke in a normal tone of voice and, if any passenger indicated an unwillingness to cooperate, the officers would simply move on to the next passenger.</p>

Because she was in the front row, appellant was the last person Trooper Hodges approached. While talking with appellant, Trooper Hodges stood in the stairwell of the bus and Agent Paret stood behind appellant, leaving the aisle clear and the bus door open and accessible. Trooper Hodges asked appellant to see her ticket and identification, examined them and returned them to her. He then inquired about her trip, and appellant responded that she was going to Pittsburgh for five days. Since Trooper Hodges had noticed that appellant did not have a luggage claim ticket stapled to her bus ticket, he inquired about her possession of any luggage. Appellant responded that she had no luggage with her. Trooper Hodges observed a black bag on the floor of the bus between appellant’s right foot and the <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>side of the bus and asked appellant if the bag belonged to her. Appellant looked away and said that the bag did not belong to her. Trooper Hodges then asked the passenger sitting on appellant’s left-hand side if the bag was hers. That passenger also denied ownership. Trooper Hodges then held the bag up in the front of the bus and asked the other passengers if the bag belonged to any of them. After receiving no response, the officer asked again, but no one claimed the bag.</p>
    <p id="b353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[210,757,1151,1164]]]'>Trooper Hodges placed the bag on the stairwell of the bus, out of sight of appellant and the other passengers, and examined it for identifying information. Trooper Hodges found a shirt and plastic bags containing zip-lock bags which appeared to contain drugs. (Subsequent testing revealed that the plastic bags contained 496 grams of crack cocaine.) Trooper Hodges testified that, at this time, he did not believe that he had probable cause to arrest appellant, albeit he believed that the bag was hers. Trooper Hodges then asked appellant to speak with him outside the bus. In making this request, the trooper did not physically touch appellant or make any show of force other than that previously described. Appellant followed Trooper Hodges from the bus. Agent Paret remained on the bus to question the other passengers who were sitting next to and behind appellant about the bag. Outside the bus, Trooper Hodges again asked appellant if the bag was hers. Appellant again denied owning the bag. Trooper Hodges advised appellant that the police would eventually be able to identify the owner of the bag through fingerprint and hair samples. Appellant stood silent for a moment and responded that the bag was hers, but that the drugs were not, and that she was transporting them for someone else.</p>

This Court has noted that there are three basic categories of interactions between citizens and the police. The first category, a mere encounter or request for information, does not need to be supported by any level of suspicion, and does not carry any official compulsion to stop or respond. The second category, an investigative detention, derives from <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>
      <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>and its progeny: such a detention is lawful if supported by reasonable suspicion because, although it subjects a suspect to a stop and a period of detention, it does not involve such coercive conditions as to constitute the functional equivalent of an arrest. The final category, the arrest or custodial detention, must be supported by probable cause. <em>See Ellis, </em><a href="/pa/541/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="662 A.2d 1043" data-case-ids="470804,7867196" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0285-01,/a2d/662/1043-01">662 A.2d at 1047-48</a>; <em>see also In the Interest of D.M., </em><a href="/pa/566/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="781 A.2d 1161" data-case-ids="706229,9480622" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0445-01,/a2d/781/1161-01">781 A.2d at 1164</a>.

Appellant stresses the fact that she was not informed that she was free to leave and further notes that the officers placed her between them, <em>i.e., </em>Agent Paret was standing in the aisle behind her, while Trooper Hodges was in front of her in the well before the exit door of the bus. Appellant asserts that Trooper Hodges did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion to detain and question her and, therefore, he was prohibited from questioning her about the bag under her seat. In taking the bag, appellant argues, Trooper Hodges conducted an illegal seizure and the crack cocaine found in the bag must be suppressed. Appellant also argues that she cannot be deemed to have voluntarily abandoned the bag because her disavowal of ownership only followed the illegal police conduct in approaching her on the bus without suspicion. Finally, appellant argues that the statements she made to Trooper Hodges before being read her rights under <em>Miranda </em>must be suppressed because she was in custody at that point as a result of the investigative detention, while her post <em>-Miranda </em>statements are the excludable fruit of the various antecedent illegalities.</p>

On the question of abandonment, the Commonwealth echoes its view that there was no antecedent seizure, and then cites this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

The situation in <em>Bostick </em>was similar to that present here: the approach and questioning occurred “in the cramped confines of a bus.” In the view of the Florida Supreme Court, whose judgment was under review in <em>Bostick, </em>that circumstance made the critical difference, indeed, so much so that the state court had “adopted a <em>per se </em>rule prohibiting the police from randomly boarding buses as a means of drug interdiction.” In so holding, the Florida court focused on the fact that the subject of such police questioning <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>would not feel “free to leave.” <a href="/us/501/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="501 U.S. 429" data-case-ids="1108039" data-case-paths="/us/501/0429-01">501 U.S. at 435</a>, <a href="/us/501/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="501 U.S. 429" data-case-ids="1108039" data-case-paths="/us/501/0429-01">111 S.Ct. at 2386-87</a>.</p>

The Court did not dispute that the bus setting differed from encounters on the street or in other public spaces. But, the Court noted, the fact that a person on a bus may not feel free to leave is a function of his having decided to utilize a bus for travel, and not a result of coercive conduct on the part of police; accordingly, the “free to leave” test for a seizure is inapt. Instead, the relevant Fourth Amendment question is simply whether, taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, “a reasonable person would feel free to decline the officers’ requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.” <em><a href="/us/501/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="501 U.S. 429" data-case-ids="1108039" data-case-paths="/us/501/0429-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/501/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="501 U.S. 429" data-case-ids="1108039" data-case-paths="/us/501/0429-01">at 437</a>, <a href="/us/501/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="501 U.S. 429" data-case-ids="1108039" data-case-paths="/us/501/0429-01">111 S.Ct. at 2387</a>.

Having rejected the Florida Supreme Court’s approach and its <em>per se </em>rule, the Court did not offer its view on whether the encounter in <em>Bostick </em>was in fact a seizure, but instead remanded the case for reconsideration under the proper constitutional test.

The bus driver agreed and pulled over. The officers asked the driver for the passengers’ tickets, which revealed one “quick turn” ticket from Cleveland to New York and back, which indicated that the purchaser spent only eight hours in New York. The officers then boarded the bus, wearing attire indicating that they were law enforcement officials, and Agent Paret approached Polo, who had the other half of the quick turn ticket. Paret asked Polo if he had any bags, and Polo responded in the negative. The officers then matched every bag on the bus with a passenger, except for one, which Polo then claimed as his. The officers then asked Polo if they could search the bag and Polo responded “okay.” Agent Paret found cocaine in the bag and arrested Polo.</p>
