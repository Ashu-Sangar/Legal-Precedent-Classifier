Although the dog usually stayed close to the Meisers’ home when it was let out, it strayed from the property on this day, as three Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light (“PP&amp;L”) workers subsequently observed the dog roaming around the area where they were working near Route 235, almost one-half mile away from the Meisers’ home. According to the PP&amp;L workers, they last observed Chief walking away from them and across Route 235 toward two houses. They next noticed Chief a short time later, when they heard approximately five shots and saw the dog running back toward them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Just as Chief was about to cross the street, the dog yelped and flinched, and as it crossed the street, it yelped and flinched a second time.

The jury at Appellant’s trial determined that the dog killing constituted the crime of cruelty to animals, which is not one of the crimes excluded from the reach of the enhancement provision, as cruelty to animals clearly is not one of the specifically excluded offenses, nor does it require “possession of a deadly weapon as an element of the statutory definition.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=809%20A.2d%20902" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="809 A.2d 902">Id.</a> </em>§ 303.10(a)(3); <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 5511(a) (defining cruelty to animals as, <em>inter alia, </em>the willful and malicious killing of a domestic animal belonging to another person). As such, the trial court was not prohibited from applying the sentencing enhancement for use of a deadly weapon to Appellant’s conviction for cruelty to animals and therefore, the Superior Court properly affirmed Appellant’s judgment of sentence. The order of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>
