We hold that a weight of the evidence challenge need not be proffered before discharge of the jury in order to préserve the challenge for post-verdict and appellate review. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand this case for that court to consider the merits of appellee’s appeal.</p>
    <p id="b180-11" data-blocks='[["BL_180.11",180,[252,1777,1159,580]]]'>This case arises from an October 12, 1993, automobile accident in which appellee David S. King’s vehicle struck appellant Gerald Criswell’s vehicle from behind. Appellee testified that he had looked down to adjust the heater of his automobile and, by the time he looked up, it was too late to avoid hitting appellant. Appellant managed to drive his vehicle to a nearby garage, and his mother then drove him to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with a muscle strain and released the same day. On September 29, 1995, appellant filed a complaint in negligence against appellee, seeking damages for alleged injuries sustained as a result of the accident.</p>

      <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>At the ensuing one-day jury trial, appellant’s evidence consisted of his own testimony and the videotaped deposition of an expert medical witness. After describing the accident, appellant recounted the headaches and neck pain he had experienced in the ensuing months and years. Appellant also described the medical treatment he received, including corrective surgery he underwent on September 17, 1998, nearly five years after the accident. Appellant claimed that, despite these treatments and the passage of time, his pain had not significantly subsided. Appellant’s expert witness, Dr. Hani Tuffaha, a neurosurgeon who had examined him for the first time on June 24, 1998, testified that appellant had a herniated disc and that he had performed corrective surgery after determining that previous non-surgical treatments had been unsuccessful. Dr. Tuffaha further testified, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that appellant’s herniated disc and the subsequent surgery were the direct results of the 1993 automobile accident.</p>

Appellee did not challenge appellant’s version of the accident, but questioned its severity and the extent of appellant’s injuries attributable to the accident. Appellee emphasized that the surgery Dr. Tuffaha performed on appellant occurred almost five years after the accident. Appellee’s medical expert, Dr. Paul S. Lin, an orthopedic surgeon, testified that he had examined appellant on April 14, 1999. Dr. Lin stated that a review of appellant’s medical records revealed no history of neck problems before the accident and that appellant stated that he had no neck pain prior to the accident. Based upon his assumption that appellant truthfully relayed the onset and nature of his symptoms, Dr. Lin noted that he had assumed that appellant’s herniated disc resulted from the automobile accident.</p>

Neither party objected to the content or phrasing of the interrogatories. Forty-five minutes after deliberations began, the jury returned with a verdict. In response to the negligence interrogatory, the jury answered “Yes.” In response to the causation interrogatory, the jury answered “No.” Accordingly, the jury did not answer the damages interrogatory.</p>

Appellant subsequently moved for a new trial, and also alleged that the trial court had erred in failing to enter a directed verdict in his favor. On October 22, 1999, one week after the verdict, appellant filed a timely motion for post-trial relief, which included a request for a new trial based on the jury’s verdict being against the weight of the evidence.

In its subsequent opinion, the trial court noted that appellee had “more or less conceded his negligence” and the issue of causation “was so apparent that most of the expert testimony was concerned with the nature and extent of [appellant’s] injuries and whether [appellant] had fully recovered rather than the underlying cause of these injuries.” Because the evidence should have led to a jury finding that appellee’s negligence had caused appellant damage, the trial court concluded that “the jury’s verdict on the causation issue was so contrary to the weight of the evidence as to shock one’s sense of justice,” thus warranting a grant of a new trial.

The panel majority concluded that the causation interrogatory in this matter was identical to the interrogatory at issue in <em>Picea </em>and that the <em>Picea </em>panel had found that this circumstance rendered the jury’s verdict ambiguous:</p>

The issue is one of importance because the Superior Court and the Commonwealth Court have struggled with the holding in <em>Picea, </em>issuing several opinions which either limit or arguably contradict that holding and which, in turn, call into question the propriety of the panel decision in this case, which hewed to <em>Picea </em>despite contrary intervening authority. As the question before us is one of law, our review is plenary. <em>Phillips v.

    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[268,862,1158,1326]]]'>Appellant notes that the Superior Court decision in <em>Picea </em>is built upon this Court’s decision in <em>Philadelphia Police Dept. v. Gray, </em><a href="/pa/534/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="534 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1839702" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0467-01">534 Pa. 467</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="534 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1839702" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0467-01">633 A.2d 1090</a> (1993). In <em>Gray, </em>this Court held that, when a party seeks to challenge a jury verdict on grounds that the jury returned inconsistent answers to interrogatories, an objection to the inconsistency must be raised when the verdict is rendered. In so holding, <em>Gray </em>relied upon this Court’s landmark issue preservation decision in <em>Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/457/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="457 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="477868" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0255-01">457 Pa. 255</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="322 A.2d 114">322 A.2d 114</a> (1974), which abrogated the basic and fundamental error doctrine and required parties to preserve issues for appeal by making contemporaneous objections at trial. Citing to Judge Musmanno’s concurrence below, appellant notes that the verdict in this case — finding appellee negligent but finding that the negligence was not a substantial factor in causing appellant’s harm — is not inconsistent, but merely “disappointing and troublesome.” Correspondingly, appellant notes, verdict inconsistency was not the basis for his weight of the evidence challenge; rather, appellant’s argument was that the jury’s finding that appellee’s negligence was not a substantial factor in causing his injuries was contrary to the testimony of both medical experts, who opined that the accident did cause appellant’s neck injuries. Because verdict inconsistency was not the basis for his post-verdict challenge, appellant argues, the Superior Court was wrong to apply <em>Gray’s </em>waiver rule to him.</p>
    <p id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.6",184,[266,2211,1157,149]],["BL_185.1",185,[199,314,1153,1543]]]'>Appellee counters by noting that <em>Gray </em>extended the <em>Dilliplaine </em>waiver doctrine to encompass claims premised upon inconsistent jury verdicts, and that the Superior Court “wisely <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>extended” <em>Dilliplaine/Gray </em>waivers to circumstances where a jury verdict is ambiguous (as revealed in interrogatories). Appellee does not dispute that a jury verdict finding that appellant had suffered no harm at all would be contrary to the weight of the evidence. But appellee argues that the jury’s verdict on causation in this case was ambiguous. This is so because, although appellant testified to the injuries and medical treatment he received in the two months immediately following the accident, he introduced no medical testimony concerning that treatment, but instead primarily focused his evidence of “harm” on the diagnosis of a cervical disc herniation and corrective surgery which occurred nearly five years after the car accident and after a substantial gap in medical treatment. Appellee notes that he contested the causal link between the accident and the later-claimed diagnosis and surgery. Given this evidentiary background, appellee submits that the jury may well have assumed that the “overly broad” causation interrogatory was asking it only to determine whether appellee’s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the latter harm. Since it is not apparent which “harm” the jury was referring to in its verdict on causation, appellee submits, the verdict was ambiguous. Appellee argues that appellant was required to object to the verdict when rendered so that the trial court could attempt to resolve the ambiguity by resubmitting the matter to the jury. In appellee’s view, such a requirement would forward the salutary function of the general <em>Dilliplaine </em>rule, which is to allow for the correction of errors in the trial court, thereby eliminating avoidable appeals.</p>

Second, the trial court may promptly correct the asserted error. With the issue properly presented, the trial court is more likely to reach a satisfactory result, thus obviating the need for appellate review on this issue. Or if a new trial is necessary, it may be granted by the trial court without subjecting both the litigants and the courts to the expense and delay inherent in appellate review. Third, appellate courts will be free to more expeditiously dispose of issues properly preserved for appeal. Finally, the exception requirement will remove the advantage formerly enjoyed by the unprepared trial lawyer who looked to the appellate court to compensate for his trial omissions.</blockquote>

The challenge does not dispute the power of the jury to render the verdict it rendered, nor does it even allege any facial error in the verdict of the jury (be it, in the eyes of the challenger, a flaw, an inconsistency or a total injustice). Assuming that the case properly was ripe for jury <em>consideration </em>— i.e., neither of the parties was entitled to a directed verdict because a properly joined issue of material fact remained for resolution — the jury is fully empowered to rule in favor of either or any party. The basis for a weight claim derives from the fact that the trial court, like the jury, had an opportunity to hear the evidence and observe the demeanor of the witnesses; the hope and expectation animating a weight challenge is that the trial court will conclude that the verdict was so contrary to what it heard and observed that it will deem the jury’s verdict such a miscarriage of justice as to trigger the courts time-honored and inherent power to take corrective action.</p>

Super. 324" data-case-ids="725717" data-case-paths="/pa-super/445/0324-01">445 Pa.Super. 324</a>, <a href="/pa-super/445/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="665 A.2d 514" data-case-ids="725717,7866701" data-case-paths="/pa-super/445/0324-01,/a2d/665/0514-01">665 A.2d 514</a>, 517 (1995), for instance, the Superior Court cites <em>Gray </em>for the proposition that the "failure to object to [an] obviously inconsistent verdict will waive [the] right to request [a] new trial in post-trial motions.” <em>Gray </em>speaks to waivers of issues and not waivers of rights to certain types of relief.</p>

The Commonwealth Court has also read <em>Picea </em>as inapplicable where a party claims that a jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence. <em>See Cipolone v.

The note to Rule 227.1(b)(1) recognizes that “[i]f no objection is made, error which could have been corrected in pre-trial proceedings or during trial by timely objection may not constitute a ground for post-trial relief.” (emphasis added).</p>
