On December 10,1997, Appellee filed a petition for child support. After conducting a support conference, the trial court ordered Appellant to pay $344.00 per month for child support, arrears of $69.00 per month, and 42% of the children’s unreimbursed medical expenses. On June 9, 2000, Appellee filed a petition for modification requesting an increase in child support due to a change in circumstance of Appellant’s employment. After conducting a modification conference on October 10, 2000, the trial court found that Appellant’s net income was $3,155.56 per month. The trial court ordered Appellant to pay $907.00 in child support plus arrears of $182.00 per month. Appellant was also required to pay 41% of unreimbursed medical expenses. Despite Appellant’s objections to the contrary, the trial court included a credit to Appellee for her payment of the health insurance premium for her and the children, including that portion of the premium that pays for Appellee’s coverage. Appellant demanded a <em>de novo </em>hearing, after which the trial court issued its December 7, 2000 order requiring Appellant to pay $889.00 in child support per month, $178.00 in arrears per month, and 41% of unreimbursed medical expenses.</p>

For example, in a situation where an ex-spouse suffers from a serious illness, a trial court may determine that it is appropriate for the other spouse to continue to provide health insurance. Depending on the severity of the illness, it may be that health insurance is of greater importance to the ill spouse than is the receipt of alimony.
