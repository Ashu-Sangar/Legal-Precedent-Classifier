During the course of proceedings, the parties reached a settlement agreement, dividing their marital assets. On October 19, 1999, the trial court entered a consent order setting forth the terms of their agreement, which provided the divorce could be finalized when the terms of the settlement were completed. Unfortunately, husband died before all those terms were carried out, and no final divorce decree was entered.</p>

The executor of the estate obtained a citation directing wife to show cause why the marital assets allocated to husband by the settlement agreement should not be turned over to the estate. The trial court granted the executor’s motion, and ordered the assets turned over to the estate. The trial court based its decision on <em>Reese v. Reese, <a href="/pa-super/351/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="351 Pa.

The husband petitioned to vacate the equitable distribution order after the wife died (before a divorce decree was entered, but after the action was bifurcated). The Superior Court acknowledged the divorce action abated upon the death of the wife, but concluded the existence of a final distribution order, and the fact the parties acted in reliance upon the order, made it binding upon them. Although the Superior Court suggested that entering an equitable distribution decree prior to a di<a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>vorce decree was improper, the court determined that since the husband invoked the jurisdiction of the court, received the relief he requested, and acted upon the court’s order, he would not be permitted to “blow hot and cold.” The Court concluded the husband was estopped from challenging the trial court’s jurisdiction to enter the order; hence, the equitable distribution order was not destroyed by the death of one of the parties.</p>

    <p id="b736-4" data-blocks='[["BL_736.5",736,[275,670,1156,406]]]'>However, marital settlement agreements are governed by the law of contracts. <em>Vaccarello v.

The pending divorce may be the impetus for the contract, but it is an agreement nevertheless, made in lieu of having the court divide the property. Once such a contract is made, though fulfillment may be delayed until entry of the final divorce decree, the contract is still enforceable.</p>
    <p id="b736-5" data-blocks='[["BL_736.6",736,[273,1112,1158,736]],["BL_737.1",737,[217,322,1149,247]]]'>Wife argues this is an executory contract,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and since husband died before its execution, the contract is not capable of completion. This is not the law of this Commonwealth, and wife’s failure to support her position is indicative of this. The agreement is still enforceable though the parties may no longer divorce. A marital settlement agreement, while requiring performance from each party, is not necessarily unique to the respective parties. Thus, an executory contract that is not personal to a decedent does not dissolve upon death. <em>See In re Allam’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/199/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="199 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="922867" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0573-01">199 Pa. 573</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.%20252" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="49 A. 252">49 A. 252</a> (1901); <em>see also Stumpfs Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/116/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="116 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="554373" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0033-01">116 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.%20866" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="8 A. 866">8 A. 866</a> (1887). In other words, if the contract can be completed by the estate of a party, it is not void due to the death of a party. <em>See, e.g., Huffman v. Huffman, </em><a href="/pa/311/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="311 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1146276" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0123-01">311 Pa. 123</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20570" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="166 A. 570">166 A. 570</a> (1933) (estate <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>can complete contract that is not strictly personal to decedent). Since husband’s estate is capable of completing the terms of the settlement agreement, the agreement did not dissolve upon husband’s death. Accordingly, the Superior Court’s decision is affirmed.</p>

But this matter was bifurcated — at Wife’s request. Wife does not suggest that when the trial court entered the consent order, it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, only that jurisdiction in that forum is now lost.
