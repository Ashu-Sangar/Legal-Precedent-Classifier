    <p class="summary" id="b74-11" data-blocks='[["BL_74.9",74,[305,936,1163,1205]]]'>It alleged that, on the 8d of March 1856, Henry Musselman, David Bair, Benjamin Eshleman, and John Gyger (the defendant) entered into partnership as bankers in the city of Lancaster, each to invest an equal portion of the capital, which was so done, and each to receive an equal share of the profits; the partnership was carried on until the 2d of July 1859, when it was dissolved by mutual consent. The business was carried on in a house in East King Street, Lancaster, which, during most of the time of the partnership, and at its dissolution, was partnership property: immediately on the dissolution of the partnership, the defendant commenced banking in the same house and continued until the 4th of May 1864. On the 6th of August 1860, Bair sold his interest, being one-fourth, to Joseph Clarkson, one of the plaintiffs. After the dissolution, all the partnership assets passed into the hands of the defendant together with the goodwill of the business; the defendant undertook to collect the assets and pay the balance to the retiring partners. The defendant by agreement with them, was to occupy the banking-house and account for the rent; the rent of the house was worth $800 per annum, and if there had been no agreement to pay rent he should pay that amount for use and occupation. The defendant has settled no account of the partnership estate although frequently requested, but pretends that the profits have been absorbed by expenses and that he ought not to pay rent because he has occupied the house in settling the affairs of the firm, and is entitled to the rent for his services. The plaintiffs charge that there is a large balance due to them, that the defendant is not entitled to compensation for settling the affairs.</p>

Obviously, therefore, the policy to be pursued in settling the affairs of the partnership (with reference to the interests of the persons composing it), was, as far as practicable, without detriment to its credit,, to protract that settlement, thus enabling them to avail themselves of opportunities to realize doubtful assets, which, in the course of time, it might be hoped or expected would occur. This policy Mr. Gyger pursued, with a success which, while unquestionably attributable in part to his own efforts and the extent of his resources, was, in a still greater degree, due to the expansion of the currency and general improvement in business which followed the breaking out of. the war, as well as to the fact that, at the time <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>of the dissolution of the firm, its credit was entirely unimpaired. Instead of closing, he continued, to some extent, the business of the firm, renewing certificates of deposit and notes, and receiving new deposits (mainly from old depositors), and occasionally discounting paper. The deposits made -with the old firm while its business was in the course of settlement were quite considerable in amount, being, during some years, not less than $120,000, and in the fourteen months preceding the establishment of the First National Bank, reaching the sum of $120,074. The paper discounted was not large in amount, being, during the first year after the dissolution, about $2400, and during each subsequent year considerably less. During the whole space of time between the dissolution and the final closing of the concern, it is conceded that the discounts did not amount to more than $10,000. By continuing to receive deposits, Mr. Gyger was placed in possession of funds for the discharge of accruing liabilities at a very moderate rate of interest, and when necessary he advanced money from his own resources — always, however, charging the firm with interest at the legal rate. He thus was enabled to postpone the winding up of the business until it could be accomplished most advantageously forjhe partners, and finally succeeded in realizing nearly, if not all of the doubtful assets, and in obtaining for the real estate a price considerably larger than could have been had at the time of the dissolution. The business was closed not only without loss, but with some profit. Out of that profit he has paid to B. Eshleman and H. Musselman, partners, and Joseph Clarkson, transferee of David Bair, the remaining partner, each the sum of $1000.”</p>

In some cases it has been held that the period of the dissolution of a partnership is the proper time to make a rest for this purpose: Stoughton <em>v. </em>Lynch, 2 Johns. Ch. R. 209; Hollister <em>v. </em>Barkley, <a href="/nh/11/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 N.H. 501" data-case-ids="6755847" data-case-paths="/nh/11/0501-01">11 N. H. 501</a>. Judge Story has laid down a different rule. “Interest,” he says, “is not allowed upon partnership accounts generally, until after a balance is struck on a settlement between the partners, unless the parties have otherwise agreed or acted in their partnership concerns:” Dexter <em>v. </em>Arnold, 3 Mason 289. Vice-Chancellor Sandford, of New York, in Beacham <em>v. </em>Eckford, 2 Sandf. Ch. R. 116, after a review of all the authorities, came to the conclusion that there is no general rule established, but that the allowance or refusal of interest depends upon the circumstances of each particular case. This seems much the safest principle to adopt in view of the confidential relation of the parties, and the variety and complication of such accounts. No unbending rule could be laid down which would not, in particular instances, work great injustice.</p>

Mr. Gyger undertook to liquidate the business of a banking firm with a large amount of outstanding and doubtful debts due to it, and a correspondingly large amount of liabilities. To do so without loss, it was necessary that he should continue to receive deposits and issue certificates of loan, by which he was enabled, in effect, to borrow at a low rate of interest, in order to meet the liabilities as they fell due. For this purpose he was also at first compelled to make advances. Thus he gained time for the collection and conversion of the assets, <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>■which, after much trouble and considerable litigation, he accomplished without serious loss. Of his diligence and fidelity there is no question. He occupied the banking-house of the old firm, and as he used a part of it for his private business, he is very properly charged with a fair rent for such part. The master has, however, added interest on this rent as well as upon a balance, which he strikes May 1st 1865, a date adopted, probably, in reference to the sale of the banking-house. He allows him interest on the amounts advanced by him before that period. According to well-settled principles, he has disallowed all compensation for his services in liquidating the business: Beatty <em>v. </em>Wray, 7 Harris 516; Brown <em>v. </em>McFarland, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20129" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Wright 129">5 Wright 129</a>. Had Mr. Gyger proceeded immediately to press the collection of the debts due to the bank, it is highly probable there would have been no capital or profits to divide, if the partners would not have been obliged, out of their separate estates, to meet a considerable deficit. It was impossible for him to know at any time what the balance really was until it was finally ascertained and struck by the master; -for it is to be observed that there was no agreement as to what amount of rent should be paid, and the apportionment of the expenses between his own private business and that of the old firm, carried on in the same building and by the same clerks and servants, had to be settled. He might not unreasonably expect that under the circumstances his late copartners would not object to allow him a reasonable compensation for his services. The rule which denies it altogether in his case works hardly, for the whole trouble and responsibility were thrown upon him. He did make a partial distribution of funds in his hands — at what time we are not informed. In view of these facts we are of the opinion that the d'ate of the actual settlement and ascertainment of the balance is the period from which it would most comport with equity to compute the interest. The account should therefore be corrected by striking out the item of credit of $219.82, on one side, and the items of charge of $801.40 and $777.19 on the other side.</p>

In equity costs do not always follow a decree against a party. They rest on the sound discretion of the court, and are to be awarded or refused, according to the justice of each particular case: 3 Daniell’s Ch. Pr. 2. It has been decided that wherever an account is intricate or doubtful, there should be no costs, Pitt <em>v. </em>Page, 1 Bro. P. C. 1, and this is especially applicable to partnership accounts: Collyer on Partn.. 339. In such cases the costs are usually divided, or what is practically the same thing, are taxed on the partnership effects: Hutcheson <em>v. </em>Smith, 5 Irish Eq. 117; Jones <em>v. </em>Morhead, 3 B. Monroe 385; Taylor <em>v. </em>Cawthorne, <a href="/nc/17/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Dev. Eq. 221" data-case-ids="8687665" data-case-paths="/nc/17/0221-01">2 Dev. Eq. 221</a>. There were conflicting claims in this case on both sides, and each party has <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>been found as to some of them to be in the wrong. There wert questions of real doubt and difficulty as to the amount of rent, and the apportionment of expenses as well as to interest and compensation. It is not easy to see how they could have been settled without a suit or a reference to mutual friends. We cannot give so much weight as the master has done to the general denial by defendant in his answer of liability to account. It was not that which rendered the suit unavoidable. The costs of this litigation appear; therefore, to be a necessary expense in consequence of the disputes between the parties in closing up the concerns of this copartnership. It is an item in the amount of profit and loss, which it would have been much better for all the partners to have saved by mutual concessions or otherwise, but which cannot in equity be charged upon one of them exclusively: Caldwell <em>v. </em>Zeiber, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Paige%20Ch.%20508" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="7 Paige Ch. 508">7 Paige 508</a>. We are of the opinion that all the costs in the court below as well as the costs of this appeal should be paid out of the partnership money in the hands of the defendant, John G-yger, and that he should be allowed a credit therefor in his account.</p>
