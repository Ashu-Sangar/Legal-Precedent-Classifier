L. 568, to Clarion county. By the 2d section of the first act it is made the duty of the county treasurer to give thirty days’ notice of a time previous to the 1st day of August in each year when he would attend at places designated in the notice to receive the taxes of the respective boroughs and townships. By the 3d and 4th sections of the act it is provided that if any taxes remain unpaid for thirty days after the 1st of August, the treasurer shall issue his warrant with- a schedule of unpaid taxes, and upon his delivering the same to the constable of any township, he shall charge the constable with the amount, from which the constable and his sureties shall be discharged only on paying such amount after deducting exonerations, &amp;c. By the 5th section, the Court of Quarter Sessions before appointing constables shall take from them a bond to the Commonwealth in such sum and with such sureties as the court shall approve, conditioned for the faithful discharge of their duties under the act, and for the payment to the county treasurer of the amount of taxes contained in any.warrant and schedule delivered to them, after deducting exonerations, &amp;c. On the 6th of May 1861, W. W. McClelland was appointed constable of Porter township, and entered into bond in the sum of $500 with Elisha McClelland and Jarius Thompson as his sureties, the amount of the bond and the sureties having been approved by the court. The amount of the duplicate of Porter township delivered to Burns was $1889.99; having collected some part of it, he put a warrant and schedule of the balance into the hands of McClelland, the constable, on the 2d of September 1861. McClelland accounted to Burns by payments and exonerations for this balance except $651.69. On the settlement of Burns’s accounts by the auditors in January 1862, a balance of $9881.84 including the $651.69 of the Porter township duplicate was reported to be in his hands. He paid the whole amount to his successor in ofiice.</p>

The legislature often exercises the right to exempt property liable to taxation, and in other instances increases the liability to taxation. It changes county sites, and orders roads to be opened and bridges to be built at the expense of the counties. No one disputes the exercise of such powers by the legislature. There is nothing in the constitution which expressly or impliedly forbids such interference; nor anything which forbids its interference with the accounting officers of a county, so far as tq,the mode and manner to be pursued in settling, and what shall constitute a finality in the settlement of public accounts. We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that the Act of Assembly of the 8th April 1864, “ for the relief of James T. Burns, late treasurer of Clarion county,” directing the opening and resettlement of his accounts, by the county auditors, on equitable grounds, is entirely within the power of the legislature.</p>
    <p id="b425-8" data-blocks='[["BL_425.10",425,[161,1580,1165,862]],["BL_426.1",426,[258,422,1161,87]]]'>The idea advanced that their former settlement is to be regarded as a decision standing on the footing of a judicial decision, is an entire mistake. The auditors are not judicial officers in any sense. They act ministerially, and the finality of their action rests on positive enactment, and is not inherent, like judicial action. The legislature cannot, it is true, assume the functions of the judiciary. That is settled in many cases, amongst which are De Chastellux <em>v. </em>Fairchild, 12 Harris 18, and Baggs’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20512" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Wright 512">7 Wright 512</a>, and other later cases to the same effect. The plain reason is that the legislature possess no ordinary judicial powers any more than does the judiciary possess legislative. Hence, in the first of the above cases it was held that an Act of Assembly directing a court to grant a new trial was void. This overruled a heresy which had crept'into the case of Braddee <em>v. </em>Brownfield, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 271" data-case-ids="1853577" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0271-01">2 W. &amp; S. 271</a>. Having the power to direct the county auditors to open the settlement of the late treasurer’s accounts and readjust and resettle them, the legislature also possessed the right assuredly further to express, with binding effect, the purpose in view in opening the settlement; and it did this by requiring the auditors, with the approval of the county commissioners, to open the settlement of <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>bis accounts “and resettle and equitably adjust tbe same.” An equitable adjustment was tbe object.</p>

Under such circumstances, we think, if they were established by competent proof, the defendant was entitled to the equity which the Act of Assembly recognised, and of which the title of the act is evidence, being an act entitled “ An act for the relief of James Burns, former treasurer of Clarion county.”</p>
    <p id="b427-6" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[205,734,1167,693]]]'>But the auditors did not regard the claim thus arising, or for some other reason, as equitable, and decided against the meditated relief. Then the case came to be tried on appeal. Here we think the court was bound to try the case on the equitable grounds intended should be administered by the auditors, and the issue was so framed as to admit of this fully. Trial on any other grounds would nullify the relief meditated. It would have been a mockery to have required the auditors to proceed and adjust equitably, and allow the court on the appeal to proceed on strict legal principles. The opening and readjusting were all to be done on equitable grounds, wherever done — either before the auditors or in court, on appeal, or the intention of the statute might be entirely set aside. The rule for the auditors was to be the rule for the court, as it was but part of the machinery in the settlement of these municipal accounts. Both tribunals were bound to act upon the equities of the defendant as intended by the act.</p>
    <p id="b427-7" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[207,1427,1166,776]]]'>But the court on the appeal did not do so. It set up, or rather administered, the very doctrine which made the appeal for legislative interposition necessary. It defeated the legislative object in doing so. In controlling the county officers as the legislature might do in the particular of opening the accounts of the treasurer, and prescribing a rule for resettlement, it impliedly directed that the rule of law applicable to a case'of voluntary payment should be waived. But it was insisted on, and admitted by the court, and in this we think there was error. It was a case in which the legislature might interpose to prescribe a rule, and it did so, and what it prescribed should have been followed out. But the court ruled that a voluntary payment by the defendant, into the treasury, of the deficit of the constable could not be recovered back from the county. As a rule of law nothing could be truer than this. But this was not the rule on which this case was designed by the legislature to be tried, as already said. It defeated the justice intended to be the rule in the defendant’s case so to try it.</p>

If proved, and established and shown that the defendant was a loser by the officer of the township and his deficient sureties, in view of the legislative action referred to, we think this circumstance should-have been regarded as calling <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>for the administration of equity to relieve him from the consequences thereof. This would be an equity in favor of the defendant if nothing inequitable were shown to set it aside; such as negligence in pursuing the principal and his sureties, if such pursuit might have resulted in recovering the deficiency, or any portion of it. The object of directing a readjustment of the accounts of the defendant by the auditors, and the allowance of an appeal, was to test whether his equitable claim for opening the former settlement stood clear of inequitable or illegal conduct on his part. This was the reason for submitting the whole matter to readjustment and settlement, instead of directing him to be reimbursed at once. If so, his equities should have .been recognised. The court below should have tried the case on these equitable principles, and not have ruled the defendant out on a sharp and unbending rule of the common law. We have said enough, however, to disclose our opinion of the assignment of error, in this case. It is sustained, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>
