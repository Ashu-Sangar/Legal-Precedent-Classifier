Gallaher the land as described in the deed to him, and on the 12th of December 1865 Gallaher conveyed in the same way to the defendant. Estimating by the courses and distances in the deed the contents would be 33 acres and 14 perches. The defendant claimed that although the courses and distances would enclose but 33 acres and 14 perches, yet the <em>actual </em>survey made on the ground by one Cummins at the time of Schweier’s purchase would *make the contents of the tract 62 acres or more, and that he was entitled to hold this quantity of land; he accordingly took possession of the whole. For the excess which was over the 33 acres, and which lay west of them, this action was brought. The plaintiff gave evidence to establish her case as stated above; her witnesses who were surveyors testifying that they found marks on the lines and at the corners corresponding with the calls in the deeds. Plaving closed, the defendant called Joseph Middagh, a surveyor, who testified that he ran the line “south 57J° west;” at the distance, 58 perches, called for in the deed to Schweier, found no corner; he continued further along a well-marked line, and found a stone heap at the distance of 101 perches; he started from the stone heap north 15° west, and found the line well-marked, and at the end of 130 perches came to a white oak corner; he then ran by the next course and distance in the deed to a pine, and thence north 89° east 98 perches to a stone heap, thence as in the deed; to the beginning; his survey made 62 acres 18 perches. G. W.1 Jacobs, another surveyor, who also had made a survey, testified substantially as Middagh. He was informed by a neighbor whilst running, that the corner at the end of 101 perches on the first line had been made by Cummins; he also testified that from information he got on the line and from Cummins’s draft, he was of opinion that Cummins had run the second line from the stone heap at the end of the 101 perches.</p>

Schweier accepted the conveyance, and always claimed and occupied by tiñese lines. The defendant, a subsequent purchaser, discovered a line extending beyond the point 58 perches west of the Haines corner some 42 perches, of the same age with that of the line to that point, making the line <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>west from the last named corner 101 perches to a post and stones, and from thence, a line N. 18° west 129 perches to a white oak, and so on around to the place of beginning. These boundaries contain upwards of 60 acres, and the defendant contends that that was the actual survey made for the purpose of executing the conveyance between Riekabaugh, the vendor, and Schweier, the vendee, and to which the principle that the lines on the ground must apply, and is to control the courses and distances in the deed, and that the deed must be held to cover this territory, notwithstanding it contains nearly twice the number of acres actually agreed to be conveyed.</p>
    <p id="b285-6" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[165,895,1171,690]]]'>The learned judge very properly held that this would be so in the absence of fraud or mistake in running the lines. That there 'was mistake, at least on part of the surveyor, if he meant to return those lines to the party, is demonstrable. The area embraced proves this. He was to start at a fixed point and run a certain course and distance, and from thence cut off 32 acres; instead of which he almost doubled the length of the first line, and included almost double the amount he was to set off. There was mistake or fraud here, which would prevent the principle invoked from applying. The defendant could not claim to reform his deed by a mistaken survey; and consequently could not defend on the equitable idea that, as he was entitled to have the deed reformed, it was to be considered as reformed so as to extend to the limits of that survey, if that survey was a mistake; and whether it was a mistake or not, was submitted.to the jury, with a very strong and very proper expression of opinion that the line was a mistake.</p>
    <p id="b285-7" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[174,1585,1167,805]]]'>In fact, it seems to me there was evidence on the ground, to show that the boundaries in the deed, were run at the same time, either immediately before or immediately after the larger boundaries were now claimed to. I think the evidence of this would have been sufficient to have carried the case, but the defendant had his theory, which it was necessary to dispose of, and it was well disposed of by leaving the question of fraud or mistake in running the lines alluded to, to the jury. It might have been more satisfactorily disposed of by simply leaving to the jury, the question whether the smaller survey was not the true survey made and reported by the surveyor, and by which the deed was made. But still, the course adopted was unobjectionable, and there was no error in ruling as the learned judge did therein. The defendant could not pretend to be an innocent purchaser of the 60 acres without notice. The title disclosed that there was but 32, and not 60 acres in the purchase of Schweier from Riekabaugh, and there is no evidence that he bought more. If he did, it was his own folly not to be warned by what appeared in the line of his title.</p>
