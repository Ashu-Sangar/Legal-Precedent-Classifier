Wynkoop, in the House of Refuge of Western Pennsylvania, from its date; and the courts, upon a fair construction of the preceding acts, have arrived at the conclusion, that this was also the rule before its passage. This seems reasonable, and it is supported by the difference not only of language, but of the subject-matter between persons convicted of crimes and sentenced to the Eastern or Western Penitentiaries, the expenses of keeping whom are necessarily borne by the respective counties in which they are convicted; and vicious and incorrigible children who may be committed tb the House of Refuge by any mayor of any city, alderman or justice of the peace within the western district.</p>
