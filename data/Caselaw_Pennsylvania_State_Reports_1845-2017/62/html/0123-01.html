About 1824 the tract was divided, Solomon Hollar became the owner of one-half and Jacob Ripley of the other. On the 12th of May 1824, Ripley conveyed hi§ part, containing about 224 acres, to Abraham Sparks, and on the 25th of April, 1887, Sparks made a deed to Solomon Hollar for this part; a patent for the whole tract was made to Hollar, May 16th 1887. The executor of Solomon Hollar, under authority in his will, conveyed the land to the plaintiff in Í859. The defendants, who claimed under Sparks, alleged and gave evidence for the purpose of. proving that Sparks made the deed to Hollar not to transfer the title, but merely to enable Hollar to have the whole tract included in one patent and thus save expense: they also gave evidence of acts of ownership by Sparks for a great number of years, by quarrying, cutting timber, selling stone and timber, &amp;c., the land being unimproved. In rebuttal the plaintiff gave evidence that Sparks bought the land from Ripley for Solomon Hollar, who furnished him with the purchase-money; that Hollar paid the taxes constantly for thirty-two years, that Sparks had not returned it for assessment, &amp;c., with other evidence in answer to the defendants’ case.</p>

This is the rule, unless the jury find that Sparks took possession of the land, and brought himself within the principle that, when the <em>cestui que trust </em>has taken and continued in the possession of the land, the trust will be deemed to have been executed. But here it is proper to inquire into the nature of the possession or entry that will have the force of a formal and written execution of the trust. No case has been produced that defines it precisely. We take it that it should have, at least, some of the characteristics of a possession to defeat a legal title under the Statute of Limitatipns. It should be exclusive, distinct and adverse to the claim of the legal owner. It may, however, bear more resemblance to an entry by the owner of the legal title, that tolls the Statute of Limitations, which is <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>accurately described in Hoopes <em>v. </em>Garver, 3 Harris 525. In this case Justice Chambers cites the case of Holtzapple <em>v. </em>Phillibaum, <em>4 </em>Wash. C. C. R. 356, in which ‘it is ruled that to constitute a legal entry on land to avoid the’bar of the statute, the party must enter with intent to claim the possession, and must do some act to prove that such was his intention, by acts amounting to a trespass on the land, or he must declare that he enters for the purpose of claiming or taking possession. No particular form of words is prescribed by the law ; the substantial part is the taking or declaring an intention to take or claim possession.’ In Altemus <em>v. </em>Campbell, C. J. Gibson says : ‘ An entry on land avoids the operation of the Act of Limitation, if accompanied by an explicit decíaration, or an act of notorious dominion, by which the claimant challenges the right of the occupant.’ Such explicit and formal acts as these are required to bar the rights of a trespasser on the land of the owner of the legal title, and w,e believe that acts quite as explicit and significant should be required to set aside the claim of a party holding a deed absolute on its face.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b125-6" data-blocks='[["BL_125.4",125,[146,1184,1156,248]]]'>“ It is to be remembered that up to the time the plaintiff acquired title, the land was vacant, without any buildings or improvements whatever upon it, except the opening of a limestone quarry and the burning of some three or four lime-kilns.

In considering this question of possession, the fact that Sparks knowingly permitted Hollar to pay the taxes for thirty years or thereabouts, and during all that time neglected to return the land to the assess- or as his, is, to say the least of it, an admission that he did not own or claim it.” • . .</p>
