And it is our opinion that, in view of the general facts of the case, they properly so regarded and treated it. A survey which had four different improvements upon as many parts of it, was surely not properly assessed as entirely unseated. The assessor, who is supposed to'ascertain and know the boundaries of lands assessed, should certainly, in such a case, ascertain what part' of the tract, if any, is not chargeable to the person of some cultivator or occupant with the payment of the taxes, and such part of the tract, if there remains such a part, should be so taxed. A reasonable degree of official care and accuracy would, it seems to us, exact this; and it is our opinion, in view of the cases which rule, that when part of a tract is cut off and occupied, the balance may be assessed as unseated, it is fairly due to all interested in a case like this, that the part should be ascertained and assessed as a part, and not, as appears to have been done here, as the whole of the tract. The tract was marked ‘seated,’ by directions of the commissioners in 1848. It is alleged for the defendant, that, having been so marked, it could not be returned to the unseated list without notice to the owner; and that, without such notice, a sale of it for taxes, as unseated, would be void. It is answered that payment of the taxes afterward implies such notice, or knowledge of the fact, and here would be a question for the jury. But, aside from this, and without undertaking to rule the case on the ground that the commissioners treated, and properly, the tract as seated, it is our opinion that, upon the uncontradicted and undisputed testimony of David C. Hoover, it was in point of fact <em>seated, </em>and not liable to taxation and sale as unseated, in 1854 and 1855; and that the sale to the commissioners in 1856, assuming a sale, was void; <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>and that your verdict, for this reason, should be for the defendant. The testimony of Hoover as to the occupancy of part of the land in controversy, is not disputed. It is our province and duty, therefore, to pass upon the point as matter of law; and, since the second ground of defence is, in our opinion, decisive of the case, it is best that it should be here put in such a shape, that, if it goes up, every question in it may at once be settled, and prolonged litigation averted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[155,758,1157,433]]]'>“We have said that the material facts as to the use and occupancy of the 1J acres on this part of the tract, at the time of the assessment, are not disputed. It is not disputed that it was occupied in 1854 and 1855. It was so used and occupied, not by mistake, but with a knowledge of the owner, and with the intention of accounting to him for the rent. The case of Sassaman <em>v. </em>Jackson, which explains and qualifies that of Ellis <em>v. </em>Hall, repudiates the doctrine in the latter case, that the responsibility of an intruder or occupant is limited to his claim. It is the most recent case upon this point, and, we think, rules it.]</p>

And here there are no controverted facts. There was <em>no sale </em>of the William Montgomery tract by the treasurer to the commissioners in 1856. The proof of this is full and clear. Although deeds were made out and acknowledged for the Montgomery and other tracts, it was done by the treasurer <em>after the sale. </em>‘ They were not’ <em>bid off </em>at the public sale. The commissioners, only one of whom was present, bid for, and bought no lands at the sale, but expressly refused to do so. They had, on the contrary, instructed the treasurer not to sell; and distinctly refused to receive or have anything to do with the deeds for any of the tracts, which, <em>after the sale, </em>he marked on his list,.as sold to the commissioners. These facts are distinctly proved by Mr. Russell, who was at the time clerk of the commissioners, and who was at the treasurer’s sale and kept for-him the sale list, and by other witnesses, and are not controverted. This was no sale or purchase. The treasurer had authority only to sell ‘ <em>in pursuance of public notice, and by open venduej </em>and the commissioners could only <em>'•hid off’ </em>lands <em>when so set up at such public sale </em>by the treasurer, and not bid by others to a specified amount. There was no sale, therefore, of the Montgomery tract to the commissioners; and no title vested in them or their successors by his deed, which the. latter could convey upon this ground. The case of the plaintiff plainly failed, and, for the reasons here given, as well as upon the other general ground taken in the defe'nce, we instruct the jury to return a verdict for the defendant.”]</p>

He gave evidence showing that about an acre and a half was cleared, near the line of the tract, some forty years ago by one Eishel; and that since that time it had been occupied, or used and cultivated by some one. And he proved by the testimony of Hoover, the owner of the adjoining tract, that he used it for farming purposes from 1854 to 1858 — that he mowed it in 1854, pastured it in 1855, and raised grain on it the following years. Upon the testimony of Hoover the court instructed the jury that the land was in point <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>of'fact seated, and not liable to taxation and sale as unseated in 1854 and 1855 ; and that the sale to the commissioners in 1856, assuming a sale, was void; and that their verdict, for this reason, should be for the defendant. This instruction withdrew the case wholly from the jury and was clearly erroneous, unless the facts testified to by Hoover were admitted by the plaintiffs. If they were not admitted, it was the province of the jury to determine, under proper instructions, whether the land was seated, or not, at the date of the assessments. Even if the testimony of Hoover' was uncontradicted, the court was not at liberty to assume the facts to be as stated by him, and give a binding direction thereon to the jury. But if the facts stated by him were admitted by the plaintiffs, then the legal conclusion arising from them was for the determination of the court. But we find no evidence of any such •admission in the record, nor anything from which it can be inferred unless it be the remark of the court that “ the testimony of Hoover, as to the occupancy of part of the land in controversy, is not disputed.” If the court meant that the plaintiffs admitted that the testimony of Hoover was true, then there was no error in declaring that it was legally sufficient to show that the land was seated, and not liable to taxation and sale as unseated. But if the court thought that his testimony was not contradicted by any evidence in the cause, its credibility was for the jury, and the case should have been submitted to their determination. The plaintiffs had given in evidence the assessment books which showed primfi facie that the land was unseated at the time it was assessed, and nothing but an express admission on their part that the facts testified to by Hoover were true, would have warranted the court in withdrawing the case from the jury. As it does not clearly appear that the plaintiffs made any such admission, the 1st assignment is sustained.</p>

In reference to this ground of defence the court say : “ And here there are no controverted facts.” If there were “no controvefted facts,” it is certain that the defendant’s evidence was in direct conflict with that given by the plaintiffs. In support of the sale the plaintiffs relied on the entry in the treasurer’s sale book of unseated lands, showing the sale to the commissioners, and upon his deed to the commissioners in pursu-' anee of the sale, which was duly executed and acknowledged, and which had remained in the commissioners’ office from 1856 until its delivery to the plaintiffs in 1864 by the commissioners together with their deed for the land. To rehut this evidence, the defendant proved by two of the commissioners acting as such in 1856 and by the clerk in the commissioners’ office at that date, that no <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>such sale had taken place. It is quite probable that, on the evidence of these witnesses, the jury would have found, if the question had been left to them, that in point of fact there was no sale of the land by the treasurer to the commissioners. But whether they would, or not, is wholly immaterial. It is clear that under the evidence the plaintiffs were entitled to have the question submitted to the jury for their determination.
