There was other evidence that the staves were delivered at Nineveh station; that they were white oak rift staves and considered good.

It would depend on whether they were delivered, in pursuance of the proposition, for Mr. Cooper. If they were delivered for himself, intending to make the best he could of them by selling them to somebody else, and after failing to do that, he gave notice, such delivery was not assent to the proposition of Mr. Cooper, which is the first element in a contract; and this transaction, moreover, lacked the consideration and mutuality necessary to entitle it to that character.” * * “Now, when put there, were the staves put there by the plaintiff for Cooper, and was he induced to put them there by the proposition of Cooper, and in compliance with it ? If so, it was a contract, and when put there and Cooper informed of it, he was bound if the staves were of the character and quality specified in the proposition ; while if they were not so delivered, it was not a contract —the act of depositing the staves at Nineveh station, viewed with the proposition, did not amount to a contract. You will judge. The evidence is with you, and it is a question for you. It must, appear from the evidence, we repeat, that there was in all the parts of the transaction what amounts to a contract; and if that is not shown, the plaintiff’s action would here fail. If a contract is shown, and you so find, then the next inquiry is, were the staves of the description and quality contracted for ? If so, and he was notified, Mr. Cooper was bound to receive them, although he was not there at the time to take charge of them. If delivered at the place, and an article answering the express description contained in the proposition, he would be bound, according to the terms of the contract, to pay for them at the price he offered. On the other hand, assuming that there was a contract, one of the express terms of it was that the defendant would take them ‘if they were all rift staves and good;’ and if they were not ‘rift staves and good,’ he was.not bound to receive them if he had been there at the time, because this is an express stipulation of the contract.</p>

You will inquire whether there is anything in this aspect of the case, if your conclusion should be that the staves were not of the description and quality that Cooper was bound to receive upon the terms of the contract, if there was a contract, which would still render him liable; whether the facts and the attitude of the parties, as disclosed here, show or do not show that from the time they were left at the station Cooper was refusing to .receive them. There is nothing expressed directly upon this question. Any conclusion arrived..at must be gathered or inferred from the conduct of the parties. If your conclusion should be that Cooper refused to receive them at the time — and that would seem to us to have been his attitude all the time afterwards — then he would not be bound to pay at all, if the staves were not such as he had bought; while, if he failed to give notice, or to apprise the plaintiff of his refusal in such case, or did anything which misled him upon that subject, then he would be bound, although the staves were not such as the plaintiff was bound to deliver, to pay their value, upon the principle of the eases cited; and you will determine all these questions of fact for yourselves, from the evidence.”</p>

This specification is contrary to Rule VII., 6 Harris 578. A judge] however, is not required to give a legal definition of every term he employs in his charge. It may be assumed that men know that a contract means an agreement between,two or more persons. If there is anything in the evidence falling short of this, it is the duty of the party to frame a point containing a request for instructions, and present it to the court. That an omission to charge where there is no prayer for specific directions is not assignable for error, is well settled: Churchman <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/whart/6/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Whart. 146" data-case-ids="1836941" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0146-01">6 Whart. 146</a>, and many other cases down to Burkholder <em>v. </em>Stahl, 8 P.

    <p id="b490-7" data-blocks='[["BL_490.9",490,[321,1020,1158,903]]]'>The 2d specification is, that the court erred in charging the jury that the proposition was like an order — -assent to which would be implied from the act of compliance with it if the staves were delivered in pursuance of it and of the description and quality specified. The proposition here referred to evidently was that contained in a letter by the defendant to the plaintiff in evidence, dated October 18th 1865. This letter must be read in connection with the previous correspondence between the parties. •&lt; Cooper had written to Altimus to know if he had any staves to sell, or could procure any from his neighbors. To this Altimus had replied, “ If you let me knowhow much you could give per hundred I could get four or five thousand, with some heading.” To which the letter or proposition of October 18th 1865 responds, “ If they are rift staves and good, I will give you $35 per thousand, delivered at the station.” Now, this certainly was a conditional order, or agreement to take the staves if of the required 'quality, and delivered at the station. Altimus might safely act upon it, and if he sent the staves to the station, Cooper could not refuse, after notice to receive them there, without showing that his order had not been complied with, or an unreasonable time had elapsed. There was no error, therefore, in the charge in this respect.</p>

This specification is also contrary to Rule VII. There is the more reason to insist upon the enforcement of the rule in this case, because, upon an examination of the charge, it does not appear that any such question was distinctly submitted to the jury, nor was it necessary. In stating the rule as to the obligation of the vendee if he objects to receive an article to give notice to the vendor — and that — upon his neglect that he would be bound to pay, he adds, “ by which he sustains inconvenience or loss,” and a similar expression occurs in another part of the charge. <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>It is hypereriticism to complain of language of this character. If the defendant thought that the law was upon the facts that Altimus could not recover without showing that he had sustained loss by the refusal of Cooper to receive .the staves, and that no evidence had been given of such loss, he should have requested the court in writing so to instruct £he jury.</p>
