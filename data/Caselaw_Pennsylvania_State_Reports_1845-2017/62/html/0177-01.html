The foundation of the jurisdiction, indeed, was the existence of a tenancy. It was necessary for the plaintiff to show that the defendant was her tenant, to whom she had leased or demised the premises; otherwise no exhibition of title or right of possession in her, however incontrovertible, would have authorized a verdict in her favor. It was competent, however, for the tenant, before the justice or in court on the appeal, to set up any defence of which a tenant can avail himself in an ejectment by his lessor. He might have shown that the title of the plaintiff had come to an enfl by expiration, by her own act, or been divested by act of law: Newell <em>v. </em>Gibbs, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 496" data-case-ids="1852545" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0496-01">1 W. &amp; S. 496</a>. Of course he might have proved that he had been induced to accept the lease by fraud or misrepresentation — for that would have been to show that there was no tenancy, which alone, as we have seen, would have been fatal to the plaintiff’s recovery in this proceeding, without going on to controvert the plaintiff’s title, or show a better one in himself or outstanding in another, as in an ordinary ejectment: Boyer <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%2064" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Watts 64">5 Watts 64</a>; Brown <em>v. </em>Dysinger, <a href="/rawle/1/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Rawle 408" data-case-ids="1819380" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0408-01">1 Rawle 408</a>; Hockenbury <em>v. </em>Snyder, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20249" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 249">2 W. &amp; S. 249</a>; Baskin <em>v. </em>Sechrist, 6 Barr 154. But the defendant below attempted or pretended nothing of the sort to bring his case within any recognised exception to the general and well established principle that a tenant shall not be allowed to controvert his landlord’s title. On the contrary, he undertook to show that, before the period of the alleged lease, Mrs. Hammond, the lessor, had given her assent to his purchase of the interest of her son William, and had thereby estopped herself from turning him out of possession; in other words, recognised a title in him not subordinate, but adverse to hers. Even, however, supposing William had under his father’s will, or had acquired subsequently, such an interest during his mother’s life, if afterwards ICoontz took a lease from her it is very plain that he cannot set up William’s title in this proceeding, whether he held it by purchase or not. He must surrender possession to her from whom he received it, and prosecute his independent title, if he has one, by a new ejectment.</p>

That, in point of fact, settled the jurisdiction of the justice to originate the proceeding, which disposes of the fifth assignment of error, even if there had been a bill of exceptions to the decision of the court below on the reserved point. The first assignment is contrary to the sixth of the rules adopted September 6th, 1862 (6 Harris 578).
