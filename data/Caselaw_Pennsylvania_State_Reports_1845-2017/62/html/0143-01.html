After his death, his executors assigned the same securities to the succeeding guardian, leaving a balance still due the wards.

The accounts were confirmed August 13th 1858. In each of these accounts the guardian charged himself with sums amounting to $3037.47 as “ Cash from Executor of D. Stahl, deceased,” and also with “interest on the same.” The aggregate balances against him appeared to be $5672.23. The decedent <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>died insolvent, and J.

He also found and reported, that in the charges in cash in the guardian’s account, were included a judgment in favor of D. Stahl, deceased, against one Powell, for $2562.64, also a note from John Ruthrauff for $200, and a note from John Coffey for $200. The auditor found that no part of these sums had ever been realized by the guardian, and after his death they were transferred by his executors, unchanged, to Henry Miller, the'guardian of the Stahl minors appointed upon Crooks’s death.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b144-8" data-blocks='[["BL_144.7",144,[292,1184,1156,645]]]'>The auditor reported that he could “ find no authority which in his judgment would warrant him in making a distribution upon the balance of the guardian’s account. He is of the opinion that these trust funds being no part of the estate of Washington Crooks, being traceable <em>in specie </em>in the hands of the executors and by them promptly transferred to the party to whom they belonged, should be deducted from the balance of the account before distribution is made.” He made the distribution accordingly, and awarded a dividend of about 84 per cent, to the creditors. The court recommitted the matter to him, with directions to make an “ alternate” report on the basis of allowing the wards a dividend on the whole balance appearing on Crooks’ guardianship accounts. Under this report the dividend to the creditors was about 75 per cent. The court (King P. J.) confirmed the “ alternate” report. This was the error assigned on appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
