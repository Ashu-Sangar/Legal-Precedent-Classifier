J., after preliminary remarks on the form of action and the evidence, charged, * * “ Until the coal is mined it remains real estate. As soon as severed it becomes personal property, although not removed from the runs. * * There were many of these runs, and generally full of the mined coal, which was to be removed from the lower end, next the gangway, and would come down to the opening by its own weight, the angle of descent being quite steep. At the time the mining ceased they had not reached the open end of the mine with any of the runs, and it would seem that the coal had. been left in the runs the better tc| enable the laborers to mine the remainder. [We have no hesitation in saying that this mined coal in the runs was personal property, could have been removed by the tenant, and passed by the general assignment to Mr. Dock, who had the right to remove it notwithstanding the re-entry by the landlord — the Lykens Valley Company — provided it could be done without essentially injuring the mines.] The right to mine and remove the coal is secured in terms by the third article of .the contract, but independently of this provision, it would exist from the general terms of the lease. You have heard the opinion of the witnesses as to the facility and difficulty of mining the residue- of the coal after this is removed • from the runs: some express the opinion that it could be readily done, and point out the means; others that it could not be mined without great expense and risk.. You must judge between them. You are instructed that if this coal could be removed without doing material injury, the Lykens Valley Company was bound to permit the assignee to remove it. If the injury would be essen'tial, rendering it impossible or very difficult and dangerous to take out the residue of the coal, the company — the owner of the mines— could lawfully forbid, its removal, at least for the time being, and until the residue could be worked out. Such refusal to permit the coal to be removed would not be a conversion. If it would not essentially injure the mines to remove the coal in the runs, the refusal by the president of the company, and those having charge of the mines to permit it to be done, would be evidence of a conversion. That subject will be next explained. It is contended by the defendant’s counsel that there is no evidence in this case from which the jury can find a conversion of the property sued for. A demand by the owner of personal property for its delivery, made on the person having it in possession, and a refusal by him so to do, is evidence of conversion — matter from which the jury should infer it, unless some legal reason is given for the non-delivery. It is not of itself a conversion. But an actual conversion of the goods is sufficient, without proof of a demand; as by using, consuming or selling them. Mr. Dock testifies that after the <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>assignment to him, he demanded the goods now claimed from Mr. Hoffman, president of the Lykens Yalley Coal Company. * * We have already fully instructed you as to the right of the Lykens Yalley Company, to retain the coal in case the removal would seriously injure the mines. We are unable to see from any evidence in the case that it was owned by the defendant, or that it possessed the right of retention on any other grounds than the danger of injury. It had taken no measures to distrain it for rent.”</p>

This is right, as the assignee sues for the benefit of creditors, and to carry out the trust. Were he to sue on the contract, the general indebtedness of the Franklin Company to the Lykens Yalley Company could be set off, which would be improper as to the creditors, whom the company making the assignment had the right to prefer under our laws.

We are of the opinion that he had a right to use the general railroad within the lines for that purpose, provided the business was so conducted as not materially to interrupt the other company in its business.] How the Lykens Valley Company acquired possession of the mines is not in proof.

It would be unjust if, after the tenant had done all this, the mined coal were still to be treated as á part of the realty; except so'far as it would be necessary to carry out the covenants in the lease. If the coal could not be removed without material injury to the lessor, we would .have to assume that the tenant’s right of property was not complete arid final, because of the covenant (in this instance expressed) to manage and conduct the mines and the mining of coal in the most approved method of modern mining; and to leave the mines in good order and condition at <em>any </em>termination of the lease. On the question of proper mining much evidence was given and different opinions expressed. The court <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>fairly submitted to the jury the question of fact, whether the mined coal could be removed without material detriment to the mines.</p>
    <p id="b239-4" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[174,509,1156,551]]]'>It does not appear that the judge misstated the testimony of Edward Savage, in charging on the question of conversion. It is true Savage says he preferred mining the coal for himself to taking the coal there for nothing. In his opinion the coal in the runs could not be prepared for market without injuring the reputation of the mines. But on the point of sale by the defendants of the mined coal, which was the material one in regard to the conversion, he does say first in chief (p. 35) he had the right to remove it; and then in cross-examination, that the company gave us permission to take all there, solid and <em>mined </em>coal, — that is my construction <em>of our contract. </em>They did not object to our taking what we took, — twenty-seven loads, — we were to have all the <em>mined </em>coal there.</p>
    <p id="b239-5" data-blocks='[["BL_239.5",239,[174,1069,1156,302]]]'>The conversion being established — and the jury have found this fact on evidence sufficient to be submitted to them — trover was the proper form of action. The coal being found to be the property of the plaintiff upon sufficient evidence and proper instructions, and the conversion by the. defendants and their refusal to permit the assignee to carry it away, the right of action in this form is complete.</p>
    <p id="b239-6" data-blocks='[["BL_239.6",239,[174,1371,1155,1076]],["BL_240.1",240,[278,411,1152,250]]]'>In allowing the jury to find for the plaintiff the actual value of the coal as it lay in the breasts, and not the cost of mining, assimilating it to the value of coal-leave, as it is known, the court did the defendants no injustice. This was clearly the lowest form in the expression' of value that could be given to it. It gave the defendants all the advantage of the mined coal without the 'expense and labor of superintending its mining. The right to a deduction from this value, of rent unpaid, cannot be conceded in this form of action. There is a plain distinction in measuring damages between property rightfully acquired, and that taken wrongfully. The latter was the case in Herdic <em>v. </em>Young, 5 P. F. Smith 178, cited in the argument. The doctrine held there was that in the case of an inadvertent trespass, where no damages ought to be allowed beyond compensation for any outrage in the taking, it would not be just that the owner should be allowed the value added to the article by the labor and expense of the trespasser, beyond a proper compensation for the value of the thing when the trespass was committed. There just compensation required a reduction from the superadded value, ’ so as to bring the damages nearer to the true standard of loss suffered by the plaintiff. But here there was no trespass inadvertent, or wilful, but a rightful reduction to the possession of the Franklin Company by virtue of the lease, as its own property. There was no wrong in the taking to be compensated for, and no right of reduction in the value growing out of the state <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>of the property itself. The rent which the defendants asked to be used in the reduction of the value of the coal was an independent demand wholly disconnected from the taking of the coal. Its deduction would be on the principle of a simple set-off, and not an equitable defalcation from the gross value. Such a set-off cannot be made in trover.</p>
    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[272,668,1157,1492]]]'>We think the court charged correctly also as to the right to use the railroad in the mines to remove the coal, qualified by the instruction that the use should be such as not to interrupt the defendants in the use of the mine. To have held otherwise would be simply to say that the mined coal could be used by no one. It being the property of the plaintiff the defendants would be liable if they converted it, and if the plaintiff entered to take it, he would be a trespasser. This would be unreasonable and inconsistent with the purpose and terms of the lease. <em>Lex non patitur dbsurdum. </em>The coal being lawfully mined the lessees had a right to remove it by the terms of the lease, and through the means and appliances sanctioned by its terms. The lease did not expire by efflux of time, so as to warn the lessees not to leave their work unfinished. If the defendants regained possession of the mines rightfully, a fact not clearly appearing in the evidence, yet a reasonable construction must be placed upon such a right of entry, that it should not be used as a penalty to forfeit all rights acquired before the entry. The property in the mined coal having already vested under the lease, the means of taking it away provided in the lease, which gave the possession and use of the mines and all their fixtures, machinery and appliances, must be construed to remain a sufficient reasonable time to enable the lessees to remove their property. The means reserved by the lessors in this lease to recover possession on the breach of certain covenants, are exceedingly sharp, stringent and speedy. They are not to be permitted to be used to destroy all the lessee’s rights of property, disconnected as they may be with the particular breach which was enforced by re-entry. This is not a case of option, where the removal could be effected by other means. The railroad is the only available means of ingress and egress to remove the coal, and necessity requires its use. <em>Neeessitas facit licitum quod alias non est lieitum. Neeessitas quod eogit defendit. </em>An equitable and reasonable interpretation must therefore be given to the terms of the lease. <em>Lex aliquando sequitur cequitatem.</em>
