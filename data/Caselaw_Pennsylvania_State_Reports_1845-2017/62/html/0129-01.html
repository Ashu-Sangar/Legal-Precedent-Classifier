Harah.for a tract of 200 acres of land in Upper Turkeyfoot township. The land was known as the “ Cupp” or “Weimer” tract. Roddy being the owner of the tract in dispute by purchase from David Weimer, on the 17th of October 1864 conveyed it with other tracts to Grratz and Torry. On the 7th of November Roddy executed a mortgage on this tract to Weimer to secure the payment of $2400, in equal annual payments of $800 on the 1st day of October in the years 1865, 1866 and 1867. On the 1st of December 1864 Gratz and Torry gave to Roddy a mortgage on this and other tracts to secure the sum of $55,218.50. On the 13th of November 1865 $800 of the Weimer mortgage was paid, and on the same day Roddy delivered to Harah this paper:—</p>

It is adequate whenever the verdict can be so moulded as to comprehend and enforce all the equities. But when, by the machinery of an equitable ejectment, the whole contract cannot be enforced, it is inadequate and inapplicable. It is a substitute for a bill in equity, and a court of equity will not compel specific performance of a contract unless it can execute the whole contract; and the whole contract cannot be executed if part only of it is set out in the bill, for the case proved must be substantially the same case stated upon the record. Further, the court will not adopt chancery principles where they cannot do full and complete justice between the parties; and there are some cases where payment of purchase-money can be enforced only in equity, and. ejectment will not lie.</p>

It is apparent that he did not sell nor the defendant buy the ‘ Cupp’ farm at $14.54 per acre, but both tracts together at that average price. The one tract may be much more valuable than the other. The Cupp farm contains 170 acres and 76 perches, neat measure, and if the evidence in relation to the agreement showed it to have been sold to the defendant at that price per acr'e, there would be no difficulty in framing a verdict. But 441 acres — not 170 acres and 76 perches — were sold at 14.54 per acre. [By fixing this tract in dispute at that price, we shall not enforce the contract made by the parties, but make a new contract for them, which <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>may work great injustice to one or the other.] Thus if the Cupp tract is the more valuable, and there shall be a verdict for plaintiff for it, to be released on the payment of $14.64 per acre by defendant within the time specified, he will take good care to pay and redeem it, but he will decline the other tract on the same terms. This would be unconscionable, and not in accordance with the letter or spirit of the agreement, yet this is what the defendant asks us to do.</p>

The tracts were purchased together for an entire consideration. The plaintiff must have the same verdict in each ease; if to be released on payment of the whole purchase-money of both tracts in the one case, it must be so in the other. Then $6412 being the whole consideration of both farms, the plaintiff will recover the Cupp farm, the recovery to be released on the payment of $6412; and he will at the same time recover the Philippi farm, to be released on the payment of $6412.</p>

It was rather a singular impression that payment of the whole purchase-money under a conditional verdict in one ejectment would not be payment of the same money in the second, under an entire contract for both tracts. And it was also strange that in an ejectment for one tract the deed required to be made by the plaintiff under the contract for both, must necessarily be confined to the one described in the particular ejectment. The ejectment being founded on the legal title of the plaintiff, and his titles being several, there was nothing to prevent his bringing several ejectments. It is the defendant who opposes the equity of the contract to the recovery, and this he does in each case. But when he has done this, what is there to .prevent the court from moulding the verdict to administer the equity of the whole contract for both the tracts? That would be by requiring the defendant to pay the purchase-money according to its terms, and requiring the plaintiff to make and file a deed or deeds for both tracts, as he is bound to do by its terms; and then by so describing the contract as to identify it, and to show that it embraced the lands in both the ejectments. A compliance with the condition would thus be effectual in each action. The only difference would be, that in the trial of the second action it would become necessary to give the first in evidence in order to enable the court to mould the verdict so as to adapt it to the verdict found in the first. Clearly, one deed and one payment of the purchase-money would perform the contract in both actions.</p>

The fact that the mortgage in favor of the defendant on the Philippi tract was not a personal charge against the plaintiff, would not prevent the defendant from using the mortgage to pay off so much of the purchase-money charged against the Philippi tract, the plaintiff having agreed to sell it as well as the Cupp or Weimer tract by the same contract. The land was encumbered by the mortgage, which must be removed before the plaintiff himself could comply with his contract.</p>
