Sterrett, deceased. He died in 1901, leaving a will dated July 10,1887, and two codicils, the first dated September 22,1899, and the second October 11, 1900. He was survived by three daughters, all dying unmarried: Emma, in 1923, Annie, in 1928 and Laura, in 1935. His daughters, Annie and <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>Emma, by their joint will, dated March 7, 1916, appointed the estate. Emma died in 1923, leaving Annie surviving. Thereafter, by her will dated January 11, 1927, Annie revoked her former appointment and made another differing in some respects from that contained in the joint will. The question is whether the appointees named in the joint will or those named in the will of Annie, take the estate. The answer depends on what the testator meant by the words creating the power. Words have various recognized meanings, and if employed by a testator with particular reference to special circumstances, will be given the meaning<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> intended; if necessary, the court may receive proof of the circumstances to determine the sense in which the words were used.</p>

The parties claiming under the joint appointment objected to the consideration by the court of facts concerning the lunacy of Laura from “the winter of 1879 and 1880” to the time of her death in 1935, on the ground that it was extrinsic evidence and “inadmissible for the purpose of explaining, qualifying or altering the meaning of the power of appointment” in question. We think the evidence was admissible. In ascertaining what he meant, the court may “seek assistance from the circumstances attending the decedent, such as the condition of the testator’s family, the amount and character of his property, and the objects of his bounty”: <em>Mayer's Est., </em><a href="/pa/289/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="289 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1103272" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0407-01">289 Pa. 407</a>, 410, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20627" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="137 A. 627">137 A. 627</a>; see also <em>Long v.

In the field of wills, where there is none but the individual standard of meaning to be considered, this principle is seen in unrestricted operation.”</p>

As this will was made in July, 1887, it may be noted that one of the stipulated facts is that “During the winter of 1879 and 1880 she [his daughter Laura] suffered a severe attack of typhoid fever, which attack was accompanied by an impairment of her mental faculties. About six years thereafter hallucinations of persecution appeared and this mental derangement existed continuously from that time until her death, sometimes with a turn for the better and sometimes- with a turn for the worse.”</p>

Some 13 years after he made his will, and in the year after he certified that Laura was insane, he made the first codicil providing for “protracted illness” of a daughter and directing expenditure for her care even though it required taking “from time to time from the shares of her sisters or from the corpus of the trust estate for that purpose.” It is apparent that he recognized and particularly wished to provide for the special needs of that daughter. He also then created the power of appointment. Slightly more than a year later, in a second codicil, he repeated the provision for a daughter suffering from a “protracted illness, or like cause,” and also the power of appointment.</p>

    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[159,788,1155,1621]],["BL_348.1",348,[286,352,1148,416]]]'>In various respects his purpose and intention stand out. His will and codicils are conclusive that he wished to provide for the disposition of his property and not have any part pass under the intestate laws. He recognized the duty of providing for a daughter afflicted by a malady rendering her irresponsible, and dealt with it by authorizing, if needed, the use of income and principal. He knew, of course, that the “protracted illness” rendered Laura incompetent to make testamentary disposition of property save in a lucid interval, and he was familiar with the presumptions applied by the law in such situations in the event of dispute: cf. <em>Titlow v. Titlow, </em><a href="/pa/54/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="54 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="1006350" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0216-01">54 Pa. 216</a>, 224. He provided that Annie and Emma should be trustees with duties to their sister. They were a “majority” of his daughters capable of acting, and, though joint action by Annie and Emma, or by Annie and Laura, or by Emma and Laura, would be the joint act of a majority of his daughters if all were compos mentis, we think that he intended his words in the codicils — “as a majority of my said daughters or the survivor of them” — to refer to the joint act of the only two of them capable of acting. At the same time he had in mind the possible existence of circumstances that might preclude joint action by Annie and Emma, and accordingly provided for it by also vesting the power of appointment in the survivor. While the words “majority of my said daughters or the survivor,” if considered apart from the conditions and circumstances at the moment requiring testator’s attention, might allow joint action by any one of the three combinations indicated <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>above, and also, with possible action, as survivor, by any one of the three who should survive the other two, we cannot attribute to testator such indifference to the actual family conditions as to permit us to say that he used the words in any but the restricted sense indicated, especially when their interpretation in the restricted meaning accords with a common sense solution of the problem before him.</p>
    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[282,786,1152,1613]],["BL_349.1",349,[157,350,1154,413]]]'>Appellants contend that joint appointment by any two, or, failing that, by the surviving daughter (any one of the three) would satisfy the words of the will; that, as Annie and Emma appointed, the power was exhausted and left nothing for any survivor; or that, in any event, Laura and not Annie was the survivor. We cannot say that he intended to include an insane person in the word survivor. Another difficulty with adopting this conclusion is in the words used in creating the power. For reasons which he deemed sufficient, he specified the method by which the appointment should be made. He directed that it be done by a testamentary document. He knew that such an instrument is ambulatory and that a joint will would necessarily be subject to the possibility of revocation by any one joining in it.

If he had intended that appointment by both should be final and not revocable by a survivor, he could have provided for joint appointment by deed without the power of revocation. But his words show he did not intend that for he not only provided for an appointment that was ambulatory, but expressly directed that a survivor might appoint if no joint appointment appeared. As by the words “majority of my said daughters” he meant Annie and Emma, to the exclusion of Laura who was non compos mentis, and as there was always the possibility that both might not appoint, he guarded against the failure of joint action, by directing that the survivor, necessarily <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>the. survivor of the two who composed the majority he had in mind, should appoint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> This indicates conclusively that he did not rely on the possibility that Laura might have lucid intervals and that he had made up his mind that he did not wish the possible devolution of his property to depend on the contingency of proving that, if entrusted with the power, Laura had executed it during such lucid interval.</p>
