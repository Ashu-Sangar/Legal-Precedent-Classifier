The petition averred that “such deposit [was] made by a bookkeeping entry in the Federal Reserve Bank in the City of Philadelphia, transferring the said moneys from the account of the Registry of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to the account of the Treasury of the United States.” The petition also set forth that the Act of Congress<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> provided “Any person or persons or any corporation or company entitled to any such money may, on petition to the court from which the money was received, or its successor, and upon notice to the United States attorney and full proof of right thereto, obtain an order of court directing the payment of such money to the claimant, and the money deposited as aforesaid shall constitute and be a permanent appropriation for payments in obedience to such orders.”</p>

The power to declare an escheat is in the Commonwealth. It is a power that was not delegated to the federal government, though its exercise by a state may be restricted in the fields <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>where the power of Congress is exclusive: cf. <em>First Nat.

S. 366</a>. “The regulation of the title and devolution of property within its limits is within the control and jurisdiction of the State”: <em>Cunnius v.

The property under discussion is a debt payable by a debtor who deposited the money for distribution pursuant to a decree in an equity proceeding pending in the district court. The money is still held under its control, pursuant to the Act of Congress, for the purpose for which it ivas paid. “That the debt due the absentee by the School District, resulting from the establishment of her dower, was within the jurisdiction of the state authority, is clear”: <em>Cunnius v.

As the Commonwealth merely asks for a declaration of escheat and does not desire an order of payment directed to any federal' agency there would seem to be no objection to considering the proceedings as in personam: cf. <em>Security Bank v. California, </em><a href="/us/263/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="263 U.S. 282" data-case-ids="6141307" data-case-paths="/us/263/0282-01">263 U. S. 282</a>, 287.</p>

His contention is that the State has no power “to escheat moneys presently in the Treasury of the United States.” It is well settled that the State has power to take possession of unclaimed property as an escheat: <em>Security Savings Bank v. California, </em><a href="/us/263/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="263 U.S. 282" data-case-ids="6141307" data-case-paths="/us/263/0282-01">263 U. S. 282</a>, supra; <em>Com. v.

It may be conceded that the State cannot take possession of property in the custody of the federal government, but that fact need not prevent the judicial determination by the State of the succession to unclaimed property within its borders. The argument made for the Commonwealth concedes that the state court can maleé no order on the federal treasury or on any other representative of the federal government, requiring the delivery of the prop<a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>erty to the escheator, but the contention is that as the district court, in the proceeding brought by the escheator and referred to above, held that the court lacked power to declare an escheat<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and dismissed his petition without prejudice, this proceeding in the state court was necessarily instituted to determine the fact of escheat, and, the fact being found, to enable the Commonwealth then to present its claim to the district court in control of the fund pursuant to the Act of Congress. In the circumstances, therefore, we think the court should have proceeded with the case and should have made such determination as the evidence may require, and if an escheat were found, to have restricted the enforcement of its order to the proper presentation of the Commonwealth’s claim in the district court to enable that court to determine whether payment should be made to the Commonwealth. Such an order would seem to be within the following language of the Chief Justice in <em>United States v. Bank of New York and Trust Co., </em><a href="/us/296/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="296 U.S. 463" data-case-ids="5725593" data-case-paths="/us/296/0463-01">296 U.

Counsel for petitioner recognize this and hence ask this court to enter such a judgment. Have we the jurisdictional power to so do ? . . . The real position of the petitioner is that the state statutes have conferred jurisdiction upon no state court to enter judgment to escheat these moneys but they have conferred it upon this court. This they cannot do, and we in consequence have no such power. . . . The state has no title and no title by escheat can be acquired otherwise than by a compliance with these statutes.
