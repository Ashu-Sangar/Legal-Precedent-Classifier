At that time there was a mortgage of $125,000 on the property. Samuel Elgart was the mortgagor and the appellant insurance company was the mortgagee. The property was purchased sub<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>ject to the mortgage. There was no personal liability assumed by the plaintiff. In November, 1934, the husband died, leaving plaintiff as the sole owner of the property. At the time of her husband’s death, the balance due on the mortgage debt was $117,000.</p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[287,622,1149,423]]]'>In February, 1935, the mortgage was declared to be in default and the mortgagee took possession and proceeded to collect the rents-from the property. On September 7, 1935, the mortgagee entered judgment on the bond and on the same day damages were assessed in the sum of $123,142.50. The-mortgagee bought the property at sheriff’s sale. It received and recorded the sheriff’s deed for it on October 25, 1935.</p>
    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.6",326,[287,1056,1149,366]]]'>During the period intervening February, 1935, when the defendant took possession of the property, and October 25, 1935, the mortgagee collected $11,122.36, in excess of maintenance charges. Against this sum the mortgagee charged $3,833.95 on October 17, 1935, for taxes and water rents, and the sum of $3,510 for interest on the mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b326-6" data-blocks='[["BL_326.7",326,[287,1435,1151,857]]]'>Plaintiff averred that the mortgagee was accountable to her for all sums received after the mortgagee’s seizure of rents from the property, that the monthly payments of interest down to and including the 22d of October, 1935, at the rate of $585 per month, amounted to $4,680 less $292.50 included in its assessment of damages, or a total of $4,387.50, that in addition thereto under the terms of its agreement with her husband and herself, the mortgagee was entitled to set aside monthly payments of one-twelfth of the taxes and water rents which amounted to $325.11 per month or a total of $2;600.88, to be added to the above sum of $4,387.50, making a grand total of $6,988.38. Plaintiff claimed that the difference between the amount defendant (mortgagee) received during that period and the permissible set-off of $6,988.38, was a net balance of $4,133.98.</p>

From that time until it received the sheriff’s deed on October 5, 1935, it collected $2,457.22 additional as rent. On November 6, 1935, which was after the appellant became the absolute owner, $1,211.17 was collected as rent. The court below allowed that item of rent also to the appellee, in addition to the other items above enumerated. From this grand total of $11,122.36, the court deducted the following items:</p>

Plaintiff’s statement avers this was collected “in October.” Appellant became sole owner of this property on October 25, 1935. It is therefore obvious that all of the October rent does not belong to the appellee. As to that, evidence will doubtless be developed at the trial showing which party the rent for October belongs to or whether it should be ap<a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>portioned between the parties. In the lower court’s opinion, the defendant is allowed a credit for $114 rents which, the court said, “it is agreed by counsel were collected after October 25, 1935.” Whether this sum of $114 is included in the above sum of $1,211.17, which defendant says was collected on November 6, 1935, does not appear. We will assume that they are two distinct items. If it appears at the trial that the larger item includes the smaller, any correction called for by that fact can be made. We will affirm the judgment entered by the court below, in favor of the plaintiff, modifying it, however, by reducing it by $1,211.17, the amount which the affidavit of defense says was collected on November 6th, for October rent. This reduces the judgment to $1,861.99.</p>

The mortgagee cannot, after the mortgage is foreclosed, apply the money of a terre-tenant to the deficiency on the bond due by the mortgagor.</p>
