Culver was driving his automobile east on the southerly side of Main Street in the Borough of Emaus en route from Laurel, Delaware, to Lehigh University, Bethlehem. The wife plaintiff Nellie O. Culver, and her sister<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>, plaintiff Mary H. Cooper, were riding on the rear seat. Culver desired to pass a small Ford car driving immediately ahead of him and for that purpose turned left and straddled the right or southerly rail of the trolley track of defendant company. According to the version of Culver and his witnesses, he was driving at this time at a rate of from 18 to 20 miles per hour and the street was dry. After passing the Ford car, he turned diagonally right, at a point about 200 feet east of Keystone Avenue, in order to come again to the southerly side of the street; his left front wheel passed over the <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>southerly rail but his left rear wheel caught in it; the car slid for a distance of from five to ten feet before the wheel freed itself, and as it did so the car was pitched to the side of the street into a telegraph pole. All of the plaintiffs were seriously injured. There was abundant testimony to the effect that the accident was due to the fact that, at the point where the left rear wheel came in contact with the rail, the latter protruded from 1% to 3% inches above the level of the street on the inside of the track. This situation resulted from a depression in the brick paving immediately inside the rail for a distance of several feet. Witnesses stated that the condition had existed for a period of at least six months prior to the accident.</p>

The jury found a verdict for Culver in the sum of $30,000, for Nellie <em>G. </em>Culver, $5,000, and for Mary H. Cooper, $14,000. Defendant filed motions for judgment n. o. v., which were overruled, but its rales for a new trial were made absolute.

It is true that a defect in a highway may be so insignificant a jury should not be allowed to find that its maintenance constitutes negligence. Thus in <em>McGlinn v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/322/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="322 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="1167878" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0478-01">322 Pa. 478</a>, where plaintiff fell by reason of a difference of 1% inches in the level of the ends of two abutting curbstones, it is held that this was not such a defective condition as to give rise to actionable negligence. But all the circum<a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>stances must be taken into account, and a slight rut or depression, as here, immediately alongside a rail, may be a more likely source of danger than if on the open highway. There was testimony in the present case that the cars of several other persons on various occasions had caught in the rail at the point of this accident. In <em>Gillard v. City of Chester, </em><a href="/pa/212/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="212 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="941799" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0338-01">212 Pa. 338</a>, a rise in the curbstone of from <em>3y2 to </em>4 inches above the sidewalk was submitted to the jury as the basis of a charge of negligence against a municipality; and in <em>Shafer v.

Superior Ct. 256</a>, it was said (p. 258) : “We find nothing in the above, cases nor in any others that holds that a depression of three or four inches is such a slight inequality as would not suffice to sustain a recovery. . . . What particular shallowness of depression in a sidewalk or street forms such a slight inequality in the surface, as to excuse its presence and release the city of liability therefor cannot be definitely stated. Each case must necessarily be determined by the surrounding circumstances and generally the matter must be left to the jury.” Instances of liability in similar cases abound in other jurisdictions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Defendant contends therefore, since liability exists only if actual or constructive notice be shown, that the statements of <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>claim did not set forth a cause of action. After the statute of limitations had intervened and the case was called for tidal, plaintiffs orally moved to amend the statements by adding an allegation that the protruding rail had existed for a considerable period of time prior to February 2, 1932, and defendant should have known of the condition. Defendant pleaded surprise; a juror was withdrawn and the case continued. Shortly thereafter, on written petitions filed by plaintiffs to amend the statements, the amendment was allowed by formal order of the court. Defendant contends that this was error, that therefore all the evidence introduced at the trial to show the prior existence of the defect in the rail was improperly admitted, and that if such evidence had been excluded no liability was established by plaintiff’s case. It appears, however, that no exception was taken by defendant to the allowance of the amendment, and it became, for all intents and purposes, as much a part of the statements as if originally embodied therein. Moreover, the statements of claim as filed alleged that defendant was negligent in “maintaining ... a dangerous nuisance by allowing its trolley rails to protrude,” etc., and since the words “maintaining a nuisance” involve the idea of continuity and some degree of permanence <em>(Ford v. Grand Union Co., </em><a href="/ad/240/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="240 A.D. 294" data-case-ids="5125552" data-case-paths="/ad/240/0294-01">240 N. Y.

In our opinion, however, this question was for the jury. It cannot be said that in attempting to bring his car out of the track space Culver, had he looked, must have seen the depression in the bricks immediately adjacent to the rail. The right wheels had never been within the track, and the passage of the left wheels across the rail had to be at an oblique angle. Considering that the turn to the right in front of the Ford car necessarily absorbed his attention, <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>it cannot be asserted with finality, that he was careless in not observing the defect or, observing it, in not realizing the inability of the wheel to clear it with safety.</p>

The so-called special finding, however, as framed by the trial judge, was not really a special finding at all; there was only one possible basis of liability submitted to the jury, and therefore no need of their stating of what they found the negligence to consist.

There are circumstances in the present ease which would make it inequitable to plaintiffs if, merely because of excessiveness of verdicts, they should be obliged to have their case retried. After the new trial was awarded defendant became involved in reorganization proceedings in the federal court under section 77 (b) of the Bankruptcy Act, and the rights which plaintiffs have acquired by liquidation of their claims might be seriously impaired if the verdicts were now set aside. Moreover, Culver’s physical condition is apparently such that the ordeal of a new trial would probably be a great hardship. We think, therefore, that justice will best be served by reversing the order for a new trial and remitting the record to the court below for it to fix, as to each of the plaintiffs, the amount of remittiturs to be filed as the alternative to granting a new trial. In establishing such amounts, the court below will, of course, have due regard to the undoubted seriousness' of the injuries sustained by plaintiffs, especially in the case of Albert E. Culver himself.</p>
