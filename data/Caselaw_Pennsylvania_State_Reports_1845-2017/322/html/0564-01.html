Liability in an amount greater than the premiums paid with interest is denied by defendant on the ground that certain answers of insured in her application for the insurance were false and fraudulent. The jury found in plaintiff’s favor, and defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied by the court of common pleas, whose judgment was affirmed by the Superior Court. We thereupon allowed the present appeal.</p>

The application had been executed and the policy issued on November 5,1931. Defendant relies on answers in the application with regard to insured’s prior health and attendance by physicans. The application stated that her present condition of health was good, that she had no physical or mental defect or infirmity, and that her last sickness was on July 7,1931, when she was confined to a hospital for ten days for the removal of a hemorrhoid. Particular reliance is placed on the following question and answer: “18. Have you been attended by a physician during the last five <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>years? If yes, give name of complaints, dates, how long sick, and names of physicians. Hemroid removed, July 7/31, Dr. J. L. Atlee, 10 days.” To show that these statements were falsely and fraudulently made, defendant invokes certain alleged admissions in the pleadings and the testimony of a single witness, the insured’s family physician.</p>

Penn Mut. Life Ins. </em>Co., <a href="/pa/322/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="322 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1167886" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0547-01">322 Pa. 547</a>, makes it plain that the case was one which had to be submitted to a jury. Under the terms of the policy, the statements in the application are to be regarded as representations and not warranties, and the burden was therefore upon the insurer to show bad faith on the part of insured in making them. The admissions in plaintiff’s reply show no more than that insured had been attended by a physician “on several occasions within five years immediately preceding her application for insurance,” and that she had been attended “for illness connected with [a] diseased kidney condition.” Those admissions are clearly insufficient to indicate fraudulent misrepresentation on her part, and their insufficiency for that purpose becomes clearer still in the light of the testimony of the attending physician. According to him, insured never knew or suspected that “she had any kidney condition.” He testified that he had in fact treated her several times for an inflammation of the kidney, which, however, did not involve destruction of the tissue or develop into Bright’s disease, but that he had “persistently concealed the true facts of her case throughout her illness because of her fear of several forms of fatal disease.” Her complaint to him was of headaches, which she always described as neuralgia. In fact she died of heart disease, which had not been discovered until after the issuance of the policy, and to which, according to the witness, the kidney condition did not contribute. In view of this testimony, the jury might very well conclude that there had been no fraud<a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>ulent concealment by insured of any “grave, important or serious disease”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in the answers concerning the condition of her health.</p>

In this respect, however, the insurer’s defense depended wholly on the testimony of this witness, and, in view of that fact and of the testimony that insured was unaware of the existence of any organic disease or serious disorder, it was for the jury to say whether or not the requisite bad faith was shown: <em>Evans v.
