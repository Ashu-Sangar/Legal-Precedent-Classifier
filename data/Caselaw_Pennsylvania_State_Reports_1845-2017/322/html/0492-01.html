The directors considered his request and concluded that the best interests of the corporation required them to decline the request; at the next annual meeting held about six weeks after the bill was filed, 1,133 shares were voted in favor of a resolution approving the action of the directors, and none against it.</p>

The court in bane can properly disregard such findings only in a clear case and then by putting upon record its reasons for so doing. ... In the instant case the court in banc gives reasons for its action, but they are not convincing, and, as neither that court nor this saw or heard the witnesses, we are in as good a position as it to weigh the evidence. . . . Furthermore, under the former practice, the court could only reverse the master’s findings of the facts in a clear case. . . . Where reasons are so given, it becomes the duty of an appellate court to fully and carefully examine them, together with the entire record, and determine whether the action of the court in banc is justified, keeping in mind the weight to which the original findings are entitled and also the reasons given for their overthrow. So doing, we have reached the conclusion that the action of the court in banc cannot be sustained.”</p>

Costlow died in August, 1933. The corporation had a prosperous career in selling automobiles until 1932. In 1932 and 1933, it lost money; in 1934 it made $18,-259.18. The first basic and undisputed fact is that in 1929 the directors, of whom plaintiff was then one, determined by a unanimous vote a dividend policy in the following resolution: “Resolved that the policy of this company as to dividends be as follows: During the year 1929 and until a change therein is made by the Board of Directors, to pay to the stockholders in the form of cash dividends from time to time during the year as the same may be declared by the Board, approximately one-half of the net earnings of the company from January 1st, 1929; the remaining earnings to be held for the purpose of a reserve for operation, either in the present business of the company in the purchase and sale of cars, or in financing the same on partial payment plan.” That policy was pursued thereafter. As losses were sustained in 1932 and 1933, though the corporation still had a relatively large surplus, no dividends were paid in those years. In 1934 a profit of $18,259.18 Avas made and on January 16, 1935, in pursuance of the policy declared, a dividend of $4.50 a share was paid; the sum was arrived at by deducting from the profits of 1934, the losses of 1932 and 1933 and distributing slightly less than one-half in diAddends.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Plaintiff’s bill was filed <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>September 6, 1934. No abuse of discretion can rightfully be predicated on the continuation of the dividend policy which plaintiff helped to inaugurate.</p>
    <p id="Adb" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[291,515,1152,694]]]'>The next basic fact is as follows. It is agreed that, but for a sum received (in 1933) on a policy of insurance on the life of Costlow, one of the founders of the company, to whose business acumen, apparently, the success of the corporation was due, the surplus in 1934, when plaintiff made his request, was substantially the same as it had been in 1932, and in 1933; that surplus was in a sum which was needed to carry on the operations of the corporation. It is also clear that it is not an abuse of discretion to refuse to declare a dividend which would reduce the surplus below what in past years had been and continued to be necessary for the conduct of the corporation’s business.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.6",538,[294,1222,1153,1186]],["BL_539.1",539,[138,351,1159,1124]]]'>The third basic fact is that when the manufacturer whose automobiles the corporation was selling cancelled the corporation’s exclusive right to sell in a given territory, a radical adjustment of its activity was needed to meet the new conditions. In prior years, to get the most out of its exclusive contract, the corporation had erected large storage facilities, said to be valued at $65,000, for the purpose of caring for the cars required to be sold; when the exclusive franchise in the given territory was taken, the need for this storage capacity ceased; the place was not required aqd the investment was no longer profitable. The chancellor and his colleagues differed about the value of these warehousing facilities, but it is clear that, as the facilities were not required for the time being, their value as an earning asset had greatly diminished. It became desirable, then, to see whether any, and if so what, changes in the conduct of its business should or could be made to supply increased earnings to take the place of those formerly earned while the corporation had the exclusive franchise. The directors — and, subject to stockholders’ veto, it was their problem — determined to finance, on a larger scale <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>than formerly, the sale of cai's by a system of credit extended to pnx’chasers of its cars. Certainly this was a subject for the consideration of the corporation and not for the court, and, so far as this record shows, this point of view is not challenged by plaintiff. The court in banc and the chancellor differed as to the amount necessary to carry out this policy: as to this difference the evidence supports the chancellor’s finding that “a sum of money in cash at all times of not less than $40,000 and at the peak seasons of sales, the sum of $50,000” is required, and does not support the revised finding of his colleagues that “The corporation requires for all purposes in the successful conduct of its business a sum of money in cash at all times of not over $40,000.” We can find no reason in the opinion filed by the majority below for changing this finding, though the rule requires that one be given. The evidence of Griffith<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and of the accountant Egts is positive on this point, and, having been credited by the chancellor, must be accepted, in the absence of other evidence to support the exception sustained by the court in banc.</p>

    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[284,457,1153,588]]]'>This brings us to the remaining element in the case. The success of the corporation is attributed by the evidence to the capacity of Frederick Costlow, one of the three original incorporators, who then owned three-fifths of the capital stock. In recognition of the value of his services, and to avoid any disastrous result to the corporation that might follow his death, the corporation insured his life in the sum of $35,000. He died in August, 1933, and the corporation received the proceeds of the policy, which, without considering the loss suffered by Ms death, increased its assets by that sum.</p>

The action of the directors in refusing to declare a dividend of that sum finds support on two grounds. (1) The resolution establishing the dividend policy already referred to as having plaintiff’s approval, limited dividend declaration to approximately one-half of the net earnings. The insurance was not net earnings within the contemplation of the parties. In <em>U. S. Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. v. Brown (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa/270/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="270 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1066088" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0270-01">270 Pa. 270</a>, 272,<a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.%20446" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="113 A. 446">113 A. 446</a>, we said: “To sustain a contract of this character, it must further appear that there is a real concern in the life of the party named, whose death would be the cause of substantial loss to those who are named .as beneficiaries. This does not follow the cessation of ordinary service, but arises where the success of the business is dependent on the continued life of the employee. In the latter case the insurance contract will be upheld [citing cases].” The defendant company had an insurable interest in Costlow’s life and the insurance was received as indemnity for the loss so resulting to the corporation. In <em>U. S. v. Supplee-Biddle Hardware </em>Co., <a href="/us/265/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="265 U.S. 189" data-case-ids="6139078" data-case-paths="/us/265/0189-01">265 U. S. 189</a>, in a suit to recover income taxes assessed and paid under protest on the proceeds of life insurance policies received by the corporation on the death of its president, it was held that the proceeds <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>were not income within the Revenue Act of 1918 and had been wrongly taxed. The court was asked, but found it unnecessary to characterize the proceeds as capital: “It is earnestly pressed upon us that proceeds of life insurance paid on the death of the insured are in fact capital and can not be taxed as income under the Sixteenth Amendment [citing cases]. We are not required to meet this question. It is enough to sustain our construction of the act to say that proceeds of a life insurance policy paid on the death of the insured are not usually classed as income. . . . Life insurance in such a case is like that of fire and marine insurance, a contract of indemnity: <em>Central Bank of Washington v. Hume, </em><a href="/us/128/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="128 U.S. 195" data-case-ids="3533634" data-case-paths="/us/128/0195-01">128 U. S. 195</a>. The benefit to be gained by death has no periodicity. It is a substitution of money value for something permanently lost either in a house, a ship, or a life. Assuming without deciding that Congress could call the proceeds of such indemnity, income, and validly tax it as such, we think that in view of the popular conception of the life insurance as resulting in a single addition of a total sum to the resources of the beneficiary, and not in a periodical return, such a purpose on its part should be express, as it certainly is not here.” And this accords with accounting practice,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> which, while not conclusive, is of interest as showing an accepted understanding of the problem.</p>

He was, in a sense, an untried man whose capacity to continue the success <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>achieved by his father’s management remained to be demonstrated. Conditions had seriously changed in other respects. As has been stated, the exclusive territorial franchise had been cancelled; competition was now possible; the $65,000 warehousing facilities no longer produced the earnings for which they were originally constructed; the business had sustained losses in 1932 and 1933; it was necessary to find methods of checking these losses and of supplying them by profitable business. Could that be done? The corporation, for some period of time, gave consideration to an extension of the practice of financing its purchasers by carrying them with its credit. In the considesation of that problem, the directors had now in the treasury the insurance money, $35,000, created and received to tide over its affairs in the event of Costlow’s death until, if possible, its effect on the corporation’s business had been minimized.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The results of the deliberation on this problem were that it was determined to increase the extension of credit to its purchasers to the extent allowed by this ac<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>cretion to its assets. This conclusion was in the interests of the entire shareholding body; if it should turn out to be ill-advised, the shareholders must bear it as an act performed by their representatives; but no court, on this record, can say that it is a business policy that should not have been adopted. It is agreed that there is no fraud; the evidence is that the corporate action was in good faith; it was done by persons who, since 1919, had on the whole conducted the business profitably; it was done by the persons, who, under the agreement of the shareholders, were expressly authorized to do it. Having so determined what should be done with the insurance money, it could of course not be distributed as dividends.</p>

If a Cash Surrender Value account has been set up, this account should be credited with a sufficient amount to close it, and the balance should be credited to Surplus”: <em>Finney, Principles of Accounting, </em>volume 2, page 115. “The credits would be made in two accounts, one to the account ‘Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Policy,’ to eliminate the asset set up during the previous years, and the second credit being to Surplus”: <em>Kester, Accounting, </em>volume 2, page 214.</p>

      <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[314,1517,1155,913]]]'> One of the directors testified that they thought that “that accumulation of insurance [should not] be paid out immediately to the stockholders as cash dividend, but that it should be carried over during the period of transition, for during that time a new manager might be broken in. That’s one reason for the Board of Directors declining to declare any distribution by way of dividends at the time.” Another testified: “Yes, and we had other reasons because my brother and I [both directors] were not exactly sure of what we were going to do with the business. Another thing, we were replacing productive machinery and we didn’t know whether the loss of my father [Frederick Costlow] would materially affect the company or not. We had experienced two years’ loss prior to 1932 and 1933 along with that loss of his [him?] in the business and we didn’t know what the future had in store for us.” The plaintiff’s reason for requesting the dividend appears to have been purely personal and not in the general interest. He testified". . . and I thought that they should declare such dividend as would enable me to carry the stock [pledged as stated above] and I would continue to cooperate with them as I had from the organization of the Company.”</p>
