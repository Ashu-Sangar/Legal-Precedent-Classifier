    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.8",170,[281,700,1154,1234]]]'>In examining his expert witnesses counsel for plaintiffs asked them what in their opinion was the difference between the fair market value of the property immediately before and the fair market value immediately after the road construction took place. Defendant’s counsel objected to this form of questioning on the ground that, instead of being asked what they considered the difference in value to be, they should first be asked their opinion regarding the fair market value of the property before the taking, and then the fair market value after the taking. The court overruled the objections. When it came to the presentation of defendant’s side of the case, defendant’s counsel asked his witnesses for their opinion as to the fair market value of the property before the exercise of the right of eminent domain and unaffected by it, and the fair market value after the exercise of such right. Counsel for the plaintiffs objected to these questions and the objections were sustained. The result was that two real estate experts for defendant were prevented from giving any valuations whatever, defendant’s counsel refusing to avail himself of the permission of the court to ask the one question as to the difference in values before and after the taking.</p>

Co. v. Sassaman, </em><a href="/pa/67/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="67 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="1022581" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0415-01">67 Pa. 415</a>; <em>Beck v. Penna., Poughkeepsie &amp; Boston R. R.

Obviously he could not have determined the alleged difference in values without first coming to a mental conclusion as to the value before and the value after and then subtracting the one from the other, and to give merely the result of this concealed arithmetical calculation is to withhold the factors without which the jury cannot intelligently place their stamp of approval or disapproval upon the testimony. The party producing the witness should not be allowed to cast upon the other side the burden of eliciting on cross-examination the opinion of the witness as to the values before and after the taking. Be this as it may, however, the learned trial judge committed clear error in refusing to allow defendant’s witnesses to testify as to the values before and after. Not. only for the reason already suggested is this the preferable form of questioning, but it is a method which has been sanctioned by general and long-continued usage, has been tacitly or expressly approved in many opinions of this court, — a comparatively recent example of which is to be found in the case of <em>McSorley v. Avalon Boro. School District, </em><a href="/pa/291/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="291 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="1107285" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0252-01">291 Pa. 252</a>, 255, — and has been given even statutory authorization in the Acts of April 21, 1915, P. L. 159, June 23, 1931, P. L. 932, section 2817, and June 24, 1931, P. L. 1206, section 1914. Defendant’s 14th to 18th assignments of error, inclusive, are accordingly sustained.</p>

All of this testimony, however, was offered subject to the express limitation that it was being presented, not as an independent element of damage, but as a matter to be <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>taken into consideration in arriving at the difference in the fair market value of the property before and after the taking, and the learned trial judge charged the jury to the same effect. There was therefore no violation of the well-established principle expressed in <em>Westinghouse Airbrake Co. v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/316/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="316 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="1159056" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0372-01">316 Pa. 372</a>, 375, that “Estimates as to the costs of rebuilding specific items <em>oí </em>property or injury to particular uses affected by the taking, are not recoverable or admissible as distinct items of damage, but such losses may become useful as elements bearing on the market value before and after the appropriation.” The same rule was applied in <em>Bridgman Realty Corp. v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/317/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="317 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="8846202" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0449-01">317 Pa. 449</a>.</p>
