    <p id="b374-6" data-blocks='[["BL_374.9",374,[284,671,1149,475]]]'>Plaintiff claims she was made sick by the presence of a centipede in the spoon with which she was eating vegetable soup served to her at lunch in defendant’s restaurant. On this account she brought suit to recover damages from defendant. In pursuance of binding instructions from the trial judge, the jury found a verdict in defendant’s favor. Plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the judgment entered. We allowed an appeal from its order granting a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b374-7" data-blocks='[["BL_374.10",374,[285,1158,1148,957]]]'>Appellant thus described what happened: “When I was taking a tablespoon to my mouth I noticed a centipede in the spoon.” She went on to say: “It was a sort of worm or centipede. That is what I thought it was.” She added that she ^didn’t touch it” and did not put it in her mouth. She admitted that the soup, most of which she had eaten, had no bad taste. She claims .that she was nauseated by seeing the object in the spoon and continued in this state for two or three weeks, although she was never actively sick in the sense that she vomited. During this period she was treated by her family physician five times. He testified that he gave her only simple remedies and that her disturbed state was more mental than physical. She claims' to have lost nine or ten pounds in weight. Upon leaving the restaurant, she returned to the bank where she was employed and continued to work daily thereafter, losing no time whatever.</p>

    <p id="b375-3" data-blocks='[["BL_375.4",375,[156,560,1150,1396]]]'>“There can be no recovery for injuries resulting from fright, or a nervous shock, unaccompanied by physical injuries”: <em>Howarth v.

There was no allegation that she had received any bodily injury. If mere fright, unaccompanied with bodily injury, is a cause of action, the scope of what are known as accident cases will be very greatly enlarged; for, in every case of a collision on a railroad, the passengers, although they may have sustained no bodily harm, will have a cause of action against the company for the ‘fright’ to which they have been subjected. This is a step beyond any decision of any legal tribunal of which we have knowledge.” We repeated this ruling in <em>Huston v. Freemansburg Boro., </em><a href="/pa/212/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="212 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="941841" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0548-01">212 Pa. 548</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.%201022" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="61 A. 1022">61 Atl. 1022</a>, saying that it is settled in this State and no longer open for discussion, and adverted to it in <em>Chittick v.
