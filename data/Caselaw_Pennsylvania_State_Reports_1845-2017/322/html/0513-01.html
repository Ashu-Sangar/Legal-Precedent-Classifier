L. 975, entitled “An act providing for the registration of bottles ... or other containers; and forbidding the refilling of, or dealing or trafficking in, such registered bottles. ...” The defendant there urged that the provision making “unlawful possession” of such bottles a penal offense was not indicated by the title. The objection was sustained. The title of that act discloses two definite purposes; first, the registration of containers, and, second, the regulation of the refilling or dealing or trafficking in such containers. No provision for general use is indicated by the title. The words “dealing or trafficking in” are distinctly restricted to a commercial use. The title of the Liquor Control Act is more comprehensive. The word “use” employed in it includes “possession.” It would be difficult to use liquor without having it in possession. Possession is clearly a step in use, and “use” is not necessarily confined in meaning to active service.</p>

But, it is urged, these words apply only to licensees, the one group of persons specifically mentioned. Appellant thus invokes the familiar maxim that to expressly name one class is to exclude all others.

The Brooks High License Law of May, 1887, P. L. 108, restricted the trade in such liquors to licensed persons, and established certain rules for its conduct.

We have never decided the question whether the bare possession of liquor can be made punishable, although the Snyder Act of March 27,1923, P. L. 34, so provided. Statutes in other jurisdictions were enacted with this object prior to the Eighteenth Amendment. As to the validity of these acts there was a difference of opinion in the courts of those other states having constitutional guarantees similar to those of Pennsylvania. The tendency of the earlier decisions, which has persisted in several jurisdictions, was to regard such enactments as violative of the inherent right of citizens to be protected in their possession of private property. It was held that the mere possession of liquor, without more, was in no way injurious to the public at large, and could not, therefore, afford justification for the exercise of the police power.
