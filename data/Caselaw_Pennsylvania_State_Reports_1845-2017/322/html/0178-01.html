As prompt action was necessary, if unfortunate results were not to follow, we have heretofore issued an order continuing the present mercantile appraisers in office. This opinion is filed for the purpose of stating what the conditions were, our view of the law applicable thereto and the reasons for the order made.</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[277,1055,1148,636]]]'>The question for determination was this: The law having directed the auditor general of the Commonwealth and the city treasurer of Philadelphia jointly to appoint mercantile appraisers for that city on or before a prescribed date, if the two officers do not agree on the persons to be appointed and no appointments are made, do the appraisers in office, whose term expired on the date named, continue in office with the power to exercise the functions conferred upon them by law and to enjoy the emoluments of their positions? Our conclusion was and is that they do until their successors are duly appointed according to law.</p>

L. 1025, 72 PS section 2713, which provides : “That in all cities of the first class, on or before the thirteenth day of December, one thousand nine hundred and nineteen, and quadrennially thereafter, the auditor general and the city treasurer shall appoint five suitable qualified citizens as mercantile appraisers for terms of four years each. Not all of said appraisers shall be members of the same political party. The powers, duties, and compensation of said appraisers shall be as now provided by law.” It will be seen that no provision is made in the statute for what is to happen in case the two appointing officials do not make the ap<a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>pointments, which in this instance, owing to the expiration of the terms of the incumbents, should have been, but were not, made on or before December 13, 1935.</p>

It is too plain for argument that the city treasurer alone had no power to make appointments. The act of assembly prescribes that the appointments shall be made jointly by him and the auditor general. The alleged appointments thus made by the city treasurer were void and of no effect.</p>

Every reason of public policy and public interest speaks against vacancies in the offices. These officials exercise very important governmental duties. Mandatory statutes require thousands of establishments in Philadelphia to be licensed by the State through these appraisers in order to carry on business during the year 1936. They include all mercantile establishments, wholesale as well as retail, all auctioneers, brokers, factors, commission merchants, real estate brokers, places of amusement, billiard rooms, boAvling <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>alleys, restaurants, manufacturers and venders of patent medicines. It is stated that more than 60,000 persons and corporations are to be licensed. For operating without a license persons are liable to criminal prosecution. In the issuance of the licenses the mercantile appraisers must take the first step. They make the assessment or appraisement on the basis of which the license fee is determined. The procedure is now in progress and must be proceeded with or serious results to business will follow and large revenues will be lost to the State. The five mercantile appraisers sitting as a board hear all appeals from appraisements. All persons subject to the mercantile tax must obtain their licenses not later than May 1, 1936. No other agency of the State is authorized by law to take over the work or assume the functions of the mercantile appraisers. From this recital the public interest and importance of the matter will be seen.</p>

However, at common law, and Pennsylvania is still and it is hoped always will be a common law State, the rule is that the incumbents of offices whose terms have expired continue in office until action is taken by the appointing power in accord with the law. This principle was fully investigated and reviewed by the Supreme Court of California in <em>Stratton v. Oulton, </em><a href="/cal/28/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="28 Cal. 44" data-case-ids="2220926" data-case-paths="/cal/28/0044-01">28 Cal. 44</a>. As pointed out in that opinion the reason for the rule is because government cannot properly function without necessary officers. As we have before stated, the officers here in question are most necessary to the proper functioning of government.</p>

There was no provision in the ordinance providing for his appointment that he should hold until the appointment and qualification of his successor. The mayor nominated the then city solicitor to succeed himself, but the nomination was rejected by city council. The solicitor continued to perform the duties of the office and claimed salary for the time that he occupied it after his appointive term expired. In holding that he was entitled to the salary, the Court of Appeals of Maryland pointed out that any other than the common law ruling “might cause a vacancy in nearly every office, and a suspension of business in the various departments of the municipality.”</p>

We acquit the auditor general and city treasurer personally of any intention to contemn the prerogatives of the court and quite readily believe that the action which they, took in naming the new officers was mistakenly taken and without any intention upon their part to act in a way which could not meet with the court’s approval. We conclude, however, that their action taken while the case was sub judice was a nullity and that no rights were acquired to the offices by those whom they appointed on March 13th.</p>

That one arises out of article VI, section 4, of the Constitution, which provides: “. . . Appointed officers, other than judges of the courts of record and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, may be removed at the pleasure of the power by which they shall have been appointed. ...” We recently had occasion to consider this section of the Constitution in <em>Com. ex rel. v. Hiltner, </em><a href="/pa/307/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="307 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1138123" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0343-01">307 Pa. 343</a>, and said that this language is clear and unequivocal. In <em>Georges Twp. School Direc</em>tors, <a href="/pa/286/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="286 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1096468" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0129-01">286 Pa. 129</a>, we decided that the constitutional method of removal is exclusive and prohibitory of any mode which the legislature may deem better or more <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>convenient. In <em>Finley v. McNair, </em><a href="/pa/317/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="317 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="8845675" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0278-01">317 Pa. 278</a>, we gave further consideration to the section. With the provision again before us, we conclude that it is controlling in the present controversy and that the auditor general and city treasurer have the power to remove the defendants or any of them from office and to appoint for the remainder of the four-year term such others as they may desire in their stead. On the familiar principle stated, however, that power could not be exercised while the litigation was pending in this court.</p>
