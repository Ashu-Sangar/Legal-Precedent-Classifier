Wilson, upon a sealed instrument whereby he guaranteed the prompt payment of all rents and royalties due the plaintiffs under a lease of these lands to the Wilson Coal Company, a corporation, of which defend<a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>ant was president. The lease granted the right to mine and remove the coal under these lands, the lessee to pay a semimonthly rent or royalty for each ton of coal mined and removed therefrom. The original affidavit of defense was adjudged insufficient and leave was granted to amend it. The amended affidavit of defense subsequently filed was also held to be insufficient, and the court below entered judgment for plaintiffs for the full amount of their claim, whereupon the defendant appealed.</p>

The plaintiffs entered judgment in ejectment on the lease on August 16, 1934, and by virtue thereof recovered possession of the leased premises. Under a landlord’s warrant of distress the goods and chattels of the lessee on the property were sold on August 31,1934, for fifty dollars, which was insufficient to pay the costs and expenses of the sale.

By way of “Set-off, Counterclaim and New Matter,” he avers that on April 18, 1933, the lessee assigned to plaintiffs as collateral for the payment of rentals then due the amount of $5,191.66, being a portion of a debt due and owing to lessee from another corporation named the Flagg Coal Company. He asserts that the action of the plaintiffs, in instituting the proceeding in ejectment upon the lease by which possession of the demised premises was recovered, terminated the lease and ended his liability to plaintiffs. Defendant maintains that he is at least entitled to a credit of $4,000 upon the amount claimed, this sum representing the fair value of certain trackage and equipment of the lessee sold at constable’s sale under the landlord’s warrant, and purchased by plaintiffs for the alleged grossly inadequate sum of fifty dollars.

L. 971, a written agreement made by one person to answer for the default of another subjects such person to the liabilities of suretyship unless the agreement contains in substance the words “this is not intended to be a contract of surety-ship.” The agreement executed by the defendant does not have this provision. Hence it must be regarded as a suretyship contract. We have often said that it is a fundamental incident of suretyship that upon default a surety and his principal are both primarily liable upon the original undertaking <em>(Reigart v.

However, forbearance on the part of the creditor, and delay in enforcing his rights do not constitute such an extension of time to the principal debtor as will release the surety: <em>Miller v.

    <p id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[291,1149,1149,801]]]'>The foregoing principles must be applied in determining the sufficiency of the defenses relied upon in the affidavit. Defendant guaranteed the “prompt” payment of the rent reserved. He contends that he was released when plaintiffs failed to insist upon “prompt” payment and allowed delinquent rentals to accumulate for over a year before bringing suit. It is true that under the lease plaintiffs were entitled to proceed against the lessee upon default in any semimonthly installment of rent, but we find nothing in the lease which required them to do so. It seems to us the failure of plaintiffs to enforce their demands for rent before August, 1934, was merely forbearance upon their part, and therefore did not have the effect of releasing defendant as surety upon the lease. See <em>Miller v. Keller, </em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.N.C.%2027" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="1 W.N.C. 27">1 W. N. C. 27</a>.</p>

While, as we have stated above, a contract to extend the time of payment would release the surety, yet we have repeatedly held that the mere ac<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>ceptance of additional security for a debt raises no implication of an extension of tbe time for payment of the original claim: <em>Shaw &amp; Leigh v.

In the present case there is nothing in the record to indicate that the giving of the additional collateral was consideration for an extension of time to the lessee, or that it was anything more than an added security to the plaintiffs for the payment of the rent. We find no merit in these contentions. The original undertaking of the lessee was not varied so as to entitle the defendant to a release from his written obligation to be answerable to plaintiffs for the payment of the rent reserved under the lease. He will, of course, be entitled by subrogation to all of plaintiffs’ rights in the security which they hold upon his payment of their claim, and to an assignment of the collateral now in their possession: <em>Neff’s App., </em><a href="/watts-serg/9/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 36" data-case-ids="12168821" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0036-01">9 W. &amp; S. 36</a>; <em>Musgrave v.

It will be noted that no rent is claimed beyond the date when plaintiffs repossessed the premises. Therefore the liability sought herein to be enforced against defendant is only for the rent already accrued. Such liability came into existence with each default in the payment of rent and continued in effect so long as any of the rent accrued remained unpaid: <em>King v.

He bases his contention upon the principle that a creditor must exercise good faith and protect for the benefit of a surety for the debt any property which he may hold as collateral security. He argues that the price of fifty dollars received at the sale on the landlord’s warrant was grossly inadequate, and that the plaintiffs should credit upon the debt the sum of $4,000 as the fair value of the property sold. This contention must fail because the affidavit of defense does not set forth sufficient facts to support it. The bare allegation that the property sold, — indefinitely described as “some two miles of mine track, a large number of mules, and all other mining equipment” — was “valued at approximately Four Thousand Dollars,” is insufficient to raise an issue of fact. The presumption is that at a public sale the price received is the highest and best obtainable. The unsupported statement that the value of the property sold is greater than the price received at the sale does not disclose any facts upon which a court could find either that the sale was not properly conducted, or that the price obtained was not then the fair market value. It has been repeatedly ruled by this court that inadequacy of price is not alone sufficient to invalidate a public sale under process of law: <em>Carsons Sale, </em><a href="/watts/6/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="6 Watts 140" data-case-ids="1846100" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0140-01">6 Watts 140</a>; <em>Cake v.
