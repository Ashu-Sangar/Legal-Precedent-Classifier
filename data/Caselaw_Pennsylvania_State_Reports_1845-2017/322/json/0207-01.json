The court below held, \u201cWhere the defendants in an action such as this have had knowledge of alleged fraud or partial or total failure of consideration when renewing the note, or notes, upon which suit is brought they are estopped by their own conduct from defending on the ground of alleged fraud or partial or total failure of consideration: Dunn v. Columbia, Nat. Bank, 204 Pa. 53; Longacre v. Robinson, 274 Pa. 35; First Nat. Bank of Pgh. v. Dowling, 286 Pa. 483; Warren Nat. Bank v. Jamieson, 301 Pa. 45.\u201d See also Ebensburg Trust Co. v.
