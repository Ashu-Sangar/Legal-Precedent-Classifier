        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nJudgment d. s. b. was entered by confession in a lease for $12,180 against Murray L. Blank in favor of John J. Forgeng and Bessie Kratzok, the appellants herein. The default claimed was the removal from the premises by the appellee without notice and consent of the appellants and without having paid one month\u2019s rent which was then due and all rent which would become due during the term of the lease, which expires August 31, 1940.\nThe lease declares that \u201cthe said Charles M. Miller is acting as agent\u201d and that the lease is entered into between \u201cCharles M. Miller, Agent, and Bessie Kratzok and John J. Forgeng, herinafter called lessor, of the one part, and Murray L. Blank, hereinafter called lessee.\u201d The issue is whether the judgment was properly entered in favor of Bessie Kratzok and John J. Forgeng alone, or whether the name of \u201cCharles M. Miller, Agent\u201d should have been included as party plaintiff in the judgment.\nUpon defendant\u2019s petition, the judgment was stricken off by the court below on the ground that \u201cin the lease the word \u2018lessor,\u2019 as indicated in the description of the parties, means three persons, Charles M. Miller, Agent, Bessie Kratzok and John J. Forgeng. In the warrant of attorney, it must mean the same three. However, the judgment was entered in favor of two only, Bessie Kratzok and John J. Forgeng; it tvas therefore not in favor of the \u2018lessor\u2019 as that term is used in the warrant, is invalid on its face and must be stricken off.\u201d\nWe do not agree with that conclusion. The lease recites: \u201c. . . It is distinctly understood and agreed that the said Charles M. Miller is acting as agent and shall not in any event be held personally liable to his principal or to the Lessee for the fulfillment or nonfulfillment of any of the terms of this Lease. ...\u201d The lease is signed:\n\u201cCharles M. Miller Agent (seal)\n\u201cCarl W. Miller Atty (seal)\n\u201cMurray L. Blank (seal)\u201d\nAfter the execution of the lease is the following:\n\u201cWe hereby accept and approve of the foregoing Agreement of lease made by in pursuance of the authority given him by\n\u201cJohn J. Forgeng (seal)\n\u201cAddress\n\u201cBessie Kratzok (seal)\n\u201cAddress\n\u201cWitness at Signing\n\u201cCarl W. Miller\u201d\nThe lease being executed by \u201cCharles M. Miller, Agent\u201d and \u201cCarl W. Miller, Atty.,\u201d (and by Murray L. Blank, admittedly the lessee), the inference is plain that the two Millers, one an \u201cagent\u201d and the other an \u201cattorney,\u201d were representing the lessors. Then follows an \u201capproval of the lease\u201d signed by John J. Forgeng and Bessie Kratzok. In the absence of any averment to the contrary, one has no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that these two persons are the only lessors. In the petition to strike off the judgment there is no averment by Murray L. Blank that Charles M. Miller, Agent, had any other status than that of agent for Bessie Kratzok and John J. Forgeng. What the lessee, desirous of striking off the judgment, did not aver, we are not justified in inferring. The natural inference is rather the other way.\nIn Waldman v. Baer, 81 Pa. Superior Ct. 390, a lease was signed by Joseph Baer as lessee and by \u201cII. Windt & Co., Agents.\u201d It bore a written assignment to Lena Gottlieb executed by Henry Waldman. Judgment having been entered for breach of covenant, there was a motion to strike off for the reason, inter alia, that judgment should have been entered in the name of \u201cH. Windt & Co., Agents\u201d and in addition that it should have been entered to the use of Lena Gottlieb. The Superior Court said, in an opinion by Judge Linn : \u201cIn view of the tenant\u2019s release of errors, we need not consider the subject (Isman v. Niederman, 74 Pa. Superior Ct. 175, 179), though we have no doubt the judgment naming H. Waldman instead of Windt & Co., Agents, as legal plaintiff was authorized by the lease (Gleadall v. Kenney, 23 Pa. Superior Ct. 576), and specifying a use-plaintiff did not injure defendant, (Pennsylvania Co. v. Shanahan, 10 Pa. Superior Ct. 267).\u201d In Gleadall v. Kenney, supra, the lease was signed as follows: \u201cMary Kahmer through her Agent John K. Stokley.\u201d Later for violation of the covenants, an amicable action was entered and judgment confessed against the defendant. The Superior Court said: \u201cThe entry of judgment was strictly within the term of the power. We cannot see that the validity of the judgment, or of the power pursuant to which it was entered, is affected by the fact that the lease was not signed by the lessor or her lawfully authorized agent.\u201d\nThe judgment of the court below is reversed.",
