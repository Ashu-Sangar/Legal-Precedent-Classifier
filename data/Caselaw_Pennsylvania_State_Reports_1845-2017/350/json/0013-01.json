        "text": "Opinion by Me.\nJustice Allen M. Stearne,\nThe decree of the court below must be reversed. An orphans\u2019 court does not have jurisdiction in such actions ex delicto: Locher\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 219 Pa. 42, 67 A. 953.\nDecedent was a cashier of a national bank. A few days after his death a depositor appeared at the bank and presented a certificate of deposit for $7,426.00. He requested a renewal certificate. The certificate so presented had been executed and issued by decedent as cashier. Investigation disclosed puzzling irregularities in the bank\u2019s records. On the face of the records the issuance of the certificate created a liability for which there appeared no corresponding asset. Yet, it was conceded that the certificate represented a renewal of a series of prior certificates for the same fund and extending over a period of many years. The situation was complicated by the fact that decedent\u2019s immediate predecessor as cashier, under whom decedent had served as assistant, was an admitted defaulter. The testimony does not establish that decedent was guilty of embezzlement. None of the bank\u2019s funds was traced to his possession. Nothing appears upon the record to indicate that decedent manipulated bank records in order to hide his own defalcation or that of the former cashier. The auditing judge frankly concedes that the apparent discrepancy in the bank\u2019s records and its correction \u201cserves more to confound than to enlighten\u201d; also that the evidence does not show \u201cprecisely just when [decedent] committed a defalcation or the exact manner in which he committed it\u201d. Despite the fact that there is no direct proof of an actual defalcation by decedent, the learned auditing judge decreed that his estate is liable to the bank for the loss and damage because of decedent\u2019s malfeasance. He ruled that when decedent issued the certificate of deposit when there was no corresponding asset, he thereby created a liability of the bank, and for such wilful and negligent conduct, decedent\u2019s estate is liable to the bank.\nThe facts in the present case closely parallel those in Locher\u2019s Estate, supra. In that case the decedent, president of a bank, made unauthorized loans to a partnership of which he was a member, to his son, and to two corporations in which decedent was interested. It was alleged that the parties to whom the loans were made were then insolvent and the security taken insufficient; and that the transactions were a fraud upon the bank and therefore the decedent\u2019s estate was liable for the loss. This Court decided that if the decedent had been guilty of tortious or criminal acts, his liability for damages must be first determined in a court of competent jurisdiction, and after damages have been liquidated, and judgment entered on the verdict, it could then be certified to the orphans\u2019 court when claimant could participate in distribution; and that such a tortfeasor could not be deprived of his common law right of a trial by jury.\nAppellee herein contends, as in the Locher\u2019s Estate, supra, that the bank has the right to waive the tort and make claim for money had and received, based upon an implied trust or contract. There is no proof that decedent received any money from the bank. The sole basis for the allowance of the claim was decedent\u2019s alleged \u201cwilful and negligent conduct\u201d in issuing certificates of deposit thereby creating a liability upon the bank.\nSeparate orphans\u2019 courts were established by Article Y, Section 22 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of 1874; Purdon\u2019s Penna. Statutes Annotated, p. 341. That section and article provides that an orphans\u2019 court \u201cshall exercise all the jurisdiction and powers now vested in or which may hereafter be conferred upon [it].\u201d By the Act of May 19,1874, P. L. 206, section 1,20 PS, section 2081, the legislature enacted that orphans\u2019 courts were courts of record. The legislature thereafter passed various acts conferring and defining the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court. Such statutory enactments were codified in the Orphans\u2019 Court Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 363, section 1, 20 PS, section 2082 and its supplements. Apart, now, from constitutional limitations, no statute has been passed conferring jurisdiction upon the orphans\u2019 court to determine liability for the tort upon which the claim is based. Section 9(e) of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act of 1917, supra, confers jurisdiction upon the orphans\u2019 court concerning \u201cThe distribution of the assets and surplusage of the estates of decedents among creditors and others interested.\u201d Such language merely re-enacts the provisions of prior statutes. As was pointed out in Locher\u2019s Estate, supra, the plaintiff in an action ex delicto against the estate of a decedent is not a creditor until such status is established by obtaining a judgment on a verdict rendered by a jury in a court of competent jurisdiction. We are not unmindful of the Act of July 1, 1937, P. L. 2665, which authorizes the orphans\u2019 court to conduct jury trials \u201cto determine issues awarded by it.\u201d But this Act does not confer jurisdiction upon the orphans\u2019 court in such actions ex delicto.\nWe note that the question of jurisdiction was not presented to the auditing judge in the court below and we are therefore deprived of the research and views of the able court below. We must, however, consider it. Magel v. Springs, 338 Pa. 452, 12 A. 2d 558; McCoach v. Philadelphia, 273 Pa. 317, 117 A. 71; Pantall v. Dickey, 123 Pa. 431, 16 A. 789; Musselman\u2019s Appeal, 101 Pa. 165; Fowler v. Eddy, 110 Pa. 117, 1 A. 789; Simpson\u2019s Estate, 253 Pa. 217, 98 A. 35.\nThe decree of the court below is reversed. The record is remitted to the court below, without prejudice to the right of the appellee, as claimant, to require suspension of distribution, for a reasonable period, to enable it to present its claim before a court of competent jurisdiction.
