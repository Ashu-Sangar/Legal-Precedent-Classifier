        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThe question is, What did Congress mean by the term \u201creal property\u201d in the' Act waiving immunity from taxation of certain property owned by government agencies? It is presented by this appeal from the confirmation of a township tax assessment for the triennial period 1942-45. Appellant, Defense Plant Corporation, originally complained of the entire assessment, which itemized land, buildings and machinery, but at the hearing in the court below conceded the power to tax the land and buildings and denied only the power to tax the machinery.\nThe parties have agreed that the plant-machinery was \u201cnecessary and essential to its [appellant\u2019s plant\u2019s] existence and operation as a manufacturing plant for aircraft propellers.\u201d It was held taxable as real estate pursuant to the General County Assessment Law of May 22, 1933, P. L. 853, 72 PS section 5020-101, providing: \u201cSection 201. Subjects of Taxation Enumerated. \u2014 The following subjects and property shall, as hereinafter provided, be valued and assessed, and subject to taxation for all county, city, borough, town, township, school and poor purposes at the annual rate:\n\u201c(a) All real estate to wit: Houses, lands, lots of ground and ground rents, mills and manufactories of all kinds, furnaces, forges, bloomeries, distilleries, sugar houses, malt houses, breweries, tan yards, fisheries, and ferries, wharves, and all other real estate not exempt by law from taxation.\u201d\nIt has long been the rule in Pennsylvania that \u201cWhether fast or loose, therefore, all the machinery of a manufactory which is necessary to constitute it, and without which it would not be a manufactory at all, must pass for a part of the freehold.\u201d Voorhis v. Freeman, 2 W. & S. 116, 119 (1841). This rule prevails in the majority of the states in which the subject has been considered by the courts, as the cases, cited later, show. Appellant\u2019s machinery, being an integrated part of the manufactory, and so, of the freehold, was therefore taxable, as other real property in the township was taxable unless the Congressional immunity did not apply.\nThe Act provides: \u201cAny and all notes, debentures, bonds, or other such obligations issued by the corporation shall be exempt both as to principal and interest from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, except as provided in section 742a (a) of Title 31. The corporation, including its franchise, its capital, reserves, and surplus, and its income shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority; except that any real property of the corporation shall be subject to State, Territorial, county, municipal, or local taxation to the same extent according to its value as other real property is taxed. The exemptions provided for in the preceding sentence, with respect to taxation (which shall, for all purposes, be deemed to include sales, use, storage, and purchase taxes) shall be construed to be applicable not only with respect to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation but also with respect to (1) the Defense Plant Corporation, the Defense Supplies Corporation, the Metals Reserve Company, the Rubber Reserve Company, and any other corporation heretofore or hereafter organized or created by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation under section 606b of this title, as amended, to aid the Government of the United States in its national-defense program, (2) the RFC Mortgage Company, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and any other public corporation heretofore or hereafter organized by or at the instance of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and (3) the Disaster Loan Corporation, and any other public corporation which is now or which may be hereafter wholly financed and wholly managed by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Such exemptions shall also be construed to be applicable to the loans made, and personal property owned, by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or by any corporation referred to in clause (1), (2) or (3) of the preceding sentence, but such exemptions shall not be construed to be applicable in any State to any buildings which are considered by the laws of such State to be personal property for taxation purposes.\u201d\nOur special concern is with the provisions \u201c. . . except that any real property of the corporation shall be subject to State, Territorial, county, municipal, or local taxation to the same extent according to its value as other real property is taxed . . . Such exemptions shall also be construed to be applicable to . . . personal property owned by . . . [Defense Plant Corporation] . . . but such exemptions shall not be construed to be applicable in any State to any buildings which are considered by the laws of such State to be personal property for taxation purposes.\u201d\nWhat did Congress intend by the term \u201creal property\u201d in the statute which was designed to waive immunity in aid of the revenues of local communities in which industrial establishments were engaged in manufacturing defense material? Did it intend \u201creal property\u201d to include the entire \u201cmill or manufactory\u201d (as provided by local law) or only the land and vacant buildings without the mechanical part of the plant?\nTwo suggestions are made by the parties for determining the intended content of the term real property. The appellant says: \u201cWe submit that the primary, universally accepted meaning of \u2018real property\u2019 is, as indicated in the foregoing quotations, land together with such tangible items, generally chattel in nature, as have by intention of the interested parties and by their permanent manner of attachment to the land become incorporated into the land, that is, buildings and fixtures.\u201d\nWe think there is such ambiguity and uncertainty in that statement, that we must reject it on the ground that it does not represent the majority view. Our examination of the decisions dealing with the actual and constructive attachment of machinery to the freehold throughout the states, shows that in a majority of the states, the attachment to the land may be constructive and need not be physical to the extent that removal will result in serious damage to the remaining freehold. In Ohio, for example, only \u201cslight\u201d attachment is required. The evidence in the record shows that some of the machinery in appellant\u2019s plant is easily removable; some is bolted to foundations; \u201choists, the monorail, or crane runway\u201d appear to be built in and supported by the structural part of the building. For some states, no decisions were found. In some states, statutes provide that certain classes of machinery shall be assessed as real property.\nOn the other hand, the appellee submits that, in abolishing immunity and conferring the local power of taxation, Congress must have intended the content of the term real property to be determined by the law of the taxing district. In the condemnation proceeding, U. S. ex rel. T.V.A. v. Powelson, 319 U. S. 266, 63 Sup. Ct. 1047, 1054, the court said at page 279, \u201cThough the meaning of \u2018property\u2019 as used in \u00a7 25 of the Act and in the Fifth Amendment is a federal question, it will normally obtain its content by reference to the local law.\u201d The rule was applied in U. S. v. Becktold Co., 129 F. 2d 473 (C.C.A. 8th, 1942) and in U.S. v. 19.86 Acres of Land, 141 F. 2d 344 (C.C.A. 7th, 1944), similar cases being referred to in the opinions.\nAgainst the adoption of the local definition of real estate, the appellant refers to several cases: Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363, 50 Sup. Ct. 121; Lyeth v. Hoey, Collector, 305 U. S. 188, 59 Sup. Ct. 155; and Morgan v. Commissioner, 309 U. S. 78, 60 Sup. Ct. 424. In the Carpenter case it was necessary to determine what Congress meant by tbe word \u201clands\u201d in tbe Act ratifying the Atoka Agreement with certain Indian tribes then in Oklahoma Territory. The Act provided \u201c. . . the lands allotted shall be non-taxable while the title remains in the original allottees.\u201d The question was whether oil royalty reserved by allottee-lessors was exempt or was taxable as personal property by the State of Oklahoma and the royalty was held non-taxable. The Lyeth and the Morgan cases involved the construction of the Federal Revenue Act, in one case the meaning of the word \u201cinheritance\u201d and in the other, the meaning of the term \u201cgeneral power of appointment.\u201d It was held that national uniformity in the collection of income and inheritance taxes required the application of the generally understood meaning of \u201cinheritance\u201d and of \u201cgeneral power of appointment,\u201d unaffected by local variations from the generally understood meaning of the words. National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U. S. 111, determining what Congress meant by the word \u201cemployes\u201d in the Wagner Act, was also referred to. It was held that as the Act was \u201cadministered by a national agency, intended to solve a national problem on a national scale,\u201d local definitions of the word must be rejected. Those cases, and others which might be added, illustrate the application of the principle of federal supremacy, a principle not challenged by the appellee. Its submission is that when Congress conferred the power of \u201clocal taxation [of real property] to the same extent according to its value as other real property is taxed\u201d without defining real property in the Act, it necessarily intended that all the property within the taxing district considered to be real property, should be taxable; that if this construction were rejected, the machinery constituting part of appellant\u2019s plant would be exempt while like machinery of a private individual would be taxed; that one purpose of the Act was to remove such discrimination as had formerly existed, in order that tax burdens might be more equitably distributed.\nThe brief filed on behalf of Allegheny County states that \u201cThe amending Act of 1941 originated in the Senate as S. 1438 of the 77th Congress, 1st Session. Section 3 of the bill amends Section 10 of the original Act. In commenting on the existing law (i.e., the provisions of Section 10 of the original Act), the report of the Committee on Banking and Currency, (S. Kept. No. 292), submitted through Mr. Senator Brown, contains the following relevant sentence: \u2018The only qualification of these exemptions provides that real property of the Corporation is to be subject to non discriminatory State and local taxes.\u2019 \u201d In the brief of the appellant it is said that Pennsylvania furnishes an \u201cexample of tax diversity.\u201d Different taxing districts may have different rates of assessment or none at all; such diversity is not prohibited ; what the law prohibits is\u2018discrimination within the boundaries of the taxing district. The Constitution of Pennsylvania allows classifications of municipalities, counties, townships, etc., and classification has been made pursuant to that power. For cities of the first class, for example, the law provides that in the \u201c. . . assessment of real estate for taxation, the machinery and tools used in manufacturing in any mill or manufactory shall not be considered or included in determining the value of real estate.\u201d Act of June 3, 1915, P. L. 787, 53 PS section 4742. In cities of the second class such property is not taxable for city or school purposes: Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20, Art. XIX, section 3, cl. 1, amended by the Act of May 12,1911, P. L. 287, section 1, 53 PS section 9634. But the mere fact that in some taxing districts certain property is taxable and in others is exempt, is of no consequence in this review because appellant does not contend that there was discrimination against its property in the taxing township. For tlie same reason it would seem to be immaterial if in some states it may be found unnecessary to raise revenue by taxing such property.\nThere is difficulty in ascertaining with certainty what Congress meant by the words real property in the statute. There is no federal general common law to which we can turn for aid. In 36 Words and Phrases, p. 221, many varying definitions of real property are given. Dictionaries define it as land, real estate, realty, and the like. Any adequate definition must take account of the doctrines of fixtures and of equitable conversion. We understand appellant\u2019s position to be that Congress intended that the content of the term real property should be the view prevailing in the majority of the states that have dealt with the subject of chattels made part of the freehold. The cases cited above in note 5 show that the majority view is contrary to that suggested as the standard. If appellant is correct in suggesting that the Congressional meaning is to be found in the prevailing view among the states, we must hold that the machinery was properly included in the assessment of real estate and entitled to the waiver of federal immunity. If, on the other hand, we accept the appellee\u2019s submission that Congress intended that the content of the term real property should be found in the law of the assessing district, the machinery was properly included in the assessment. In either view, we all agree the appeal fails.\nOrder affirmed.\nThe assessment was itemized:\n\u201cNine (9) Acres improved, assessed at $1,100 per acre..................... $9,900.00\nTwenty-four (24) acres, not improved, assessed at $1000 per acre.......... 24,000.00\nPlant building and cafeteria assessed at.. 338,000.00\nAdministration Building, assessed at---- 32,000.00\nBoiler House, assessed at.............. 60,000.00\nPersonnel Building, assessed at......... 5,000.00\nMachinery, assessed at................. 388,000.00\nTotal $856,900.00\u2019\nSee also, Patterson v.
