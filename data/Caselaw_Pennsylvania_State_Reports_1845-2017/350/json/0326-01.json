        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the final judgment entered in favor of the defendant in an action of assumpsit on an insurance policy. On April 9, 1907, Bobert A. Patton insured his life for the sum of $45,000 in The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company. The appellants, the substituted beneficiaries, claimed to recover $3,635.55, with interest; $2,984.85 thereof being the proportionate amount of extended insurance payable under said policy; and $650.70 thereof being a balance of the dividend of $659.70 payable under said policy on April 9,1931.\nOn and prior to October, 1929, the policy was in the possession of the defendant company as security for a loan of $12,500 to the insured, and in October, 1929 the loan was increased to the sum of $17,543.75, which sum with interest for the year ending April 8,1931, amounted to $18,596.38. The premium due April 9, 1931, was not paid, and no premium was paid thereafter. The insured died on April 25, 1942.\nThe non-forfeiture provisions of the policy, paragraph IX, stipulated that upon lapse after payment of three years\u2019 premiums the insurance would extend automatically for the period set forth in the table of extended insurance printed below paragraph X thereof, and also set out the paid-up insurance and loan or cash surrender values.\nTwenty-four annual premiums of $1,354.05 had been paid, and on April 8,1931, the policy completed its 24th year; its period of \u201cextended insurance\u201d was, according to the table, 11 years, 223 days; its \u201cpaid-up insurance\u201d value was 45 times $642 or $28,890, and \u201cthe loan or cash value\u201d 45 times $442.61 or $19,917.34. Under other terms of the policy the dividends awarded thereon were to be retained by tbe company to accelerate tbe maturity of tbe insurance as an endowment; or used in tbe payment of premiums. In April, 1910, the insured elected to apply tbe dividends thereafter accruing in reduction of premiums and that direction continuously thereafter remained in force.\nIn its affidavit of defense, tbe company averred that under date of July 24, 1941, it sent a written notice to tbe insured, addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Robert A. Patton, stating (1) tbe lapse of tbe policy for failure to pay tbe premium due April 9, 1931, (2) tbe cancellation of tbe indebtedness of $18,596.38 by deducting that amount from tbe cash value of $19,917.45, and (3) tbe automatic extension of insurance for tbe sum of $26,404, until May 4, 1933. A copy of this notice was attached to tbe affidavit of defense. Appellants claim that no proof of this averment was offered by tbe appellee at tbe trial. Tbe policy was not at any time returned to tbe insured. When be demanded its return tbe appellee stated that it bad been destroyed. Appellee then delivered to tbe insured a form of policy which appellants adopted as a copy of tbe original policy.\nTbe plaintiffs read into evidence tbe averments of tbe several paragraphs of tbe statement of claim and tbe admissions contained in the corresponding paragraphs of tbe affidavit of defense, and put in evidence tbe policy, tbe direction for tbe application of the dividends, tbe notice of tbe premium due April 9,1931, the check of April 7, 1942, for $13.87 and tbe table of further extension of tbe insurance and cash values from tbe 21st to tbe 24th years. Tbe specified values, on tbe unit of $1000 worth of insurance, at tbe end of tbe twenty-fourth policy year are as follows:\n\u201cif [quoting from the policy] no indebtedness exists against it\u201d\nAmount of Loan or\nPeriod of Extended Paid-Up Insurance Cash Surrender\nInsurance on Surrender Values\n11 years, 223 days $612.00 $112.61\nThe policy states: \u201cShould any indebtedness exist it shall be deducted from the Cash Value of the Policy and the other Values shall be diminished proportionately.\u201d The defendant\u2019s evidence consisted of the testimony of an assistant actuary of the company and certain exhibits, including the certificate of the insured\u2019s indebtedness. Judge Kun then entered a decree nisi in favor of defendant. Exceptions to it were dismissed and final judgment was entered accordingly.\nThe decision in this case depends entirely on the interpretation of the language of the insurance contract. The word \u201cvalues\u201d in the quoted provision of the policy obviously refers to \u201cextended insurance\u201d as well as to the two other \u201cvalues.\u201d If the \u201cextended insurance\u201d is not a value, the only other value, after \u201ccash value\u201d is eliminated from the thought, would be the \u201cpaid-up insurance\u201d value, and the word \u201cvalue\u201d instead of \u201cvalues\u201d would have been used in the policy, after the word \u201cother.\u201d\nThe policy provides in effect that the amount of insurance was to be diminished only \u201cshould any indebtedness exist,\u201d for in the absence of such indebtedness, it states: \u201cIf this policy shall lapse through non-payment of premium after three years\u2019 premiums have been paid in cash, the Company, subject to the other conditions of the Policy, will guarantee the following options, as provided for in the table of values given below:\n\u201cFirst. \u2014 Will extend automatically, as term insurance, without participation, the net amount insured by this Policy, [italics supplied] for the number of years and days named; . .\nThere is nothing in the contract of insurance except the provision as to the insured\u2019s indebtedness, which calls for a diminution of the amount of insurance contracted for, in the event of the non-payment of premiums. At the beginning of the policy the company promises \u201cto pay . . . the sum insured hereby less any indebtedness . . .\u201d\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claim that the amount of the insurance and not the term of extension is the \u201cvalue\u201d which is to be diminished proportionately for non-payment of the premium, must be rejected. Defendant\u2019s contention that under the contract the amount of the insurance could not be proportionately diminished on the insured\u2019s failure to pay the premium due but that on the contrary, the automatic extended insurance feature became operative in the full amount of the policy, less the indebtedness due by the insured on that policy, that is, $26,440, must be accepted. The term for which the insurance was to run was a \u201cvalue,\u201d and on the insured\u2019s failure to pay the premium due, it was the company\u2019s right and duty to \u201cdiminish proportionately\u201d that \u201cvalue\u201d which was the policy\u2019s \u201cperiod of extended insurance.\u201d That the term of a policy has value requires no demonstration. These plaintiffs are attempting by this action to give the policy \u201cvalue\u201d by asking a judicial determination to the effect that its term, after default in the payment of the premium due, was eleven years, 223 days, which period would cover the date of the insured\u2019s death.\nThe company\u2019s right to deduct from the policy\u2019s cash value, the insured\u2019s indebtedness, and to reduce the amount of paid-up insurance in the same proportion as the cash value is reduced is predicated both on the policy and on the certificate of indebtedness offered in evidence. This certificate sets forth as follows:\n\u201cwhere the Policy provides for automatic extended insurance the amount so extended shall be the face value of the Policy, less the total indebtedness, and for such a term as said reduced cash value shall provide.\u201d\nFurthermore, it should be noted that the net value of the policy, $1971.77, would purchase extended insurance in the sum of $45,000 for a much shorter period then it would purchase $26,404 of extended insurance. Under either plan the term of extended insurance would have ended before the insured\u2019s death.\nThe case of Steuernagle, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 322 Pa. 289, 185 A. 208, cited by appellant is inapplicable, for in that case the policy provided that it was the amount of insurance and not its term which was to be reduced if premiums were not paid.\nIn Toncich v. Home Life Ins. Co., 309 Pa. 336, 163 A. 673, the reserve or cash value of the insurance policy on which that suit was based was on April 28, 1929, $324; the indebtedness was a $200 loan. This court held that this left $24 \u201cto secure \u2018extended insurance.\u2019 This sifm, on the basis of the tables in the policy, extended the insurance for one year and 11 days, at the expiration of which period, the insured being still alive, the policy ceased and determined.\u201d In that case this court said that \u201cWhen the payment of premiums ceased the policy lapsed; it was in effect in liquidation, and by its terms certain rights arose in the parties: Mills v. Ins. Co., 136 Tenn. 350; Bach v. Western States Life Ins. Co., 51 Fed. (2d) 191. Under the automatic extension clause the insured could demand that the reserve on the policy, built up by the payment of premiums for four years, be applied to extend the full insurance. The period of extension was computed on the basis of reserve or cash value at the time of lapse, excluding any indebtedness. If there was any indebtedness on the policy, the insurer was entitled to liquidate it by charging it against this reserve value: Bach v. Ins. Co., supra; Hawthorne v. Bankers Life Co., 52 Fed. (2d) 309. When an indebtedness is charged against the reserve or cash value of a lapsed policy the extended insurance as shown by the table is proportionately reduced.\u201d The phrase \u201cproportionately reduced\u201d as used in the policy in the Toncich case has exactly the same meaning as the phrase \u201cdiminished proportionately\u201d which is used in the policy now being interpreted. The decision in the Toncich case is controlling in this case.\n* Appellant also complains that the company upon the non-payment of the premium disregarded the direction of the insured to apply the amount of all dividends in reduction of the annual premium, but instead, it retained the amount of the dividend due $650.70, when the premium, $1354.05, was not paid and applied the same to the cash value of the policy. The company takes the position that the amount of the dividend being insufficient to pay the annual premium due, it was impossible to use the dividend in reduction of the premium, that it had to be treated as \u201caccumulated surplus,\u201d and that in adding it to the \u201ccash surrender value\u201d the company was acting in accordance with the provisions of the insurance contract. This addition increased the net value of the policy which was available for the purpose of purchasing extended term insurance.\nOur conclusion is that in so doing, and in all other respects, this company fulfilled all its obligations under the insurance contract and deprived the insured and their beneficiaries of none of their rights.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nThe company offered in evidence the company\u2019s letter of May 8, 1942, to the son of the insured in which it was stated the above amount was the \u201camount of insurance extended under the policy\u201d and showing that \u201cthe total period of extended insurance was\u201d according to the calculations therein set forth, \u201ctwo years and 25 days.\u201d\nThe insured never exercised any of the options provided for in the policy and therefore the policy on the insured\u2019s failure to pay the premium due was placed on \u201cautomatic extended insurance\u201d to May 4, 1933.",
