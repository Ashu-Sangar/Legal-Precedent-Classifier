The Hartford Sterling Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (whose assets are being distributed), was organized in October of 1930. Of the authorized capital stock of 250 shares, only 150 shares were issued. <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>Of these, Harry I. Avrach, the company president, owned 119. On March 4 and March 8,1931, two fires occurred, destroying the plant of the corporation and its contents. The loss was covered by two insurance policies, aggregating $113,500. The corporation claimed a fire loss of $73,000.</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[206,615,1155,755]]]'>Insurance appraisers estimated the damage to the building at $12,498.00 and to the equipment at $14,-734.00; a total of $27,232.00. Shortly after the fires, Clayton Lofland, a contractor (appellant in No. 41 herein), agreed in writing to repair the fire damage to the building and equipment for the exact amount of such appraisal or estimated loss. On July 21, 1931, Lofland obtained an assignment of the company’s interest in the insurance policies to the extent of $27,232. In November, 1931, the company, authorized by its directors, delivered to Lofland a formal assignment of its claim against the insurance company in substitution of its previous assignment and as collateral security for all repair work done by Lofland up to $27,232.00.</p>

Avrach, the company president, and another to be indicted for arson and conspiracy and tried in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Delaware County. The first trial resulted in a mistrial. At the second trial, Avrach was convicted on a count charging him with conspiracy to cheat and defraud the insurance company. He appealed to the Superior Court, and his conviction was set aside and a new'trial ordered <em>(Commonwealth v.

These efforts were unsuccessful because of the failure of the parties to agree as to the amount payable to Lofland out of the proceeds. In March, 1933, two suits were instituted by Lofland, assignee, and others in the District Court of the United States (transferred from the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia County) against the Mechanics and Traders Insurance Company of New Orleans (the insurance company), to recover the amount of the loss sustained by the defendant corporation to its plant and machinery as a result of the fires.</p>

Lofland and other creditors filed opposing answers. The court approved the compromise. On December 26,1934, Lofland appealed to this Court from such order. The appeal was dismissed on May 27, 1935 (<a href="/pa/319/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="319 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1162343" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0174-01">319 Pa. 174</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20A.%20234" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="179 A. 234">179 A. 234</a>).

Lofland opposed the removal, contending that he was the absolute owner of the fund by virtue of the assignments to him. The issue was referred to a special master. The master held twenty-two meetings. After study of the voluminous testimony, he awarded Lofland $7,627.83, <em>with interest, </em>for work performed under the contract to repair the building and rehabilitate the machinery and equipment. This sum was decreed to be payable to Lofland out of the insurance proceeds by virtue of his as<a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>signment, and the balance was awarded to the receiver of the Hartford Sterling Company. With respect to a claim for $6,203.35 alleged to have been advanced by Lofland for the defense of Avrach (the president of the insolvent corporation, who was indicted for arson), the master found that such sum was advanced after the assignment of the two policies and therefore could only be presented in the receivership proceedings in Delaware County. The master ruled that Lofland should not be charged with the costs of the receivership out of his share of the funds. Exceptions were filed by both Lofland and the receiver. The master’s report was approved by the District Court (Kirkpatrick, J.). On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals (98 E. 2d 589, opinion by Maris, J.) the decree of the District Court was modified and affirmed. Interest was disallowed. The United States Supreme Court refused to allow a writ of certiorari (<a href="/us/305/0658-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="305 U.S. 658" data-case-ids="6165676,6165725,6165792,6165855" data-case-paths="/us/305/0658-01,/us/305/0658-02,/us/305/0658-03,/us/305/0658-04">305 U.

The auditing judge properly found that Lofland had not spent this amount in Avrach’s defense, and awarded him only $3,257.62. Exceptions were filed by Lofland to this award and were dismissed by the court en banc. He thereupon appealed.</p>

Lofland states in his own brief that <em>“The Special Master held </em>. . . <em>that he was only empowered to determine what Lofland was entitled to receive upon his two assignments, </em>and since all the moneys expended by him [in Avrach’s defense] . . . were advanced <em>after </em>the said assignments, Lofland’s claim was a proper one in the receivership proceedings in Delaware County and therefore <em>could not he paid out of the fund in the District Court.” </em>We find nothing in the language of the master’s report whereby jurisdiction is assumed over <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>claims made <em>after </em>the assignment; on the contrary, the master relinquished jurisdiction over the claim now in dispute because the money was advanced long <em>after </em>the assignment had been made.</p>
    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[186,504,1154,810]]]'>Nor are we able to discover any statement that Lofland actually advanced the full sum of $6,203.35; the master never decided what sum Lofland was entitled to because it was not within his jurisdiction so to do. His report states in passing that: “This sum ($6,203.35) was <em>probably </em>advanced by Lofland, <em>much of it </em>certainly advanced, but it is not included in the terms of the assignment,” and the Master is “unable to find anything in the record . . . which would justify . . . recommending the payment of this claim as a part of the moneys secured by the assignment.” These statements certainly cannot be construed as a definitive finding that $6,203.35 is owing to Lofland; they are merely the gratuitous and extraneous remarks of the master about a matter which was admittedly not before him.</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.5",316,[189,1326,1157,805]]]'>Moreover, in approving the report of the master, the District Court stated: “It is quite clear that the Master did, <em>in view of the disallowance of the claim for the defense </em>fund, give Lofland a very large measure of consideration in other matters.” This language, if we attach any present significance to it at all, could only be construed as <em>rejecting </em>Lolland’s claim; it cannot be interpreted as a determination that Lofland has a right to the full sum of $6,203.35. Lolland’s contention that his claim for $6,203.35 was adjudicated in his favor by the Federal Court is, therefore, inconsistent with the facts. The action of the court below, in determining that Lofland was entitled to only $3,257.62 was entirely proper, and, Lolland’s argument that the claim is res adjudicata is devoid of merit.</p>

Lofland’s contention that he was erroneously charged with one-half of the stenographic costs is meritorious.

It is well settled that in an equity proceeding disposition of costs is largely within the discretion of the court below and its decree will not be interfered with by this Court except where the court below has grossly misused its power. <em>Guckenheimer &amp; Bros.

We find no gross abuse of discretion here; on the contrary, there was ample justification for the imposition upon Lolland of the cost of the audit. There is evidence to show that it was his refusal to compromise that was largely responsible for this interminable litigation. Moreover, Lolland’s award did not approximate his original claim, and some of his allegations during the course of this litigation have come very close to fraudulent representations. Much time and expense might have been saved if Lolland had not made so many dilatory moves and had recognized the futility of litigating claims, the bona lides of which has been suspected by the master and the various judges. Under the circumstances, the assessment upon Lolland of the cost of the audit was entirely proper.</p>

Avrach originally advanced $19,890.95, but received reimbursement for $15,000 of this amount in the form of 150 shares of capital stock in the corporation, thus leaving a balance owed of $4,890.95.

In the instant case, however, Avrach furnished all the capital for the corporation. The company was his instrumentality and when he put money into it, he put money into his own business as its sole owner, not in another’s enterprise <em>by way of a loan. </em>It is true that Avrach only held 119 shares of the 150 shares issued. Of the remaining 31 shares, Thomas B. Ginley held 15, Ashley W. Hagey held 15 and Alfred T. Steinmetz held 1, as the company’s nominal secretary. None of these parties, however, paid anything for their stock, and. the certificates made out to them were never taken out. The learned auditing judge correctly stated that “The other stockholders were but figureheads. Avrach’s control was absolute. The business was in reality his.” Avrach was not a creditor dealing with a debtor corporation; he was lending money to himself. To permit him to share as creditor in the assets of a company, which is merely his creature, would encourage fraud and defeat the valid claims of other creditors.</p>

He testified that these seven checks represented advancements to run the old corporation and were in the nature of loans to the new corporation. It is clear that these checks, payable to the receivers of the old corporation, were not given with the consent of the new corporation because, at the date of the last check (October 9,1930), the new corporation had not yet gone through the formalities of organization. Nor does the evidence disclose any later action on the part of the new. corporation rati<a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>fying the expenditures. The directors of the new corporation never agreed to assume as a loan by Avrach monies advanced to the receivers of the old corporation to run that corporation. Moreover, counsel has failed to show how the assets of the new corporation were enhanced by Avraeh’s advancements to the old corporation. Furthermore, Avrach did not look to the new corporation for reimbursement at the time the advancements were made; instead, he relied on receiver’s certificates for security. Since he did not obtain these, he now seeks to recover against the insolvent new corporation to the prejudice of other creditors. His claim was correctly disallowed by the court below.</p>

(appellant in Appeal No. 45), complains that the court below erred in failing to allow him $2,500.00 in counsel fees for successfully appealing the conviction of Harry I. Avrach, president of the Hartford Sterling Company, to the Superior Court. The court below disallowed the claim against the corporation because it considered the contract engaging the attorney a personal contract of Avrach. Although the evidence is conflicting, we agree with the court below that the “testimony adduced did not support a claim against the corporation,” but was an oral personal contract between Wernick and Avrach for professional services rendered Avrach. The only evidence that Stein-mete, the company’s secretary, was a party to the contract, thus aiding the attempt of Wernick to bind the corporation, is the meager testimony of Avrach himself. When Wernick was engaged as counsel, the good name and liberty of Avrach were at stake. True, the corporation was assisted by the successful appeal from the conviction subsequently to recover part of the insurance fund. However, the corporation was merely the incidental beneficiary of a personal contract between Wernick and Avrach for the benefit of the latter. Without passing on the reasonableness of the amount of Wernick’s claim, we see no reason to disturb the finding, of <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>the court below that the claim is not binding on the corporation.</p>
