MacGregor refused access to the books, and refused to pay royalty on this <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>CPS solder. At the same time, he decided to pay no further royalties upon the CPT solder, and demanded repayment of the royalties that had been paid on such s’older, alleging that the payments had been made by mistake. In addition he now asks for damages in an unstated amount upon an unstated cause of action under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 U.S.C.A., Secs. 1 and 2).</p>

Supreme Court, that court said: “The question for our decision is whether a patent licensee, by virtue of his license agreement, is estopped to challenge <em>a price-fixing clause </em>in the agreement by showing that the patent is invalid, and that the price restriction is accordingly unlawful because not protected by the patent monopoly (italics supplied). . . . Here a different question is presented [i.e. different from the question presented in <em>U. S. v. Harvey Steel Co., </em><a href="/us/196/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="196 U.S. 310" data-case-ids="8291751" data-case-paths="/us/196/0310-01">196 U. S. 310</a>]- — -whether the doctrine of estoppel as invoked below is so in conflict with the Sherman Act’s prohibition of price-fixing that this Court may resolve the question even though its conclusion be contrary to that of a state court.” The Court then declared “Such a restriction on the price of articles entering interstate commerce [as was imposed by the license contract in that case] <em>is </em>a violation of the Sherman Act save only as it is within the protection of a lawfully granted patent monopoly” (citing cases). “Agreements fixing the competitive sales price of articles moving interstate, not within the protection of a patent, are unlawful because <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>prohibited by the Sherman Act.” In that case the validity of a price-fixing clause in the license agreement was challenged and that challenge could not be adjudicated by the Court until it first determined the validity of the patent, for only a valid patent could stand between that clause and its being adjudged as a violation of the Sherman Act. In that case the suit was to recover royalties withheld and also for an injunction restraining the Sola Company from selling licensed products at prices below those established by the licensor. In the instant case the issue is not whether the price-fixing clause is in violation of the Sherman Act. It is before the court as a matter of defence to a contract for royalties which had accrued. Defendant asserts the right to attack the validity of a patent because the agreement licensing him to make, use and sell that patent (Jones Patent No. 1,651,709) during a certain term contains a price-fixing clause. We reject, as did the court below, the contention of MacGregor, the defendant, that the presence of a price-fixing clause in a patent-license agreement gives the licensee the right to attack the validity of the patent, regardless of whether the price-fixing clause is involved in the litigation to recover royalties.</p>

The Court below aptly said: “In the instant case the court has not been requested either directly or indirectly to require MacGregor to maintain Westinghouse prices. By his own testimony he has not maintained them. The price-fixing clause is not in issue. It is raised merely as a defense to a suit for accounting and payment of accrued royalties. The legality, the enforceability of the price-fixing clause is a moot question. We therefore do not propose to declare the Jones patent invalid. Whether the price-fixing clause in the license is legal or invalid is not before this Court. It is our judg<a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>ment that the decision of the Sola case does not control or determine the instant case.”</p>

An estoppel whose operation will result in a contravention of Federal Anti-Trust laws is outside the pale of judicial recognition. It follows that Avhen an estoppel is invoked and the opposing party alleges that its application is inconsistent with a Federal law it becomes the duty of the tribunal to determine every fact which is relevant to the issue thus raised. The validity of any “protective” patent invoked by the propounder of the estoppel becomes such a determinative “fact.”</p>

The “competiting” MacGregor solder consists of approximately 92.25% copper, 7.25% phosphorus and .5% tin. The main and essential ingredients “are phosphorus and copper.” MacGregor admitted that if the tin which in the amount of % of 1% he puts in the solder was omitted from that solder there would be “left a good workable solder.” Walter A. Graham, “a non-ferrous metallurgist” of the plaintiff company testified that “he had occasion to use and see used for practical soldering operations, the three solders, namely, the Westinghouse phos-copper and the MacGregor phos-copper tin and the MacGregor phos-copper silver solder.” When asked to tell “what differences there are in operating results in soldering with the Westinghouse phos-copper solder as compared with the MacGregor phos-copper tin solder,” he answered: “In our experience we have not been able to find any noticeable difference of the three, the Jones and the two MacGregor solders. They are interchangeable for use in the same purpose and application.” He was asked: “What has been your observation as to whether or not the addition of tin to the phos-copper solder by MacGregor has changed the characteristics of the phos-copper solder without tin?” The answer is “There is no observable difference in. the practical application.” He was then asked: “These two solders could be interchanged for the ordinary use for which each is designed?” He answered: “That’s right.”</p>
