The defendants <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> are Nicholas Vitullo and his three sons, trading as N. Vitullo &amp; Sons. This partnership is a clothing contractor, a term, used in the Philadelphia clothing industry, to describe one who works on garments, for a manufacturer of clothing. Both parties have been engaged in the industry for years. The bill was filed December 28, 1943, and was subsequently amended. Nicholas Vitullo defended on the ground that he neither made nor authorized the contract; his sons admitted <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the contract, but, <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>inter alia, averred that it violated the federal statute<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and regulations governing price administration.</p>

Defendants’ counsel made notes of the terms then agreed to and by October 5th had put the agreement in writing and delivered it to defendants. The party of the second part was described in the agreement as Alfred Vitullo, Augustus Vitullo and Henry Vitullo, individually, and trading as N. Vitullo and Sons. Nicholas Vitullo was not named. This draft of agreement was executed in the name of N. Vitullo &amp; Sons and was signed by the three sons. They sent it to plaintiff for execution and plaintiff executed and delivered it. .</p>

There is evidence of a local trade custom in the clothing industry in Philadelphia requiring a contractor employed by a manufacturer, to notify him of any proposed termination of the relationship. Accordingly, on October 8,1943, defendants, having made their contract with plaintiff, notified Windsor Overcoat Company that they “will not be able to make any more work for you as of December 31,1943.” At the same time they also notified the Clothing Contractors Association and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America of the same fact.</p>

Such an arbitration was begun on behalf of Windsor Overcoat Company, but was discontinued for a reason given by defendants’ witness, Flickstein (Secretary of the Philadelphia Clothing. Manufacturers Association) in the following words: “A. It fell through because of the fact Vitullo said he did not want to go through with the Daroff contract, and did not want to go through <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>with the arbitration.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Endow, called by defendants, testified: “Q. Then what happened? A. I received a call the evening before the arbitration was set — Friday night; the arbitration was to take place Saturday, and Friday night I received a call from Mr. Flickstein informing me there would be no arbitration meeting tomorrow. I said, ‘Why?’ He said, ‘The firm of Segal has settled with Yitullo, and Vitullo does not intend to go through with the contract with Daroff.’ In order to verify, Mr. Vitullo, Senior, told me I should telephone everything is all right; there will be no arbitration tomorrow. By Mr. Wolf: Q. Who told you? A. Nicholas Yitullo.” As Yitullo withdrew from the arbitration, we need not consider the sufficiency of the notice as an element in defense.</p>

After plaintiff learned that defendants would not perform their contract, it sought another contractor. In this search, it was aided by the Philadelphia Clothing Manufacturers Association, the Contractors Association, and the Union. The only available contractor was Mario Eanieri, though his plant was not equipped to make overcoats of the grade desired by plaintiff nor in anything like the quantity which defendants’ plant was equipped to make.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> He agreed to <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>do 800 garments a week.

The contention must be rejected because the evidence is clear that there was no other available contractor to do what defendants had agreed to do.

But comparison dealing with only part of the essential evidence cannot be accepted as conclusive. A proper comparison requires consideration of the effect of the additional 15 cents per garment allowed by the OPA in September, 1943, for contractor’s services, as is shown in the finding quoted later in a note. This additional allowance was in effect when plaintiff and defendants made their contract and, as we understand it, applied to the entire industry in Philadelphia. William Flickstein, a witness called by defendants, testified that he was Secretary of the Philadelphia Clothing Manufacturers Association and that “around September, 1943,” he, representing the Manufacturers, and Samuel Rudow, representing the Contractors Association, held meetings attended by Mr. Lodge, representing the Administrator, pursuant to which they and the Administrator’s representative agreed that contractors should receive additional payments at the rate of 10 cents per garment on grade number 3 and 15 cents per garment on grades number 1 and number 2. There is no denial of this agreement or of Mr. Lodge’s authority to act for the Administrator. Defendants made this increase the subject of a request for a finding of fact which was affirmed by the Chancellor, Stating that the contractors, with the approval of the Administrator, “. . . should receive from manufacturers, in addition to the payments for services theretofore made . . .”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> the sums specified per garment. <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>This finding of fact was not excepted to by the Administrator and is established for the purposes of the case. Defendants’ witness, Samuel Rudow, who represented the Contractors Association in the negotiation, also testified on the subject.</p>
    <p id="b541-3" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[204,558,1153,1309]],["BL_542.1",542,[199,274,1154,534]]]'>It is of course true that, if this increase be considered as a wage increase payable to such of the contractor’s employes as made overtime, it will not increase the rate percent receivable by the contractor for his services; but if it was intended, as Mr. Rudow testified, to increase the contractor’s compensation because his plant worked overtime, it would increase the 18 percent theretofore payable. Treating it as a payment for contractor’s services, in accord with the finding, the question then becomes this: to what extent did it increase the 18 percent theretofore payable to the contractor? Mr. Rudow was asked what difference it would make in the percentage and answered, “It would make about twenty-two percent.” He was also asked: “Q. The fifteen cents a garment went into labor cost, did it not; not the percentage of profit? A. The percentage of profit — I do not represent labor — it was not in the labor costs.” At another place he was asked, “So the price that was being paid to Vitullo by Segal [Windsor Overcoat Co.] plus the fifteen cents increase on the price agreement, brings it to about twenty-two percent above the labor cost? A. Correct.” Mr. Flickstein was asked with respect to this 15 cent allowance: “Q. In other words, the price was 18 percent plus fifteen cents per <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>garment, is that correct? A. Yes.” From the evidence of the witnesses we understand that the 15 cent increase was not intended to be a mere wage increase because a wage increase would not have benefitted the contractors, though the purpose of the meeting appears to have been to benefit the contractors for operating their plants overtime; a mere wage increase would have gone into the cost of labor on which the contractor would have received only percentage allowed for his services, not an additional payment.</p>

It is true that Nicholas Vitullo testified that he received labor cost plus 18 percent, but, the learned chancellor was bound to deal with all the evidence, not only part of it. The testimony of the witness, Myers, that in March, 1942, and in August and September, 1943, Windsor paid the cost of labor and 18% may be true but is not inconsistent with the evidence of the operation of the 15 cents increase allowed by the OPA in September, 1943.</p>

If either condition existed, then, since the percentage margin over direct labor costs was higher under the terms of the contract than that obtained in March 1942, the agreement was unlawful in that it contemplated the violation of the Eegulation.” The brief then goes on to say that the chancellor “. . . gave consideration to Section 1389.53 (a) only, in referring to ‘similar’ goods, and paid scant if any attention to Sec. 1389.53 (c) which <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>applies to articles ‘most clearly related to articles of the same type’ manufactured in March 1942.” Counsel then add that “. . .we think that the goods to be manufactured for plaintiff were similar- to the- goods manufactured for Windsor, still, even if that is not so, then certainly such goods were at the very least 'the most closely related to articles of the same type’ manufactured in March, 1942.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The learned chancellor found: “25. There is not sufficient satisfactory evidence for the Chancellor to find that the price agreed to be paid by H. Dar off &amp; Sons, Inc, to N. Vitullo &amp; Sons is in excess of the price paid as of March, 1942, for similar work, as is provided in the regulations of the Office of Price Administration.” We are in accord with that conclusion, understanding that the 15 cent increase per garment was approved by the OPA in September, 1943.</p>
