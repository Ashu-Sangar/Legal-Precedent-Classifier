The father has judgment for $395,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the minor for $4,000. This was the third trial. After the first trial, with verdicts for plaintiffs, a new trial was granted. In the second trial, the jury disagreed.</p>

Defendant owned land on what is described as the East Mountainside in Scranton; on his land was a pond of some length and about 50 feet wide. About dusk, May 25, 1939, boys were fishing in the pond when the minor plaintiff arrived to warn his brother, who was among them, to come away. He was a trespasser. The' defendant got his gun containing a shell or shells loaded with bird shot and, without warning, and with the intention of inflict<a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>ing bodily harm, fired at the boys who were then only about 75 feet from Mm. Approximately 100 pellets of bird shot entered plaintiff’s body, principally about bis chest, face and head. One eye was injured so seriously that, as one physician testified, “. . . vision was reduced to about 10-200, which was below useful vision.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Plaintiff was taken to a hospital and confined there about a week for treatment; many of the pellets, but not all, were removed. He was then 16 years of age. His face is disfigured by pellet marks and he still suffered at the time of the trial from the effect of the shooting.</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[196,868,1152,426]]]'>On the next morning, while under arrest, defendant made a statement to Captain Scull and other officers of the Scranton Police Department, which, after being transcribed, he signed. He stated that he thought the boys intended to steal his pigeons, and that, “When I picked up the gun I didn’t move a foot, I stood by the firewood, held the gun up and fired. Q. Did you mean to shoot them? A. No, I wanted to scare them.”</p>

In the course of his charge Judge Mays referred to this fact and said to the jury: “But the fact remains that he was in court; and could he have thrown any more light upon this subject? Well, he didn’t go upon the stand. Now, you may not make any presumption against Mm because of that; but it is a fact, a circumstance, that <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>you may take into consideration in deciding what is the truth in this controversy. Is it the truth as he said in this statement: Yes, I pulled the trigger, I fired off this gun, but I had it directed up into the air and toward the heavens. Or is it the truth as contended for by the plaintiffs, that the gun was pointed toward these boys, any one of them?” The assignment complaining of that instruction is overruled; the jury would be justified in inferring from the absence of his testimony that, if honestly given, it would be unfavorable to himself, or in other words, that the plaintiff and his witnesses truthfully described the shooting.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
