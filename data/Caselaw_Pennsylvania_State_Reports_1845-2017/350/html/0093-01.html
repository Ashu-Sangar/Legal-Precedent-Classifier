The last preceding assessed valuation of the taxable property in the Township <em>at the time this resolution was passed </em>was that made for the year 1923, which amounted to $419,-530.00. The highways were constructed and completed in 1926, and Jefferson County advanced and paid the township share of $42,847.87 as well as its own share. To defray the cost of these highways it was necessary to increase the indebtedness of the township in the sum of $29,000 and obtain the assent of the electors of the township to such an increase.</p>

This resolution contained a financial statement showing that the amount of the last assessed valuation of the taxable property of the township to be $419,530 (the 1923 assessment), the total present indebtedness to be none and the actual net increase of the township indebtedness by the issue of such bonds to be $29,000.

This resolution for the purpose of creating a fund for the payment of the principal and interest and taxes on the bonds set forth that “There is hereby levied an annual tax of - mills on all taxable property of the said Township, the collection of which shall begin in the year one thousand <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>nine hundred and twenty - and to continue; and include the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty-six.” All proceedings in connection with the election, were filed in the office of the Clerk of the, Court of Quarter Sessions of Jefferson County and were admitted in evidence. The township, however, was unable to sell the bonds issued as authorized by the electors. Thereupon, the Supervisors met on April 2, 1927, and passed a resolution wherein they continued their obligation to Jefferson County for the Township’s share of the cost of the highways and set forth that this increase of indebtedness was authorized by the. electors, and further authorized a loan of $29,000 from one Gilbert McGregor of Punxsutawney, Pa., on the credit of Young Township, for the payment of its indebtedness to the County. A note was drawn on April 4, 1927, and the plaintiff’s assignor, Gilbert McGregor, loaned the $29,000 to the township. Interest was paid on this note until March 7, 1929. Mr. McGregor died and thereafter, on December 19, 1939, his estate transferred the note to his sister, the plaintiff.</p>

The court also found that the actual authorized outstanding indebtedness which was obtained without the assent of the qualified electors of Young Township on April 4, 1927, was at least $6,800 prior to the execution of the $29,000 note on which suit was brought.

Twenty-nine thousand dollars would be only 6.9 per cent, of the assessed valuation <em>as fixed in 1923. </em>The appellant further contended that the Supervisors of Young Township in the election proceedings filed in the Court of Quarter Sessions, both before and after the election held on April 22, 1924, set forth that the last assessed valuation of the property in Young Township was $419,530 (the 1923 assessment). Appellant also calls attention to the fact that the note sued upon contains a certificate to the effect that $29,000 does not exceed seven per cent, of the last assesssed valuation preceding the public election held on April 22, 1924, and that the Township therefore “is now estopped from setting up any defense against plaintiff’s claims.” The additional indebtedness which the court found was $6,800 when the $29,000 was actually borrowed on April 4, 1927, the appellant urges could only be classed as a debt created within its revenues, regardless of existing indebtedness. As to the court’s finding that no annual tax for the payment of the debt and interest had been levied as required by law, the appellant contended that the resolutions indicated that an annual tax would be levied and assessed for the payment of the principal and interest of the money and that five mills would have been more than sufficient to pay the debt, interest and state tax on the obligation within a <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>period of thirty years, and that the Supervisors did actually levy and collect beginning with the year 1927, when they obtained the $29,000 loan from Mr. McGregor, an extra five mills for the purpose of providing funds to pay this debt and interest and that this continued annually for some six years thereafter.</p>
    <p id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[201,601,1157,1355]]]'>The basic disputed point is whether the 1923 or the 1924 valuation constituted “the last preceding valuation of the taxable property” upon which the debt limit was to be ascertained. Section 3 of the Act of April 20,1874, P. L. 65, as amended (53 PS §§ 1873,1874), provides : “The indebtedness of any county, city, borough, township, school district, or other municipality or incorporated district, in this Commonwealth, may be authorized to be increased to an amount exceeding two per centum, and not exceeding seven per centum, upon the last preceding assessed valuation of the taxable property therein, with the assent of the electors thereof, duly obtained at a public election to be held in the said district or municipality.” Section 3 further provides: “Whenever the corporate authorities of any . . . township ... by their ordinance or vote shall have signified a desire to make such increase of indebtedness, they shall give notice during at least thirty days, by weekly advertisements ... of an election to be held . . . for the purpose of obtaining the' assent of the electors thereof to such increase of indebtedness. Said notice shall contain a statement of the amount of the last assessed valuation, of the amount of the existing debt, of the amount and percentage of the proposed increase, and for the purposes for which the indebtedness is to be increased.”</p>

Have the supervisors of this Township complied with this legislative prescription? The evidence shows that the corporate authorities, on March 1st, 1924, by due Ordinance indicated “a desire to make such increase of in<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>debtedness.” Having signified such a desire, the act directs that they shall give notice of an election to be held to obtain the consent of the electors to such an increase. The Act expressly provides the requisites of the notice. This Board of Supervisors proclaimed in the ordinance an election and fixed the time therefor, and then provided the form of the notice to be given, which notice contained the indispensable informaiton required by the Act, inter alia, “the amount of the last assessed valuation” stated to be $419,530, the amount of the 1923 valuation, and the amount of the proposed increase,” as $29,000. This was done in compliance with the mandatory requirements of the act.</p>

The assent of the electors to this increase in indebtedness was not obtained until April 22, 1924. If we determine what was “the last preceding valuation of the taxable property” in the township from the “vantage ground” of April 22, 1924, the answer must be the assessment of March 1, 1924. If we determine this question from the “vantage ground” of the date when the increase of indebtedness was formally “desired” by the Supervisors, March 1, 1924, our answer must be the assessment of 1923. It would not be reasonable to hold that the Supervisors’ meeting on March 1, 1924, would regard a valuation <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>made <em>that </em>day by the Board of Revision as “the last preceding valuation.” This record does not show on what hour on that day the valuation was made for the year 1924. There is no proof that it was made before the resolution of the Supervisors was passed. The record shows only that the Commissioners of Jefferson County issued a book entitled “Adjusted Valuation of Young Township for 1924 <em>under date </em>of March 1,1924” (italics supplied). That does not prove that the book was issued <em>on </em>that date or that it was issued before the Supervisors acted on March 1, 1924.</p>
    <p id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[198,896,1155,1016]]]'>The question then arises, is April 22 the date from whose “vantage ground” the last “preceding valuation of the taxable property” in the township must be determined? It is clear that the Supervisors and the voters acted on the theory that April 22 was <em>not </em>the controlling date for in the resolution of March 1, 1924, which was incorporated in the “Official Notice and Special Election Proclamation” duly advertised by the Supervisors, it was set forth that the proposed bonded indebtedness “not to exceed twenty-nine thousand dollars” was 6.9% of the last adjusted valuation of the taxable property,” meaning thereby the 1923 valuation. The Official Notice also specifically stated that “the amount of the last assessed valuation of the taxable property of said township is the sum of $419,530.” That was the <em>1923 </em>valuation. This was <em>the fact </em>officially presented by advertising to the voters when they were asked to give on April 22, 1924, their assent to the proposed increase of indebtedness.</p>

Appellants contend that the assent given by the electors to this loan on April 22, 1924, dated back to March 1, 1924, when the Supervisors by resolution proclaimed their “desire and intention to increase the indebtedness of the Township of <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>Young to an amount not to exceed $29,000” and then and there and for thirty days thereafter set forth in an Official Notice (as the law required) a financial statement showing that $419,530 was “the last assessed valuation of the taxable property” in that township, i. e., the 1923 valuation. It is clear that the date of the resolution of “desire and intention” was the date when the facts as to the township’s indebtedness should be determined and announced to the electors whose assent to the proposed increase of indebtedness had to be secured before the increase could be made. The date on which the Supervisors of Young Township performed this important duty was March 1,1924.

The election in this case was held on the third Tuesday in February 1910,” i. e., on February 15th. The notice given to the electors that it would be held on this day was first published on January 22, 1910. In that notice the assessed valuation of property within the city was stated to be $1,388,675,057. These were in fact the figures “finally adjusted” formally on February 1,1910, and of which the council must have had “advance notice” when they began their advertising on January 22nd. This Court said: “Where or how their figures [those of February 1, 1910] were obtainable is utterly immaterial” because “they were not those of the last preceding assessed valuation of property.” We declared that the “figures [which] were accessible to the municipal authorities” were those of “the assessment finally adjusted on or before February 1,1909, and nothing was to be substituted for them.” The appositeness of this decision to the question now before us is this: This court there <em>refused </em>to take as the “vantage ground” from which “the last preceding assessed valuation” was to be determined <em>the date the electors </em>authorized the loan. In the <em>instant </em>case the Court said: “The date the electors of Young Township authorized the $29,000 loan, April 22, 1924, was the date as of which the validity of its $29,000 note sued on is to be determined.”</p>

While the choice of either of these dates as the “vantage ground” from which to determine the last valuation did not affect the decision on the question involved in that case, it is of significance that the date of the enactment of the ordinance signifying the “desire to increase the indebtedness” was accepted as a matter of course as the date on which the view was to be taken to ascertain <em>which </em>assessed valuation was the “last preceding” one. The decision in this case emphasized the importance of the public notice to be given by advertisement of the proposed increase of indebtedness and the court pointed out that the statute required the public notice shall contain, “inter alia, the amount of the existing debt” (and, of course, “the last preceding assessed valuation”,) so that “the electors” can “act not only intelligently but prudently in casting his ballot for or against a proposed increase of the indebtedness.”</p>

The date on which such voting takes place is not a practicable one to be used as the decisive one in matters of this kind, as this court indicated by its decision and opinion in <em>Bullitt v.

As early as February 2, 1924, <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>this township took, through its supervisors, the first step in this matter, as we set forth in paragraph two of this opinion. It is a legitimate assumption that <em>on this date </em>as well as on March 1,1924, when further important action was taken by the Supervisors as herein set forth, the fact that the assessment was $419,530, as made in 1923, was a vital factor in the Supervisors’ deliberations. In all their official actions and in the advertisements for the information of the electors they and the electors treated this <em>1923 </em>assessment as “the last preceding assessed valuation” of the taxable property in the township. We decide that they were justified in doing so and since this increased debt of $29,000 did not make the debt of the township exceed seven per centum of the 1923 assessed value of the taxable property in Young Township, it cannot be adjudged invalid as contravening Art. 9, sec. 8 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania.</p>
