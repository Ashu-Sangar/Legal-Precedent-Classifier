M., Francis Cole, appellee, was proceeding in a westerly direction upon a state road sixteen feet wide in Conneaut Township. Earl Penfield, who died as a result of the accident, was proceeding in a northerly direction upon a township road fourteen feet wide. These roads form a right angle intersection at a point designated as “Conneaut Center”. <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>The intersection is not protected by traffic signs of any kind. Immediately south of the intersection, on the township road, is a dip of approximately fourteen feet. Two hundred fifty feet east of the township road and facing the state road is a house. Both the dip in the road and the house obstruct the view of users of both roads. The evidence does not definitely establish the distance from the intersection at which the view is unobstructed. When appellee passed the house 250 feet from the intersection he was traveling between 40 and 45 miles per hour. After having passed the said house he removed his foot from the accelerator for the purpose of decreasing his speed, and looked for traffic on the intersecting road, but saw none. The collision occurred in the center of the intersection. Appellee’s automobile skidded and proceeded approximately 35 to 40 feet beyond the point of impact, where it rolled over on its side. The Penfield car stopped approximately 150 feet northwest of the Cole car, in a field. The only eye-witness to the happening of the collision is appellee, who testified that “I believe he hit mine [his car].”</p>

All of these cases hold that an appeal to the court is not for the purpose of reviewing the evidence taken before the secretary, and his action thereon, but to hear evidence and determine, in the exercise of the court’s sound discretion and in the furtherance of justice, whether the license should <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>be suspended: <em>Hardwick Automobile License Case, </em>supra, 267.</p>

Tbe court below concluded that “tbe case does not appear so grave as to warrant a double penalty”, and directed that bis license should be reinstated. We said (p. 267) : “There is nothing in tbe record requiring this Court to bold that there has been a manifest abuse of discretion by tbe court below.” In <em>Schwarts Automobile License Case, </em>supra, appellee admitted that be was driving between 50 and 55 miles per hour. Tbe court below concluded that “at most, be was guilty of a technical violation” and directed tbe reinstatement of bis operating privileges. We there held (p. 268): “There is no manifest abuse of discretion on tbe part of tbe trial court.” The present case is squarely in point with these two eases; tbe petition admits that appellee “was involved in an automobile accident . . . wherein as a result of said accident Earl Penfield was fatally injured.”</p>
    <p id="b404-5" data-blocks='[["BL_404.5",404,[192,1430,1150,589]]]'>Tbe lower court properly held that tbe evidence and circumstances of tbe present case do not establish that tbe fatality resulted from tbe negligence of appellee. Nor can it be said that where one of tbe drivers in a two-car collision is fatally injured, tbe surviving driver of one of tbe cars must necessarily have bis license suspended by tbe secretary, regardless of whose negligence caused tbe accident. Tbe court below has not abused tbe broad discretionary power vested in it by tbe legislature in concluding that tbe operating privileges of Francis Cole, appellee, should not be suspended.</p>
