Philadelphia guaranteed to Monongahela the prompt payment of the rental agreed to be paid and the faithful performance of the covenants agreed to be performed by Consolidated. The Special Act under which Philadelphia was incorporated gave it power to guarantee the performance of obligations of other corporations. The lease and guaranty were duly recorded. Since January 1, 1902, the only income of Monongahela consisted of that derived under the terms of the lease and a supplemental agreement thereto relating to the issuance of Refunding Bonds, hereinafter referred to. After the lease, Monongahela did not own any property not covered by the lease.</p>

Monongahela was required to make all such reports and returns of its property, earnings, dividends, and profits for the purposes of taxation as Consolidated should require. Consolidated covenanted to pay and meet interest on bonds of Monongahela and its merged companies and interest on bonds issued for the purpose of taking up said bonds when they matured. Consolidated also covenanted, at its own expense, to do paving and repairing, defend suits against Monongahela during the lease, and pay verdicts and judgments thereon and other claims; at its own expense to keep up insurance; and at its own expense to operate the properties.</p>

Ever since the execution of the lease from Monongahela to Consolidated, the demised properties have been operated by Pittsburgh Railways (except during its receivership and reorganization proceedings) tinder an operating agreement between Consolidated and Pittsburgh Railways, the term of which was for five years from January 1, 1902, and thereafter until terminated on three months’ notice by either party. All of the taxes imposed upon Monongahela, including Federal and State income taxes, continuously from 1902 until in or about the year 1938, were paid by Pittsburgh Railways except for a few years when they were paid by its Equity Receivers. Pittsburgh Railways paid such taxes in performance and discharge of the covenants of Consolidated under the said lease. Philadelphia caused Pittsburgh Railways to make these tax payments.</p>

It expressed surprise at this information and formally demanded that Philadelphia inform Monongahela • of the taxes and the amounts thereof which had not been paid and demanded that Philadelphia promptly pay and discharge such unpaid taxes. A copy of that letter was sent to Consolidated. Five weeks later, Philadelphia replied to this letter, but did not give the requested information and suggested that the disposition of the taxes be held in abeyance. On or about September 28, 1942, Monongahela received from the Trustees of Pittsburgh Railways a copy of a second notice and demand for income taxes made by the collector, dated August 15,1942. The notice was directed to Monongahela at 435 Sixth Avenue, being the address of Philadelphia and subsidiaries. On October 9, 1942, Monongahela informed Philadelphia of its receipt of the notice from the collector and inquired what Philadelphia proposed to do concerning the payment of the taxes previously mentioned in Monongahela’s letter of May 22,1942. Three weeks later, Philadelphia replied to this letter, again requesting time and stating that it would •reply to Monongahela’s inquiry in a few weeks. On October 30, Monongahela received a letter from the attorneys for the Trustees of Pittsburgh Railways enclosing notices of levies and distraints, from the Col<a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>lector of Internal Revenue. On November 2, 1942, Monongahela informed Philadelphia of the levies and distraints and urgently requested that Philadelphia advise Monongahela what Philadelphia proposed to do about carrying out its guaranty of the payment of Monongahela taxes. Until Philadelphia’s reply to this letter on November 20, 1942, it had never denied its liability as guarantor for the payment of Monongahela’s taxes.</p>

Philadelphia that it was under no obligation under its guaranty to pay Federal Income taxes of Monongahela, because Consolidated was under no obligation to pay those taxes; and stated that Philadelphia was unable to give Monongahela the unequivocal assurance which it had requested that Philadelphia would pay such taxes. The general attorney stated, however, that Philadelphia, as guarantor of the lease, gave its assurance that it would pay Pennsylvania capital stock and local real estate taxes owing by Monongahela.</p>

This tax covenant was held to include an income tax imposed upon the lessor based on the yearly payments. The tax covenant in the Monongahela Lease is even broader than the tax covenant in the North Pennsylvania case; because the former includes all taxes imposed upon Monongahela or for which it would be liable on account of its earnings or profits.</p>
