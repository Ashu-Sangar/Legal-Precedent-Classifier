On April 9, 1907, Bobert A. Patton insured his life for the sum of $45,000 in The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company. The appellants, the substituted beneficiaries, claimed to recover $3,635.55, with interest; $2,984.85 thereof being the proportionate amount of extended insurance payable under said policy; and $650.70 thereof being a balance of the dividend of $659.70 payable under said policy on April 9,1931.</p>

The premium due April 9, 1931, was not paid, and no premium was paid thereafter. The insured died on April 25, 1942.</p>

Under other terms of the policy the dividends awarded thereon were <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>to be retained by tbe company to accelerate tbe maturity of tbe insurance as an endowment; or used in tbe payment of premiums.

    <p id="b361-7" data-blocks='[["BL_361.8",361,[211,632,1151,484]]]'>The policy states: “Should any indebtedness exist it shall be <em>deducted </em>from the Cash Value of the Policy and the other Values shall be diminished proportionately.” The defendant’s evidence consisted of the testimony of an assistant actuary of the company and certain exhibits, including the certificate of the insured’s indebtedness. Judge Kun then entered a decree nisi in favor of defendant. Exceptions to it were dismissed and final judgment was entered accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b361-8" data-blocks='[["BL_361.9",361,[211,1129,1152,526]]]'>The decision in this case depends entirely on the interpretation of the language of the insurance contract. The word “values” in the quoted provision of the policy obviously refers to “extended insurance” as well as to the two other “values.” If the “extended insurance” is <em>not </em>a value, the only <em>other </em>value, after “cash value” is eliminated from the thought, would be the “paid-up insurance” value, and the word “value” instead of “values” would have been used in the policy, after the word “other.”</p>
    <p id="b361-9" data-blocks='[["BL_361.10",361,[209,1677,1154,425]]]'>The policy provides in effect that the <em>amount </em>of insurance was to be diminished only “should any indebtedness exist,” for in the absence of such indebtedness, it states: “If this policy shall lapse through non-payment of premium after three years’ premiums have been paid in cash, the Company, subject to the other conditions of the Policy, will guarantee the following options, as provided for in the table of values given below:</p>

      <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>There is nothing in the contract of insurance except the provision as to the insured’s indebtedness, which calls for a diminution of the amount of insurance contracted for, in the event of the non-payment of premiums. At the beginning of the policy the company promises “to pay . . . the sum insured hereby less any indebtedness . . .”</p>
    <p id="b362-4" data-blocks='[["BL_362.4",362,[213,690,1151,1135]]]'>Plaintiffs’ claim that the <em>amount </em>of the insurance and not the term of extension is the “value” which is to be diminished proportionately for non-payment of the premium, must be rejected. Defendant’s contention that under the contract the amount of the insurance could not be proportionately diminished on the insured’s failure to pay the premium due but that on the contrary, the automatic extended insurance feature<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> became operative in the full amount of the policy, less the indebtedness due by the insured on that policy, that is, $26,440, must be accepted. The term for which the insurance was to run was a “value,” and on the insured’s failure to pay the premium due, it was the company’s right and duty to “diminish proportionately” that “value” which was the policy’s “period of extended insurance.” That the term of a policy has value requires no demonstration. These plaintiffs are attempting by this action to give the policy “value” by asking a judicial determination to the effect that its term, after default in the payment of the premium due, was eleven years, 223 days, which period would cover the date of the insured’s death.</p>

    <p id="b363-5" data-blocks='[["BL_363.5",363,[213,629,1152,308]]]'>Furthermore, it should be noted that the net value of the policy, $1971.77, would purchase extended insurance in the sum of $45,000 for a much shorter period then it would purchase $26,404 of extended insurance.

    <p id="b363-6" data-blocks='[["BL_363.6",363,[213,957,1152,265]]]'>The case of <em>Steuernagle, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins.

This court held that this left $24 “to secure ‘extended insurance.’ This sifm, on the basis of the tables in the policy, extended the insurance for one year and 11 days, at the expiration of which period, the insured being still alive, the policy ceased and determined.” In that case this court said that “When the payment of premiums ceased the policy lapsed; it was in effect in liquidation, and by its terms certain rights arose in the parties: <em>Mills v. Ins. Co., </em><a href="/tenn/136/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="136 Tenn. 350" data-case-ids="8535080" data-case-paths="/tenn/136/0350-01">136 Tenn. 350</a>; <em>Bach v. Western States Life Ins. Co., </em>51 Fed. (2d) 191. Under the automatic extension clause the insured could demand that the reserve on the policy, built up by the payment of premiums for four years, be applied to extend the full insurance. The period of extension was computed on the basis of reserve or cash value at the time of lapse, excluding any indebtedness. If there was any indebtedness on the policy, the insurer was entitled to liquidate it by charging it against this <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>reserve value: <em>Bach v. Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>Hawthorne v. Bankers Life Co., </em>52 Fed. (2d) 309. When an indebtedness is charged against the reserve or cash value of a lapsed policy the extended insurance as shown by the table is proportionately reduced.” The phrase “proportionately reduced” as used in the policy in the <em>Toncich </em>case has exactly the same meaning as the phrase “diminished proportionately” which is used in the policy now being interpreted. The decision in the <em>Toncich </em>case is controlling in this case.</p>

      <em>* </em>Appellant also complains that the company upon the non-payment of the premium disregarded the direction of the insured to apply the amount of all dividends in reduction of the annual premium, but instead, it retained the amount of the dividend due $650.70, when the premium, $1354.05, was not paid and applied the same to the cash value of the policy. The company takes the position that the amount of the dividend being insufficient to pay the annual premium due, it was impossible to use the dividend in reduction of the premium, that it had to be treated as “accumulated surplus,” and that in adding it to the “cash surrender value” the company was acting in accordance with the provisions of the insurance contract. This addition increased the net value of the policy which was available for the purpose of purchasing extended term insurance.</p>
