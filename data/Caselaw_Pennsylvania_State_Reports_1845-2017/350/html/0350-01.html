The statement of claim avers that Julius Savo lived with his parents and at all times “had a vicious, malignant disposition, and had the habit of mauling, pummelling, assaulting and mistreating smaller children when playing on the streets or in secluded, vacant lots, and of beating, bruising, and punishing such smaller children”; that the defendants “well knew of such habit, . . . and that notwithstanding such knowledge and information they allowed him to go alone among smaller children and continue to assault, misuse, beat, bruise and punish them,” and the defendants “encouraged such boy in such conduct by resenting any resistance or admonition made by other adult persons when said acts were committed by the said boy and knowing of such disposition and propensities and acts of said minor child and in failing to protect other children from such acts of said minor son”. It is then averred that with full knowledge of the disposition, trait and habit of their boy, he was permitted on the evening of October 1, 1943, to go at large where minor children were playing, and with his fists assaulted Robert Condel and with great force threw him down a steep and precipitous embankment, fracturing his leg. It is further averred, “having been frequently notified by complaining neighbors of many similar vicious and unlawful attacks on little children, [the defendants] failed and neglected to exercise reasonable care so to control the said Julius Savo as to prevent him from intentionally harming others and from so conducting himself as to create an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to plaintiff and others as they knew or had the ability to know that they had the ability to control said minor child and knew or should have known of the necessity and opportunity for exercising such control, particularly as the place of said assault was in the immediate vicinity of their residence and a place where young children daily played together, <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>... as they had received complaints from neighbors and others of the bullying, vicious conduct of the said Julius Savo for a long period of time prior to the trespass herein complained of and encouraged him in the manner aforesaid to continue such action, in that they, when complained to, resented any resistance or admonition made by any adult person when committed by the said boy.”</p>

The injury committed by the child must have been the natural and probable consequence of the parents’ negligent act, that is, a consequence which, under the surrounding circumstances, might and ought reasonably to have been foreseen as likely to flow from such negligent act. “Things or results which are only possible cannot be spoken of as either probable or natural. For the latter are those things or events which are likely to happen and for that reason should be foreseen. Things which are possible may never happen, but those which are natural or probable are those which do happen and happen with such frequency or regularity as to become a matter of definite inference. To impose such a standard of care as requires, in the ordinary affairs of life, precaution on the part of individuals against all the possibilities which <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>may occur, is establishing a degree of responsibility quite beyond any legal limitations which have yet been declared” : <em>Swanson v.

C. L. 627. But, by the same authority, it seems to be stated as a general rule that the parent is liable if he was himself guilty of negligence. He is liable, however, only for his own fault and not that of his child. While it is also true that the parents did not actually participate in the particular tort here in controversy, they did know of the habit of their child of striking other children with sticks. They were bound to know that was a habit liable to cause injury to other children, especially smaller children. No one could be so familiar with the habit of a child of that age as the parent, and while the parent cannot be held to the degree of liability of one harboring a vicious dog after notice of its vicious<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>ness, or a wild animal, we think parents should be held responsible and liable for a dangerous habit of a child of which they have knowledge and take no steps to correct or restrain. It is that which constitutes the negligence on the part of the parent.A statement of claim very similar to the one in this case\was filed in <em>Ryley v. Lafferty, </em>45 Fed. (2d) 641 (Idaho)and in overruling the demurrer filed thereto the court, stated: “Having full knowledge of their child’s habits, traits, and vicious disposition, and encouraging him in the manner charged to continue such acts, would constitute assent and participation on the part of the parents in the tort alleged, and, if so, it would be regarded as negligence upon the parents’ part. It may be a question of fact as to whether the child knew of his parents resenting any resistance or admonition made by other adult persons whose children were also beaten and maimed, for to encourage the child the parents must signify their consent to a continuation of their child’s conduct, or direct or ratify the act, or that the child was at the time acting as their agent or servant in their interests or for their benefit. Under such circumstances the parent would be liable under the doctrine of adoption of tort. 29 Cyc. 1667; <em>Norton v. Payne et ux., </em><a href="/wash/154/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="154 Wash. 241" data-case-ids="820243" data-case-paths="/wash/154/0241-01">154 Wash. 241</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=281%20P.%20991" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="281 P. 991">281 P. 991</a>; <em>Thibodeau v.
