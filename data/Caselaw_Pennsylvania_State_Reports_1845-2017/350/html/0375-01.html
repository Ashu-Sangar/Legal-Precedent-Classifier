Her husband’s age is given as 33. Each had been married before. She married Holt February 4, 1941, in Madill, Oklahoma. He was a tractor driver in the construction of pipe lines and came to Waynesburg, Greene County, Pennsylvania, in Jauuary, 1943, to work at that occupation. He died between noon and one o’clock on May 27, 1943, in a furnished three-room apartment rented from Mrs. Sellers, into which he moved March 2nd. The apartment was on the second floor. Mrs. Sellers also occupied a room or rooms on the same floor. The first floor of the house was occupied by B. Wayne Michael, his wife and daughter. There is evidence that during the time Holt lived in the Sellers house, he occasionally had convulsions, nausea and vomiting spells. Nausea and vomiting are said to result from taking arsenic.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Mr. Michael testified that for some time before Holt’s death he heard him get up at night and vomit. Dr. Walker testified that in his conversation with Mrs. Holt on Thursday, the 27th, shortly after Holt’s death, she informed him that he suffered with nausea and vomited that morning. Holt consulted a physician, Dr. Hart, who saw him twice, once in March <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>and once in April, for wliat the doctor thought was “an acute gastric intestinal upset”; to aid him in diagnosis, he desired an x-ray of Holt’s gall bladder and referred him to Dr. A. Carl Walker of Waynesburg to have the x-ray taken. Holt saw Dr. Walker and stated that he had been suffering from intense nausea and vomiting for a week prior thereto. Dr. Walker, in preparation for the x-ray, prescribed for him a gall bladder dye and paregoric with directions for taking them on the evening before the date fixed for the x-ray, instructing him to appear the next day without having eaten breakfast. The day fixed was the Friday before Holt’s death but he did not keep the engagement; Mrs. Holt advised the Doctor that Holt could not retain the gall bladder dye on account of nausea and vomiting.</p>

About 12 o’clock he had a convulsion and became very ill, said he was in great pain. While Holt was in the convulsion, which immediately preceded his death, Mrs. Holt called to the Michaels, occupying the downstairs apartment, “to come upstairs,” and Mrs. Michael testified, “. . . of course we [herself, husband and daughter] all ran to see what was wrong.” Holt was then, as Mrs. Michael said, “unconscious, and black, he was very black when he was in this convulsion.” Mrs. Sellers, from her room on the second floor, opposite Holt’s room, also came in. When Holt became conscious, he “told us that capsule he had taken had made him sick; . . . that capsule made me so sick.” He said, “You know, I was feeling pretty good there a half hour ago.” He begged<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> them to do something for him. Mrs. Holt <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>left the house to get some whisky. When she returned, Holt was dead; Mrs. Sellers met her on the porch and informed her of the fact. Other witnesses testified in corroboration.</p>

Carl Walker was called. He testified that, when he arrived, Holt was dead, that his face and neck were swollen and that his body was discolored as far as the nipple line. He examined his abdomen and found that it was soft from which he inferred that there was no peritonitis such as would have resulted if the gall bladder had ruptured.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> He concluded from his examination that Holt suffered what he called a “heart block” and signed a death certificate that Holt died of coronary occlusion. He said the discoloration of the body and the swollen appearance of the face and neck made him suspect death by “some chemical poisoning.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Holt had an industrial policy of insurance in the sum of <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>$518, taken out a short time before, and Dr. Walker was asked to sign a proof of death. One of the questions on the form was: “Was death due to suicide, homicide or accident? Please specify”, and he answered that question “No.” At the foot of the certificate for the insurance company he wrote, “I am not sure what caused this man’s death. The local coroner investigated the case and ask[ed] me to sign the death certificate. I feel that an autopsy should of [have] been performed.” Dr. Walker testified that he called the coroner and instructed him to investigate the case, saying, “I told him that I was not sure what caused this man’s death, there were certain circumstances surrounding the death that made me suspicious.” The only time he had seen Holt before, was when the engagement was made for the gall bladder x-ray.</p>
    <p id="b412-4" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[190,1158,1151,645]]]'>An undertaker took charge of the body, embalmed it, and on Friday evening, the day after the death, it was sent to Madill, Oklahoma, for interment. Mrs. Holt and Jean Lough of Waynesburg went to Madill by the same train. The District Attorney and the State Police had been notified of Holt’s death and, as a result of their investigation, notified the authorities in Marshall County, Oklahoma, to have an autopsy performed. The results of the autopsy, showing arsenic trioxide in the viscera, were given in evidence and became the bases of opinions of physicians that Holt died of arsenical poisoning.</p>

The box containing the brown pills and the white capsules, which had been seen by the Michaels on the day of Holt’s death, disappeared and could not be found after Holt’s body was shipped to Oklahoma. Those remaining were delivered to the State Police who delivered them to the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratories for analysis. The analysis showed that some of them contained arsenic. Mrs. Holt admitted <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>that she bought quantities of arsenic, explaining that she purchased it for use as a douche.

Mr. Leckey testified that she came into his store on May 24th and asked for rat poison. He “. . . handed her a tube of Elkay rat paste, which I explained was a phosphorous paste and very dangerous because there was no satisfactory antidote.” She asked if it “would kill a person.” He said, “My God, woman, that would kill anything.” She purchased it. Mr. Leckey was corroborated by witnesses who were present in his store at the time. Mr. Krause, of Washington, Pa., testified that on May 26th, about 11.30, she came into his store and asked for rat poison. He showed her several kinds. She said, “. . . she had a lot of trouble with them and they didn’t do the work. She said she was bothered a lot by rats <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> *8and she asked me if I could sell her arsenic, and I told her no, that I didn’t have any, and then she asked me for strychnine, and I sold her a small quantity of strychnine . . . one dram, sixty grains . . . white powder ... in a little bottle.” She gave as her address 177 High Street, which was not the address at which she was living; she was living at 340 East Lincoln Street. He recorded the sale in a poison registry maintained by him. Mrs. Holt admitted that she bought this strychnine but denied that <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>she asked for arsenic. Mr. Headlee, another druggist, testified that on February 15, 1943, he sold an ounce of arsenic trioxide to appellant, and another ounce on May 13th. He asked her what it was to be used for and she said “rat poison” and he so recorded it in his poison registry. She again gave her address at 177 E. High Street, although she did not live there.</p>

    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[221,941,1153,968]]]'>Three physicians testified that Holt died from arsenical poisoning. Two of them had not seen him but based their conclusions on hypothetical statements. Dr. Ramsey, a pathologist of experience, described in appellant’s brief as “an expert toxicologist,” testified: “Q. Doctor, if the report of the chemist showed you that the stomach content, content [contained] 1.05 grains per pound, the stomach tissue 0.2 grains per pound, the liver tissue 0.09 grains per pound, and the kidney 0.07 grains per pound, and the spleen tissue 0.05 grains per pound of arsenic trioxide, what in your opinion, Doctor, was the cause of the man’s death? A. Well, my opinion would be his death was due to arsenic poisoning.” There was evidence that a fatal quantity is from 1% to 3 grains of arsenic trioxide. It will bfe noted that the question propounded involved 1.46 grains. There is evidence that arsenic is eliminated in various ways and that Holt had vomited as recently as the morning of his death.</p>
    <p id="b414-6" data-blocks='[["BL_414.6",414,[223,1920,1150,479]]]'>On behalf of the appellant, it is contended that “The Commonwealth utterly failed to produce any other evidence to establish the cause of death. Having based its case exclusively upon the results of the analysis which showed less than a lethal dose of arsenic was recovered, which experts stated would not cause death under ordinary conditions, the Commonwealth should have been required to show that death was not from a natural cause.”</p>

      <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>It is settled in this Commonwealth that it is not necessary to show that arsenic, in quantities sufficient to kill, was found in the body after death: <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth must show beyond reasonable doubt that death resulted from poison feloniously administered. Enough was 'shown to go to the jury to determine that Holt’s death resulted from arsenical poison and not from natural causes. We must also reject the argument that there is no proof of felonious intent. It is within the province of the jury to find such intent from the circumstances shown. The appellant admitted the purchases of the poisons. There is evidence from which the jury could find that in order to divert suspicion she falsely stated the purposes for which she purchased them; such statements were part of the circumstances that would support a finding against innocence: compare <em>Commonwealth v. Lettrich, </em><a href="/pa/346/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="346 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1216466" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0497-01">346 Pa. 497</a>, and cases cited p. 499, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.2d%20155" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="31 A.2d 155">31 A. 2d 155</a>.</p>

Mrs. Hill, who testified she saw appellant “about every day,” said that on May 12th, she and appellant drove about Waynesburg and vicinity looking for their husbands; went after them to Washington, Pa., and, not seeing them there, went to Pittsburgh; drove about Pittsburgh and finally returned to Waynesburg after dark and found that their husbands had returned. According to Mrs. Hill, she and appellant stopped rather frequently and drank whisky. On that evening, as a result of a quarrel on this subject, Holt beat his wife.</p>

The evidence referred to was relevant on motive : compare <em>Commonwealth v.

Having been asked what effect the embalming fluid would have on the poison in the viscera, he stated that there would be no chemical reaction that would change the arsenic. He was then asked to state “the active ingredients of standard embalming fluid.” Counsel for appellant objected “unless . . . [he] knows what embalming fluid was used . . .” The court sustained the objection. The undertaker had testified that he used a standard product, that “. . . there is a state law regarding the manufacturing of embalming chemicals. It cannot contain arsenic or any poison of that nature.” The witness, Rogers, was then reminded that the undertaker had stated that he used “a standard embalming fluid” and was asked whether there was arsenic in it. He replied that “I have never found one that had arsenic in it” though he had “. . . analyzed possibly twenty different brands.” He was then asked whether he had examined the embalming fluid which the undertaker said he used, and replied that he had not. This evidence is complained of; we think defendant was not prejudiced.</p>

The Court: That leaves out all he threw up and all he eliminated and that his body threw off, the actual amount there is less. By the Witness: A. That’s right.” The appellant contends that the court made a prejudicial statement.

In the garbage can were various containers with traces of phosphorus. Appellant’s purchase of strychnine was shown. Evidence of these circumstances could not well have been kept out of the case, and the learned trial judge instructed the jury to limit its inquiry to death by arsenic <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and to disregard the other poisons.

      <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>Mrs. Holt was found guilty because arsenic in a substantial amount was found in the body of her husband, and because she had purchased two small quantities of that drug, one ounce each, on February 15, and May 13, 1943, at Headlee’s Drug Store in Waynesburg, where the druggist said she was “a frequent customer”. Holt died May 27, 1943. At the time of these purchases she gave her correct name, and her address as 177 East High Street, Waynesburg. At the time of the first purchase she was actually living at 177 East Main Street, Waynesburg, at the home of Jennie Hessel, where she had been since her arrival in Waynesburg from Oklahoma on February 1st, 1943. She moved from there on or about March 2,1943, and was living at 340 East Lincoln Street, Waynesburg, at the home of Mrs. Sellers, when she made the second purchase, where she remained until after the death of her husband. On May 26,1943, at Krause’s Pharmacy in close-by Washington, Pennsylvania, she purchased a small quantity, 1 dram, 60 grains, of strychnine. The druggist said she had asked for arsenic and that he told her he had none. She again gave her correct name and her address as 177 High Street, Waynesburg. This druggist said she told him she was from Oklahoma, that her husband was working on the pipe line which was being built through Waynesburg, and she then exhibited her ration book to establish her identity. All of this appears in the Commonwealth’s case, and there is not anything in the entire record, other than the erroneous street address, which could in any way suggest even a suspicion that this woman was attempting to hide her identity. I think any fair examination of this testimony would force the conclusion that the error in the address could not have been intentional or of any possible advantage to evade identification, and that she did just about everything that any innocent person would do to make her identity known. This is particularly true since she was a stranger in the town, having lived there only about two weeks when she made the first purchase. <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>Waynesburg is a small borough with a population of less than 5000 people. The Commonwealth made much of this inadvertence. It is one of a number of small and trifling incidents which were permitted to enter the case. There is not anything to show that she ever administered arsenic or anything else to her husband. Her explanation of the reason for purchasing the arsenic was for her own hygienic use and was quite sufficient, if believed. Since only arsenic was found by the autopsy, all question of poison by strychnine or other drugs was removed by the trial judge from the case.</p>

Her husband was a sick man; although but thirty-three years of age, he had been ill, and under the treatment of physicians for at least two years prior to his death. He seemed to have a serious gall bladder condition and it worried him considerably, he being afraid of an operation. On May 20, the Thursday before he died, he went to Doctor Walker, a witness for the Commonwealth, and arranged for an x-ray examination of his gall bladder, he having been sent there by Doctor Hart, who had seen him several 'times regarding his illness.

Everything indicated that Holt knew his condition was brought on by his own act and that his wife in no way contributed to the happening. If his wife had given him the capsule he would have accused her then. Everything there indicated their relationship was amicable.</p>

He examined him and later signed the death certificate in which he said that the primary cause of death was coronary occlusion, other conditions chronic inflammation of the gall bladder. Before he signed this certificate, he notified the coroner. This official came to the house and made an investigation, after which he informed the doctor that everything was satisfactory and that he should sign the certificate. Doctor Walker claims <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>that he told the coroner that there should be an autopsy. This, however, the coroner flatly denied. Following Holt’s death, defendant went to the Michael apartment and remained there practically all the afternoon and evening of that day, and she spent that night at the home of friends who resided nearby. She did not return to her own apartment until the next day, and then only shortly before she left for Oklahoma, when she went there accompanied by a neighbor to get her clothes for the trip. She made no attempt to conceal or destroy anything. Her neighbors had full possession of her apartment following the death, and while she was away.</p>
    <p id="b426-4" data-blocks='[["BL_426.4",426,[210,954,1152,644]]]'>The body was sent the next night to Oklahoma. An autopsy was held there at the request of the Pennsylvania authorities, and it was found that there was an appreciable amount of arsenic in the body. When this was reported to Doctor Walker, he changed his opinion as to the cause of death as given on his certificate and said that he believed that Holt had died of arsenical poisoning, and he then attempted to give the impression that he had been of that opinion from the first. His testimony shows clearly that he was covering up what he thought was a gross mistake and for reasons of his own. His testimony, to say the least, is not reliable.</p>
    <p id="b426-5" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[211,1608,1158,808]]]'>No motive for the crime was shown and the effort to prove a motive was so futile that one wonders why the district attorney in such a serious ease would introduce such testimony. For instance, it was shown that shortly prior to the death a $518.00 industrial policy was taken out. This was not enough to pay the funeral and other-expenses. And it was the only insurance Holt had on his life at the time of death. Also, by clearly incompetent testimony, to be referred to later, an effort was made to show an application for a $1,000.00 policy in the Great American Life Insurance Company. In addition, an effort was made to show that she would be the beneficiary of an amount collected by the fellow employees of her husband, and that she knew that. Surely the attempt to show motive because of insurance was a complete failure.</p>

      <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>Another effort to show motive resulted in testimony that several weeks before his death Holt had an argument with his wife and struck her, and that later she made the statement that she didn’t care what would happen to him, that he had killed her love. On another occasion it was shown that he had locked her out of their apartment. In other words, the wife was the innocent victim of the husband’s brutality and now that is turned upon her as a motive to convict her of the most serious crime known to the law. It was shown that on one occasion she and a Mrs. Hill drove to Pittsburgh looking for their husbands, who were in the habit of going around with other women, and that coming and going they stopped for refreshments, and each had several glasses of whiskey. There is no indication that she ever used liquor to excess, but it is clear that her husband frequently became intoxicated. I think it was the same night that she returned from this trip with Mrs. Hill that Holt struck her. The majority recites this trip in detail, but I cannot see in it any motive for murder.</p>

Some of them were as follows: (1) The introduction of the incompetent testimony concerning embalming fluid. The court allowed a chemist to testify that standard brands of embalming fluid contain no arsenic, and that he had examined twenty such brands. This witness admitted that he had not examined the kind of embalming fluid [Q-. H. Shell Company] used in the Holt case. His testimony gave the jury to believe that the Holt embalming fluid had no arsenic in it, which may or may not have been true. Had this not been permitted, the presumption would have arisen that the arsenic in the body of the deceased may have come there through the embalming fluid. This alone could have raised a reasonable doubt and might have resulted in the acquittal of the accused. We said in <em>Commonwealth v. Danz, </em><a href="/pa/211/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="211 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="940074" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0507-01">211 Pa. 507</a>, 519, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20A.%201070" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="60 A. 1070">60 A. 1070</a>, that such question is a most material matter, re-<a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>suiting in substantial error, for which there should be a reversal. In that case we said that the witness testifying concerning the embalming fluid was one of the most important witnesses in the case.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[210,520,1157,1680]]]'>The majority agrees that it was error not to have stricken this testimony out, yet hold that “defendant Avas not prejudiced” thereby. With this I do not agree, because I think this testimony highly prejudicial. We said, in <em>Commonwealth v. Petrillo, </em><a href="/pa/338/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="338 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1199962" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0065-01">338 Pa. 65</a>, 97, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.2d%20317" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="12 A.2d 317">12 A. 2d, 317</a>: “In ordering a new trial in this case we are not holding that there was not sufficient competent evidence offered to warrant a conviction, but we are holding that there was such an admixture of competent and incompetent eAÚdence in the testimony admitted as to deprive the defendant of the fair and impartial trial which every accused in an American court of justice is entitled to. It is the duty of the appellate courts to see to it that every defendant gets such a trial. This Court said in <em>Logue v. The Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/38/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="38 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="994062" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0265-01">38 Pa. 265</a>, 269, in an opinion by Justice Thompson: ‘It was suggested on the argument here, that even if there was error in the particulars discussed, it did the prisoner no harm, as the jury found him to be guilty of a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated murder, and therefor the law of self-defense could have no application to his case. This suggestion is more plausible than sound. It would be very unsafe to prove the accuracy of all the steps in a trial by the result of the verdict. <em>Who can tell what the result might be in any given ease where there is error in some of its parts? </em>The result might be accurate, but it would probably be accidental. <em>The law does not conclude parties and rights upon such uncertain grounds. </em>Its utmost effort is accuracy, as far as it may be attained through fallible agencies, and then its mission is complete, and its conclusions irrevocable.” (Italics added.)</p>

He did not make clear “to the jury the nature of circumstantial <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>evidence, and in language understandable to lay minds the jury should have been instructed that if the evidence could reasonably be explained on any other theory than that of the guilt of the accused, she should be acquitted”: <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Giovanetti, <a href="/pa/341/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="341 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1204485" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0345-01">341 Pa. 345</a>, 359, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="19 A.2d 119">19 A. 2d 119</a>. This Court said in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Bardolph, <a href="/pa/326/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="326 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="1174420" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0513-01">326 Pa. 513</a>, 521, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.%20916" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="192 A. 916">192 A. 916</a>, quoting with approval the following from <em>Commonwealth v.

The evidence must be such as to exclude to a moral certainty every hypothesis but that of guilt of the offense imputed; the facts and circumstances must not only be consistent with and point to the guilt of the accused, but they must be inconsistent with his innocence.” The trial court should have charged in almost this identical language so that the lay minds of the jury could understand that if the evidence against the accused could be reasonably explained on any other theory than that of guilt the accused must be acquitted. The trial court touched upon this subject in its qualified affirmance of defendant’s seventh point, but in a way that was confusing and of little or no help to the jury. I think defendant was prejudiced by the inadequate manner in which this important subject was handled.</p>
    <p id="b429-3" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[227,1769,1153,589]],["BL_430.1",430,[214,299,1150,478]]]'>(3) The court erred in allowing the introduction of Holt’s application for insurance made to the Great American Life Insurance Company. The application was secured from its office in Texas by a Pennsylvania State Policeman. He brought it to court and the trial judge permitted it to be introduced in evidence. No agent or representative of the company appeared to testify to anything concerning it. The action of the court in this respect was nothing better than the admission of pure hearsay testimony. If the jury could imagine anything in the way of motive from the testimony concerning in<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>surance, the admission of this incompetent application was decidedly prejudicial to the accused. The majority, conceding that it was error to have admitted this evidence, hold, however, that such testimony “had very little to do with the vei’dict”. Who can say what effect the testimony regarding insurance had on the verdict of the jury? The attitude of this Court seems to me to be pure assumption, nothing better than a guess, and one in which the Court should not indulge.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[214,790,1151,972]]]'>(4) The majority says that the accused was not prejudiced by the refusal of the trial court to charge that conviction could only follow their being convinced beyond a moral certainty of the guilt of accused. This would seem to approve the dropping of this phrase out of the law as being the equivalent of “beyond a reasonable doubt”. I think it a bit too late in the day, under our decisions, to say that one is the equivalent of the other— that each mean the same thing. In one of our recent cases, <em>Commonwealth v. Libonati, </em><a href="/pa/346/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="346 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1216395" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0504-01">346 Pa. 504</a>, 508, 31 A. 2nd 95, Mr. Justice Patterson said: “The requirement of the law is that in order to warrant a conviction the facts and circumstances proved must be of such character as to produce a moral certainty of the guilt of the accused beyond any reasonable doubt”. See <em>Commonwealth v. Giovanetti, </em>supra. This is a correct statement of the law as it exists today, and therefore, the lower court erred in failing to follow it.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[215,1770,1150,479]]]'>I think that it is very doubtful that the corpus delicti was proven; also that even if the case had to be submitted, and I think this.was necessary, the testimony against the accused was so weak that in a fair trial she would be found not guilty because of the reasonable doubt. She was perhaps unfortunate beyond her deserts by reason of the “hue and cry” in this small community against a woman who was charged with a cowardly and atrocious crime.</p>
