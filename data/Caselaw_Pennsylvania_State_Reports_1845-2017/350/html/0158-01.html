    <p id="b192-6" data-blocks='[["BL_192.9",192,[228,703,1152,1131]]]'>On May 18, 1926, the City of Erie adopted an ordinance providing for the paving of the roadway of certain streets and for the appointment of viewers to assess benefits; the assessments were to be paid in ten instalments, the first one thirty days after the completion of the work and the others semi-annually thereafter with interest at six per cent per annum. The ordinance declared it to be the duty of the city treasurer promptly to collect the instalments as they become due and at the expiration of four months from the date of the confirmation of the assessment by the court to deliver a certified list of all unpaid assessments to the city solicitor who was thereupon to file municipal claims; upon failure of any property owner to pay the amount of any instalment and interest the treasurer was to request the solicitor to commence the proper action to collect such delinquent assessment. For the purpose of paying the contractor there were to be issued street improvement bonds which were to rest for their security only upon the assessments and to bear interest at the rate of six per cent per annum until paid.</p>

The bonds stated that they were issued in pursuance of the ordinance, that they rested for their security solely upon the assessments levied on the lands abutting on the improved highways, and that they were to be called in and paid as <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>funds were received by the city treasurer from the assessments.</p>

The present action is in assumpsit against the City of Erie for that amount, with interest at six per cent per annum from the respective dates of issue of the bonds. The alleged liability of the city was predicated upon an averment that it did not proceed with the collection of the liens within a reasonable time and when they could have been collected, nor did it press the owners of the properties for payment; also that it was negligent in not levying sufficient assessments, filing valid liens, reviving liens, and taking other steps at the proper times to make and protect the assessments. The case was tried by the court without a jury. Testimony was presented by plaintiff to show that there had been delay in filing the viewers’ report extending beyond the statutory period; negligence in failing to provide sufficient interest inasmuch as the liens bore interest from dates later than the issuance of the bonds; delay in redeeming bonds resulting in further deficiencies of interest; improper releasing of properties from liens; failure of the city treasurer to request the solicitor to collect delinquent assessments upon defaults in payments of instalments; and failure on the part of the solicitor to institute suits in assumpsit against solvent property owners, to collect penalties due because of the non-payment of liens, and to institute proceedings to collect the liens although for several years after the issuance of the bonds there was sufficient value in the properties abutting the improvement to cover the amount of the assessments.</p>

This ruling rests upon the fact that it is only the city which can take such proceedings, and therefore the law writes into these bonds an implied covenant that the city will use due diligence in collecting the liens and if it fails to do so will itself pay the bonds according to their terms with the same force and effect as if they were full faith and credit bonds of the municipality.</p>

The theory ■underlying these decisions is that the liability of the municipality arises, not in tort, but from contract, and is based upon an implied covenant that due care will be exercised in the filing and enforcement of the liens and that, if the city fails to exercise such care, it will pay the bonds just as though it had been originally named therein as general obligor. If, therefore, this implied <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>covenant is broken, tbe resulting damage to tbe bondholders is not, as the court below held, unascertained, unliquidated, and limited to what might have been collected had the city been duly diligent; on the contrary, full recovery is allowed in the face amount of the bonds and the interest as therein provided. From this it also follows that the allowance of interest after the maturity of the bonds was not a matter within the discretion of the court, for, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, a liquidated claim carries interest with it, as of legal right, from the time the debt becomes due. Interest “is completely due, wherever a liquidated sum of money is unjustly withheld.
