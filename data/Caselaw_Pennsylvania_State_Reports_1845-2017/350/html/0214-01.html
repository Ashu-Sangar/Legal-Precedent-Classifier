The case was tried on the merits in February, 1939, before the three judges of the court below in banc. Three questions were presented and considered: (1) Had the pledgee foreclosed the equity of redemption and become the owner of the collateral? (2) Had the court jurisdiction? (3) Was there laches? The judges differed among themselves concerning these issues, and dismissed the bill, one judge dissenting. Plaintiffs’ appeal from the dismissal of the bill was sustained: <em>Thomas v.

The notes provided that on default “. . . power and authority are hereby given to the holder hereof to sell, assign and deliver the whole of the said securities ... at any broker’s board, or at public or private sale, at the option of said holder, without either demand, advertisement or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived. At any such sale the holder hereof may himself or itself purchase the whole, or any part of the property sold, free from any right of redemption on the part of the undersigned which is hereby waived and released . . .” The issue was whether the pledgor’s title was divested by sale of the collateral in foreclosure of the equity of redemption. This issue was tendered by defendants’ answer which, inter alia, averred: “In addition to the failure to make payment as above recited, the said William R. Thomas [pledgor] had violated each and every of the other covenants, conditions and agreements contained in said notes (Exhibits ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’, respectively), so that on the 28th day of October, 1931 the said John H. Waters was entitled by the terms of said notes to make private sale of the collateral pledged therewith, and to become the purchaser thereof.</p>

Thomas which was waived and released in said notes.” It was an affirmative defense; unless they proved it, their defense failed: compare <em>McConville v.

There is no direct evidence of sale and the circumstances relied on do not support the averment. Defendants refer to declarations, said to have been made by Mr. Waters, to persons not connected with plaintiffs, that he “had taken over” the collateral; that he referred to it as “securities that I was compelled to take over in order to secure myself . . .” that, as president of the bank, he wrote to the president of the Murphy Company asking for “a 50 <em>fo </em>payment on your note next week . . .” and in a postscript referred to “the Murphy Company stock which I hold.” His secretary testified that he “. . . handed me an envelope in which were notes, [the Thomas notes] and he said it was a closed transaction and I should file the envelope in his compartment in the safe for posterity.” Assuming, but not deciding their admissibility, it is clear that none of those statements shows that he had complied with the provision in the notes, foreclosed the equity of redemption and purchased the security. Taken literally, as they must be, the declarations are consistent with plaintiffs’ contention and inconsistent with defendants’ contention, because the <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>power to sell and to buy was not one to be executed by a taking: cf. <em>Huntingdon Talley Trust Co. v.

It is significant, against the defendants, that the notes continued so to be entered after that date, though one would have expected, if defendants’ contention is correct, that Mr. Waters would have had his books show the change brought about by his foreclosure of the pledgor’s equity. The record contains the following stipulation: “Counsel for defendants agree that at the time of the death of Mr. Waters, the books concerning which testimony has been given at this hearing today by Mr. Resley and Mr. Gardner shows the three Thomas notes, one of $32,-000.00 and two others, one of $20,500.00 and one of $1,900.00, as being his property, and they do not show any common stock of G. C. Murphy Company as being his property or being the property of anybody, in particular, Mr. William R. Thomas. By Mr. Meyers: Does that apply as to the date of Mr. Waters’ death?

An ancountant, connected with Main &amp; Co., testified that until January 1,1934, the notes were entered on Waters’ books as an indebtedness of $54,400 due by the pledgor, and that on January 1, 1934, which was after the pledgee’s death, the bills receivable account was discontinued by a journal transfer containing the following explanation: “. . . for 1655 shares of G. C. Murphy Company common stock held as collateral on loans to William R. Thomas, deceased. It now develops that these 1655 shares were fully transferred to John H. Waters on October 28, 1931, as full settlement of claims for loans amounting to $54,400.00.” There is no evidence of the making of the settlement so recorded and we consider it irrelevant. The original answer alleged that, by the sale, plaintiffs became entitled to a credit of $41,375; by an amended answer, defendants credited plaintiffs with the face amount $54,400. In their brief, defendants say that Waters “. . . maintained another set of books with reference to his personal affairs,” and that “At the time of the transfer of the stock no entry was made in this journal and ledger showing the ownership of the stock . . .”</p>

The evidence is that Waters’ title was that of pledgee, subject to the pledgor’s equity of redemption; that status continued until such time as evidence .showed a change: compare <em>Zuback v. Bakmaz, </em><a href="/pa/346/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="346 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1216419" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0279-01">346 Pa. 279</a>, 282, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%20473" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="29 A.2d 473">29 A. 2d 473</a>. The burden of proving it was on defendants who alleged it. Until foreclosure, the pledgee could not obtain an absolute title and the foreclosure could take place only pursuant to the agreement contained in the notes; defendants’ averment of sale was an apparent <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>recognition of the necessity for snch action.

    <p id="b253-3" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[211,459,1162,1898]]]'>The next proposition to be considered is that the defendant distributees, who are said to have acted innocently in receiving the stock as distributive shares of the Waters’ Estate, should not be required to reimburse plaintiff for all the proceeds from the stock with interest and without deduction for income taxes which they paid on their respective incomes. The administrator of Waters made distribution in 1935; accordingly no order has been made against him as a defendant in this proceeding : see <em>Thomas v. </em>Waters, 342 Pa. at pages 132 and 133, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.2d%20872" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="18 A.2d 872">18 A. 2d 872</a>. As was stated in the former opinion, the Orphans Court, at the audit of the administrator’s account, had approved distribution in kind; the notes were part of the property with which the administrator had charged himself and formed part of the property distributed, each distributive share necessarily carrying with it a corresponding share of the collateral; it is immaterial that, at the time, the notes were physically located in decedent’s safe and not in the courtroom. Legally they were in the administrator’s possession as his account disclosed; the distribution in kind was of what he had. So far as appears in the record, the administrator complied with the decree of distribution. Defendants present a contention in their supplemental brief that an amount equal to the amount of the dividends received by the administrator should be deducted from the amount ordered to be paid by the distributees on the ground that claim for that amount should have been made at the audit of the account of Waters’ administrator. There is nothing to commend that argument. Any dividends received by the administrator were creditable by Mm first to interest on the notes and then to principal. As was stated in the former opinion, the Thomas executors were debtors, not creditors, of the Waters’ estate at that time.</p>
