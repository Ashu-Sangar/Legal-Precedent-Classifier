There is a distinct difference between a certificate of stock and scrip, or other evidence of ownership. A certificate while merely evidence of ownership of stock is a matter of record on the books of the corporation, and any transfer thereof is evidenced by the issuance of a new certificate to the transferee. Scrip, on the other hand, has none of the attributes of a certificate of stock.

If a corporation merely issued shares of stock and the law did not confer on the owner thereof the power to vote <em>all </em>of such shares, he would have only one vote, as at common law. When a holder of more than one share of stock claims the right to cast more than one vote he must point to a statute giving him that right. In Pennsylvania he can show his statutory authority to cast one vote for every full share of stock he owns, but he cannot show any statutory authority for his casting fractional votes for every fractional share of stock he owns. This right is clearly not conferred by implication for it is not necessary to the exercise of any right expressly granted. If, for example, a statute conferred upon qualified citizens the right to cast one vote, say on the question of a bond issue by the municipality in which the voter was an elector, for every acre of real estate the voter owned in that <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>municipality, a voter possessed of <em>2y2 </em>acres of real estate could not cast 2% votes, and the fact that the law authorized the issuance to a voter of “scrip” entitling him to receive a deed to a full acre upon his surrender later of such scrip or other evidence of ownership aggregating a full acre, but providing that he was not entitled to vote on that scrip, would not by implication confer upon him the right to cast a <em>fraction </em>of a <em>vote </em>based upon his ownership of a <em>fraction </em>of an <em>acre </em>even if he did have a <em>deed </em>to that fractional acre.</p>

This is a suitable argument to be addressed to the Legislature, but as courts have no power to legislate, the argument cannot affect their construction of the law. It may be said, however, that the Legislature may wisely have hesitated to confer upon stockholders the right to vote fractional shares of stock because of the complications and confusion in voting which would inevitably result. The court below concedes that “the right to cast a fractional vote based <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>upon a fractional share would involve expense and inconvenience to the corporation, would complicate its books and stock records, . . . and that numerous disputes over the voting rights of fractional shares would be inevitable. ... A corporation authorized to issue fractional shares could issue a certificate for any fractional interest, % share, 1/10 share, 1/100 share, 1/1000 share, or in any fraction. Undoubtedly the issuance of such fractional shares would lead to many complexities, particularly in the case of cumulative voting.” But the court adds: “However, corporations are not compelled to issue fractional shares; they are merely given the right to do so, and if they desire to avoid the difficulties arising from voting fractional shares, they can issue scrip or other evidence of ownership.” While this is true, the state which is the parent of its corporations might have deemed it wise to save corporations from the possibility of the complexities the court below has so aptly portrayed, by withholding from shareholders the right to cast votes based upon their ownership of fractional shares. We hold that the fractional shares of stock standing in the names of the appellee shareholders of Clawson Chemical Company could not lawfully have been used by them as a basis for their voting for directors at the annual meeting of the corporation held on April 25, 1944, cumulatively or otherwise. If these fractional shares of stock had not been so used as a basis of voting, it is evident from a simple mathematical calculation that the respondents would not have received enough votes to insure their election as directors. The demand for an ouster is therefore sustained.</p>
