    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[225,1613,1154,528]]]'>The basis for the claim is an alleged parol agreement made on January 31, 1924, between the decedent and the claimant in the home of a neighbor named Bernhardt. It is maintained that decedent agreed with claimant that if she would continue to live in decedent’s home and do the .housework everything which decedent possessed would go to claimant at decedent’s death.

She resided with them for some years prior to the wife’s death on January 23rd, 1924. Claimant was employed in a nearby grocery <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>store. She worked at the store during the day and assisted with the housework at night. Claimant also cared for decedent’s wife during the illness preceding her death. The conversation which it is contended constituted the contract took place after the wife’s funeral, upon the return of decedent and claimant from the burial. The parties had been invited to supper by the neighbors Bernhardt. The women prepared and served the meal and cleared the table while decedent and Mr. Bernhardt carried on the conversation in question. Mr. Bernhardt inquired of decedent concerning his future plans, whereupon decedent is alleged to have made the statement hereinafter quoted. Claimant remained with decedent and performed the domestic service as theretofore. On September 14,1932, — over eight years after the making of the alleged contract — decedent remarried. Some five or six weeks thereafter, at decedent’s suggestion, claimant left the home. Reversing the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the auditing judge that the claim had not been sufficiently proven, the court in banc allowed the claim for a period of 446 weeks, at the rate of $12 per week, a total of $5,352.</p>

His testimony was: “Q. Now after the dinner was over was there any conversation between you and Mr. Roberts and Alberta Babel? A. Well, of course we were interested, naturally would be, in what they were going to do; so I asked Mr. Roberts and he said that Alberta had said maybe she was going to leave, now that Mrs. Roberts was gone, and that he had been talking to her, didn’t want her to leave, and he said that he was willing to live on there if Alberta would agree to it, and he said that anything that he had naturally would be Alberta’s at his death, that he would make provision to that effect, or, as you might say, a will, if Alberta would agree. Of course he stipulated that Alberta Avould work at the store and take care of the house in the evening, which Alberta did, <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>to my knowledge, as far as I know, after, as long as we lived there and afterwards; and Alberta agreed to the proposition.”</p>

He wrote: “As it fell from the lips of the witness the testimony of Henry Bernhardt was hesitant, excursive, unsure. The impression which he gave while on the stand was that of a man cudgeling his brains in a not very successful effort to recall matters which had transpired almost twenty years ago and in which he was not particularly concerned at the time they occurred. It lacked probative weight.”</p>
    <p id="b503-5" data-blocks='[["BL_503.6",503,[213,953,1154,1304]]]'>The refusal of the auditing judge to accept this testimony was not based upon capricious disbelief. He assigned very sound reasons for his rejection. He very carefully considered what weight or value could be ascribed to such evidence. If the manner of the witness was “hesitant, excursive and unsure” and he was “cudgeling his brains in a not very successful effort to recall matters which had transpired almost twenty yeags ago”, a judge charged with the duty of making findings of fact was not obliged to accept such testimony as a true and sufficient basis to support a finding that the parties had come to an agreement. Where an auditing judge sees and hears the witnesses, it is for him to determine their credibility and the weight to be given to their testimony because of their character, intelligence and knowledge of the subject, and his findings, like those of a jury, will not be disturbed except for clear error. <em>Steinmeyer v.
