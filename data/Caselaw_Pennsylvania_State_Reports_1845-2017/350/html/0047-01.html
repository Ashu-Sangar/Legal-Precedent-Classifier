This board was appointed to determine the damages to the property of appellees arising out of the improvement of Section 6, State Highway Boute 184, in Sugarloaf Township and Conyngham Borough, Luzerne County. Prior to the commencement of the improvement, the Pennsylvania Department of Highways prepared a plan indicating that the entire improvement was 5.52 miles in length, of which total length, .01132 mile or 59.8 feet, were located in the Borough of Conyngham. The balance of the improvement was located in Sugarloaf <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>Township and involved the taking of 1.63 acres of land of appellees in Sugarloaf Township.</p>
    <p id="b81-4" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[201,385,1153,592]]]'>B.efore the Governor approved the plan for this improvement, the Borough of Conyngham, by its Secretary, certified to the Department of Highways, that the council of the borough had duly passed and adopted an ordinance adopting as the borough plan, the aforesaid plan of the Department of Highways for the portion of the improvement in Conyngham Borough, enacting or ordaining as true and proper, the widths, lines, grades, courses, etc., shown thereon. The Burgess, President and Secretary of the Council also approved the aforesaid plan on the title sheet under the following notation:</p>
    <p id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[204,988,1152,319]]]'>“Approving and establishing by ordinance the lines, grades, drainage structures and all other structures on Route 184, Sec. 6, in Luzerne County between Sta. 579+72 and Sta. 585+70; and Rd. approach Lt. of Sta. 643+00 between Sta. 2+55 and Sta. 12+25.00 in Conyngham Boro.”</p>
    <p id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[203,1319,1155,1078]]]'>Relying on the signatures to the plan, the passage of the ordinance and the certificates of the Borough Secretary, the Governor approved the plan. The appellee petitioned the Court of Quarter Sessions for the appointment of viewers to determine and assess the damages. A board of view was appointed by the lower court. This board filed its report, and it was confirmed nisi. This report fixed the damages to appellees’ property, including both the portion in Conyngham Borough and the portion in Sugarloaf Township, at the total sum of $2850, and the viewers, over the objection of Commonwealth’s counsel, determined that the total amount was payable by the Commonwealth. Counsel for the Commonwealth filed exceptions to the report of viewers and subsequently the court upheld the exceptions, in part, and referred the proceedings back to the board of view for the purpose of securing additional testimony concerning the enactment of the ordinance by the Borough of Conyngham, adopting the plan of the Department of Highways.</p>

      <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>The viewers subsequently filed a supplementary report which contained, inter alia, a copy of the ordinance passed by the Borough of Conyngham with the certification of the Borough Secretary attached, as well as a discussion of the law applicable to the facts, and a determination that all damages payable to the appellee as found, were payable by the Commonwealth. The damages determined were for that portion of appellees’ property in the Borough of Conyngham as well as in the Township of Sugarloaf and the total amount thereof again was determined to be payable by the Department of Highways.</p>
    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[189,936,1150,469]]]'>To this supplementary report, counsel for the Commonwealth filed five exceptions, which appellee contends were filed after the court’s decision on June 21, 1943. The only exceptions before the court when its decision was rendered were those filed on May 8,1942, and which raised only the question whether the poAver of eminent domain in the Borough of Conyngham in taking land for this highway was exercised by the Borough or by the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[189,1426,1149,98]]]'>Both parties filed a statement that the question to be argued before the Supreme Court was the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.6",82,[187,1535,1151,645]]]'>“The appellant on the appeal of this ease intends to argue before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania the following question: ‘Is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania responsible to a property owner for property damages in a borough when the borough certifies to the Commonwealth that it has enacted a borough ordinance adopting, as the action of the borough, the width, lines, grades, etc., shoAvn on the Commonwealth’s plan for the improvement of a State highway in the borough, and the Commonwealth in reliance thereon completes the improvement in accordance with said plan and does not exercise its right of eminent domain?’ ”</blockquote>

It is significant that its agreement with the county commissioners of this county for contribution by the latter to the payments of damages (liability on the county is expressly excluded therein), did not include that portion of the highway situate within Conyngham Borough; nor was such portion of the highway included on the map filed by the Commonwealth in the Kecorder of Deeds office.”</p>
    <p id="b83-3" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[217,944,1152,429]]]'>The court below correctly stated “As the petitioners know of no certificate asserting proper adoption of the ordinance, did not rely on it or were intended to benefit by it and are strangers to it, they could not be bound by it nor avail themselves of it.
