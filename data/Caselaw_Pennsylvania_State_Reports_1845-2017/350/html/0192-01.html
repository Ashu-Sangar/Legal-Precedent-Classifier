They do not, however, rest merely on the absence of market for the shares of stock. They called witnesses to give their opinions as to possible sale of the property of the company. Mr. Mitchell, engaged in “retail lumber, mill work and building supplies,” in Delaware County, said that he made an effort in 1927 and 1928 to dispose of his business and could find no market except “at a tremendous sacrifice,” by which, he said, he meant “At less than 50% of our valuation.” He said he was familiar with the business of the Glauser company which was a “more specialized business and would be harder to dispose of.” He stated that “It is our experience that sales started to drop about 1927 and ’28 and that was general all over the country.” Mr. Wood, engaged in the “lumber business [and] mill, work” in Delaware County, said he was familiar with the Glauser business and thought it “. . . might have been sold at a sacrifice, I don’t think it could have been sold for one hundred cents on the dollar.” He stated that he had been in the Glauser lumber yard a number of times and that while he knew nothing “about their book affairs, . . . the stock in their lumber yard, like any yard established for a long time, had a lot of unsaleable material which they never could have gotten even the cost for.” A third witness, Mr. Finley, was a wholesale lumber dealer who sold lumber to the Glauser company. He stated that he did not recall any sales “of the business of the type of Glauser business . . . between 1920 and 1930,” though he “tried to” keep track of the sales. He said that his lumber business began to decline in 1928. Asked, “What happened <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>in 1929,” he answered, “Of course the collapse came, but the lumber business was very much off all of ’29, even before the collapse.” He became a member of the creditors’ committee that operated the Glauser company from 1931 until it was sold some eight or nine years later. He testified that he thought the business could have been sold at the beginning of 1928, but, when asked “At what kind of figure?” he replied, “Well, I don’t know that. I believe it could have been sold, but not as good a price as it would have gotten if sold two or three years earlier. All business people began to recognize a slight decline in business in 1928, in the lumber business.” He was asked about the character of the management after Mr. Glauser’s death: “Q. And in the three or four years after his death did you regard it as a well managed business? A. I regarded it as well enough managed to keep on selling to them. Q. And you gave them liberal credit? A. I gave them liberal credit up until 1929-30 in there, I was a very small creditor at the time the creditors’ committee was appointed. Q. And others gave them liberal credit in ’26-’28? A. Yes, right on up to the time of the creditors’ committee there was a fair amount of accounts payable, . . .” He said that in 1929 he concluded that “The management [was] incapable.” S. L. Irving, a director of the Chester National Bank, was a member of the creditors’ committee, and testified that from 1925 to 1930 his bank loaned money to the Glauser company on single name paper and that the credit reputation of the company all those years was “very good.” He said his bank “. . . considered it good up until December of 1930.” From 1926 to 1930, reports of the company’s condition, similar to those made to testator, were made by Eastern Millwork Company and were considered by testator’s widow and Willis K. Glauser on behalf of the trust company.</p>

Both sides are at some disadvantage because Mr. MacLean, the treasurer of the Glauser company, and Willis K Glauser, secretary of the company and also assistant trust officer of the Delaware County Trust Company died sometime before the account was filed.

Mrs. Glauser testified that she' went to the trust company and saw Willis K Glauser “possibly once a month”, though “usually on [her] own business”; she received letters and reports from the trust company, and “after [she] commenced to feel that the principal was dwindling” she and her daughter, Mrs. Spackman would “go in and talk to Willis Glauser.” She was asked: “Q. Mrs. Glauser, you knew, of course, that the estate continued to hold these seventeen hundred and odd shares of stock in the Stacy G. Glauser and Son Company? A. Yes. Q. Did you ever suggest to anybody at the Delaware County Trust Company that the estate should sell the shares owned by the estate in the Glauser company? . . . A. No, I don’t think I did. Q. After you were made president of the Stacy G. Glauser &amp; Son, you knew something, at least, of its affairs, didn’t you? You were at all of the meetings of directors, weren’t you? A. Yes. Q. You were at all of the meetings of the shareholders? A. No. Q. Didn’t you preside at meetings of the shareholders held in the Company office? A. No, I presided at meetings in my own home with the officers. Q. Take your annual meetings where stockholders were present, to elect directors and transact business, didn’t you preside at those meetings? A. I don’t remember. Q. Are you sure you didn’t? A. I am pretty sure I didn’t, but I don’t know.” She was asked: “Did you at different times discuss the matter of this estate with your son-in-law? A. I would not know. Q. Did you ever discuss with him the matter of any of the details of investments <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>in your husband’s estate with Mr. Spackman? No. Q. Did you ever go oyer any of these semi-annual reports with Mr. Spackman? A. Well, they had a copy of it. Mr. and Mrs. Spackman had a copy. Q. Do you mean they had a copy of the semi-annual reports sent out? A. Just the same as I had, not the full report, just the analysis, that you showed me.” Her son-in-law, Mr. Spackman, also testified on the subject at some length, saying, inter alia, “Q. Did he tell you any effort was being made to get rid of it? A.' It seems they were waiting for someone to come along and buy it. . . . Q. When did you ask him that, on how many occasions over the years? A. I would say this, it will have to be a guess, I would guess that I probably asked him that at least every three months, not all of those times in the bank of course, but at times when I would play bridge with him I would always say ‘how are you coming along with the sale of the Lumber Company’? Q. What was his reply? A. The same one that I gave you before that you can’t just go out and sell something like that, you have to wait until someone comes along. Q. Was the matter of liquidation discussed in your hearing? A. That was finally discussed.”</p>

I can’t give you an accurate figure, I spoke to him about it quite a few times because it disturbed me. Q. Did you discuss it with your mother? A. Not very much. Q. Did you discuss it with your husband? A. Yes.” In cross-examination she said, “Q. You can’t point to any incident to which you raised any question until after the dividends stopped, is that true? A. I cannot as of a time. Q. You say that Mr. Willis Glauser pointed out to you that while there was a certain book value of the stock, that a large part of that was good will? A. Yes. Q.

The accountants claim credit for $13,250 expended in 1931 in purchasing 265 shares of the stock at $50.00 per share. Of the 265 shares, 200 were the subject of re-purchase agreements; 65 were not. In an exhibit, filed by one of the exceptants, it appeared that the cash value of the capital stock as reported to the Commonwealth for 1930 was $23.71 per share. Based on that exhibit, the learned court surcharged accountants with the difference between $50.00 per share, the amount paid by them, and the sum of $23.71, making a total of $6,966.85.</p>

There was no obligation on accountants in 1931 to purchase the stock. While the contracts provided that on the “death, resignation or leaving the employ” <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>the stockholder or his representatives would sell to Mr. G-lauser and provided that he would purchase, the parties omitted from the contract any provision that the stock should be purchased after his death by his personal representatives. At most, there might have been implied a term to the effect that time for performance would end with the final accounting of his executors, for, as was said in <em>Bland’s Admr. v. Umstead, </em><a href="/pa/23/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="23 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="974000" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0316-01">23 Pa. 316</a>, “. . . the law does not profess to keep up the representation of a dead man’s estate longer than is necessary to settle it.” No notice was given and claim was made, doubtless because none existed, at the audit of the executors’ account, confirmed January 5, 1926.

In referring to the transaction, the learned judge said, “This was apparently done by the corporate trustee alone.” Later, however, he said, “It is alleged that the transaction itself was conducted by the corporate Trustee, but the Individual Trustee says that she was consulted about the matter and was told that it had to be done and raised no objection to the consummation of the business.” If the evidence supported the finding, the conclusion might follow. The brief of the trust company makes no reference' to any evidence that would support the finding of the learned judge. The statement is challenged on behalf of appellant. We have read the evidence<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and find nothing <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>that sustains the finding.

Testator, with several others, in November, 1925, had endorsed a note for $22,000 which became the property of the bank. June 25,1926, Mrs. Glauser, individually and as executrix and trustee of her husband’s estate, and the other endorsers, or their representatives, agreed to pay the debt. The accountants claim credit for $4,807.99 paid to the bank on January 30, 1933, in discharge of the obligation. The learned judge held the payment unauthorized but, instead of requiring its repayment to the trust, he refused to surcharge the trust company and charged Mrs. Glauser as having received an advancement by the trustees pursuant to authority contained in the 8th paragraph of the will. The will provided: “Eighth: I hereby authorize and empower my Trustees or Trustee to pay and advance to my said wife, Emma P. B. Glauser, and my said daughter, Kathryn Dunlap Glauser, respectively at any time or times during their respective lives, in parts or in one payment, such amount or amounts from their respective shares of the principal of this trust, as in the sole judgment of said Trustees or trustee, may be reasonably required for their proper support, comfort or welfare, but the total payments from principal to be made either to my said wife or my said daughter shall not exceed the one-tenth part of their respective shares. My said Trustees or Trustee shall have full discretion to value my estate <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>in order to determine the amount of these payments. The income payable to my said wife and daughter respectively shall be reduced in proportion to the payments made from their respective shares of the principal. My said Trustees or Trustee shall not be responsible for the use of these advances from principal. The receipts therefor of my said wife and daughter shall be a full release and discharge to the said Trustees or Trustee.”</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[162,723,1153,371]]]'>Speaking of the payment of testator’s obligation, the learned judge said: “It is sure it would not be an arbitrary thing to say that it was made for her particular comfort, support and welfare. This, however, should be allocated to and against ‘her share of the principal, or that portion of the principal which she acquired the income which this Will requires to be paid to her’.”</p>
    <p id="b237-5" data-blocks='[["BL_237.5",237,[160,1107,1152,753]]]'>We think the testator, by using the words “proper support, comfort or welfare,” intended exactly what the words import; that he intended to authorize the trustees “to pay and advance” part of principal on two conditions: (1) demand by the beneficiary for a purpose specified, and (2) subject to the discretion of the trustees to approve or disapprove. We can see no basis for the conclusion that the payment made by the accountants is within the intention expressed in the will. Mrs. G-lauser did not request an advancement pursuant to paragraph 8, and, in joining in the payment, did not act pursuant to paragraph 8. The assignment of error must be sustained and both accountants surcharged with the amount wrongfully paid.</p>

Both accountants shall, in equal parts, restore to the trust the sum of $4,807.99 with interest at the rate of <em>3y2% </em>per annum from January 30,1933, and, in addition, the Delaware County Trust Company shall restore the sum <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>of $13,250 with interest at the rate of 3%% per annum from the respective dates of the purchase of Glauser company stock in 1931.</p>
