On June 30, 1934, the Washington Union Trust Company, appellant, was appointed substituted trustee of the general trust fund of mortgages or mortgage pool of the Washington Trust Company, and substituted trustee of the investment or securities pool of said company. The Receiver proceeded to liquidate the assets of the commercial department of the insolvent Trust Company, filing periodic accounts. By 1940 it was apparent that there were ample assets to pay all depositors in the commercial department the face amount of their deposits with a substantial balance remaining. On June 23, 1940, appellant, as substituted trustee of the mortgage pool, filed a petition in the court below alleging gross mismanagement on the part of officers and directors of the insolvent company and, as substituted trustee of the securities or investment pool, filed a petition alleging fraud upon the settlors of inter vivos trusts. Both petitions requested a right of priority in any liquidation, subject only to the claims of depositors. <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>The sixth and partial account of the Receiver was filed June 30,1943. Thereupon appellant filed claims with the Receiver and made averments similar to those set forth in its petitions of June 30, 1940. It now claimed, however, as substituted trustee of the securities or investment pool, a right of priority over depositors in any liquidation. On August 20, 1943, appellant filed a petition in the court below setting forth a detailed statement of facts upon which its claim of priority was based.</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[229,788,1152,1025]]]'>At the audit of the account appellant filed formal objections to the proposed distribution of the balance to the depositors as interest upon their deposits, asserting the preferred claims of settlors of the inter vivos trusts. Counsel for all parties in interest agreed that consideration of the exceptions be postponed until the court should determine whether interest was to be paid to the depositors. If payment of such interest was necessary to constitute payment in full then no fund would exist to which appellant could look for payment of its claims. The court below decided that interest should be paid to the depositors, directed the payment of counsel fees out of the fund to Andrew M. Linn, Esq., attorney for the depositors, and directed distribution of the balance to the depositors. Exceptions were taken to the adjudication. At the oral argument of January 25, 1944, the court below stated that the decree of November 1, 1943, awarding interest to depositors, was a final decree of distribution. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[227,1823,1153,534]],["BL_399.1",399,[248,284,1151,648]]]'>A decree to be final and appealable must preclude the complaining party from further action in the court making such decree: <em>Keasbey’s Trust Estate, </em><a href="/pa/342/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="342 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1206989" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0439-01">342 Pa. 439</a>, 444. The decree of the court below directing distribution of the fund to depositors determined appellant’s rights in and to said fund. Failure to refer to appellant’s putative right to trace the trust res in accordance with the principles of the <em>Erie Trust Company’s Case (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/326/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="326 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1174498" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0198-01">326 Pa. 198</a>, does not affect the finality of the decree. This failure was brought about by the manner <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>in which, the case was presented in the court below. Appellant having stipulated that consideration of its exceptions “had best lie back behind the determination of whether there is going to be any fund from which [they] could be paid” cannot now complain that the court below failed to adjudicate the same and thereby preclude finality of the decree. Furthermore, the claim comes too late —approximately nine years after appellant was appointed substituted trustee, during which time no affirmative steps were taken by it to establish a preferred claim in the trust fund, nor was any claim of that nature made prior to June 30,1943..</p>

The latter statute gives priority of distribution to depositors and makes no reference with regard to interest upon deposits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It is necessary, therefore, to apply the common-law rule permitting preferred depositors to receive interest upon their deposits.

The court below properly held that the remaining assets were to be applied to the payment of interest accruing upon the deposits after the Receiver had assumed control of the Trust Company.

X of the Act of 1933, supra, which limits payment of interest upon deposits to that accruing prior to the date that the Receiver enters into possession,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> impliedly recognized that interest was unrestricted theretofore.
