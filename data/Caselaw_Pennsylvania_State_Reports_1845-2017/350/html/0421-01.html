After a hearing the court reduced the assessment by $110,700. The assessment was fixed at $1,800,000 — land at $1,350,000 and building $450,000. The two preceding triennial assessments have been litigated. For 1937-39 the assessment was fixed at $1,985,060: <em>Park’s Appeal, </em>supra. For 1940-42 (not appealed to this Court) it was $1,921,060.</p>

Qualified experts testified for both sides and gave the reasons for their opinion as to value. The testimony was reviewed and weighed by the hearing judge who, in a carefully considered adjudication, made his findings of fact. There is no basis for the owner’s contention that the learned hearing judge substituted his <em>individual </em>ideas as to market value in disregard of the testimony; His findings were reached after carefully reviewing and weighing all the evidence. We are not impressed by the argument of the owner that his witnesses were so superior in quality and experience that they overwhelmed the single expert of the county and city and presented a preponderance of evidence, <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>which greatly outweighed that of the county and city. It appears that sales, holding prices, rental value, return and many other factors were testified to by the various witnesses. All this evidence was apparently considered by the learned court in arriving at a fair market value for the purpose of fixing the assessment. We find no ground for setting aside the assessment.</p>
