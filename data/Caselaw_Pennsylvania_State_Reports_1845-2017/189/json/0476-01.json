Bright his bond and mortgage for the sum of $5,200; that the mortgage was duly recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Allegheny county, and the bond was in the possession of the said Mary A. Bright up until, as far as petitioner can understand, June 10, 1898, when she assigned the same to Anide L.

Bright was then living, in order to ascertain from her whether or not a notice which the petitioner had received from Annie L. Knorr a couple of weeks before to the effect that she had purchased the mortgage was correct, and to inform her that the petitioner was ready to pay six months\u2019 interest to the proper person as soon as the said Mary A.

Bright and the said Annie L.
