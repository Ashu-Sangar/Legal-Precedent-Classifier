Appeal of Susan Israel.\nWills\u2014Vested and contingent estates\u2014\u201c Descendants.\"\nTestator bequeathed a fund in money to a trustee for the use of his nieces A. and B. \u201cto pay to each of them one-half of the interest on the investments as it accrues during life and on the death of either, one moiety of the principal to be paid to her child or children, failing which her interest in the trust to pass to her sister or to her descendants in case of her death.\u201d Both A. and B. died without leaving child or other issue surviving. Meld, that upon the death of B. the whole trust fund fell into the testator\u2019s general estate.\nArgued Jan. 19, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 332, Jan. T., 1898, by Susan Israel, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., Jan. T., 1881, No 309, dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nBefore Stebbett, C. J., Gkeen, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that Lewis Wain died in 1863, leaving a will by which he provided, inter alia, as follows:\n\u201cI give, bequeath and devise to the Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Live and granting annuities the sum of Ten thousand dollars in trust to invest the same in well secured Mortgages on Real Estate in the City of Philadelphia or in Loans of the said City or of the State of Pennsylvania for the use of my niece Susan Israel paying to her the interest on the investment as it accrues during her life and the principal to her sisters Phoebe W. Bell and Mary L. Smith share and share alike at her death in case of her leaving no lineal descendants otherwise the principal to be paid to her child or children and in case of the death of Phoebe W. Bell or of Mary L. Smith before that of Susan Israel then the share of the said decedent to be paid to her child or children failing which to be paid to her sister if living or in case of her death to her descendant or descendants.\n\u201c I give bequeath and devise to the above mentioned company the sum of Ten Thousand dollars in Trust to invest the same in the above mentioned securities for the use of my nieces Phoebe W. Bell and Mary L. Smith and to pay to each of them one half of the interest on the investments as it accrues during life and on the death of either, one moiety of the principal to be paid to her child or children failing which her interest in the Trust to pass to her sister or to her descendants in case of her death.\u201d\nMary L. Smith died December 26,1895 ; Phoebe W. Bell died March 16, 1898; neither left husband nor descendants. Mrs. Bell\u2019s will made the appellant, Susan Israel, her residuary legatee.\nSusan Israel made claim to the fund given to the trustee for the use of Phoebe W. Bell and Mary L. Smith.\nThe auditing judge, Ashman, J., refused to allow the claim, and awarded it to other legatees in order to make good the bequests to them.\nExceptions to the adjudication were dismissed, Penrose, J., filing the following opinion:\nIt is conceded, as it must be, that the original limitation to the beneficiaries under the present trust was but a life estate. Their interest, being equitable, could not coalesce with gifts over of the legal estate to descendants, even if the word \u201c descendants \u201d be regarded as the equivalent of heirs of the body (Bacon\u2019s Appeal, 57 Pa. 504), but \u201c descendants,\u201d at most, is only the equivalent of \u201c issue \u201d which, when used with reference to personalty, is a word of purchase: Myers\u2019s Appeal, 49 Pa. Ill; Hawkins on Wills, 197.\nIt is contended, however, that at the death of one of the cestuis que trust without descendants the other, under the terms of the will, became additionally entitled to one half of the principal, previously held in trust for the one so dying, absolutely; and, undoubtedly, at the death of either, having children, one half of the principal is to go to them. But at the death of either without children, or as the will expressed it, \u201c failing which,\u201d the survivor is to receive, not one half of the principal but, \u201c the interest in the trust \u201d of the one so dying, in other words, the entire income of the trust estate instead of the half only as originally given, the entire principal in that event going at her death to her descendants. The distinction between the half of the principal given to children and \u201cher interest in the trust\u201d passing to the other cestui que trust was clearly in the mind of the testator.\nAs the will fails to provide for the contingency which has occurred of the death of both without descendants, the trust fund falls into the general estate and becomes applicable to the payment of other pecuniary legacies, in the, order prescribed, with interest, so far as they have not already been paid in full, the surplus, if any, going to the residuary legatees.\nExceptions dismissed.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nThomas Learning, for appellant.\nNo paper-book filed nor argument offered for appellee.\nJanuary 30, 1899:"
