        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nIt appeared at the trial that the plaintiff at the time he was injured was employed by the defendant company to deliver oil to retail dealers. He drove a pair of mules which had been owned by the company and used in its business for a number of years. He was an experienced driver, but had had charge of this team only four or five days. In the afternoon, after having returned to the stable and cleaned the mules, he went into the stall for the purpose of leading one of them to the blacksmith shop. As he took hold of the halter the mule threw its head around, struck the plaintiff and knocked him down, and then struck and kicked him.\nAs it was not shown that the mule had before injured or attempted to injure any one or that it had manifested in any way a vicious disposition, there was nothing in the testimony to warrant a recovery, and the judgment of nonsuit should stand unless it appears that offers of testimony were improperly rejected.\nFor the purpose of showing that the mule was vicious, an offer was made to prove by a witness called that one of the mules of the team prior to the kicking of the plaintiff had kicked and injured another driver. This was the whole offer. It was not proposed to show the time when or the circumstances under which the injury was inflicted, or which mule had done it. Indeed, it was stated in connection with the offer that no one knew which mule had kicked the other driver. It may require but little to establish the vicious disposition of a mule, but unless it is to be taken wholly for granted there must be some basis for a reasonable inference, and in this offer we see none. A mule may kick under circumstances which do not indicate a vicious disposition generally, as in case of sudden fright, or under provocation when teased, or in consequence of careless management. That it had kicked some months or years before, or when untrained, would not be reason for the inference of continued viciousness. The fact that one of the pair had kicked, which one not being shown, would not justify the conclusion that both were vicious, or that the injury had been inflicted by the one which had kicked a driver before.\nThe offers to prove that the company\u2019s manager had been told that the team was unsafe fixed no time with reference to the plaintiff\u2019s injury when the communication was made, except that it was within two years thereof. It was not proposed to show that any facts were stated to him, but the mere opinion of a witness, not that the mules were vicious, but that they were unsafe. They might have been unsafe in many ways, as the result of timidity or want of training, without showing any indication of either general viciousness or a disposition to injure any one when in their stalls.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "C. A. Weigand, Appellant, v. Atlantic Refining Company, a Corporation of Pennsylvania.\nNegligence\u2014Master and servant\u2014Vicious mule\u2014Evidence.\nIn an action by an employee against his employer to recover damages for personal injuries sustained from a kick of a mule, there is no error in excluding an offer of the plaintiff to show that one of the mules of the team prior to the kicking of the plaintiff had kicked and injured another driver, without any offer to show the time when, or the circumstances under which, the injury was inflicted, or by which mule it had been done. It is also proper to reject an offer to prove that the defendant\u2019s manager had been told that the team was unsafe, where it is not accompanied by an offer to show the time, with reference to the plaintiff\u2019s injury, when the communication was made, except that it was within two years thereof or in what respect the team was unsafe.\nArgued. Nov. 11, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 215, Oct. T., 1898, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., July T., 1897, No 401, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Green, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries caused by the kick of a mule. Before Frazer, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on March 1, 1897, the plaintiff, whose business was that of a driver of teams, entered the employ of the defendant company as driver of a team of mules, known as \u201cMoreland team,\u201d used in delivering oil to retail dealers in what is known as a tank wagon; that some time previous to his employment to drive \u201c Moreland team,\u201d he had been in defendant\u2019s employ as a driver of a tank wagon for a short time, first as a driver of a team of mules and afterwards of a team of horses; that the \u201c Moreland team \u201d had been used by the defendant in its tank wagon service for a number of years previous to March 1,1897; that plaintiff cleaned the mules, put the harness on them, \u201chooked them up\u201d and drove them on the 1st, 2d, 3d and 4th days of March; that on the afternoon of March 4, plaintiff went into the stall for the purpose of taking the \u201coff-side\u201d mule to the blacksmith shop to be shod; that when he took hold of the halter the mule threw up her head, striking plaintiff, knocking him down and trampling and kicking Mm on the left side of the body and face, injuring him to such an extent as to require his confinement and treatment in the West Penn Hospital for twenty-six days, and also treatment for some time after leaving the hospital; that he went to work again for defendant on May 11, and continued in its employment until May 81, 1897, when he left its service voluntarily. The plaintiff offered to prove that some time within two years before the injury to plamtiff, one of the mules of the \u201cMoreland team\u201d kicked a young man named Bowman, who was at the time driving the team, breaking Bowman\u2019s leg, but neither the time nor circumstances under which the injury to Bowman was inflicted was included in the offer.\nWhen Percy Moreland, a witness called by plaintiff, was on the stand, plaintiff offered to prove by him that he drove the team or span of mules owned by the Atlantic Company, and that he stated to Mr. Noble, who had absolute charge and control of a distinct branch of the company\u2019s business, that this team or span of mules was unsafe, and that Mr. Noble replied that he \u201c could not help that, they had them and had to use them.\u201d\nDefendant objected to the offer as incompetent and irrelevant, the evidence so far being that the plaintiff was injured by the off-side mule.\nBy the Court: Objection sustained. Your position might be correct if this team ran off and this man was injured. Exception and bill sealed for plaintiff. [4]\nPlaintiff offered to prove by this witness that one of these mules, prior to March 4, 1897, had kicked and broken the leg of one Edward Bowman.\nBy the Court: Which one of the mules ?\nBy Mr. Hudson, of counsel, for plaintiff: Nobody knows. Mr. Bowman don\u2019t know, nor anybody else.\nDefendant objected to the offer as incompetent and irrelevant, for the reason that any evidence tending to show that any other person was kicked by the other mule is not competent in this case, and for the reason that the evidence so far shows that the plaintiff was injured by the off-side mule, and any evidence showing that either of these mules prior to this time had kicked any other person, without distMctly showing that it was the off-side mule which kicked the plaintiff, is incompetent and irrelevant.\nBy the Court: Objection sustained. We cannot hold other mules responsible for what the off-side mule did. Exception and bill sealed for plaintiff. [5]\nMr. Moreland recalled by plaintiff. By Mr. Hudson: I now make the following offer. I propose to prove by this witness, since the examination of Edward Bowman, who was kicked by one of these mules prior to March 4, 1897, Bowman stating that he thought the off mule kicked him, although he couldn\u2019t testify positively\u2014I propose to prove that witness had a conversation with Mr. Noble, in which he stated to Mr. Noble that the mules were unsafe, and that Mr. Noble replied, \u201cthey had them, and they had to use them,\u201d this conversation occurring the morning after the mule kicked Bowman.\nDefendant objected to the offer as incompetent and irrelevant.\nBy the Court: Exception and bill sealed for plaintiff. [6]\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off. [3]\nErrors assigned among others were (3) in not taking off non-suit ; (4-6) rulings on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions.\nW. A.

Seifert, 116 Pa. 628.\nA single act done by the animal to the knowledge of the owner is sufficient to render him liable for subsequent similar injuries done by the animal: Smith v.
