      <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>The claim in this case is for commission upon the sale of real estate, made by the plaintiff as agent, upon which judgment was entered in default of appearance and affidavit of defense. The application was promptly made, and the circumstances would justify the opening of the judgment if a good defense were shown. We think, however, that the plaintiff would be entitled to judgment on the affidavit as filed. The defendant admits that he “gave” plaintiff permission to sell said property for the price of $50,000, and if plaintiff should effect and consummate the sale thereof, he, the defendant, would allow him a commission of two per cent out of the proceeds of the sale thereof. He does not deny that the plaintiff did procure a person, to wit: Henry S. Stewart, who was willing to exchange lands held by him for the lot belonging to the defendant, and admits that he entered into a written agreement with Stewart for the purchase of the same for which he gave his check to Hippie for $500; that the next day Stewart requested defendant to release him from the agreement, and on defendant’s refusal Stewart stopped payment on the check. Upon this statement of the facts it is clear that the plaintiff had performed his part of the contract, and that it is still within the power of the defendant to enforce his agreement with Stewart, which upon argument it was alleged, and not denied, that he is attempting to do by action now pending against Stewart: Keys v.
