At one of these conversations notes were produced and were handed to and examined by the defendant. The witness who testified to this conversation said that she knew of the existence of the notes in suit; that they were handed to and examined by the defendant at this conversation, and that he said: “ Mother, these notes are all right. You shall have them. I will pay you on the first of the year. I cannot pay you before.” The witness further testified that the notes so produced and examined at this conversation were the notes in suit. Upon cross-examination, however, she admitted that she did not read the notes which were handed to the defendant at the time of the conversation, but that later in the day her mother showed them to her. The witness to the other conversation was J. Frank Melloy, defendant’s partner, who testified that the plaintiff came to the store of the firm and said to the defendant that she came for her money, and defendant said, “ What money? ” and plaintiff said, “The notes,” and defendant then said, “I haven’t any money,” and plaintiff then said, “ When will I get it ? ” and defendant said, “ In three weeks.”</p>

They are, however, barred by what we call the statute of limitation, and they could not be sued upon unless there is testimony in the case which takes it out of the operation of that statute. In all these cases if you claim a sum of money which is barred by the statute you must prove that there was a subsequent acknowledgment and promise to pay that debt. Of course, a man cannot make a general promise to pay all his debts. That would not be considered sufficient to take it out of the bar of the statute. [The point made by the defendant in this case is that in this evidence <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>these notes were not sufficiently identified as the notes in regard to which the conversation took place between the son and his mother on the two occasions which have been testified to; one occasion in the presence of the daughter, and the other in the presence of her son.

If you find that these promises were not made as to these identical notes, your verdict should be for the defendant.] [3]</p>
