It appeared that plaintiffs were considerably annoyed at times by the offensive odors, not given forth by the furnace itself, but which arose from the garbage before being placed in the furnace. The furnace was of the best and most approved construction. The evidence showed that other industrial establishments on the river bank contributed to some extent to the annoyance. The furnace was operated under a contract with the city, and the site of it had been selected by the city authorities. The evidence tended to show that the site was probably the best for the purpose anywhere within, or in the neighborhood of, the city. The court refused to enjoin the operation of the furnace, but decreed that the garbage should be placed in the furnace as soon as possible, and that the residuum should be shipped off as speedily as possible. <em>Held, </em>that the decree was a proper one under the circumstances.</p>

The plant cost, in its original construction, and in the repairs and changes that have been made, well on to $100,000. There are fourteen digesters, as they are called, in which the garbage is boiled. As originally constructed, these were not tight, and a great deal of odor and gas escaped from them. There was no mode at first of deodorizing and destroying these gases and odors; they were conducted by a pipe down towards the river, escaped, and were quite offensive, down on the river bank: and up on the bluff. A change was made, by which the digesters were made air-tight, by lids on the top, after the garbage was put in, before the boiling process began; the offensive odors and gases were conducted under a vacuum to what is called an incinerating furnace, by which they were either destroyed or deodorized, the pulpy material was conducted into what is called a “ dryer, ” and the dry residuum obtained from that dryer. At first this residuum was converted into fertilizing material at the garbage furnace, and, in the process of converting it into fertilizer, some chemicals were used, which were themselves offensive and increased the bad odors. When the change was made, in the summer of 1896, they ceased to convert this residuum into fertilizers, and obtained some place up in one of the adjoining counties to which the residuum is shipped, and there converted into fertilizers. From eighty to one hundred tons of garbage are hauled to this furnace every day, except Sunday. No garbage is hauled on Sunday, and the works are never run on the Sabbath day. About 120 barrels of the residuum are obtained every day and shipped off on the cars; no offensive vapors or gases from the digesters, during the boiling process, if kept closed, can escape into the building, and the gases conducted through the incinerating furnace are there either destroyed or deodorized, so that they are not offen<a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>sive, and any smells that may ascend to the bluff are not from the gases or vapor arising during the boiling process.

In the establishment, since the change in 1896, fans have been used, expelling from the building all the air and escaping gases, out into the atmosphere, so that in the building itself there are no offensive odors at any time, except when the fresh garbage is brought in. The garbage is brought in and put into a pit, where foreign substances, like bottles, cans and things of that kind, are picked out, and it is then conducted by a conduit up to the digester, and put into the digester. When the garbage remains in the pit for any length of time, an hour or so, there is a very considerable quantity of offensive odors escaping from that garbage. They go into the building and are expelled from the building into the atmosphere by the fans.</p>

      <em>5. </em>There is occasionally on the bluff an offensive odor from the establishment. It does not arise from the boiling process; does not arise from the dry residuum that comes out. It comes from the offensive odors from the garbage, before it is put into the digester; and, by being driven out of the building with the warm air in the building, when the wind is blowing from the furnace towards the bluff these offensive odors are occasionally quite distinct and manifest on the bluff. There are other large factories and establishments along the river, on both sides of the river, that contribute to the offensive gases or odors up on the bluff when the wind is blowing in that direction. In June of 1896 a large amount of garbage and refuse, consisting of partially burned canned goods and groceries, from the wholesale grocery establishment of T. C. Jenkins &amp; Co., that was destroyed by fire, was hauled by wagon loads, and dumped out on a portion of the railroad yard near this factory. That remained there on the ground giving out a fearful stench for some weeks, and it no doubt affected the offensive odors upon the bluff during that time.</p>

The witnesses who testified for the plaintiffs, living on the bluff, attributed all the offensive smells and odors up there to this garbage furnace, and some of them, who kept records of <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>the days when it was so very offensive, spoke about its being on some Sabbath days, and testified that the vapors came out of the smoke stack of the furnace, and that the garbage furnace was working on that day. They were mistaken, because the factory never was worked on the Sabbath day, and the odors and gases that escaped after passing through the incinerating furnace did not enter the smokestack, but escaped through a separate pipe at the top of the building. Some of them also testified that their imaginations contributed to their sensations from these escaping vapors.</p>

If the garbage is not permitted to remain in the pit after it is hauled, but is at once conducted into the digesters, there would be little or no offensive odor in the building, or that could escape from the building. The evidence would indicate that at some times garbage was permitted to remain in the pit for two or three hours, perhaps sometimes even longer than that. During that time the offensive odors would accumulate in the buildings, and the fans would expel them from the buildings, and, with the heated air, they would rise up to the bluff, when the wind was in that direction. This accounts for the offensive odors occasionally noticed by those on the bluff, and, if the process should be remedied in these respects there would be little, if any, offensive odor or gas escaping from the building up to the bluff.</p>

The location of this garbage furnace is, perhaps, in the most unobjectionable place that could be selected within the city limits. There is no evidence to the contrary. In selecting a place for a garbage furnace, a reasonable discretion must be allowed to the city authorities. There is no doubt that a garbage furnace anywhere may be to some extent a nuisance to citizens in that locality. As one witness in the case testified, the very thought of a garbage furnace will be an annoyance. So any large establishment, factory, rolling mill, furnace, glass works, and all these other large establishments, will be, to a certain extent, an annoyance to property holders in the immediate vicinity, and, in many cases, may even depreciate the value of property in the vicinity. These inconveniences and annoyances that some citizens may suffer are simply the incidents resulting from the growth and business of a large city. This furnace is constructed on the most scientific principles, and is far superior to ordinary garbage furnaces. The bluff where these complainants live was, some years ago, probably the most delightful place about the city for residences, overlooking the Monongahela river and the hills beyond, a high bluff bank, almost <em>perpendicular; </em>but, in the growth of the city, factories and furnaces have been established along the bank of the river, and no doubt will increase with the years, and the smoke from these, the noise, the steam, the smells, and the offensive odors from them, will affect the bluff as a place of residence. But, the onward march of the business of the city cannot be arrested because it may be an annoyance to some of those living on the bluff. In the course of a few years it will not be, perhaps, a desirable place for residences. It is just like many other portions of the city; years ago, the lower part of the city, on Penn avenue, was the most delightful portion of the ciiy for residences. In consequence of the large iron establishments and others, it has almost ceased to be a place of residence; property for residences has depreciated in value, and the desirable places for residences are out in the suburbs <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>annoyed some little by tbe fact that a garbage furnace is down on the bank, and, some little annoyed, perhaps by the hot air that escapes from the building, does not make this a public nuisance. The offensive odors on the bluff arose from the garbage remaining too long in the pit. If the garbage brought into this furnace should be, at once, put into the digesters, and they kept tight, I believe there would be no offensive odors escaping from the garbage even in the building, and none, of course, to any appreciable extent, could extend up the bluff.</p>

If, at the end of that period of time, only a year or so hence, this factory should be found to be a nuisance, the city authorities will not continue it, or, if they attempt to continue it then, there may be an effort made to stop it. It cannot be continued without the consent of councils and the mayor. It will not be any serious injury to these complainants to let this factory run on for the length of time provided for under the present contract, if the garbage be at once put into the digesters. Of course the city cannot authorize or sanction a public nuisance. Under the testimony of the director of the department of public safety and the officers of the bureau of health, I do not feel authorized to suppress this garbage furnace at this time, which would result, of course, in a great loss to the defendant. If the causes of the offensive odors, as stated in my findings, cannot be removed, it will be the duty of the director of the department of public safety and of the officers of the bureau of health to stop this furnace, because the ordinance requires it to be conducted in a sanitary manner. It is their duty to visit it frequently, inspect it, and hear any complaints of the citizens on the subject ; and, unless it can be conducted in a manner that will not be offensive to the neighborhood, or to the complainants living on the bluff, it would not be proper for the director of the department of public safety to renew this contract with the defendant, but he should make some other provision for disposing of the garbage of the city.</p>
