The two water companies received their charters upon the same day, and recorded them upon the same day. The Penn Water Company was authorized to supply water to Braddock township, and the Pennsylvania Water Company was authorized to supply water to the Sterrett township, which adjoins Braddock. On August 10, 1888, the Penn Water Company, assuming to act under the provisions of the act of April 17, 1876, conveyed its franchises and property to the Pennsylvania Water Company. It is therefore the Pennsylvania Water Company, claiming the franchises of <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>the Penn Company, that is here contesting with Braddock borough as to the right to supply water. As the case proceeded, doubt was suggested as to the right of the Penn Company to transfer its franchises to the other company, but this point was not pressed upon the argument, and the right to thus merge the two companies seems to be now conceded by counsel for the borough. Under these circumstances, we will assume that the Pennsylvania Company has, as to Braddock township, all the rights which the Penn Company would have had if no consolidation had been effected.!</p>

Beginning at about the time of the recording of the charters, i. e., early in May, 1888, some surveys were made by Mr. J. H. Harlow, one of the promoters of the enterprise, and now the president of the Pennsylvania Company. But no other work was done until after the merger or consolidation. In February, 1889, property in Penn township, on a hill overlooking the Allegheny river, was purchased as a site for a reservoir’, and in the same month a contract with Mr. J. H. Harlow to build the works was executed by the Pennsylvania Company. Pipes were laid from the reservoir through Penn and Sterrett townships to Braddock township. The first pipes were laid in Braddock township in March, 1889, and water was turned into the pipes in the autumn of 1889. Since that date the company has extended its system, laid a large amount of pipe, reaching the vicinity of Braddock borough with its pipe line early in 1890, is increasing the capacity of its works, and seems to have used due diligence in providing for the supply of water to the citizens of Braddock township.</p>

The request was renewed in February, 1897, permission being asked to open the streets after April 16,1897, and the request was refused. On April 20,1897, the company commenced to lay its line on said Corey avenue, when the borough of Braddock filed the bill in this case.</p>

In this connection attention is called to the fact that after the issuing of letters patent, March 18, 1887, and before the <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>recording of the same, May 3, 1888, to wit: on June 2, 1887, P. L. 310, the corporation act of 1874 was so amended that water companies created thereunder do not secure exclusive franchises. See Luzerne Water Co. v. Toby Creek Water Co., <a href="/pa/148/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="148 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="981878" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0568-01">148 Pa. 568</a>.</p>

If it began at the former date, then the water company now defending took under its charter and the transfer from the other company the exclusive right to furnish water to Braddock township, and would still retain that right even as to the portion of that township which has been annexed to the borough. While the borough of Braddock would, even in that case, doubtless, have the right to continue to furnish water to parties outside the borough where contracts were made under the act of 1885, before March 18, 1887, as long as the parties who had contracted with it chose to take the water, no definite term having been fixed in any of the contracts. Its subsequent contracts would give it no rights with respect to the furnishing of water within the limits of Braddock township. If, however, the corporate existence began May 3, 1888, when the articles of association, etc., were recorded, then the water companies did not take an exclusive franchise, and whilst they, or the surviving one, would have the right to furnish water to the Copeland district, now fourth ward of Braddock, it could not exclude the borough as a supplier of water either from that district or from the other districts involved in this controversy. We do not regard the question as to when the corporations began to exist as such, as open for discussion. It was settled by the case of G-uckert v. Hacke et ah, <a href="/pa/159/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="159 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="850147" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0303-01">159 Pa. 303</a>. It is there said: <em>“ </em>It is plain from a cursory reading of the Act of April 29,1874, P. L. 73, that recording of the certificate <em>‘ </em>in the office for the recording of deeds in and for the county where the chief operations are to be carried on,’ was intended to be made one of the conditions precedent to corporate existence.” And if, as is there said in support of the conclusion, the exemption from personal liability is a matter of sufficient importance to call for the giving of notice by recording, with greater reason can we base an argument upon the importance of the charter provisions granting and defining the primary franchises of the <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>corporation. For almost eleven months after the amendment to section 34 of the corporation act of 1874, the promoters of this enterprise did nothing to indicate that they claimed any rights with respect to the furnishing of water to Braddock township, nothing even to indicate that they intended to accept the franchises offered them by the state. The importance of holding them strictly within the powers and privileges granted to them, is emphasized not only by the fact that they are now attempting to exclude a large borough, with a waterworks, from laying pipes in one of its own wards ; but also, by the fact that if the city of Pittsburg adds any more territory on the east, it will have no right to extend its water system to cover it, if the franchise contended for is exclusive. But we are told that the introductory sentence of clause 34, of the corporation act of 1874, provides that water companies, etc., “ incorporated under the provisions of this statute ” shall “ from the date of letters patent creating the same,” have the powers, etc., conferred by the succeeding clauses of section 34; and therefore as to these companies, whatever may be the rule as to other corporations, the franchises date from the issuing of the certificate. But this is a begging of the question. If, as is held in Guckert v. Hacke, these companies were not incorporated until May 3,1888, their privileges were defined by section 34 as it then stood, and at that time it conferred no exclusive franchise.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[143,1559,1175,602]]]'>We conclude that the parties plaintiff and defendant have the right to furnish water in the districts invol ved in this controversy; the defendant (the Pennsylvania Water Company) under its charter, and the borough of Braddock under contracts made by authority of the act of 1885 as to the districts still within Braddock township, and by virtue of its charter rights as to the Copeland district, now its fourth ward. The borough of Braddock should pay one half of the costs, and the Pennsylvania Water Company the other half.

This, we think, arose through a misapprehension of the sense in which the word existence is used in a dictum found in the opinion referred to, and taking it for an authority to the effect that the recording of the certificate, as required by the act of 1874, is a prerequisite to corporate existence in the sense of having corporate life; instead of gathering from the case that the recording is to be regarded as one of the lawful conditions of corporate existence, in the sense of living in the full observance of all the statute requires of corporations after their creation and as going concerns.</p>
