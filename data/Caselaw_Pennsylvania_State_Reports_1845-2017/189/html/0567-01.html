The plaintiff has been seriously injured and naturally we all sympathize with him, but his case is to be determined upon legal proofs. The doctrine of the law is that he takes the risks of the employment, and among those risks is the negligence of a fellow servant. It therefore becomes very important to know exactly what is the cause of the accident, and whether it is due to negligence and to whose negligence. Now in this case it is not shown at all how it was that this brake came to be broken. All we have before us is the evidence of the plaintiff that after he had made several revolutions of bis wheel he found that the chain was broken, but to what the break was due we cannot tell; it is amere conjecture. It may have been that the car was out of repair or it may have been that there was some de<a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>fects, some concealed defect in this brake, and that the revolution itself caused the break just at that moment, but this is entirely conjecture. The theory of the plaintiff appears to be that this was a case where there was a broken chain before the cars were inspected at Elizabethport, but there is no evidence to support that and nothing from which the inference can properly be drawn. I think, therefore, that the nonsuit will have to be entered.</p>
