The decedent died on November 11,1895. The check was never presented for payment at the bank, but continuously remained in plaintiff’s possession.

C. Euwer, in his lifetime, to the plaintiff, for the sum of $2,500. The check is dated November 4, 1893, and this action is against the administrator. The plaintiff asks, at your hands, for a verdict for the amount of the check, with interest from its date, namely, November 4, 1898. The plaintiff has produced the check, it having been in her possession since it was given. The possession of the cheek, and the giving of the check presumes an indebtedness on the part of the giver to the person to whom it is given. But, in addition to that, we have testimony here which shows what the consideration of this check was, what it was for, namely, boarding, attention and services rendered by the plaintiff to the decedent, Mr. Euwer.] [8] And we have the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff, showing the time and circumstances under <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>which it was given, and! the statement made by Mr. Euwer at the time it was given. ¡I refer to the testimony of «this young nephew of the plaintiff, Mr. Day, who says he was present in the house of Mrs. Ritchie at the time Mr. Euwer gave her this check. He says that Mr. Euwer stated at the time that he had never paid her anything for the services mentioned, and that he proposed to do so now, and gave her the check. We have testimony of witnesses produced by the defense themselves, that shows that the decedent did stay or board for months at the house of the plaintiff. One of the witnesses said he was there in the year 1893 as much as seven months, according to his recollections; and another witness that he was there some five or six months, at any rate, in the years 1892 and 1893. So that we have not only the giving of the check and the statement of Mr. Euwer at the time of its giving, as to what the consideration was, but the possession of the check by the plaintiff, down to the time of the bringing of this suit, and she asks for a verdict at your hands for the amount of the check, with interest to the present time.</p>

But we have, in addition to that, the testimony of the witnesses, not only on behalf of the plaintiff herself, but the witnesses produced by the defense, showing good consideration for that check. We have no direct testimony on behalf of the defense showing a failure of consideration. [It is claimed, however, by the counsel for the defense, that there is only service shown for a short time, not sufficient to make up the amount of this check, and he argues that you should not allow the full amount of the check, because there was not consideration shown for the full amount. As I have stated, the testimony does tend to show a good consideration for the check, and the defense does not show to what extent there was a failure of consideration. They have not produced any testimony to show you to what extent there was a failure. They have not shown what the balance is, for which they claim there was a failure of consideration. In the absence of that the plaintiff would be entitled to your verdict for the whole amount.] [9] You will consider the whole testimony, and if you are satisfied that the check was given and received by the plaintiff under the cir<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>cuinstances as stated by her, and the consideration was as stated, you will find a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of the check, with interest.</p>
