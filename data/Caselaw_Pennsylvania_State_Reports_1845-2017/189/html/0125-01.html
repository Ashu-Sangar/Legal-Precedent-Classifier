Plaintiff did not comply with his agreement at the time and in the manner as therein provided, and long after the agreement had expired and long after defendant had declined to further negotiate for or purchase the same, plaintiff procured a conveyance for the lot which he tendered, and the defendant having notified the plaintiff that after his failure to furnish a proper deed within the time he declined to take the same.

Hippie &amp; Co., <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>exhibited to affiant a plot purporting to show the location of said lot and its relation to a certain roadway marked thereon known as “ Overlook Way.” Affiant asked said Charles E. Pope, who was present, how far the northwesterly line of the lot about to be purchased was located from the said “ Overlook Way,” there being no distances on the plan. Said Pope stated that at the rear end of the line the distance was from fifteen to twenty feet, and the plot showed that the said line where it intersected Darrah street was nearer to “ Overlook Way” than at the rear end of the lot. Affiant avers that the deed by which said Pope acquired title from Sampson, as he, affiant, afterwards learned through his attorney, located said northwesterly line very close to said roadway, and on a much steeper portion of the ground than the plan above referred to, and the statement of said Pope to affiant, indicated. And he, affiant, avers that said statement made by Pope, was not only untrue in fact, but misrepresented a material fact to affiant, because under the contract for the purchase of said lot, it appears that affiant was to accept the deed subject to certain restrictions, one of which was, that if the location of a building on the lot about to be purchased would interfere with said “ Overlook Way,” affiant was to build a retaining wall, and he avers that if said line had been as pointed out to him on, and indicated by, -the plan, no necessity for any such wall would likely have arisen.
