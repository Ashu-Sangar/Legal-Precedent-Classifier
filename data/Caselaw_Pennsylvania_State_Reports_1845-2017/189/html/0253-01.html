On one side of the road was a somewhat abrupt embankment and on the other was a declivity without guard rail or other protection. At the point where the accident occurred a number of cattle had gathered, one of which suddenly rising frightened the horse, and the occupants of the buggy were precipitated over the declivity.</p>

It follows that if there is enough in this case to show negligence in the defendant, there must necessarily be enough to show negligence on the part of the plaintiff. Nor were they under any necessity when they took the risk. It is <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>plain that the cow could have been easily removed either by driving directly towards it, or by the driver of the buggy alighting when he approached it, and going to his horse’s head.”</p>

The absence of a parapet or guard rail was not in any sense the proximate cause of the accident, though if one had been there the consequences might have been less serious. Even that however is entirely conjectural. But there was nothing in the occasion of the accident or the manner of its occurrence which the township could reasonably have been required to foresee and provide against. Further, if the township was bound to anticipate the conjuncture of circumstances which led to the accident, while they were in the future, and was negligent in not providing against their possible happening, the plaintiff must have been at least equally negligent in not guarding against them when they were present or imminent. But we prefer to rest the case on the absence of any sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of defendant.</p>
