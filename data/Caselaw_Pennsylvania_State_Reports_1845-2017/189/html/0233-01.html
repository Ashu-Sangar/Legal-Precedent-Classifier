Defendant averred that when the plaintiff was the owner of the stock, defendant was his creditor for a large amount, and also liable as his surety; that plaintiff was financially embarrassed and unable to carry the stock; that defendant then advanced his own money, took the stock, and made the company a success, and that he had no agreement to hold the stock in trust for plaintiff. The court below held that the answer was responsive to the bill and that plaintiff’s evidence was insufficient to overcome it. It also appeared that in proceedings which had been instituted by creditors to set aside the transfer to defendant, plaintiff had said nothing of the alleged agreement with defendant, and in his testimony in those proceedings, introduced in evidence in the equity suit, he swore that it was his purpose that the legal title should be in defendant because he wanted it where it could not be reached. <em>Held, </em>that the court below committed no error in dismissing the bill.</p>

Pursuant to plaintiff’s request, plaintiff and this defendant then endeavored to have the pledgees of said gas company stock carry out the plaintiff’s desire, with relation to taking said stock and operating said company as aforesaid, but said pledgees, after some weeks’ work by plaintiff and defendant, “refused so to do,” assigning as his reason therefor that it was necessary to the defendant’s answer, and to any color of credibility of his assumption of what followed, that he should allege, as he did, most positively, that the other pledgees of the stock “ refused ” to go into the arrangement admittedly agreed upon between defendant and Hukill. There is no question that the parties did in the first place have a mutual understanding, as claimed by plaintiff, in regard to getting the pledgees of the gas stock to take the stock and operate the company; but it is equally clear, that from some cause or other (whether the pledgees merely declined, neglected or absolutely refused, is immaterial) the whole attempt failed, and the plan was abandoned by <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>both parties. The plaintiff in his bill says: “Yoder entered upon the undertaking, and after first, with the assistance of this complainant, making efforts to have the creditors holding said stock co-operate, then proposed to and offered this complainant to do it himself,” etc., to which this complainant assented. And defendant’s answer is that “ after some weeks’ effort by plaintiff and defendant, pledgees refused, and thereupon the plan to induce said pledgees to hold said stock and operate the company was finally and positively abandoned by both plaintiff and defendant.” And the evidence of both plaintiff and defendant clearly establishes the fact that the first plan was abandoned by mutual consent. Why it was abandoned does not seem to me to be a question of any importance in considering the merits of the cause. But assuming that it was a vital question, as claimed by plaintiff, I do not consider the evidence of Mr. Steinmeier, the cashier of the Third National Bank, that defendant did not attempt to make the arrangement he claims he did with him so distinct and certain as to throw such discredit upon defendant’s answer as would justify the court in disregarding it as false.</p>

The latter company and plaintiff <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>individually were heavily in debt, and all his stock in the gas company was pledged as collateral for loans on notes which he could not meet. In this condition of affairs he applied to defendant to assist him, defendant at that time being a creditor to a considerable amount, and contingently liable to a still larger one as indorser for plaintiff. After some efforts to induce the pledgees of the gas company stock to unite in a plan to keep it together and sell the company plant as a whole, the defendant took it up. Without going into details, it is sufficient to quote the finding of the learned judge be.low, that “ the evidence of both plaintiff and defendant clearly establishes the fact that the first plan was abandoned by mutual consent.” Then as already said defendant took up the stock by advancing his own money or giving his notes, so that he became the legal owner of the stock, assumed the management of the company, and now after several years of effort has apparently made it profitable. So far the facts are uncontested, but at this point the plaintiff comes forward with his bill claiming that defendant acted throughout the transaction under an agreement that made him a trustee for plaintiff, and that he is now fraudulently holding the stock, etc., for his own benefit. This alleged agreement is the hinge of the case. It was denied by the defendant and the finding of the court below is that “ by an examination of defendant’s answer it will appear that every material averment of fact upon which plaintiff bases his claim and upon which he seeks to recover is clearly and distinctly denied by defendant, and we are of opinion that nothing has been shown by plaintiff which would justify the court in refusing to give it the ordinary effect of answers responsive to bills in equity. We are led to the conclusion that under the evidence the plaintiff has failed to establish his case by sufficient proof and that therefore his bill must be dismissed at his costs.” An examination of the evidence leads us to concur in this result; a review of the testimony would serve no useful purpose and we might well leave the case here.</p>

By the transactions in 1893, now in controversy, defendant became practically possessed of all the plaintiff’s property, and this result was not allowed to go unchallenged by the latter’s creditors. Suits were brought against plaintiff with defendant as <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>garnishee to set aside the transfers of stock as in fraud of creditors. One of them reached this Court, Davis v. Yoder, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20Pa.%20138" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="178 Pa. 138">178 Pa. 138</a>. In none of these was the agreement now set up as the basis of this suit asserted or even admitted. On the contrary it was positively domed by defendant and either denied or studiously concealed by plaintiff. But without discussing the evidence in those cases, though the records or the portions of them containing plaintiff’s testimony were put in evidence in this suit, it is sufficient to advert to the plaintiff’s own admission in this case as to the nature of the transaction. He was asked: “ Q. Up to the time you were turned out of office, you and your son, did Mr. Yoder ever intimate, or claim to you that he proposed to take or appropriate the stock to himself? A. Oh, no, no, if he had he wouldn’t have got it. I supposed of course that the legal title was passing from me into Mr. Yoder, that I intended, because I wanted it where nobody could reach it, I wanted to put it in that shape where I could say that the legal title was in him and not in me, because we wanted it where it couldn’t be reached.” This answer alone is enough to turn plaintiff out of a court of equity. Assuming it to be true it shows that the transaction between plaintiff and defendant was a scheme to hinder and defraud the former’s creditors, and equity will not assist him to get his share of the plunder.</p>
