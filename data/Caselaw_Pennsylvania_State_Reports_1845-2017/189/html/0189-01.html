They also acted as jobbers and dealers. They both purchased and sold goods for the defendant company, and sold goods to and purchased them from said company. For some eighteen months prior to November, 1896, Dickson &amp; Kerr, in the course of their numerous dealings with defendant, had received orders for various small lots of goods, such as the present orders, which they (D. &amp; K.) then purchased from plaintiff, who did business in Philadelphia. These goods were shipped direct from plaintiff’s works to defendant, consigned to defendant, the shipping receipt being sometimes given in the name of plaintiff and sometimes in that of Dickson &amp; Kerr. Dickson &amp; Kerr paid plaintiff for them and sold them to defendant. At the beginning of November, 1896, the book showed a balance in favor of defendant as against Dickson &amp; Kerr, on their various transactions, of about $1,500. During November and December, 1896, defendant gave Dickson &amp; Kerr four orders for iron cocks. Dickson &amp; Kerr ordered goods to the amount of these several orders from plaintiff directing that they be charged to defendant. Plaintiff shipped the goods direct to defendant, one order on December 10, 1896, two on December 81, 1896, and one on January 22, 1897. The goods arrived in Pittsburg (part of them at Toledo, Ohio), within a day or two after shipment, and on January 7 or 8,1897, defendant was notified by an invoice of the goods then shipped, received from plaintiff, through Dickson &amp; Kerr, that the goods had been charged directly to defendant. At the time of this notice the fourth order had not yet been shipped, and part of the others were probably yet in the hands of the railroad company, the balance being in defendant’s warehouse. Defendant, while it insisted that the purchase had been made from Dickson &amp; Kerr, and not from plaintiff, retained the goods shipped, and called for the filling by plaintiff of the unshipped order.</p>

The present suit is for the price of these four bills. When these goods were bought and shipped, plaintiff did not know that Dickson «fe Kerr were indebted to defendant, and he acted in the matter in good faith. Nothing was said upon the subject, but plaintiff intended to pay Dickson &amp; Kerr the usual commission for making the sale to defendant. Defendant gave to Dickson «fe Kerr nothing on the faith of these orders. It is conceded that plaintiff can recover, unless the price of the goods has been applied upon an account to which it is legally applicable. The goods were those of plaintiff. Defendant seeks to apply them to the payment of the debt of Dickson &amp; Kerr. As one cannot be directly divested of the title to his property without his assent, so the same object cannot be attained by applying the price of one man’s property to the payment of another’s debt.</p>

Clagett, 2 Smith’s Leading Cases, 118, and certainly never was intended to cover every ease where an agent sells without giving the name of his principal. The estoppel is based not upon the act of the agent, but upon the act of the principal. George v. Clagett was explained by Baring v. Corrie, 2 Barn. &amp; Ald. 137, where the distinction is taken between a factor and a broker. Mochem on Agency, sec. 773, states the rule as follows, viz.:</p>

Corrie than it is like the case of George v. Clagett, and in fact the equities in favor of the set-off were greater in Baring v. Corrie than they are in the present case. Frame v. Coal Co. may seem in some respects to go slightly further than George v. Clagett, but still even if the coal was shipped directly to the purchaser by the coal company, the transaction was fully completed in the name of Pollock &amp; Medler, and in fact seems to have been really a sale by the coal company to Pollock &amp; Medler. It was at all events a case in which the coal company intended to and did authorize Pollock &amp; Medler to deal with the coal as their own, and hence was estopped to question the set-off. In the present case, plaintiff, on Dickson &amp; Kerr’s representation that they had made a sale for plaintiff to defendant, shipped directly and gave notice before defendant had changed its position.</p>

The goods were not furnished on this contract, but on a contract purporting to make defendant the immediate purchaser from plaintiff, and if defendant, upon being informed of the facts, did not wish to stand to this contract, it was for it to refuse to do so. Plaintiff had shipped the goods to defendant as a purchaser and certainly had no option to take them back, if defendant desired to keep them, even if Dickson &amp; Kerr had reported a sale which had not at the time been actually made. No goods had in fact been furnished by plaintiff on the contract between defendant and Dickson &amp; Kerr, and the option as to ratification of the contract on which they were furnished lay wholly with defendant.</p>

This certainly cannot be successfully maintained. Nor do we think that there is any greater reason for allowing the other goods to be so appropriated.

A to B without the buyer’s knowledge and consent.. And even if it turns out that A was all the time only agent for B as an undisclosed principal, yet B’s rights under the contract will be limited by the rights which the buyer has in good faith acquired against A while dealing with him as principal: Frame v.

Dickson &amp; Kerr being in debt to defendant on the previous dealings, defendant had the right as against them to get its debt paid and the accounts balanced by ordering goods from them in the regular course of their prior business, and if the goods were sent, received and charged by defendant before knowledge of any other title than that of Dickson &amp; Kerr, the transaction was closed, and defendant was not liable to plaintiff.

Both claims were too broad. Defendant was right as to its original status on its order to Dickson &amp; Kerr, and as to all goods received, receipted for or credited to Dickson &amp; Kerr before notice of plaintiff’s title.
