On June 19,1896, she gave a check to the treasurer of the defendant company, payable to the order of the company, for $1,000, in advance payment of dues. The treasurer indorsed the check in the name of the company, and got the money from the bank, but never paid it over or accounted for it. He became a defaulter, and left the county.</p>

On that check no money could be obtained without the indorsement of some authorized officer of the association. In point of fact it was indorsed by the treasurer, and as he was the proper person to make such indorsement it cannot for a moment be doubted that the defendant was responsible for his act. The payment was therefore an actual and legitimate payment to the company. As a matter of course the plaintiff could not be held responsible for the defalcation of the treasurer.</p>
