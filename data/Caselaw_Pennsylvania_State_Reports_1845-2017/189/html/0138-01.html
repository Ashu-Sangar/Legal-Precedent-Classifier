There is a note about which there seems to be some tangle. A note was given for $150, I think, or $250, and I understand that Mr. Ahlers says that this was raised by erasing to $750. Whom was that note given to? A. There were several notes of $100 and $150. One is held by Samuel Crawford. I don’t remember the amount of this particular one—in the neighborhood of $150, I think. This note was altered, the figure 1 being changed into a 7. I telephoned to Mr. Ahlers that I wanted to see him, that the note was not large enough, and that I would have to have another one. He said he wouldn’t be over in town soon, as he had several engagements, and didn’t see how he could arrange it. I asked him if he would give me authority to change it; he said, yes, if I could fix it up so it would pass, to do so. The note was in blank, the figures were simply there. I changed the 1 to a 7, and changed it by his authority. The name of the Ahlers Lumber Company was then on the back. I got value received from Mr. Crawford for that $750 note. Then there were several Wheeler notes that the amounts were changed in precisely the same manner. These notes bore William Ahlers’s indorsement when they were changed. They were not changed in his presence. . I telephoned him about them. He told me to change them through the telephone. He was never present when the notes were changed. On several occasions when I could meet him I got him to write out new notes, but on several occasions when I couldn’t arrange to meet him I changed them with his authority.”</p>

On such an issue all the authorities agree that the door should he opened wide to all evidence tending to throw light on the transaction. It is true that in general it is not competent to <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>prove an act, and especially a criminal offense, by evidence of a similar act at a different time, though such evidence may be strongly corroborative of the probability of the act or offense charged. But where the acts are connected as parts of a plan or scheme of fraud, the rule that excludes evidence is relaxed. In relation to the exact question here raised, the proof of forgery of a note by proof of forgery of other notes of the same kind under similar circumstances, at or near the same time, the authorities appear to sustain the competency of the evidence. The subject was very carefully considered by Judge Thayer in Penna. Co. for Ins., etc., v. R. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=158%20Pa.%20160" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="158 Pa. 160">158 Pa. 160</a>, and his opinion adopted by this Court. The offers of evidence in the first, fourth and fifth assignments of error tended to show that Cowan, “ the maker of the notes in suit, had in his possession notes of small amounts, with genuine accommodation indorsements of defendant upon them, and at or near the same time passed to the plaintiff similar notes, with what purported to be defendant’s indorsement, but for much larger amounts, which defendant denied having executed in that condition.” In addition, the offers included a card, testified to being in Cowan’s writing, showing practice in changing figures in the very manner charged by the defendant as having been done here. These offers tended to show a scheme on the part of Cowan to get defendant’s indorsements on notes of small amounts, and then raise the amounts by alteration of the figures before passing them to his creditors, and particularly to the plaintiff. The evidence therefore bore on the issue, and should have been admitted.</p>
