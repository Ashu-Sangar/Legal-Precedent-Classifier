Plaintiff’s statement set forth a policy for $5,000 taken out September 15,1891. The application for the policy was not included in the statement. Plaintiff averred that one of the express conditions of the policy was that twenty-five per cent of the mortuary premium paid during the period of fifteen years from its date should he added to the reserve fund and invested for the exclusive benefit of the members of the association; that the defendant, in violation of this stipulation, issued a new form of policy providing for the payment of “ disability claims, and pledging the reserve fund and other assets of the association for that purpose.”</p>

By resolutions duly adopted on January 29, 1896, by the board of directors, the form of certificate of membership was authorized. In pursuance thereof, from time to time since the date of the passage of said resolutions, certificates of membership have been issued in said form. Said form of certificate of membership is in conformity with the laws of the state of New York, and for the benefit of the members of the defendant association. Defendant denies that the issuance of certificates of membership in said form is violative of any provision in the certificate of membership issued by the defendant to the plaintiff. Defendant could at any time, <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>under the provisions of the various forms of certificate of membership issued by it, have compromised or settled its liability upon any terms which seemed to it expedient, with any members of defendant’s association. Defendant, in the clauses in the said certificate of membership providing for the payment of disability claims, merely stipulated that it would terminate its liability upon said certificate of membership upon the terms therein set out. Said provision is for the advantage of the defendant and of the continuing members of its association. The action of defendant, therefore, in issuing its certificates of membership in the form complained of by the plaintiff, is not only lawful but expedient and beneficial to the plaintiff. Plaintiff has, therefore, no ground of complaint against defendant, and is not entitled to the return to her of the dues, fees and mortuary assessments by her paid. Defendant therefore owes the plaintiff nothing at the present time.</p>
