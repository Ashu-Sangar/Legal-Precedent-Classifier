That the said company immediately organized and erected its plant, reservoir, laid mains, etc., and has been furnishing the citizens of Philipsburg with a full supply of pure fresh water from the waters of Cold Stream. The capital stock of the company was, when chartered, $30,000, and subsequently increased to $60,000. That the defendant company chartered January 19, 1897, proposes to take water from said stream, to supply the inhabitants of Philipsburg borough, and places adjacent thereto, and by so doing will irreparably injure the plaintiff’s plant by depriving it of a sufficient water supply for the purposes of its charter, etc., and pray that the defendant company may be perpetually enjoined from erecting its plant, and from interfering with the rights of the plaintiff, and from supplying the inhabitants of the borough of Philipsburg with water, as authorized by its charter.</p>

It immediately organized and erected its plant on Cold Stream, built a reservoir, and laid its mains and pipes, and commenced furnishing the inhabitants of Philipsburg with water from said stream, and has been doing so ever since, and so far as the facts in this case are concerned, there- has been no complaint for want of a full supply of water, or as to its quality. It purchased a large dam erected on said stream, and for a few years the water power was sufficient to run the pumps. Two pumps were at first placed in the plant. In the course of four or five years two additional pumps were erected, and an engine and boiler placed at the pumping station to furnish additional power. The evidence shows that since the additional pumps were placed, during dry weather or seasons, the steam power is used to pump with, for about four months of the year.</p>

February 12, 1885, $10,000 of the increase was ordered by a meeting of the board of directors, and certificates issued therefor. Of this amount $7,000 was from the earnings of the company, and $3,000 paid in by the stockholders who received the shares. June 18,1890, another increase of $10,000 of stock was ordered, the whole of which came from the earnings of the company, and on July 18, 1892, the stock was again increased $10,000 from the earnings of the company, making the capital stock of the company then issued $60,000, $27,000 of which was from the earnings or profits of the company, which had mostly been applied to the enlargement and improvement of the works of the company, although the evidence fails to show in detail the costs of the said extension and enlargement of the plant. The plaintiff never proceeded to condemn any portion of Cold Stream under the right of eminent domain, but only acquired the right to the dam and water power by purchase, but acquired no legal right to the water diverted from the stream to the reservoir, and which furnishes the supply to the inhabitants of Philipsburg and points adjacent thereto.</p>

This is independent of the stock issued out of the earnings of the company, to include the $27,000 of increased stock, which came from the earnings of the company. It is conceded that the annual dividends upon the original stock, as well as the increased stock, is largely in excess of eight per cent per annum,^—during the period the company has been in existence.</p>

The evidence shows that the defendant company contemplates erecting a dam on Cold Stream, between three and four miles above the location of the plaintiff’s dam, and pipe the water therefrom to Philips-burg and places adjacent thereto, to supply the inhabitants thereof, as authorized and empowered by its charter. The size of the main pipe it proposes to lay does not appear in the testimony, the quantity of water it proposes to divert from the stream does not therefore appear. The evidence shows that at a fair stage of water, the volume of water that flows through Cold Stream into plaintiff’s dam is about 36,000,000 gallons every twenty-four hours. That of this amount about 15,000,000 gallons has its source below the point on the stream where the defendant company proposes to construct its dam, and about 21,000,000 gallons of it has its source above the point where said dam is proposed to be located. During the dry months of the season, being ordinarily about three or four months, this quantity may be diminished from fifty to sixty per cent, depending upon the character of the drought, but in any event the evidence to our mind shows clearly, that at no time has there been less than from 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 gallons of a flow in twenty-four hours. The evidence shows that the average consumption of water by the inhabitants, now supplied by the plaintiff company, is not more than between 300,000 and 400,000 gallons every twenty-four hours. So that the evidence clearly shows that the supply of water from Cold Stream, for the consumption of the inhabitants of Philipsburg and places adjacent thereto, is quite ample for that purpose for both companies, and that the quantity that may be used by the defendant would not deprive the plaintiff of an ample supply of water to meet the wants of the inhabitants. The amount used by defendant company may impair the water power of the plaintiff to a greater or less extent, when the water is at its lower stages during the dryer months of the year.</p>

    <p id="b49-8" data-blocks='[["BL_49.11",49,[137,1665,1171,504]]]'>The Philipsburg Water Company was incorporated on June 15, 1881, for the purpose of furnishing water to the inhabitants of the borough of Philipsburg in Centre county. It promptly entered upon the prosecution of the work for which it was created. For thirteen years from the commencement of operations it was restricted to the furnishing of water to the inhabitants of said borough, but as it was desirous of increasing its business it obtained on August 31, ,1894, an amendment of its charter authorizing it to furnish water to the inhabitants of places adjacent thereto.</p>

It proceeded without delay to make arrangements for an adequate supply of water, and to provide the proper facilities for conveying it to its patrons within the territory included in its charter. While thus engaged it was met by the Philipsburg Company with a bill in equity to restrain it from appropriating the water of Cold Stream, or in any manner interfering with the accustomed flow of the same, and also to restrain it from diverting the water from said company’s dam, reservoirs, pipes, etc., and from supplying or attempting to supply the inhabitants of Philipsburg with water in any manner whatever so as to interfere with the exclusive franchises previously enjoyed by said company, and finally to restrain it from doing any act or acts by which the value of the capital stock of said company would be in any manner impaired.</p>
    <p id="b50-4" data-blocks='[["BL_50.4",50,[268,1052,1176,147]]]'>The Citizens Company promptly filed its answer to the bill and thereupon the parties agreed that the ease should be heard as upon final hearing upon bill, answer and testimony.</p>
    <p id="b50-5" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[263,1206,1184,1163]]]'>The most important question raised by the pleadings was whether the Philipsburg Company possessed the exclusive privilege of furnishing water to the inhabitants within the territory embraced in its charter. That the company by its original charter acquired the privilege under and by virtue of the act of 1874, and subject to the restriction imposed by it, is undisputed. The question whether the act of June 2,1887, and the company’s amendment of its charter in 1894 deprived it of the privilege there acquired was not decided by the court below, althoughit was held in Luzerne Water Co. v. Toby Creek Water Co., <a href="/pa/148/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="148 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="981878" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0568-01">148 Pa. 568</a>, that the said act repealed by implication the exclusive privileges given to water companies by the act of 1874. It was evidently considered unnecessary to determine this question, as the court found that the complainant had, for a period of five years, divided among its stockholders, from its earnings, a dividend equal to eight per cent per annum upon its capital stock. It is conceded that if this finding was authorized by the evidence the complainant’s claim of an exclusive privilege is defeated by it. The evidence on which the finding was based related to the stock and cash dividends. We have carefully examined this evidence and are convinced by it that it fully warranted the finding, and that the latter was the only conclusion fairly de~ ducible from the former.</p>

      <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>The other matters of which the Philipsburg Company complains in its bill relate to the water supply required for the inhabitants within the territory covered by its charter, and to the depreciation in value of its capital stock as a consequence of the competition which would naturally follow the establishment of another plant. The answer to these complaints is that the water supply of Cold Stream is more than twenty times the quantity of water consumed by the inhabitants of Philipsburg, as furnished by the complaining company, and that the probable effect upon the value of its capital stock as the result of competition is no cause for the intervention of a court of equity. Besides the Philipsburg Company has never condemned Cold Stream or any portion of it for the purposes of its charter, although the water supply for its customers has, since the establishment of its plant until the present time, been furnished from it. The Philipsburg Company therefore has as against the Citizens Company the position and rights of a lower riparian owner, and nothing more.</p>
    <p id="b51-3" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[117,1244,1175,344]]]'>All the material facts found by the court have adequate support in the evidence, and we discover nothing in them which calls for an issuance of the injunction prayed for in the company’s bill. The case before us is not within the class of which White v. City of Meadville is a type, and therefore a discussion of cases of that class is unnecessary. They are not applicable to the case at bar.</p>
