The judgment was entered in this court in favor of Amanda Messmore use, against John Morrison, administrator of the estate of Joseph Morrison, deceased, on May 13,1895. Now this proceeding is a scire facias on that judgment, and the plaintiff is Amanda Messmore now for use of Kate Messmore, and the defendant here is Benjamin Williamson, heir and devisee of Archibald Morrison, deceased, who was an heir of Joseph Morrison, deceased. The original judgment was obtained against the estate or representative of Joseph Morrison. It is contended that the land or property of Joseph Morrison passed to Archibald Morrison, and from Archibald Morrison to this defendant, and was subject to the payment of the debts of Joseph Morrison, deceased. Now there seems to be no dispute that this piece of land did pass to this defendant from Joseph Morrison. And the case only presents the legal question then as to whether under the evidence offered the plaintiff is entitled to recover here, or the plaintiff should have judgment on this scire facias.

The omission to make the administrator a party defendant in the scire facias to charge the lands of the decedent with the payment of his debts was not, under the facts of the case, fatal to the proceeding. The administrator was also an heir, and as such was made a defendant, and had full notice of the proceeding, and he is not here complaining.

In his representative capacity the ad<a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>ministrator could have made no defense, for while the judgment is prima facie evidence only in a proceeding to charge the land, it is conclusive as to the personal estate: Sergeant’s Heirs v. Ewing, <a href="/pa/36/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="36 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="992199" data-case-paths="/pa/36/0156-01">36 Pa. 156</a>; Paul v.

If summoned he could not have defended in the interest of creditors or of the estate generally, and the omission to name him deprived the other defendants of no right. Nor is there any merit in the objection that Archibald Morrison is named in the writ as an intermediate heir through whom the interests of other heirs were derived. The clear purpose of the proceeding was to charge with his debts the real estate of Joseph Morrison, which was in the possession of his heirs or their devisees, and of this purpose the record throughout gave the fullest notice. It would have been better practice to have followed the words of the act of assembly in describing the estate to be charged, but the omission of the word “ real ” could have led no one to suppose that goods and chattels, and not lands and tenements, were meant. While in its popular use the word “ estate ” includes both real and personal property, when used in a strictly technical sense it applies to realty only. In Bouvier’s Law Dictionary (1897) it is defined to be “ the degree, quantity, nature and extent of interest which a person has in real property,” and tins is said to be the proper and technical meaning of the word.</p>

There was no attempt to obtain a judgment which would bind the defendants personally, and no such attempt if made could have been successful.
