The affidavit of defense averred that shortly after the keys of the premises had been delivered to defendant’s agent, who at the time was ignorant of the <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>covenant in the lease, plaintiffs were informed that the certificates of stock would not be returned to them until the premises were restored to their original condition.

L. Kohler, who knew nothing whatever of the terms of this lease nor of the deposit of the stock now held by defendant for the purpose in said lease mentioned, but did know that the rent had been fully paid, and that said plaintiffs had notified the said <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>defendant that they would surrender possession upon the termination of their lease; that at that time no demand was made for said stock nor was there anything said to the said Kohler that any stock or securities belonging to the said plaintiffs were in the possession of this defendant; that, afterwards, when the said plaintiffs requested that the stock mentioned in the statement filed should be returned to them, they were told by the defendant’s agent, Mr. Kohler, as he informs me and as I expect to prove, that the plaintiffs must restore the premises to the condition in which they were at the making of the original agreement, and that the certificates of stock would not be returned to them until the premises were thus restored to the original condition. This restoration would have required the reconstruction of the said large portion of the party wall which had been removed by them. The plaintiffs, through their agent, Mr. Burnett, who made the demand, were further told that the defendant did not care to put the plaintiffs to unnecessary expense and that the defendant therefore would be willing, if an agreement to that effect was executed by the plaintiffs, to allow the restoration to remain open until it could be ascertained whether the premises could be rented together in the condition in which they were. The plaintiffs, through their said agent, were then further told that if an agreement was executed by them in writing, specifying the things necessary to be done to restore the premises to their former condition of separate and distinct buildings and agreeing to make the requisite alterations or restorations in those particulars when demanded by the defendant, the certificates of stock would be forthwith delivered. Plaintiffs declined to make such agreement and demanded the delivery of the stock despite the demand upon them to restore the premises to their former condition. The delivery of the certificates of stock was refused.</p>
