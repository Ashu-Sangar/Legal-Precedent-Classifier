O., Greene county, Pa.” The omission to fill this blank with place of payment in the copy given the grantors and the filling of said blank space in the original retained by grantees, with the words at “ New Free-port P. O., Greene county, Pa.,” forms the basis of one of the principal contentions raised in this case. Several of the early monthly instalments of rentals falling due were paid by agents of the South Penn Oil Company, at the house of William and Elizabeth Johnson, to them, but finally the grantors went monthly to the New Freeport P. O., Greene county, Pa., and there received through the mail from the postmaster or his assistants, vouchers for rentals duo in advance, which under an arrangement between the postmaster and the assignees of the oil and gas rights of said grants, were there cashed to William and Elizabeth Johnson upon their signing said vouchers.</p>

It was the post-office of the grantors and their point of trading and was made at that place for the convenience of all parties to the grant. The town of Waynesburg, at a bank, some twenty miles distant from residence of the said Johnsons, having in some former leases been the place of payment, this change was made for the most part for their convenience, and we have no difficulty in finding, under all the evidence introduced before us, that the payment of monthly rental for delay <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>of $12.50 each, under the terms of the grant of February 15, 1896, was payable in advance, on or before the 15th of each month after April 15, 1896, at New Freeport P. O., Greene County, Pa., and the deposit of that sum, payable to the grantors by check or cash, with postmaster Matthias Meighen, at that place by Guffey and Queen, or their assignees, the grantor having received rentals paid in that way on April 7, 1897, was a valid payment of said rentals and prevented the forfeiture of said grant, notwithstanding the death of William Johnson, one of the grantors.</p>

The deed for this 100 acres made by William Johnson to Elizabeth Johnson his wife, was not recorded until March 8,1897, something over one year after the grant of February 15, 1896, and the South Penn Oil Company was not so informed from the record until the service of the bill in equity by plaintiff upon said South Penn Oil Company, defendant.</p>

When Elizabeth Johnson called at the New Freeport P. O., as usual, to receive her rental to April 15, 1897, she was informed by the acting postmaster that since her husband was dead, he was advised the rentals should be paid to his legal representatives. There was some controversy between Mr. Bradley, the acting assistant postmaster who paid the rentals by check and cash, and Elizabeth Johnson, and she was paid the rental to April 15, 1897. Owing to the death of William Johnson and the refusal of his administrators to receive rental accruing after his death and the fact that there were heirs, when Elizabeth Johnson went in May after her rental, due between April 15 and May 15, 1897, she was informed the rental was there as usual but the intermediary stated to her he was advised not to pay it out to her until it was determined who was to act in this particular for her deceased husband’s estate; that he had been informed there were minor children left by William Johnson. This displeased Elizabeth Johnson, and she left, saying she thought they didn’t intend to pay her any more rentals, and as she owned 100 acres of the land and wanted to make something out of it she would release it and declare the grant of February 15, 1896, then held by the South Penn Oil Company, for the oil right and the Carnegie Natural Gas Company for the gas right, forfeited, and accordingly Elizabeth J ohnson did on June 14,1897, execute and deliver a second lease for the 100 acres included in the grant of February 15, 1896, to Guffey and Queen to J. L. Fisher, of Broad Tree, W. Va., who on August 31, 1897, assigned said lease of June 14, 1897, to B. N.

These payments by the Carnegie Natural Gas Company, on account of the grant of February 15,1896, together with the payments made by the South Penn Oil Company, on account of the same grant, admitted to have been received by Elizabeth Johnson and her husband, to April 15, 1897, show a duplication of the receipts of rental by William and Elizabeth Johnson to April 15, 1897, on this grant under which the South Penn Oil Company and the Carnegie Natural Gas Company hold this 150 acres of land for oil and gas, and applied to the period for which Elizabeth Johnson claims there was a failure to pay her rental on her 100 acres by the South Penn Oil Company, at the time she declared a forfeiture of the grant of February 15, 1896, and released the 100 acres to James L.

It follows from this finding that the lease for the same land subsequently made to Fisher and assigned to the plaintiff is invalid. Our doubt has been whether that part of the decree which directs the surrender for cancellation of the Fisher lease can be sustained under the pleadings, there being no cross bill.</p>
    <p id="b84-5" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[292,773,1176,712]]]'>The lessor, Elizabeth Johnson, and the Soutv Penn Oil Company, the assignee of the first lease, are joined as defendants, and it is averred in the bill that this lease was forfeited for nonpayment of rent, and is being used by the oil company “ vexatiously and injuriously against the plaintiff to throw a cloud or suspicion over his title and interest.” The answer of Elizabeth Johnson admits the alleged forfeiture and the improper use of the lease by the oil company, and she prays that the relief asked for by the plaintiff be granted. The answer of the South Penn Coal Company contains a specific denial of the averments of the bill upon which the alleged forfeiture is based, and the prayer thereof is to be hence dismissed with reasonable costs. The decree orders (1) the surrender for cancellation of the plaintiff’s lease; (2) the dismissal of the bill at the plaintiff’s cost.</p>

The established rule in chancery practice is that the defendant cannot have affirmative relief against the plaintiff, even in the subject-matter of the suit, except by cross bill. “ When a defendant seeks the aid of the court, for the purpose of enforcing his rights, he must file a cross bill; when he relies upon his rights, merely by way of defense to the relief sought against him, it is not necessary to do so: ” 2 Daniell’s Chancery PI. &amp; Pr. 1550. There are some well-recognized exceptions to this rule, where a defendant may have a decree in his favor without a cross bill, as on a bill for specific performance where the defendant sets up in the answer and' proves an agreement different from the one sought to be enforced; on a bill for accounting, if a balance is found due the defendant; and on a bill for partition where the <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>defendant claims the same relief as is sought by the original bill. These and other exceptions are very clearly stated in 5 Ency. of Pl. &amp; Pr. p. 634, and it is there said, citing McClaskey v. Barr, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20F.%20134" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="48 F. 134">48 Fed. Rep. 134</a>, that the theory on which relief is granted the defendant without cross bill in these cases is that the court will entertain the original bill only on condition that the plaintiff consents to the same justice being rendered to the defendant that he asks for himself.</p>
    <p id="b85-5" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[93,747,1171,354]]]'>This case must be considered as coming within the general rule that if the defendant relies on the equities of his case for anything beyond a defense, and seeks affirmative relief, he must file a cross bill, and that part of the decree which directs the delivery for cancellation of the lease held by the plaintiff must be set aside. As so modified the decree is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.</p>
