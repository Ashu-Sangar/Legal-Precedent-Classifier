    <p class="summary" id="b429-6" data-blocks='[["BL_429.11",429,[173,660,1163,751]]]'>At the trial it appeared that about 8 o’clock on the evening of October 10,1896, plaintiff was driving a covered wagon on a township road which was occupied by the defendant company with two tracks used in the operation of an electric railway. The evidence showed that the two tracks occupied a greater part of the road, so that a wagon in passing along the road had to be partially on one track or the other. The ear came in collision with the wagon shortly after rounding a slight curve in the road, and the plaintiff sustained personal injuries. The evidence for the plaintiff tended strongly to show that the car was run at a very high rate of speed. Plaintiff testified that he heard no bell. The witnesses for the defendant testified that a bell was rung, but their evidence varied as to the distance from the curve at which it was rung. Defendant’s point and the answer thereto were as follows :</p>

It was for the jury to say whether he was lawfully driving on the defendant’s track, and there was abundant reason for his being on the track. There were two tracks on the public road and they occupied nearly the whole width of the road, so that it was necessary for a person riding in a wagon to be partly on one of the tracks. There was also evidence to support the charge of negligence on the part of the company in regard to the rate of speed, and not giving any warning of the approach of the car. These questions were necessarily submitted to the jury who alone could decide them. The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>
