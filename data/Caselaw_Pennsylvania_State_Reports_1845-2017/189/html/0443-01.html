Under these controlling facts the plaintiffs certainly cannot recover in this action, and if they have any remedy it would be under the written contract to have the matter disposed of by the engineer, because that is the proper way and the only way that boroughs and cities can get their work done. We are also of the opinion that no sufficient evidence of a demand on the disputed items has been shown, made upon the engineer and refused. But on either, particularly the first point, we are of the opinion that the plaintiffs have not maintained their action, and, therefore, grant the motion for a non-suit, with leave to move the court in banc to take it off, if the court in banc thinks we have erred, or will give you the benefit of it.</p>
