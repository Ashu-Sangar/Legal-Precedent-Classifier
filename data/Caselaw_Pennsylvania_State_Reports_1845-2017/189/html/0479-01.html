L. 811, which provided that it should be the duty of the corporation as soon as a sufficient amount of stock had been subscribed to purchase ground and to erect thereon a library building suitable for the <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>use of the Young Men’s Mercantile Library and the Mechanics’ Institute, and that when this building was ready for use it should be perpetually leased to the Young Men’s Mercantile Library and Mechanics’ Institute on certain terms. The Hall Company erected the building, but the Library Association did not lease it. On February 3,1870, an act was passed which provided that the Hall Company might lease its grounds and 'buildingto the Library Association on such terms and conditions as might be agreed upon between the respective corporations. In 1871, an agreement was entered into by which the Hall Company was to retain possession and control of the building, and rent to other parties the portion of the building not occupied by the Library Association. This agreement recited that the Library Association was not able to assume the obligations of the lease contemplated in the charter of the Hall Company. It was provided that the agreement should be ratified by the stockholders of the Hall Company, but such ratification was never obtained. A large debt was incurred by the Hall Company in the erection of the building. In 1890 this debt was refunded, and shortly thereafter one B. obtained a controlling interest in the stock of the Hall Company. The Library Association filed a bill in equity against the Hall Company andB., alleging that thedefendanlsproposed to divert the property from the use for which it had been built. The evidence did not show any fraud on the part of B. <em>Held, </em>(1) that as the terms of the creating act were not complied with, plaintiff had no rights or interest in the property in .dispute by virtue of the act of March 18, 1859; (2) that as the agreement of March 10,1871, was not ratified by the stockholders of the Hall Company, plaintiff acquired no interest in said property by virtue of said agreement; (3) that the bill should be dismissed for the reason that the plaintiff had failed to show any ground of complaint.</p>

Nearly every important fact averred in the bill is either not denied in the answer, or is sustained by the testimony. The bill assumes a trust relation between the two corporations, and then avers numerous acts to show an abuse of the trust by the defendants. The complaint is that H. M. Bennett, inspired and assisted by the other defendants, pursued a course to further his own interests and to defeat the rights of the complainant under the trust and in'the trust properly. In order to sustain the complaint, three specific charges are made: (1) that said Bennett fraudulently obtained control of the Hall Company; (2) that after obtaining control, the property was wilfully mismanaged; (3) that there was wilful default in the payment of the coupons maturing in April and October, 1897.</p>

That <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>fact is clearly established in the testimony, and is not denied in the answer. It is denied, however, that any part of the stock was secured by fraud or misrepresentation, or with any purpose of preventing the carrying out of the objects for which the Hall Company was organized. It is plain that the Hall Company was incorporated for the purpose of erecting a building to accommodate the Library Association, but it is equally plain that this was not to be done at a loss to the stockholders of the Hall Company. The act of incorporation distinctly provided that such stockholders should be reimbursed for the cost of ground and buildings, with interest not exceeding six per cent. The Library Association was to be ultimately benefited, but not at the expense of the stockholders of the Hall Company. The capital was invested in ground and buildings, and the stock had intrinsic although little market value. There can be no question about the right of the stockholders of the Hall Company to make sale and transfer of their stock. With such right conceded, the mere act of purchasing the stock is not sufficient to convict the present holder of fraud. Bennett had a right to buy all or any part of the stock. That he holds a controlling interest is immaterial. Plaintiff’s right can be enforced against the defendant company no matter by whom the stock may be held.</p>

It is alleged that there was a failure to rent parts of the building, and that other parts were leased at less rent than the properly was fairly worth. After a careful review of the testimony, we were not able to find either allegation well founded. The contention is that, with proper management, a sufficient sum would have been realized “ to have paid off the floating debt of said defendant, together with six per cent interest on the cost of the ground and buildings of said trust property, and a sum in excess thereof which should have been applied to the liquidation of the indebtedness for the said grounds and buildings.” If such is the fact, it is not shown in the testimony. We have examined the evidence in vain to obtain data on which to base a calculation. We have the cost of construction, and can figure out the annual interest thereon. The present revenues are inadequate to pay the interest on cost of ground and buildings. There is evidence to justify finding <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>that a fair rental for the theater would be $10,000, or $2,000 more than is now obtained. The room formerly occupied by Horne &amp; Co. is now vacant and the rent then paid was $1,500. But we have no evidence as to cost of repairs, insurance and taxes. It has not been shown, however, that a tenant could have been obtained for the Horne room at a fair price, or at a price approaching the former rental. It has been impossible for us to gather from the testimony any accurate information as the actual net income, or the probable net income under unexceptionable management.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[265,852,1175,405]]]'>The allegation of wilful default in the payment of coupons maturing in 1897, is without evidence. The coupons were not paid, but there is no evidence that the Hall Company had funds with which to make payment. Nor is it shown that with proper management the Hall Company would have had funds sufficient for payment of coupons at maturity. The plaintiff has failed to show any fraud or mismanagement to.its prejudice, and failing in these respects, the relief prayed for cannot be granted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[259,1263,1180,1124]],["BL_507.1",507,[150,347,1171,1013]]]'>The relation between the two corporations is peculiar. It was defined by Mitchell, J., in Library Hall v. Pittsburg Association, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20Pa.%2039" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="178 Pa. 39">178 Pa. 39</a>, as “practically the position of trustee and cestui que trust.” This case not only defines the relation which exists between these companies, but likewise defines the rights and responsibilities belonging to each. The Hall Company is bound to act in the utmost good faith to effect the purpose of its incorporation, and on failure so to act, the association can seek redress in the courts of equity. But the same authority holds that “ the stockholders of the Hall Company are entitled to keep the management of the property in their own hands until the terms of the act should be complied with.” Under the act of incorporation (March 18, 1859, P. L. 811) the association was entitled to possession under a perpetual lease on certain conditions, and it was likewise entitled to a conveyance on other conditions. It is not pretended that the terms of the act were complied with in any respect. The act contemplated that the Library Association should take possession, and assume the care and responsibility of managing the property, and reimburse the stockholders of the Hall Company the amount invested in ground and buildings. The building was erected in 1870, and the Library Association has occupied a part of it <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>ever since, bnt it contributed nothing to the construction account, and in no way complied with the terms and conditions of the act of 1859. It has permitted the Hall Company for many years to manage and control the property because it was “ manifestly injudicious for it to assume the obligations of the lease contemplated in the charter of the Library Hail Company.” It is settled that the association has no right to the possession until the terms prescribed in the act of incorporation are complied with. It would seem to follow that the association has no rights in the property until the terms prescribed in the act of incorporation are complied with. The Hall Company, it is true, was organized for the purpose of providing a building for the Library Association, but it was contemplated at the time that the stockholders were to be repaid the outlay made for ground and building. The Library Association serves a good purpose; it is a very useful institution. But if it desires the benefits of the act of 1859, it must be willing to assume the obligations and burdens imposed by the act. The property of the Hall Company cannot bo appropriated even to a worthy institution without the consent of the stockholders.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b507-3" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[148,1378,1174,1010]]]'>The Library Association never complied with the terms of the act of 1859. There is no such contention now. The plaintiff claims an interest in the property and bases its right to relief on a contract, which was made and executed by the officers of the two corporations on March 10, 1871. The contract expressly provided that it should be subject to the ratification of the stockholders of the Hall Company. The agreement contemplated that the Hall Company, without consideration, should retain the control and management of the property, and in some other respects, varied materially the conditions imposed by the act of 1859. It was likely for this reason, therefore, that the contract was made subject to the ratification of the stockholders. No such ratification was ever obtained. Nor has it been shown that the agreement was made known to the stockholders and acquiesced in by them. The fact appears that the Library Association occupied part of the building and paid rent therefor. The agreement therefore cannot be made the foundation of this proceeding. For the reasons already given, the plaintiff company has failed to show that it is entitled to the relief prayed for.</p>

As to the allegations of fraud on the part of the defendants they are entirely without support from the testimony. The conclusions of law found by the court, in our judgment, are quite correct. It would be a useless waste of time to review all these matters in detail, and we therefore affirm the decree on the opinion of the court below.</p>
