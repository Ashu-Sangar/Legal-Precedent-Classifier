But when shall the charge of interest begin ? The defendant was surety for the committee of a lunatic, and gave a bond for $2,500, the condition of which was that the committee should well and faithfully execute the trust in all lawful respects. The account of the committee was filed October 24, 1894, and the report of the <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>auditor thereon, which was filed February 15, 1895, and duly confirmed, established the fact that the committee had not well and faithfully executed the trust, and that by reason of tbe default of the committee, the estate of the lunatic has, as early as January 2, 1890, lost a sum of money much larger than the amount of the bond. Demand was made upon the surety on October 18, 1897, for the principal of the bond and interest from January 2, 1890, the time of default by the committee. The defendant offers to pay interest from the time when the demand was made upon him, to wit: October 18, 1897.</p>

Nothing was said as to the time when the payment should be made. In the ease of the New York Life Ins. Co. v. Seckel, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Phila.%2092" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Phila. 92">8 Phila. 92</a>, it was said by Sitaiiswood. J.: “Beyond the penalty of the bond there can be no recovery against the sureties so far as the principal of the claim is concerned; hut there is no reason why interest should not be allowed on the amount of the penalty from the date of the breach.” When, therefore, is the date of the breach? In Hughes v. Hughes, <a href="/pa/54/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="54 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1006335" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0240-01">54 Pa. 240</a>, the bond was for the payment of money at a certain time, the action was for the debt by the obligor, and not for the penalty of the bond, and it was held in an action against the administrator of the obligor, that a greater sum then the penalty might be recovered. Weikel v. Long, <a href="/pa/55/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="55 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="1470654" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0288-01">55 Pa. 288</a>, was an action on a bond to pay money to guardians.

This is shown in the case of the New Holland Turnpike Co. v. Lancaster Co., <a href="/pa/71/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="71 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="1031238" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0442-01">71 Pa. 442</a>, in which the turnpike company had given a bond for $4,000 conditioned to pay one <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>third of the cost of building a county bridge. The bridge cost $16,500; the company was sued on its covenant to pay one third thereof, and a verdict and judgment entered against it for $5,500. The Court, Shabswood, J., said: “It is to be observed that this is not an action of debt to recover the penalty, but of covenant on the agreement, of which the bond is evidence. It is not a mere bond in a penalty, on a condition to be void upon doing or not doing a collateral act, either by the obligor or a third party. Such is the usual case in official bonds with sureties, conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of some office, or for accounting for money, or an ordinary private bond of indemnity, by sureties. In such cases it may be conceded that the penalty of the bond is the limit of liability on the instrument itself.” In the case of U. S. v. Curtis, <a href="/us/100/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="100 U.S. 119" data-case-ids="4603" data-case-paths="/us/100/0119-01">100 U.
