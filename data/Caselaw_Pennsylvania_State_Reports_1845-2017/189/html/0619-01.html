This will was duly probated in the high court of justice of England, and letters testamentary thereon were issued by said court to his widow, Mary Ann Lund. The latter, also a resident of Great Britain, died on May 20,1897, domiciled in England, leaving a last will, by which she devised and bequeathed all her residuary estate to her daughter, Mary Ann Grimes, and appointed her sole executrix under her will.

Upon the death of the executor of an executor, the executorship passed to his executor, and so long as the chain of representation remained unbroken by an intestacy, the ultimate executor represented every preceding testator: 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, title Executors and Administrators (ed. 1889), 204. In 2 Blackstone’s Commentaries, * 506, the law and the reason of it is thus clearly stated: “ The interest vested in the executor by the will of the deceased may be continued and kept alive by the will of the same executor, so that the executor of A’s executor is to all intents and purposes the executor and representative of A himself; but the executor of A’s administrator or the administrator of A’s executor is not the representative of A; for the power of an executor is founded upon the special confidence and actual appointment of the deceased ; and such executor is therefore allowed to transmit that power to another in whom he has equal confidence; but the administrator of A is merely the officer of the ordinary, prescribed to him by act of parliament, in whom the deceased has reposed no trust at all; and therefore, on the death of that officer, it results back to the ordinary to appoint another.” Other text writers state the law the same way. See Wentworth on the Office and Duty of Executors (14th ed.), 462; 1 Williams on Executors (9th ed.), 293, and 3 Redfield on Wills, 73,-pi. 17. This is the law of England at this time, and also of some of the American states, as may be seen by reference to Woerner on the American Law of Administration, section 350, and note, and Williams on Executors, 293, and note. It was <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>also the law of Pennsylvania until the Act of March 15, 1832, P. L. 135, section 6, restricted administration of goods within this commonwealth to persons appointed here, by providing that no letters testamentary or of administration, granted out of this commonwealth, shall confer any of the powers and authorities possessed by an executor or administrator under letters granted within this state. But to furnish means of administering the estates of citizens of any other state or country, it was provided in the 12th section of the same act, that copies of wills and testaments proved in any other state or country according to the laws thereof, and duly authenticated, and of the letters testamentary or other authority to administer issued thereon, duly attested, shall be deemed sufficient proof for granting letters testamentary or of administration with the will annexed in this state. By section 19 of the same act, it was provided that whenever a sole executor or the survivor of several executors shall die, leaving goods of the estate of his testator unadministered, the registrar shall, notwithstanding the executor may have made his last will and testament and appointed an executor or executors thereof, grant letters of administration of all such goods and estate in the same manner as if such executor had died without having made any testament or last will, and the executor of such deceased executor shall in no case be deemed executor of the first testator.</p>

The first of these acts which we have to consider appears to be the Act of June 16, 1836, P.

L. 67, section 5, declaring that the act of 1832 shall not apply to the stock or loan of the city or county of Philadelphia; the Act of May 15, 1850, P.

L. 195, permitting the transfer of the loans of this commonwealth and the city of Philadelphia, by the person or persons duly authorized by the laws of the state or country in which the foreign bondholder was domiciled or resided at the time of his death; provided an affidavit is filed with the clerk of the orphans’ court that the decedent is not indebted to any person within this commonwealth. All this legislation has been passed for the purpose of facilitating the transfer of public and corporation loans and stocks, in pursuance of the policy which actuates commercial nations in such matters. In order to induce persons residing outside of this state to invest their capital in business enterprises here, the legislature has enacted these statutes to permit a transfer upon the death of the owner, to be made according to the law of his domicil, without putting his representatives to the inconvenience, expense and delay of administration here.</p>

She died on May 20, 1897, in England, and by her will bequeathed her residuary estate to her daughter, Mary Ann Grimes, and appointed her sole executrix. Copies of these wills and grants of letters testamentary thereon have been filed in the office of the register of wills in this county. George Lund owned 510 shares of the stock of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and during the life of his widow and executrix she received the dividends thereon.

The plaintiff has demanded of the defendant company a transfer by her, as executrix of Mary Ann Lund, executrix of George Lund, deceased, 'of the said 510 shares of stock, but the defendant company has refused to permit any person other than an administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of the estate of George Lund, appointed in England or in Pennsylvania, to make the transfer, and the question is, under what law is the power to make the transfer to be derived?</p>

It was intended to relieve the representatives of the owners of loans and stocks, who are authorized by the law of the state or country in which such owners lived and died, from the necessity of taking out letters of ancillary administration in this state, and to permit such representatives to transfer such loans and shares the saíne as if they derived their authority under the law of this state; and that the inquiry for the person representing the estate of any decedent should be for the person representing such estate according to the law of the domicil of the deceased owner, and not the law of this state. The 19th section of the act of 1882 is not repealed as to the ordinary goods and chattels of the estate of a nonresident, but it is superseded as to his investments in public and corporation bonds and stocks within this commonwealth by the several acts before cited; and as to such loans or stocks the power to transfer them is derived from the grant under the law of the domicil of the decedent. As to our citizens the law is that the executor of an executor cannot make such a transfer, because we have provided a person to take his place; but as there is no provision for an administrator de bonis non in England, when there is an executor of an executor, who is the person representing the estate <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>of the decedent and has authority to transfer the shares of the first testator there, the executor of the executor should be permitted to make the transfer here. We are required to give these acts a reasonable interpretation so as to facilitate and not impede the transmission of the property.</p>

Here the testator has been dead ten years. His widow, as legatee, owner and executrix, has received the dividends since his death. Now his daughter is legatee, owner and executrix, and it is contended that she cannot receive the dividends or transfer the shares without being put to the expense of an administration, involving the giving of security to a large amount, and the settlement of an account and distribution by the orphans’ court, with an attendant inconvenience and delay. No question as to domestic creditors is involved, because the legislature, by enacting that foreign executors and administrators may make the transfer, has disregarded any rights of local creditors as to public and corporation loans and shares of stock, except that the act of 1874 requires an affidavit that the decedent is not indebted here. As the plaintiff in this ease is the person representing the estate of the decedent and is duly authorized by the law of England, where the decedent was domiciled and his will was proved, she is entitled to make the transfer she desires to make.</p>
