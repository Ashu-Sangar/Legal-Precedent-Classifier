The eastern terminus on Arch street for both companies was at the place of the accident. Plaintiff desired to get on a summer car of the Union Traction Company. In trying to do so he went upon the track next to the car, and while he was on the step of the Union Traction car, and before the bar had been raised high enough to permit him to enter, a Hestonville, Mantua and Fairmount car started, took the switch for the north track, reached it, and with considerable speed moved westward and passed along the side of the Union Traction car. On account of the closeness of the tracks, the plaintiff was caught between the cars and severely injured.</p>

When you reached Arch street was the south bar of the Sprmg Garden (Union Traction) car up or down ? A. Down. Q. What did you do when you found this bar was down? A. I walked around the back of the car and got on the north side. The motorman and conductor were in their position to raise this bar and I got on. Q. Where was the Arch street (Hestonville, Mantua and Fairmount) car when you started to pass in the rear of the Spring Garden street car? A. On the same track. Q. How far below ? A. I should suppose about twenty-five or thirty feet. Q. When you started to get on the car of the Spring Garden street lme, where was the Arch street car ? A. On the same track, about twenty feet below. Q. But had not started ? A. No, sir. Q. How do you know <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>it had not started ? A. I looked and examined it and saw they were both on the same track before I got in between. Q. Did you or did you not look southward to see whether or not the Arch street car was approaching before you attempted to get on the north side of the Spring Garden street car? A. Yes, sir; it was stationed there and had not moved. Q. Where were the motorman and conductor of the Spring Garden street car when you attempted to get on the north side? A. One in front and one in back. Q. What were they doing when you attempted to get on ? A. About in the act of lifting the bar. Q. How long does it take to lift a bar under ordinary circumstances ? A. A very few seconds. Q. Did they see you attempt to get on? A. Yes, sir. Q. How do you know they did? A. They could not help it; they were looking at me. Q. May I ask whether on previous days, when you had reached this point to take the Spring Garden street car, you had noticed the south bar down? A. Yes, sir. Q. What did you do on previous occasions ? A. The same as this day, walked around on the north side, and the bar was always up.”</p>
