Under the agreement, as admitted by the parties, there was nothing to prevent Barbin from selling papers over this route, after he had signed the written contract, and it is not only his privilege but his right to continue in possession and exercise full control over the route until the $2,000 was all paid by Wentzel to him. <em>Answer : </em>This is refused.

    <p class="summary" id="b523-8" data-blocks='[["BL_523.8",523,[142,1315,1172,405]]]'>5. Under the uncontradicted evidence in this case, Barbin had a legal right to sell papers on this route, at any and all times since the date of the agreement with Wentzel, and no damage or breach of contract in this suit can be predicated upon any attempt by him to sell papers on the route after the date of the contract, and especially if such attempts were made prior to the payment of all the purchase money by Wentzel. <em>Answer : </em>This is refused.

If there were nothing else in the case than that, I would be inclined to think that this action was not properly brought, and it leaves a question that may possibly be considered hereafter, whether or not this action was properly brought. At present, I instruct you that that is properly set up here as a claim.] [4]</p>

And it appears that at the time of this difficulty on January 9 or 10, he demanded payment of the balance due upon this contract. He did not demand simply that a note should be given, as agreed upon, but he demanded the money. He said, “ Have you got the money here or the security? ” And Mr. Wentzel said “No; ” and Mr. Barbin then said, that until the money or security was furnished he was not bound to give Mr. Wentzel anything. That was about the position.] [5]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[271,740,1180,921]]]'>[So that you have now, in the first place, the question whether or not Mr. Wentzel did comply with his contract. If he did not, was he excused in any way for those matters in which he was deficient. Mr. Barbin did not furnish the list of subscribers ; he did not furnish the service that he was bound to do, and then finally he interfered by taking away the subscribers. Was he justified in so doing? If he was, you will find for the defendant. If he was not, you will find for the plaintiff. The question is now, what is the measure of damages, and here comes the question of difficulty. In the first place, as I said before, Mr. Wentzel, if the contract was rescinded, would be entitled to have his money back, and if Mr. Barbin’s conduct was equal to a rescission; that is, if he did that which he could only do if the contract had been rescinded,—go in and take the customers away from Mr. Wentzel and destroy the value of his contract,—he would be in the same position, and Mr. Wentzel would be then entitled to recover back at least the money he had paid on account of it, less what he had got back.] [6]</p>
