No other testimony was taken, and no action was taken, the plaintiffs protesting that they had not received any proper notice. On February 28, the plaintiffs each received another notice to appear before the board on Sunday, March 20, to answer charges preferred by Thomas J. Welsh, secretary, of violation of article 2 of the constitution, inclosing a copy of the charges, as given last above, signed by the secretary, but the notice was not accompanied by copy of the manifesto. Plaintiffs appeared in response to this notice. At this meeting a copy of the manifesto was produced, wliich the petitioners admitted they had signed, but no testimony was taken, nor was there any effort made to show that the manifesto was circulated by plaintiffs, or that it tended to disrupt or destroy the union, or cause the withdrawal of members, nor, indeed, was there anything tending to sustain the charges against plaintiffs, and they, after protesting as before, withdrew from the meeting. The matter was then dropped, but subsequently at the same meeting, and without passing upon the guilt or innocence of the plaintiffs of the offense charged, a resolution was passed erasing the names of the plaintiffs from the roll of membership of the union. At this meeting there were present <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>eight of the members of the board, and while no votes were cast against the resolution of erasure, it is very doubtful that the requisite two thirds of those present were cast in its favor. Brecht, one of those present, says he did not vote; Welsh, the secretary, and nominally the prosecutor, says he did not vote. Allen, the president, says he only voted when there was a tie —and it also appears plainly that he had prejudged the case and was disqualified to vote.</p>

And can it be said that they were deprived of those rights and privileges after a fair and impartial trial ? The charter of this corporation contains no power of expulsion, and where no such power is so given it can only be exercised by the corporation when the member has been guilty of some infamous offense, or has done some act tending to the destruction of the society. Does the act complained of here tend to the injury or destruction of the union? The charge states that the manifesto bearing the signatures of the plaintiffs tended to disrupt and destroy the union, but there was no proof at this pretended trial that it did so tend. The circular, or manifesto as it is called, in itself, certainly contains nothing rendering it or its authors liable to such charge. In substance, it is nothing but an invitation to participate in a meeting at which were to be discussed matters affecting the interest of the union. It is plain that there were diverse opinions among the members with regard to the policy to be pursued by the union in reference to its relations to what are known as labor organizations; and it can be inferred, too, that those issuing the manifesto held views at variance with those controlling this union; but surely that is no reason why those who invite all members to attend a meeting where these different views should be discussed in order to reach a determination of the question as to what were the best interests of the association should be charged with an effort to disrupt and destroy the union. If the issuance of the manifesto was an offense at all it was a minor one, for the commission of which the plaintiffs could not be expelled from the society and deprived of their interest in the funds of the union. If we are correct in this, the mandamus must issue as prayed for in this case, but there are some other features which it seems proper <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>to discuss briefly. It is claimed by tbe respondents that it was tbe duty of the relators to first exhaust their remedies within the organization itself by appeal, which is provided for by section 2 of article 11 of the by-laws, and expressly provided for by the resolution of December 5, 1897, before asking for this writ. An examination of section 2, article 11 of the by-laws shows that it does not cover this case, and that so far as the bylaws were concerned the plaintiffs were without remedy by appeal or otherwise. As to the provision for appeal in the resolution of December 5,1897, it seems to be an attempt to amend the by-laws, which must be done in a very different manner from that adopted here. The by-laws themselves prescribe the mqde for their amendment, and this was not followed; however, this attempt of the resolution to provide an appeal impresses conditions which render it burdensome and ineffective, in that it requires a compliance with the findings of the board and the payment of all expenses. Another anomalous feature of the resolution of December 5, 1897, is that it makes the board of directors both prosecutors and judges of the matter in dispute. It is said that plaintiffs assented to this resolution by their pres ence at the meeting and failure to object thereto at the time. This, however, does not bind them to an illegal resolution and by-law, if they elect to raise the question of its illegality subsequently. The plaintiffs claim, too, and with grounds, we think, that the notices of the meetings for the trial on February 20 and March 20,1898, were insufficient in that they contained no complete copy of the charges preferred. Objection also is raised by the plaintiffs that all the proceedings leading to their expulsion were taken on. Sunday, and for this reason they are invalid. We have not deemed it necessary to discuss this objection, as well as many others raised by the relators, it being very plain that this expulsion must fall for other reasons given.</p>
