Equity will regard a penalty or forfeiture as intended to secure the fulfilment of a contract, and it may preclude the injured party from recovering more than a just compensation, or from obtaining a collateral advantage: Notes to Peachy v. Duke of Somerset, 2 Lead. Cas. Eq. <em>2044; </em>Bispham’s Eq. 178. Whether a sum named as compensation for the breach of a contract is to be considered as a penalty to secure its fulfilment, from which equity will relieve, or as damages liquidated by the parties themselves, is a question which cannot be answered by the application of axxy general rule. The question is always one of construction, and any rule upon the subject is a mere guide to the intention of the parties. The grounds on which each case is to be considered and determined are clearly stated by our Brother Mitchell in Keck v. Bieber, <a href="/pa/148/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="148 Pa. 645" data-case-ids="981847" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0645-01">148 Pa. 645</a>: “ The general principle upon which the law awards damages is compensation for the loss suffered.

Allabough, <a href="/pa/103/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="103 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="449086" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0335-01">103 Pa. 335</a>: “The question .... is to be determined by the intention of the parties drawn from the words of the whole contract, examined in the light of its subject-matter and its surroundings; and in this examination we must consider the relation which the sum stipulated bears to the injury which may be caused by the several breaches provided against, the ease or difficulty of measuring a breach in damages and such other matters as are legally or necessarily inherent in the transaction.”</p>
    <p id="b222-4" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[231,911,1171,661]]]'>From the nature of this case the actual damages which would result from a breach of the contract would not readily be susceptible of ascertainment, and it seems to us that it was the manifest intention of the parties not to leave them to the uncertain estimate of a jury, but to fix them by express agreement. “ Uncertainty as to the extent of the injuries which may ensue,” was said in Powell v. Burroughs, <a href="/pa/54/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="54 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="1006303" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0329-01">54 Pa. 329</a>, and Wolf Creek Co. v.
