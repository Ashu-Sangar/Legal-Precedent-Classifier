Moments later firemen arrived and removed the body from the premises to the Somerset Community Hospital at Somerset, Pennsylvania, where she was treated by Dr. Harold E. Musser.

On November 16, 1957, Gary saw the victim with a cut above her right eye and a cut below her lip. The photographic exhibits show a gaping wound above the eye in the eyebrow. On another occasion Gary saw her with a swollen ankle and a black eye. In explaining these marks and wounds, the victim stated to Gary that they were caused by the defendant having struck her.</p>

    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[235,676,1148,1467]]]'>Defendant contends that it was error to allow the introduction of expert evidence with respect to the fire and to the testing by defendant of the burning qualities of whiskey approximately three weeks prior to his wife’s death. It was not only the theory of the Commonwealth, but the Commonwealth proved (if Aurigemma is believed, as the jury must have believed him) beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant not only set fire to and burned his wife to death, but used an accelerant to produce the fire which caused his wife’s death. This was clearly not an ordinary fire. The entire burned or scorched area of the room was less than 6 feet square and yet the fire was so intense that one small area was burned completely through the floor. Only parts of the victim’s body were burned; and the burning was so deep in the area of the groin that there was a crevice so large a fist could be inserted in it. According to the testimony of Herbert C. Dixon, an expert in chemistry with extensive experience investigating fires of suspicioxxs origin, if this fire had been caused merely by smoldering cigarettes, the length of time required for the smoke to travel from its point of origin in the first floor bedroom to the upstairs window where it was seen by neighbors, would be much longer than occurred ixi this case. These circumstances singly and together demonstrate that expert evidence concerning the nature of the fire was admissible.</p>

Speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Stern, the Court <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>said (page 443) : “Expert testimony is admissible in all cases, civil and criminal alike, when it involves explanations and inferences not within the range of ordinary training, knowledge, intelligence and experience. Certainly laymen could hardly be expected to have knowledge in regard to various types of fires and the difference in the nature, violence and intensity of flames resulting from the burning of inflammable liquids or other materials as contrasted with the burning of a wooden counter or hair upholstery, . . .” This contention of defendant is devoid of merit.</p>

There is likewise no merit in this contention. When a defendant pleads not guilty, no one knows whether a crime has been committed or what his defense will be. In such cases it is especially important to admit photographs of the victim to aid the jury in their understanding of the alleged crime, whether it was accidental or felonious, the kind of crime it was, exactly what caused the victim’s death, and what, if any, connection defendant had with it. The admission of photographs is largely within the discretion of the trial Court and will not be reversed except for a flagrant abuse of discretion. However, photographs are not admissible for the purpose of exciting or inflaming the emotions of the jury, and the trial Judge must admonish the jury against permitting the photographs to prejudice them against defendant: <em>Commonwealth v.

In this case it was especially wise for the trial Judge to admit the photographs, not only because they were an aid to the understanding of the crime as explained to them by the witnesses who referred to the photographs, but in addition thereto the photographs aided the jury in determining whether this was an accidental burning from Mrs. Boden’s cigarette, which she might have dropped if drunk, or a planned <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>and deliberate burning by defendant of his wife with the intent to kill her.</p>
