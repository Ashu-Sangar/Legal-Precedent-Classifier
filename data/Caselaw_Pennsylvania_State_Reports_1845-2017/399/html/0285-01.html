The application also showed that Catherine applied for this marriage license <em>in her maiden name, </em>Catherine Fiorelli, instead of in the name of Catherine Manfredi, which would have been her legal name if she were married to Fedele. Appellee also offered in evidence a certificate certifiéd to by J. J. Kirby, a Justice of the Peace, that Catherine Fiorelli and John Leon were married by him on February 10, 1914.

Appellant’s testimony as'to cohabitation eight months or less in Smith’s Ferry, and proof of reputation among a few Italian families, was undoubtedly very weak. The subsequent conduct of the alleged contracting parties refutes this weak proof of a common law marriage. Fedele admittedly left his' alleged wife and child, appellant, 6 months after the child was born and returned to Italy. Approximately 7 months after Fedele left, Catherine entered into a formal ceremonial marriage with John Leon while Fedele was yet alive, in which she stated that she had never been married, and was married under her maiden name. When Fedele’s brother Frank, the decedent, came 3 or 4 months after Fedele left for Italy to the house at Smith’s Ferry, where Catherine and appellant were living, and took away all the furniture under the direction of his brother (except a high chair for the baby and a sewing machine) no objection was made by Catherine. Moreover, Catherine living in a two or three room shanty with Gallo and -Fedele, and the .conflicting evidence as to which one of the two men had sent for her, as well as the short period of time of 8 months in which Fedele alone allegedly cohabited with her in Smith’s Ferry, make it extremely doubtful whether any Court would be justified in finding a common law marriage, especially where, as here, it would bastardize one or more children of Catherine and John Leon, who were ceremonially married on February 10, 1914.</p>

As said by President Judge Keller in Baker v. Mitchell, <a href="/pa-super/143/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="143 Pa. Super. 50" data-case-ids="1031755" data-case-paths="/pa-super/143/0050-01">143 Pa. Superior Ct. 50</a>, 54: ‘The law of Pennsylvania recognizes common-law marriages. But they' are a fruitful source of perjury and fraud, and, in consequence, they are to be tolerated, not encouraged;. the -professed contract should be examined with great scrutiny, and it should plainly appear that there was an actual agreement entered into, then and there, to form the legal relation of husband and wife.’ Especially is this true where.one of the parties is dead and the claim so grounded is to share in the distribution of his estate. ‘When the lips of a man’ are sealed by death, and he leaves no satisfactory evidence as to the existence of such contract, courts will be very slow to establish it in derogation of the undoubted rights of those who follow him’: Stevenson’s Estate, supra, 301.

If Fiore was legitimate, then Mary Maola was illegitimate. Moreover, if Mary Maola is legitimate by a common law marriage in 1912, then Frank Leon, who was born on May 2,1915, and who was the son of Catherine and John Leon who were ceremonially married on February 10, 1914, would be bastardized, and all the other children of this lawful Leon marriage who were or could have been born before the death or divorce of Fedele would be bastardized.</p>
