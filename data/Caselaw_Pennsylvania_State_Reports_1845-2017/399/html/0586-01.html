McCrady, the appellee, has been for many years the owner of a 190 acre farm located in Springfield Township, Erie County. The northwest corner of that farm, triangular in shape, is bounded on the north by U. S. Highway Route No. 20, on the south by Pennsylvania Highway Route No. 5 and on the east by appellee’s land.</p>

Under its power of eminent domain and for the purpose of straightening Route No. 5, the Commonwealth in 1935 effected a taking of approximately fifteen feet along the southerly boundary of appellee’s triangular tract of land including a portion thereof upon which gas pumps were located. After appellee learned of this taking he presented no claim for any damages and continued to operate, without any interference, the gas pumps on the land taken by the Commonwealth. In 1951 the appellee tore down the old and erected a new gasoline station and at the same time enlarged and remodeled the restaurant building.</p>

This plan of the Commonwealth <em>condemned </em>strips of land along both the southern and the northern boundaries of this triangular plot; it projected a channel change on the southern boundary, approximately 30 feet in length, part of which would be constructed on appellee’s land; on land owned by the Commonwealth it established three traffic islands and a highway divider and a curbing, the latter ranging in height from 6" to 12" on the inside and from 10" to 12" on the outside, which completely surrounded the triangular plot and created thereof an “island”; five access ways, thirty-six feet in width, were provided as means of ingress and egress to the gasoline station, the restaurant and the parking area.</p>

These access ways were located in such position that ingress and egress to and from the gasoline station, the restaurant and parking area were rendered exceedingly difficult and, in some instances, impossible. The narrow width of the access ways prevented the entry of large trucks and truck-trailers — representative of a considerable volume of the business of the gasoline station — unless such trucks or truck-trailers first turned to the left into the most southerly land of the westbound two lane Route No. 5 or drove over the the almost insurmountable curbing. Socony Mobile Oil Company, appellee’s lessee of the gasoline station, <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>notified appellee it would have to surrender its lease because of the fact that the construction of the curbing and access ways made unprofitable the operation of the gasoline station.

The parking lot had to be relocated, and this relocation required the placement of pipes to carry off the water of a creek in the rear of the restaurant, the deposit of considerable fill over the area and blacktopping of the entire area in order to render it suitable for the parking of automobiles of customers of the restaurant and the gasoline station.</p>

L. 1242, Art. IV, 36 PS §670-420, upon which the Commonwealth relies, provides: “The secretary [of Highways] is empowered to make reasonable rules and regulations governing the use of all state highways, and, by the construction of curbs, divisor strips, painted lines or signs, may control the direction of the flow of traffic thereon . . . .” It is the Commonwealth’s contention that, by virtue of this statutory provision, the instant curbing and access ways were constructed and for any damages flowing therefrom it is not liable. Under the Commonwealth’s theory this new construction of the highway is considered as two separate transactions; <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>the placement of the curbing as an exercise of the police power and the taking of appellee’s land as an exercise of its right of eminent domain. Such position directly contradicts the factual situation. The curbing and the taking of the land of the appellee were all one transaction. While the curbing was constructed upon land taken by the Commonwealth from appellee in 1935 appellee’s land taken by the Commonwealth on April 30, 1957 was necessary and essential if the purposes of the Commonwealth were to be realized. What the Commonwealth attempts to do is clear and evident: under the guise of the police power it seeks to accomplish indirectly that which it cannot accomplish directly. If the curbing was to be constructed the Commonwealth had to take a certain portion of appellee’s land for slope purposes and the latter it acquired under its power of eminent domain. The <em>curbing </em>could not have taken place without the <em>talcing </em>of a portion of appellee’s land for slope purposes and the <em>talcing </em>would have been meaningless without the <em>curbing. </em>Under the unique and extraordinary situation herein presented the <em>talcing </em>and the <em>curbing </em>were both part and parcel of <em>one </em>transaction. The Commonwealth’s attempt to justify the curbing as an exercise of its police power and the taking as an exercise of its power of eminent domain in an attempt to escape liability for the damages which appellee so obviously suffered cannot be condoned. The language of Mr. Justice Holmes in <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.

By the construction of this curbing at heights varying from 6" to 12" the Commonwealth sealed off and isolated this triangular portion of appellee’s land and, for all practicable purposes, doomed the commercial enterprises conducted thereon unless appellee relocated the building structures. While the Commonwealth did provide five access ways yet such ways were of such width and so located as to effect a practical denial of any access to the property for the purposes for which it was employed. The court below in its opinion stated in this connection: “To rehabilitate the property for use as a gasoline station, appellee made many changes. With a new building and by rearranging a restaurant building also on the property, he was able to make it possible for the lessee to resume business. It is appellee’s contention, with which we agree, that the taking of the narrow strip of land around most of appellee’s property in 1957 and the erection of curbing which rendered useless the gasoline station, caused damage for which appellee is entitled to compensation. The appellant contends that inasmuch as it erected the curbing on its own <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>property and left openings from the highway at places which could, even though inconveniently, he used, no right to damages exists other than for possibly the small amount of property actually taken. If the Commonwealth is correct in this legal position, we then can exaggerate the situation somewhat in order to point out the injustice which results from such a rule of law. Assume a hotel building of many stories is laid out by architects, and constructed with an attractive front and first floor arrangement commonly provided for the convenience of patrons. This hotel also has a small entrance at the rear principally used by employees and by those bringing supplies but, nevertheless, through such entrance, and possibly through storage rooms and furnace rooms, the customer can reach the lobby where reservations may be made and access to elevators may be had. Then assume that the Commonwealth erects a ten foot wall on the adjoining street and takes a strip of land around and from the hotel property for some auxiliary use and leaves a ten foot entrance at the rear of said hotel. Could we under such circumstances conclude that the hotel owner was without remedy even though his million dollar investment became useless? We think not.”</p>

As a direct — not a consequential — result of the taking of this land as part of the general plan of the Commonwealth the construction which followed effectively denied to the appellee and his business invitees access to the land and resulted in a cessation of appellee’s commercial activities.
