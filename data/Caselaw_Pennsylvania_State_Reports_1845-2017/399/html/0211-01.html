The record considered in this manner discloses the following facts. The plaintiff on a fair, dry day in September, 1954, was walking across Hopewell' Avenue in the community of Aliquippa, Beaver County, when he was struck by an automobile operated by the defendant and was seriously injured.. Hopewell Avenue, an improved public highway, runs north and south, is 30 feet in width, and is divided into three' ten-foot traffic lanes. The westerly lane is used for the parking of motor vehicles, the center lane for southbound traffic, and the easterly lane for northbound traffic.</p>

Plaintiff was crossing the street from west to east between intersections, in the direction of his friend’s automobile, when the accident occurred. At the point where plaintiff started to cross the street, automobiles were parked parallel with and adjacent to the curb. As plaintiff stepped off the curb into the roadway, he saw a truck proceeding south in the westerly lane. He then walked between two parked cars and when he reached the end or outer edge of the parked cars,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> he looked to his left and saw defendant’s automobile traveling south in the westerly lane at a point located up the street to the north, the distance to <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>which, was estimated by other testimony to be 174 feet. Plaintiff then proceeded to take four or five steps into the street and then looked to his left again and saw that the defendant’s automobile was right on top of him. The impact followed almost instantly.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[148,627,1146,649]]]'>Police investigating the accident found two skid marks in the southbound traffic lane where defendant had been traveling, 24' 3" in length. They were parallel to the curb. The right, or west, mark was 12' from the west curb and the left, or east, mark was 2%-' from the line dividing the north and southbound lanes. In front of the right, or west, skid mark were two spots of blood 12' from the west curb, or 4%' from the east side of the parked cars. No testimony was offered as to the speed at which defendant’s car was traveling. Its damage consisted of a dent on the right front between the headlight and the center of the grill.</p>

Subsequently, the court refused to remove the nonsuit, not only sustaining the finding of the trial judge that plaintiff was contributorily negligent, but also ruling that negligence on the part of the defendant had not been established.</p>

It is axiomatic that the question of contributory negligence should not be taken from the jury’s consideration except in a clear case and only when reasonable minds would not legitimately differ as to the conclusion of its existence: <em>Aaron v.

However, a pedestrian who crosses a street between intersections is held to a higher degree of care than one who crosses on a crosswalk at a street intersection, and, by the same token, the driver of an automobile is held to a correspondingly lesser degree of care: <em>Harris v. DeFelice, </em><a href="/pa/379/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="379 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="1253617" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0469-01">379 Pa. 469</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.2d%20174" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="109 A.2d 174">109 A. 2d 174</a> (1954) ; <em>Rucheski v.

It is equally well established that a pedestrian, particularly one crossing between intersections, must not only look before starting to cross the street but must continue to look as he proceeds across.

This in itself convicted him of contributory negligence. It was a clear violation of his definite obligation, even if no approaching traffic were visible before he undertook to cross. But, it was even more incumbent upon him to continue to look as a reasonably prudent man interested in his own safety would do, in view of the fact that, before he started to cross, he saw the automobile of the defendant approaching from a comparatively short distance away. His own foolhardiness in blindly jay-walking across a busy street at least contributed to this unfortunate occurrence. This renders recovery impossible under a long line of Pennsylvania authorities.</p>

Thus, in the event he is injured while crossing the street, he will be able to express in the purest of English, to the learned judges who hear his case, just what happened, because, otherwise, with all the right on his side, he may still lose, the learned judges being unable to understand, or lacking the patience to understand, what he is saying.</p>

In order to get to the other side, where a friend (Sam Bekitck) was waiting to give him a ride to his destination, Nikola had to pass between two parked cars. Before committing himself to the street he looked to the left and saw an automobile 174 feet away and he concluded that he had sufficient time to cross before it reached Mm. He took four or five steps and then, looking to the left again, he observed <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>the car bearing down on him. He endeavored to avoid the collision, but when once more he looked to the left, the car was about to strike. In desperation he leaped to the hood of the car.

Then he says “I turn left again,” which means that from the time he stepped off the curb to the time he was hit, he looked to his left at least three times.

He is not required by -law or by common prudence to keep his head screwed to the left as he advances on his legitimate errand. The Majority Opinion admits that Hopewell Avenue was a “busy thoroughfare.” Thus Nikola had to be concerned about what was ahead of him and to the right of him, as well as to what was on his left.

    <p id="b241-8" data-blocks='[["BL_241.9",241,[150,1931,1148,265]]]'>But even with his un-college-bred brain, Nikola could see the trap into which defendant’s counsel was attempting to lure him. He replied: “I jump it right away. I make it steps. I make it four or five steps, maybe more, then I jump when car approach me.”</p>
    <p id="b241-9" data-blocks='[["BL_241.10",241,[151,2214,1146,155]],["BL_242.1",242,[241,362,1146,145]]]'>The first “I jump it right away” was clearly intended as an inquiring repetition of defendant’s counsel’s question, as if to say: “I jump it right away?” <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>And then came the explanation: “I make it four or five steps, maybe more, then I jump when car approach me.”</p>
    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[243,535,1144,209]]]'>The cross-examiner tried another stratagem: “You went up just opposite his car, and then you went between the parked cars to go straight across to Bekitch’s car, didn’t you?”</p>
    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.6",242,[242,761,1145,426]]]'>If Nikola had replied Yes to this question he would have admitted that he had proceeded directly through parked cars and, without looking, walked straight into the path of an oncoming car. Nikola saw this, uneducated as he was, and he replied with a flat “No.” And then, shattering the cross-examiner’s dream for the suicidal reply, Nikola went on to say very specifically: “I <em>take look </em>when I get between cars.”</p>
    <p id="b242-6" data-blocks='[["BL_242.7",242,[237,1208,1148,533]]]'>Since we are compelled to read the record in the light most favorable to Nikola, we find, by this answer, added to his other answers, the established fact that Nikola looked before he committed himself to. the crossing, looked as he passed between the parked cars, looked when he had taken four or five steps, and looked just as the car was about to hit him. How many looks must a pedestrian take in order not to be hit by a speeding, heedless car, and even more, so as not to be disastrously hit by an unappraising court nonsuit?</p>
    <p id="b242-7" data-blocks='[["BL_242.8",242,[236,1760,1145,263]]]'>Defendant’s counsel tried again: “Q. You don’t understand me. You went up the sidewalk until you got up to where Bekitch’s car was opposite you? A. Yes. Q. Right straight ahead? A. Yes, right in front of me. Q. Then you went between the parked cars? A. Yes.”</p>
    <p id="b242-8" data-blocks='[["BL_242.9",242,[234,2041,1146,153]]]'>And now comes the cross-examiner’s pitch: “Going over to Bekitch’s car?” In other words, going straight ahead to Beldtch’s car without looking.</p>
    <p id="b242-9" data-blocks='[["BL_242.10",242,[219,2212,1158,155]]]'>But Nikola saw the curve in the cross-examiner’s throw and he replied: “No. <em>I look. </em>I didn’t go right away.”</p>

      <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>The cross-examiner now tried another curve: “There was a space between the parked cars and the Bekitch car to which you were going, is that right?”</p>
    <p id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[160,513,1148,484]]]'>This was obviously intended to letch an affirmative answer which could be interpreted as. showing ■ that Nikola pushed out through the open space, not looking, not heeding, not watching out for oncoming cars. But the answer was not what the cross-examiner expected. Nikola was careless about grammar, but not careless about the manner in which he crossed the street. He replied: “I get out between the ears, and <em>then I look, </em>and after I see it was far enough I could make it — ”</p>
    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.6",243,[157,1008,1147,365]]]'>Here the cross-examiner more or less gave up. However, he had not failed. Although he was unable to confuse Nikola, he did succeed in convincing the trial court that, somehow, Nikola was guilty of contributory negligence, not because of what Nikola said but because of what the court did not take the time to understand what Nikola said.</p>
    <p id="b243-6" data-blocks='[["BL_243.7",243,[156,1390,1148,325]]]'>Thus, although Nikola’s natural intelligence and adherence to the simple truth saved him from the bear traps laid down by the cross-examiner, it did not save him from tumbling into the pit of an overly-meticulous juridic-technical appraisement of his stumbling vocabulary.</p>
    <p id="b243-7" data-blocks='[["BL_243.8",243,[157,1723,1155,483]]]'>And so, I end this dissent as I began, namely: When one is contemplating crossing a street he should first take stock of his educational equipment and ask himself certain questions: Will he be able to cope with the intricacies of the English language on the witness stand? Will the judge understand what he is saying, with his heart but only falteringly, with his tongue? Will he be able to describe what he did so that it cannot be twisted into seemingly something else?</p>

Then, if he crosses the street and is hurt, and he has a good case, he will be able to describe in faultless English and impeccable grammar, unblemished by confusing contributing clauses and split infinitives, just what happened to him. And then, when the verdict is returned in his favor, Justice will remove her blindfold and smile at this demonstration of perfection in an imperfect world.</p>
