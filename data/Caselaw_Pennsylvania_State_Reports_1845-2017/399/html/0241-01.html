In resolving this question two inquiries must be pursued: first, to determine whether, within the four corners of this will, the testator evidenced <em>any </em>intent that Howard Holton’s adopted children should be included in or excluded from the word “children” and, if such intent is evidenced, it will prevail; second, in the absence of any evidence of tes<a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>tator’s intent, expressed or implied, in the will, to determine the impact of section 16(b) of the Wills Act of 1917<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> upon the construction and interpretation of this will.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[148,573,1151,1568]]]'>An examination of the language of this will reveals no manifest <em>expression </em>of the testator’s intent in this respect; if such intent is present it must arise by <em>implication. </em>The appellants contend that an implication of an intent on the part of the testator to include adopted children within the word “children” arises both from the language of the eleventh paragraph of the will and from a comparison of the language of paragraphs eleventh and twelfth. The appellants argue that in the eleventh paragraph when the testator used the word “descendants” in juxtaposition with the words “child” and “children” he used such words synonymously, and, since we held in <em>Collins </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/393/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="393 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="1279727" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0195-01">393 Pa. 195</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=142%20A.2d%20178" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="142 A.2d 178">142 A. 2d 178</a>, that the word “descendants” may include adopted children, <em>Collins </em>should control and the words “child” or “children” likewise be held inclusive of an adopted child or children. From a study of the language of this will it is apparent that <em>Collins </em>is wholly inapposite. Testator did not use “descendants” synonymously with “child” or “children”; it is clear that the testator’s reference to “child” or “children” was to members of a third generation class while his reference to “descendants” was to members of a fourth generation class. Judge Lefever in the court below aptly stated: “. . . it is clear that the only rights of [the adopted children] are as <em>children or descendants of deceased children </em>of [Howard Holton]. They cannot by implication elevate themselves into a broader class described as ‘descendants’ . . .”.</p>

Holton — when compared with the testator’s use of the word “descendants” in the eleventh paragraph is most significant. According to appellants, this significance lies in the fact that “issue” denotes only actual physical offspring, while “descendants” may include adopted children and the testator, a well trained lawyer, must have employed these different words to indicate an intent in the twelfth paragraph to provide for his deceased son’s natural children and in the eleventh paragraph by the broad term “descendants” to provide for possible adopted children. Such a contention is without merit. The eleventh and twelfth paragraphs each provide dissimilar gifts for entirely dissimilar situations; it is obvious that the testator selected language which would be appropriate for each different situation. No significance can be attached to this variation in language.</p>

Corr died in 1912 leaving a will executed in 1906; he created a testamentary trust for his daughter for life and gave her a power to appoint among her “children and descendants of children”; he provided a gift oyer if she died “leaving no children or descendants of children”. The daughter had no natural children but adopted a son in 1930, eighteen years after Corr’s death. The daughter’s attempt to exercise her power of appointment in favor of her adopted son was held invalid. This Court stated (p. 340) : “Prior to the passage of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P.L. 403, it was the established rule that adopted children could not participate in. testamentary gifts to ‘children’: [citing cases]. As the testator died five years before the effective date of the Wills Act, this is the rule that must govern the interpretation of his will. <em>But even if the Wills Act [1917] were applicable here, Seidle’s position would be no better, because that statute modifies the former rule of construction only as to persons adopted before the execution of the will.

This being so, it is obvious he was not limiting the scope of his will only to children in existence at the time he wrote his will.

Thus, this inescapable logical development produces an incongruous situation which it seems to me should be difficult for the Majority to explain away, namely, that adopted children of a deceased child (that is, the great grandchildren of Mr. Holton) may qualify as beneficiaries, whereas adopted children of Howard himself may not qualify.

In not so limiting the term “descendants,” Mr. Holton clearly manifested his intention not to use the term “children” in the sense of natural children.
