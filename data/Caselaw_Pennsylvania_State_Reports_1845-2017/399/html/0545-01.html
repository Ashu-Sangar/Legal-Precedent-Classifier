He served as a Commissioner from that date until June, 1955, without receiving any compensation for services rendered in that position. On December 12, 1947, the members of the Commission, ten in number, elected him to serve as á member of the Executive Committee, which was part of the active operating administration of the Commission. The Executive Committee, six in number, consisted entirely of members of the Commission. Beginning in February, 1948, he was compensated, as a member of said committee, through and including June, 1955, for “extra services” allegedly performed by him, as follows: $1,100 for 1948; $1,800 for 1949 and 1950, each; $3,600 for 1951 in equal amounts from the “Revenue Fund” and the “Construction Fund”; $4,500 for 1952 paid in amounts of $1,800 and $2,700, respectively, from the same two funds; the same amount in the years 1953 and 1954 paid entirely from the “Revenue Fund”; and, $2,250 from the same source for the months of January through June, 1955.</p>

It is by virtue of the legislation of Pennsylvania enabling its creation that this Commission is designated a body <em>corporate and politic. </em>No support for appellant’s position can be gleaned from the language of the Dauphin County court in <em>Carver v. Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, </em>70 Dauphin 114 (1957), wherein the court, dismissing appellant’s petition for a declaratory judgment with respect to the legality of the same payments made to him that are herein in question, said at 116: “. . . the defendant is a separate corporate entity and not the alter ■ ego . of the Commonwealth. While it is the ‘instrumentality’ and ‘agent’ of the Commonwealth, it is not the Commonwealth.” Accepting this characterization of appellee as true, we can nevertheless not escape the inevitable conclusion <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>that appellee, though separate and not the Commonwealth, is indeed public in nature and purpose.</p>
    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[160,477,1147,1352]]]'>Appellant contends that the Commission was not able, on its own, to award salaries to its members, that it was “harnessed” by a strict “Trust Indenture” by the terms of which payments to its members could be made only upon recommendations by its consulting engineers, and that payments were in fact made, not by the Commission but, by the Trustee. There is no merit in this contention. The Trust Indenture, after providing that payments from the Revenue Fund could be made only after a requisition and certificate, properly signed by certain Commissioners, were first filed with the Trustee, specifically states: “Upon receipt of each requisition and accompanying certificate the Trustee <em>shall </em>pay each such obligation. . . .” Clearly, no discretion lay with the Trustee, following the transmittal of the requisition and certificate, to allow or disallow payments thereby called for. Indeed, an exhibit on the record, being a photostatic copy of a duplicate of one such requisition, addressed to the Trustee and signed <em>on behalf of the Commission </em>by “Alex R. Miller and Doris S. Jones” is notice that, “You are hereby <em>directed </em>to pay For Payroll Purposes the sum of. . . .” Mr. Miller, who signed in the capacity of chairman, was himself on the payroll of the Commission as a member of the Executive Committee.</p>

The Commission by law was obligated to forward written reports annually to the Governor of Pennsylvania. Mr. Carver’s commission came to him from the office of the Governor. It was solely through legislative authority on the part of <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>the two states, which were parties to the compact, that the Commission came into existence. The action of the Commission in creating salaries for its own members (salaries not otlienvise authorized), clearly ultra vires, brings this case squarely within the rule of this Court with respect thereto announced in the early case of <em>Commonwealth v. Mayor of Lancaster, </em><a href="/watts/5/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="5 Watts 152" data-case-ids="1844062" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0152-01">5 Watts 152</a> (1836), and <em>Lawson v. Allegheny County, </em><a href="/pa/326/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="326 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1174481" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0242-01">326 Pa. 242</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.%20600" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="191 A. 600">191 Atl. 600</a> (1937). Obvious dictates of public policy militate against the propriety of members of a commission, created as a body corporate and politic, in attempting to accomplish by indirection the exercise of a power given them neither directly nor by necessary implication. Especially must this be so when the ends sought to be attained are directed toward the personal aggrandizement of the body as individuals.</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[256,1239,1149,1139]],["BL_573.1",573,[162,370,1151,814]]]'>Appellant’s reliance on paragraph (p), 36 PS §3401, Art. II, which granted to the Commission “all other powers,” not inconsistent Avith the Constitution of either state or of the United States, reasonably necessary or incidental to the effectuation of its authorized purposes, Avas properly discouraged in <em>Commonwealth v. Miller et al., </em>7 Bucks Co. L. Rp., 170, 181 (1957), whereat the foilOAving appears: “Defendants would have us hold that the effect of this phraseology permits this public corporate instrumentality to conduct its affairs as if it were a private corporation, and thus pay whatever salaries it deems necessary to the commissioners. It is clear to us that a reading of the compact as a whole negatives any such construction. Any theory under which the commissioners by virtue of their appointment might use the funds derived from the public for their own personal benefit is entirely repugnant to the purposes of the enabling act and the compact entered into by virtue thereof.” Similarly Avell reasoned is the opinion of the court below as expressed in <em>Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission v. </em>
      <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>Miller, 9 Bucks Co. L. Rep., 104 (1959), referred to in the opinion of Judge Biester, wherein he said: “To adopt the theory advanced by the defendant, the absurd result would be reached that this public corporate instrumentality, exercising important governmental functions, might be operated for the aggrandizement and personal benefit of its individual members . . . the commission has the right to function as a private corporation <em>within its framework as a public corporation. </em>It was not intended that by the insertion of the clause in question the whole public structure would be obliterated. Actually the phrase used points up the public nature of the corporation, for if it were a private corporation the language used in par. (p) would be inapposite and meaningless.”</p>
    <p id="b573-4" data-blocks='[["BL_573.5",573,[163,1195,1149,867]]]'>Appellant refers us to Article X(i) of the enabling legislation (Act of June 13, 1947, P. L. 592, §1), which provides that no member of the Commission shall be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of any act or omission of the Commission. While at first blush this provision would seem to set up a roadblock to these proceedings, it is clear that the Legislature simply meant to confer upon the Commissioners the same protection generally enjoyed by officers of a private corporation. But, no less certainly, individual commissioners remain individually responsible for the ultra vires acts of the Commission. It cannot seriously be urged that the provision in question completely protects the commissioners from suits brought to remedy wrongs perpetrated by the Commission without any legal authority whatever.</p>
