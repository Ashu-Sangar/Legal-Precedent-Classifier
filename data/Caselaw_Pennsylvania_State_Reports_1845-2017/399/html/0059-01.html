The instant record is clear that the book value of Laurel Hosiery Company was not an accurate indicia of the market value of the common stock.. Prior to the sale of this stock, the Laurel Hosiery Company had outstanding unpaid dividends of $76,000 owed to the holders of its first preferred stock, which dividends, had they not been waived in contemplation of the sale, would have considerably reduced the book value. For approximately two years prior to the sale the Laurel Hosiery Company books showed a steady and progressive reduction of sales, increased sales and manufacturing costs and the net losses of operation at the close of the year 1954 amounted to $101,702.13. An accountant testified that the losses of the corporation, had they continued to exist at the rate experienced over several years, would have completely wiped out the book value of the stock within one and one-half to two years. Furthermore, the Laurel Hosiery Company was suddenly confronted with changes in style of products, fabrics and costs which rendered its plants and method of production obsolete.

When this problem was brought to my attention, the trust officers had already had a night session, at which <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>time they jointly with Mr. Lerch and Mr. Carll<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> tabulated the possible value of a piecemeal liquidation of the assets .... I personally do not pose as an expert on what a mass sale of full-fashioned hosiery will bring [i.e., inventory]; I have had some knowledge of what hosiery equipment — machinery—brings on piecemeal liquidation. The estimate of the piecemeal liquidation of all the machinery looked reasonable to me. I might say at this point, at the time I made that decision, I had previously received a telephone call from Mr. Bowman, of Berkshire Knitting Mills, that he would be willing to pay $5,000 for each of the twenty-five machines. I said ‘Fine, I think other people would pay that too; would you buy the other machines?’ No. ... I took into consideration that our estimate was under the .$5,-000 that Mr. Bowman or Mr. Master would be willing to pay . . ., and I arrived at the conclusion that the offer we had, which was a certainty for the stock, against an offer for the seamless and indicated interest for certain of the full-fashioned machines, but no assurance of values beyond that, for the inventory in process, raw material, and the rest of the equipment or the real estate, that it would be better to take the fixed offer for the stock, than to take the chances on liquidation coupled with the further two adverse factors : when you embark upon a liquidation . . . and the trade knows that once you announce you are liquidating and you have no alternate use for either the machinery or the inventory or the real estate, you at once get at the mercy of what I call the vultures of liquidation because they, knowing you are faced with the fixed daily charges of carrying unproductive assets, they wait around with a firm offer, knowing you inevitably will be forced into taking less”. Our study of this <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>record leads us to the conclusion that the trustee acted in a reasonable and prudent manner in its choice of a sale rather than a piecemeal liquidation of the corporate assets.

The duty of <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>loyalty which an officer and director owes to a corporation does not absolutely preclude such officer or director from dealing with the corporation.

The agreement herein mentioned was entered into with the full knowledge and approval of all the directors and the shareholders. To establish that the trustee was negligent in the ratification of this action by the Board of Directors, it Avas incumbent upon appellant to affirmatively prove that the agreement was a fraud upon her rights. There is no evidence that the trustee failed to act except in the utmost good faith or that the beneficial interests in the trustee-held stock Avere deceived in any manner as to the transactions between the corporation and its President. As a matter of fact, the agreement and the subsequent payments pursuant thereto indicate an intent to equitably apportion between the corporation and the owners of the machines the earnings received upon the sale of hosiery manufactured on such machines.</p>

The record then shows that twenty-one of these machines were installed prior to June 1954 and only four of the machines installed subsequent thereto. The option held by the Laurel Hosiery Company was to be exercised within one year of the date of installation of these machines. The record does not disclose whether, prior to June 24, 1955, the trustee, on its representation on the board of directors, learned of the offer made to E. J. Lerch for the purchase of the twenty-four seamless machines. If the trustee did know of this offer it was under a duty to transmit this knowledge to the other directors of Laurel and the directors (including the trustee) would then have been under a duty to exercise the option and resell the machines. Appellee’s claim that funds were not available for this purpose is without merit: for example, the proceeds from the stock sale would have been one source from which funds for such purpose could have been secured. Had the directors (including the trustee’s representative on the board) exercised this option a profit of approximately $24,000 could have been realized without delay and this trust estate enriched thereby to the extent of its pro-rata share of such profit. On the other hand if the trustee did not learn of this offer to sell or the sale until after the stock had been sold then at the time it did so learn it should have taken steps to recover from Lerch the profit the corporation would <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>have realized had Lereh, in accordance with his fiduciary duty as a director, made a timely and full disclosure of the offer to purchase these machines to the directors while they still could have exercised the option. The failure of the trustee to take any action in respect to this matter constituted negligent conduct on its part for which it should be surcharged to the extent of the loss suffered by the estate.</p>

For the purpose of clarification of the record in these respects the record must be remanded to the court below and, upon such clarification being made, the court beloAV, consonant with this court’s opinion, should enter a surcharge against the trustee.</p>

In its finding that the shares had a book value of $280 per share the court below utterly failed to take into consideration factors of record bearing directly on book value, such as the effect on book value of the $76,000 owed by the Company on its first preferred stock dividends, the established pattern of the heavy losses in operation of the Company, etc.</p>
