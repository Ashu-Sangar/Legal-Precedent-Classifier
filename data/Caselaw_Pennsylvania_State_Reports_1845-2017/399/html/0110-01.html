Woods, the wounded “taller” man who had fallen several times en route to this point, was helped into the car by appellant.

The bullet which fatally wounded Woods was traced to Max Gordon’s gun. “Tony” Scoleri’s gun was never recovered; however, there was evidence that, prior to, during and subsequent to the hold-up, “Tony” Scoleri had in his possession a .32 calibre automatic gun and the autopsy on Max Gordon’s body revealed the presence of two .32 calibre bullets.</p>

In addition thereto, the trial judge made his own personal observations of appellant and his actions and suggested to defense counsel that they have a medical examination by a doctor of their own choice, a suggestion defense counsel did not accept. When trial was resumed appellant was continuously in the courtroom and the <em>record does not reveal any evidence that appellant at any time lost consciousness hut, on the contrary, illustrated an awareness of his surroundings. </em>The best available medical advice was that appellant’s mental and physical condition justified resumption of the trial; examination of the record leads to the conclusion that appellant was simply malingering. Not only does the record clearly negate appellant’s contention that the trial court did not exercise any discretion under the circumstances but it shows conclusively that the trial was resumed only after, by personal observation and upon competent medical advice, the trial judge was satisfied as to appellant’s fitness to stand trial.

Granted the salutary effect of this new legislation, does it. necessarily follow that its provisions should be made applicable to capital cases where, prior to the passage of the legislation, a defendant has been tried, found guilty of murder in the first degree and judgment of sentence entered but, at the time of the passage of the statute, an appeal from such judgment of sentence is pending?

The instant statute not only lacks a clear and manifest expression of intent that it be construed retroactively, but it does not contain any such implication. In the second place, since the 1959 statute is amendatory, Section 73, art. V of the Statutory Construction Act applies: “Whenever a section or part of a law is amended, the amendment shall be construed as merging into the original law, become a part there<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>of, and replace the part amended and the remainder of the original law and the amendment shall he read together and viewed as one law passed at one time; but the portions of the law which were not altered by the amendment shall be construed as effective from the time of their original enactment, <em>and the new provisions shall be construed as effective only from the date when the amendment became effective.” </em>(Emphasis supplied) Hence amendatory statutes are construed retroactively <em>only </em>if such construction is clearly indicated under the provisions of the statute: <em>Rupert v.

In <em>Day, </em>supra, the relator in a habeas corpus proceeding, convicted of burglary in 1946, had been sentenced to the Pennsylvania Industrial School under a statute which required him to serve a 20 year maximum term unless sooner released by the Pardon Board; in 1953 the legislature passed an amendatory statute limiting the duration of a sentence to the Industrial School to a 6 year term; the Superior Court rejected relator’s contention that the 1953 statute operated retroactively to reduce his duly imposed sentence. In <em>Voci, </em>supra, we did not apply retroactively a statute prohibiting the introduction of evidence secured by wiretap in any Pennsylvania court to proceedings then pending on appeal in which Yoci had been convicted on the basis of <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>evidence obtained by wiretapping. The fact that the question was not directly raised in <em>Yoci </em>did not affect the result. In <em>Bishop, </em>supra, Bishop was tried and convicted of murder in the first degree and the penalty fixed at death; subsequently and during the pendency of an appeal to this Court, the legislature passed a statute which permitted a jury, after a conviction of murder in the first degree, to fix the penalty either at life or death, whereas when defendant was tried and convicted a verdict of murder in the first degree automatically carried with it the imposition of the death penalty. Even though the jury had requested leniency-in a note addressed to the court — this Court stated: “As this was prior to the Act of May 14, 1925, neither the court nor jury had any discretion in fixing the penalty for first degree murder.” (p. 59)</p>

If [the legislature] may authorize boards of inspectors to disregard judicial sentences, why may they not repeal chem as fast as they are pronounced, and thus assume the highest judicial functions? It is to be observed that these questions have no reference to the power of the legislature to prescribe a general rule of law that <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>shall be inconsistent with a previous judicial decree. <em>Such a rule, when it operates on future cases and not retrospectively, is quite legitimate. </em>Their power to legislate in that manner is not to be doubted. . . .

The judge, who <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>had watched the doctor as he examined the defendant, made his own medical observations:</p>

The fact that the doctor said that the defendant was <em>“beginning </em>to speak spontaneously” clearly implies that from 7:30 until 9:15 he could not speak spontaneously and therefore could not communicate with his attorney while evidence was being presented in his case. The fact that the doctor used the word “otherwise” indicates that Scoleri could have been lacking complete awareness. The doctor emphasized this concept when, in answer to the judge’s question as to whether the defendant was <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>capable of understanding, the doctor replied: “More so than he was possibly five hours ago.”</p>

These are Mr. McClain’s words: “If the Court please, I object to any rebuttal being produced by the Commonwealth in the present condition of this defendant.

The judge said: “I have been advised before we brought him in that he was able to consult. I have been advised by the doctors. A doctor is here in attendance, and he has stated that since that time he is better able than he was five hours ago, which antedated the time we started this session by two hours, and you notice this, he asked for water, and he asked for a blanket, and inasmuch as some of the testimony has been taken within his presence and within his hearing, I do not propose to have this case interrupted any longer.

Whether defense counsel did or did not find an opportunity to obtain a doctor during the day was entirely irrelevant to the issue the judge should have decided, namely: Was the defendant in condition to go on with the trial at that time? Defense counsel could have been a hundred per cent improvident in attending to his duties, but such improvidence should not become a yoke to fasten on the defendant.

Defense counsel, who, of course, is an officer of the court, made the categorical and definitive statement that the defendant was in such condition that he could not consult with his lawyer to discuss the Commonwealth’s evidence aimed at sending him to the electric chair. Neither the Commonwealth nor the judge disproved <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>defense counsel’s statement in this regard. Thus, considering defense counsel’s unimpeachable standing at the bar, his statement must be accepted as true. And this brings us to the horrifying conclusion that the Commonwealth produced evidence against one standing trial on a capital charge during the time that he could not hear, could not understand, and was entirely unaware of what was being said.

The evidence presented by the Commonwealth against the defendant when, according to the undenied statement of defense counsel, the defendant was incapable of comprehending what was taking place, was of an extremely vital character.

While Scoleri lay unconscious, at the very brink of an eternal judgment, on that crucial night of his trial, the Commonwealth produced a witness, Franklin M. Caraker, parole officer, who testified that two days before, and a day after, the murder, he had seen Scoleri walking and had detected no limp or abnormality in his stride. Another witness, John Santarpio, also testified in behalf of the prosecution. The testimony of both witnesses covers 36 pages in the trial transcript and consumed about thirty minutes, during which time the defendant lay inertly on the floor like a log.</p>
