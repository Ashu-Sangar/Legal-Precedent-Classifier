Limiting the wife’s right merely to appoint to one of a limited class selected by settlor-testator would nullify the reason for the remedial Act and would make a mockery of the legislative intent to prevent a husband defrauding his wife of all or a part of his personal property by (what is generally called) an active inter vivos trust.

The Court’s opinion will be searched in vain for the use of the word “vested”, or for any discussion of whether the gift to the charities was vested. That case involved three questions: (1) Was a special power of appointment which was given by a donor who was domiciled in Pennsylvania to a donee who was domiciled in California governed, if and when exercised by the donee, by the law of California, or by the law of Pennsylvania? (2) Did the donee have a power to appoint that particular estate and if so, did he validly execute the power? (3) If the power was not validly exercised, should the estate of the donor over which the donee mistakenly thought he had a power of appointment, be awarded under the doctrine of cy pres to three educational institutions or to four? . .</p>
