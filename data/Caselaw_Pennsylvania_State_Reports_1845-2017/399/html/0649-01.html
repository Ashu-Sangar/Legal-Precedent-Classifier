You boys realize that instead of taking the income from the business, I have left it in the business and permitted more than fair salaries to be paid to those of you who are active in the business. Not only have I left the earnings in the business, but I have also loaned the business from my own personal cash certain amounts, and all of this is now being left to you boys for your personal benefit. Each of you will get a share of that total. . . . Now I feel that the amounts that each of you will receive from what I left in the business will more than make up for the shares which your sisters receive. . . .”</p>

    <p id="b676-5" data-blocks='[["BL_676.6",676,[240,958,1153,1417]]]'>The decree is affirmed on the following excerpts from the opinion of Judge Nixon of the court below: “A careful reading of the Agreement, with its exhibits, discloses that the parties to said Agreement recognized that there were many substantial questions as to the disposition made by Austin Givens of his estate. In order to eliminate the litigation that would have been necessary to have an adjudication of the respective rights of the parties, they entered into this Agreement. So far as the parties to this proceeding are concerned, it provides that all of the assets of his business were to be turned over to a corporation to be known as Austin Givens, Inc., with Rose Givens holding the stock as trustee. In the stock of the Corporation Rose Givens had a life estate and the five sons were the remaindermen. There are, however, a few distinct characteristics to the life estate of Rose Givens different from those of an ordinary life estate in stock of the corporation. The main distinction was that she had an absolute right to manage the Corporation and to determine what dividends, if any, were to be paid by the Corporation. Any dividends paid were to be her individual property. However, before any dividends could be paid on the stock, certain deferred salaries owing to four of the children had to be paid from the earning’s of the Corporation.</p>

      <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>“The uncontradicted testimony discloses that Mrs. Givens, from the time the Corporation was formed until her death, was active in the affairs of the Corporation and was paid a salary, the amount of which was fixed by her. It also shows that she was at all times advised by her attorney, a member of the Bar of this Court, as to her rights under the Agreement. None of the deferred salaries were ever paid. The record is devoid of any evidence to indicate that Mrs. Givens had at any time determined that there was any surplus or profits of the corporation available for the payment of dividends or deferred salaries. On the contrary, there is uncontradicted evidence that she elected to take a salary in lieu of her right to declare dividends.</p>
