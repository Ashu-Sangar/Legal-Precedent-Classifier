Among decedent’s debts was a note to one Mertz, of which decedent was co-maker: its original amount was $663. On Marcli 20, 1943, seven days after the four year period mentioned in the will had expired, Harlan paid off the balance of this debt, $153. He then deeded the small house and its half acre to himself and his wife.</p>

He worked the farms, sold milk, collected rents from cottages, and any other available sources just as his father would have done had he lived, hot just for four years, but for five years, and with the money so received, kept the farms in operation and paid off his father’s debts.</p>

    <p id="b221-4" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[148,472,1146,976]]]'>Looking inward at,the will from its four corners, we think it clear that the decedent meant to pnt Harlan in control and to reward him accordingly: the grandchildren, once reared, could take care of themselves and were given the balance of the real estate, amounting to about half of it. The “as is” provision in Paragraph Fourth obviously was intended to designate the small house and its bit of land as the source from which to clear the estate of debt by sale if necessary, but to leave it as part of the 99-aere tract if there was no debt. The exemption of this house and land from Paragraph Sixth was designed to be consistent with Paragraph Fourth as a method if paying debts. If there were debts after four years, the house could be considered as converted realty which would pass to Harlan as personalty under Paragraph Second. We regard this not only as the intent of the decedent but as the meaning of his words.</p>
    <p id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.6",221,[149,1458,1145,924]],["BL_222.1",222,[250,360,1142,89]]]'>Appellants accuse Harlan of bad faith, as if he had withheld the small debt of |153 until the end of the four years in order to keep the property debt-ridden and subject to conveyance. The- court below found otherwise and we agree that there is no reasonable cause, against the background of Harlan’s faithful management of the estate, to single out one incident and- call it self-dealing. Even if Paragraph Fourth be construed to require a sale, it could be said that Harlan had advanced the purchase price over the years of managing the farms and paying taxes and debts out of his own funds and out of his share of the proceeds. Finally, taking appellants’ argument that “if the debts were paid off then the real estate was not to be sold but (was) to remain ‘as is’”, the debt-paying scheme of Paragraphs Fourth and Sixth did not come into play at all and the small house and land remained part <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>of the 99 acres and passed to Harlan under Paragraph Sixth.</p>
