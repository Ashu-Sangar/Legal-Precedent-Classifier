Although it appears from the record that the Commonwealth was content to rest its case upon the basis of these written documents, nevertheless the Commonwealth did call two witnesses. J. S.

Specifically, relator claims that the hearing judge was unfair and partial in three respects: (1) when he stated: “I am not going to tolerate these dilatory tactics any further. I have a long list. I am not going to make a big case out of this. There is no honest defense to this, and you know it”; (2) when he stated: “I am going to cut this [relator’s counsel] cross-examination [of Yallely] short”; (3) ivhen he refused to grant relator’s motion for a continuance of the hearing for the purpose of presentation of alibi witnesses.</p>

On July 30, 1959, relator was originally brought before Judge McClanaghan and at that time relator’s counsel told the court that he was going to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Upon that representation of counsel, relator was released from custody upon posting of bail in the amount of $500. Despite relator’s counsel’s representation to the court, no petition for a writ of habeas corpus was presented until November 5, 1959 — three months and five days after relator had been before Judge McClanaghan.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>On November 6, 1959 — although the return day of the writ of habeas corpus was November 13, 1959— the parties appeared before Judge Hagan and at that time relator’s counsel stated of record: “We have no objection to it being heard today”. The Commonwealth then proceeded with its case and produced the four exhibits, supra, and the witness Desmond. At this point it must be observed that the record before Judge Hagan indicated that the Governor of New York, in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, supra, had officially represented to the Governor of this Commonwealth that (1) the relator was charged with the commission of three crimes in the State of New York; (2) that the relator had been present in the State of New York on the date of the alleged commission of the crime, i.e., October 29, 1956; (3) that relator was a fugitive from the State of New York. Desmond’s testimony then unequivocally identified relator as the person and individual named in the requisition papers. At that point in the hearing relator’s counsel requested that “the prosecutor [Yallely] do something or other” and it was at that time the hearing judge made the first remark concerning which relator now complains. In view of the dilatory tactics pursued by relator’s counsel and the clear and precise proof, through the medium of the written documents and Desmond’s oral testimony that relator was in fact the person named in the requisition papers of the Governor of the State of New York, the hearing judge’s remark is understandable. It is evident that relator’s counsel, under the guise of a writ of habeas corpus, was attempting to secure a determination of relator’s guilt or innocence of the offense with which he was charged in New York and for which he was being held for extradition.</p>
    <p id="b485-3" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[171,2256,1145,100]],["BL_486.1",486,[233,357,1147,1120]]]'>Following the hearing judge’s remark, Yallely testified. Upon completion of his testimony in chief, and <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>after he had answered twenty-nine questions on cross-examination, the hearing judge cut short the cross-examination. Up to that point Yallely had clearly and unequivocally identified relator as having been in the State of New York on October 29, 1956, the time of his alleged commission of the crime charged against him there. When the hearing judge put an end to the cross-examination, relator’s counsel was attempting to discredit Vallely’s <em>original </em>identification of relator by photographs in New York. The identification of relator as the person who had been in New York when the crime was committed was complete and what relator’s counsel Avas then attempting to do was discredit Yallely’s testimony, a matter for the courts of the demanding state rather than the courts of the asylum state. The issue before Judge Hagan was whether relator was in the State of New York when the alleged crimes were committed and not whether relator was guilty or innocent of the commission of such crimes. The hearing judge very properly cut short relator’s counsel’s cross-examination.</p>
    <p id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[233,1499,1145,752]]]'>Relator further complains that the hearing judge refused a motion for a continuance for the purpose of the production of Avitnesses to show that relator was not in the State of New York on October 29, 1956. Relator’s counsel had already informed the court of his willingness to proceed. A hearing of the witnesses Avhose presence relator’s counsel desired would have been of importance on the question of relator’s guilt or innocence of the commission of these crimes and not his amenability to extradition. The question of the continuance of this hearing Avas a matter within the discretion of the hearing judge and we find on this record no circumstances indicating that he abused his discretion in this respect.</p>

The Commonwealth had requested that four exhibits be marked for identification: (1) the “Governor’s warrant”; (2) the “warrant for the arrest of the relator”; (3) the requisition papers of the Governor of New York; (4) “the affidavit of the Governor of New York” authorizing two named New York City detectives to arrest relator. After these four exhibits had been marked for identification and after Commonwealth’s counsel had referred to the contents of the requisition papers, Commonwealth’s counsel then stated to the court: “I move this <em>exhibit </em>into evidence”. (Emphasis supplied). From this remark relator’s counsel now argues that <em>only </em>exhibit 3 — the requisition papers — were offered and received into evidence. The record furnishes no foundation for this argument. Immediately after Commonwealth’s counsel had made this statement he referred the hearing judge to <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Mills v. Baldi, </em><a href="/pa-super/166/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="166 Pa. Super. 321" data-case-ids="468742" data-case-paths="/pa-super/166/0321-01">166 Pa.

(Emphasis supplied). It. is clear and explicit that Commonwealth’s counsel meant and that the hearing judge and relator’s counsel so understood that <em>all four exhibits </em>of the Commonwealth had been received in evidence. The hearing judge in his opinion stated: “At the hearing the Commonwealth introduced in evidence the warrant of the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania (Exhibit No. 1), the warrant for the arrest of the defendant (Exhibit No. 2), and the warrant of the Governor of the State of New York (Exhibit No. 3)”. All four exhibits were properly in evidence and part of the record before the <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>hearing judge. Furthermore, at no time in the court below did relator’s counsel allege or contend that the Commonwealth had failed to introduce these exhibits into evidence. We cannot entertain such a complaint at this time and, furthermore, if we could, the record shows that such complaint is without merit.</p>

    <p id="b490-5" data-blocks='[["BL_490.5",490,[228,1503,1146,702]]]'>The fact that the judge had a long list of untried cases was entirely irrelevant and did not justify his giving the case presently before him inadequate attention and consideration. Justice cannot be measured by the number of cases decided, but only by the number of cases decided correctly or, at least, tried with all constitutional safeguards protected. The surgeon who neglects proper hygienic and antiseptic preparations for operations, because he has an excess of patients, might better serve humanity by operating on less people and curing them than by cutting into more people and leaving them in worse shape than before picking up the scalpel.</p>

In the <em>Dronsfield </em>case, supra, we affirmed the lower court’s finding to the effect that: “The evidence is overwhelmingly to the effect that the relator was not in Winslow, Arizona, or in any other part of Arizona on June 2, 1951, and that his identification as the man who cashed the check in Starr’s jewelry store in Winslow, Arizona, was so weak as to be unworthy of belief by this court.”</p>

We have seen in the case at bar that the New York detective’s identification of Pacewicz was inconclusive since he had no personal contact with the defendant and actually only testified to hearsay. Later, in the hearing, a man by the name of Harold Yallely stated that he had seen the defendant two or three times in October, 1956, had not seen him since, and had identified him by photograph about a year prior to the hearing.</p>

Under this standard, a hopeless imbecile could come into court and point a shaking finger at a high church dignitary of the purest character and unblemished reputation, and, upon that showing, the dignitary would be powerless to resist extradition. Under this criterion of proof a malefactor, <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>perjurer and criminal could point to anyone he chose as the victim of his intended malefactions and, according to the Majority reasoning, such skeleton procedure would be enough to force the victim into another state.

If one counts the number of “Q’s” in the record, it is true that they total up to 29, but this, I submit, is no way of determining whether the cross-examination was adequate under the circumstances. Even 129 questions might not be enough in a given case. It so happens here, however, that the statement the cross-examiner put 29 questions is misleading, because, to some of the questions the Commonwealth interposed objections, and the objections were sustained by the Court. For instance: “Q. Now, did you ever supply the police with the name of Edmund Pacewicz? Mr. Balka: Objected to. The Court: Objection sustained.”</p>

    <p id="b493-6" data-blocks='[["BL_493.6",493,[158,727,1148,472]]]'>If the prosecuting witness gave no description to the police of the alleged culprit, how did the police pick up Pacewicz and how did they know that they had the right man? Of course, the police could have gotten a description of the man through an identifying photograph, but here we come to the crux of the court’s failure in this case. Mr. Levy asked the prosecuting witness: “At that time you were shown a photograph?” and the witness answered: “Yes.”</p>
    <p id="b493-7" data-blocks='[["BL_493.7",493,[156,1220,1150,425]]]'>Then defendant’s counsel asked: “How many photographs were you shown?” This was a perfectly proper and, in fact, indispensable question, because if the police showed him only one photograph, this would be no test of identification at all.

A cross-examination may be cut short when it ceases being a search for truth, and becomes, instead, a vehicle for abuse, purposeless argumentation and meaningless repetition, but the record reveals no such faults on the part of the cross-examiner here. Judicial and police authorities should <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>realize that it is a very serious matter to seize a man in his home, take him from his employment, wrest him from his companions, uproot all his family and social obligations, disorganize his whole life, both present and future, to transport him to another State (even though eventually he might be acquitted), when there is the possibility that he is not the person sought. And the least right that can be afforded the accused in such a situation is to permit him to cross-examine thoroughly the accuser to determine if he might not be mistaken, might not have erred, might not have stumbled.</p>

After the Commonwealth had produced the extradition papers, the judge ruled that the Commonwealth had made out a prima facie case. Of course, it is rudimentary that this is not so. The papers are a mere nothing until the defendant in court is identified as the person named in the papers. Accordingly, defendant’s counsel expressed amazement at the court’s observation and he remarked: “Do I understand, though no one has identified the defendant in this case — ”</p>
