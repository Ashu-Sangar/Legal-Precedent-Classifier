Furthermore, these engineers advised that the contemplated construction and financing of this project would place an unnecessary and unjustifiable burden upon a majority of the property owners for the benefit of a relatively few property owners whose sewage may have been polluting waters of the Commonwealth; that a third pumping station to eliminate the pollution of waters of the Commonwealth (proposed to be constructed within three years) would require additional sewer facilities presently not economically feasible and impossible to accomplish within the three year period; that the average property owner in the tri-borough area — with an average annual income of $3,800' — cannot financially bear the estimated initial expense of $1,000 in addition to the estimated annual minimum sewage rental of $69.40.</p>

Presumptively, these officials must be regarded as acting properly and for the public good. Absent any allegations in this complaint of either fraud or misconduct and absent any allegations of fact which would indicate that these municipal officials have acted or are acting either in abuse of their power or in a capricious or arbitrary manner, judicial intervention cannot be justified. To label the actions of these officials as capricious or arbitrary does not make them so. A hearing might indicate that the proposed plan is not as complete as it might be, that it involves a greater expenditure of money than the results would justify or that it was unwise at this time to enter upon such a plan. However, the determination of such facts has been placed in the first instance in the discretion and judgment of the Authority and Borough officials and upon them has been placed responsibility under the law for such determination and judgment. Unless it can be shown — and the facts alleged in the complaint, even if proven, do not so show — that the discretion and judgment of such officials have been motivated by fraud or by complete lack of responsibility or by arbitrary considerations or capricious beliefs, no court should substitute its judgment for that of such officials. To do so would constitute an unwarranted judicial interference with the duties of duly appointed and elected public officials.</p>
