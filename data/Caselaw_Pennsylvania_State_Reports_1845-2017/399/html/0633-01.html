The basic issue is the impact, if any, upon this release of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (herein called Uniform Act) of July 19, 1951, P. L. 1130, 12 PS §§2082-2089.</p>

McBeth, respectively- — were standing upon state highway 712, Upper Mount Bethel Township, Northampton County, with the bumpers of both automobiles interlocked. Herbert Smith, aiding Falcone and McBeth, was engaged in attempting to disengage the interlocked bumpers. An automobile driven by Donald Fenner then came along the highway, struck the McBeth automobile and Smith causing the latter very serious personal injuries.</p>

Falcone and McBeth then joined Fenner as an additional defendant on the theory that Fenner was either solely, or, jointly with them or either of them, liable to Smith, or liable over to them or either of them. Fenner, in his answers to Smith’s complaint and to Falcone’s and McBeth’s complaint, affirmatively defended on the ground that Smith, on May 28, 1952, had <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>given him a written release<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> which precluded any liability on his part not only to Smith but. also to Falcone and McBeth.

    <p id="b658-5" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[261,467,1149,582]]]'>Falcone and McBeth filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings raising two questions: (1) whether Smith’s release of Fenner released Falcone and McBeth; (2) the apxfiicability of the Uniform Act to this cause of action which arose prior to the effective date of the Act. President Judge Barthold held that, while the Uniform Act was inapplicable, judgment could not be entered - on the pleadings since Smith, despite the release of Fenner, could recover if he proved that Falcone and McBeth were alone liable: <em>Smith v.

The jury returned a verdict generally for $110,833.17 against all three defendants — -Falcone, McBeth and Fenner — and specifically found: (a) Smith was not con tributarily negligent; (b) neither Falcone nor McBeth nor Fenner was solely liable; (c) that joint negligence of Falcone and McBeth was not the legal cause of the accident; (d) that the joint negligence of Falcone, McBeth and Fenner was the legal cause of the accident. Motions for judgment n.o.v. were granted and judgment entered for Falcone, McBeth and Fenner. From the entry of such judgment an appeal was taken. That judgment was entered upon the theory that Smith’s release of Fenner released Falcone and McBeth as well as Fenner.</p>

In this action, Smith’s theory, as alleged, was that, since Fenner now claimed that the release exonerated <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>not only him but also Falcone and McBeth, Fenner '“is engaged in an’attempt to avoid his own release; and such conduct is a fraud in fact and in law; and, therefore, by his own act [Fenner] has made said release null and void”. Preliminary objections filed in this action were upheld and the court below dismissed the complaint. From that decree an appeal has been taken.</p>
