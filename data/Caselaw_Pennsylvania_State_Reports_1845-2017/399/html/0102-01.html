      <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>One of the most noted cases of group libel in recent years is <em>Gross v. Cantor, </em><a href="/ny/270/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="270 N.Y. 93" data-case-ids="2019514" data-case-paths="/ny/270/0093-01">270 N.

In that case, Eddie Cantor, the singer-comedian, had written an article which was published in the magazine “Radio Guide” in which he inveighed against “those New York radio editors who are experts at logrolling, who use their columns for delving into personalities that have nothing to do with radio and whose various rackets are a disgrace to the newspaper profession.” The author further asserted that “There is but one person writing on radio in New York City who has the necessary background, dignity and honesty of purpose.” He did not, however, name the person so exonerated of the charges. A New York radio editor sued Cantor for damages in an action for libel and obtained a judgment which the New York Court of Appeals affirmed. In its opinion, the court quoted with approval from <em>Ryckman v. Delavan, </em><a href="/citations/?q=25%20Wend.%20186" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="25 Wend. 186">25 Wend. 186</a>, 202 (N.

Dubois Printing &amp; Publishing Com</em>pany, <a href="/pa-super/64/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="64 Pa. Super. 115" data-case-ids="457931" data-case-paths="/pa-super/64/0115-01">64 Pa. Superior Ct. 115</a> (1916). In the <em>Egan </em>case, a newspaper printed a defamatory story about “a number of [former] national organizers” for the United Mine Workers of America who were in DuBois. The plaintiffs in the action were two such organizers, but were not specifically referred to or identified in the article. The Superior Court held (at page 122) that, “Whether the descriptions of the persons referred <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>to in the article applied to the plaintiff [s] was a question of fact properly submitted to the jury.” Judgment for the plaintiff was reversed, and a new trial ordered, but for a reason not presently material. That the defamation was referable to the plaintiffs, who had not been identified by the article, is implicit from the portions of the charge embraced by the fourth and fifth assignments which the Superior Court impliedly approved, viz., that the reference was sufficient . . if you [the jury] are of the opinion from the evidence produced in this ease that the description in these articles were such, either intentionally or by want of due diligence in ascertaining the facts as to point to these plaintiffs, and to suggest by natural and reasonable inferences to the public that they were the parties referred to, . . or, stated otherwise, “If you [the jury] find that these articles are such as claimed by the plaintiffs, that the plaintiffs were so described that the public naturally and reasonably thought they were referred to, . . . .”</p>
    <p id="b130-4" data-blocks='[["BL_130.5",130,[268,1449,1148,917]]]'>Counsel for defendant in the instant ease points out that a reading of the paper books discloses that the plaintiffs in the <em>Egan </em>case were the only former national organizers for the United Mine Workers of America in DuBois at the time of the publication, and argues, from that, that the defamatory statements must have referred to the plaintiffs. The significant thing is, however, that the fact that the plaintiffs were the only former national organizers in DuBois <em>did not appear by the complaint. </em>In other words, so far as the pleadings were concerned, there might have been any number of such former organizers in DuBois. That the only ones were, in fact, the two plaintiffs was developed by evidence at trial. It was of no moment, therefore, to the ruling of the Superior Court on the sufficiency of the reference in the defamatory article to include the plaintiffs.</p>

      <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>Here, the ordinary reader of the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer </em>could naturally and reasonably infer that the defamatory publication referred to the plaintiff, among others. Certain it is that a substantial number of readers, particularly those resident in Upper Darby Township, knew that the plaintiff was one of the thirteen commissioners of the township. Moreover, it is not unreasonable to conclude that many other Upper Darby readers of the <em>Inquirer </em>who, prior to the defamatory article, had not known the identity of all of ¿he township’s commissioners, were impelled by the scandalous nature of the charges to make inquiry and find out who the commissioners were — a process which would almost inevitably lead to connecting the plaintiff’s name with the alleged corruption in office.</p>
    <p id="b131-4" data-blocks='[["BL_131.5",131,[137,1175,1148,1025]]]'>The fact that the article did not state that all of the commissioners of the township were parties to the reported corrupt deal could not operate to exclude the plaintiff from being one of the relatively small and officially designated group to which the article indisputably made reference. The publication also declared that the district attorney’s office would question all thirteen of the commissioners, one of whom was the plaintiff. That statement at least implied that, in the mind of the district attorney, none of the commissioners was above suspicion of knowledge, guilty or otherwise, of the alleged “split”. The effect of the article could be to impugn the integrity and honesty of the plaintiff in the estimation of the public. Even persons favorably disposed toward him might, upon reading the article, reasonably conclude that the plaintiff was one of the commissioners referred to as being corrupt. This would be a sufficient maligning of his reputation to give him a cause of action for libel.</p>

We hold that, under the facts pleaded, the trial court should have concluded as a matter of law that the publication was defamatory and that the plaintiff was sufficiently referred to so that a recipient might reasonably conclude that the plaintiff was an object of the defamation. Whether recipients did so conclude is a question for a jury to determine. The court was therefore in error in dismissing the complaint and in entering judgment for the defendant.</p>
