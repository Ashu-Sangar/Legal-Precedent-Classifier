When a person intends or plans to commit a crime, he goes about it <em>clandestinely and attempts to hide from the public both his identity and every one of his acts which could be linked to the crime. </em>Certainly he does not publicize to the world, as Torrance did, his silo wall and that it was built by and can be bought from ManuMines. Instead of being evidence in behalf of the Commonwealth to prove Torrance guilty of fraud, it is more reasonable and logical to say that it demonstrates that he was <em>not </em>a party to the crime. Yet these were the two rocks on which the Commonwealth built its entire case.

However, the learned trial Judge, in vigorous language, admonished the jury to expunge from their minds what had thus been intimated, and cautioned them to give no credence to it but to exclude it wholly from their consideration.

Have you given any consideration to the timeliness of August 25th, 1953, and September 1953, in the light of events that have later occurred? A. Frankly, no, as of this minute I had not. Q. Does it seem <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>to you <em>as of this minute </em>that there is any significance to attach to those two periods of time? A. There might have been. Q. <em>What might have been? </em>A. It might have been in somebody’s mind; certainly not mine. Q. Well, what might have been in anyone’s mind that you can think of at this point that <em>might incite your curiosity? </em>A. My curiosity now has been developed somewhat by the coincidence, we will call it, of those two dates, insofar as perhaps later activities of ManuMine <em>might have been concerned in somebody’s mind. </em>Q. <em>What mind are we thinking of </em>at this moment, sir, that is particularly attractive to your thinking at this moment; what mind would you be attracted to? A. <em>The only mind </em>that I would know <em>that might be at all interested </em>in Manu-Mine <em>would be Mr. </em>Evans, Chairman of the Commission. : . . Q. What would that have possibly entailed if you had given such consideration to those thoughts that would have come through your mind? A. Well, undoubtedly I would have been told that, maybe rather broadly, that it was none of my business, or something like that. Q. In order to convey it to the Grand Jury, we have to do it through what you were thinking. We have to convey it by words, and you have done it very descriptively. Do you think this was a foregone conclusion that Mr. Stickler was going to operate in this field and all you could do was go along with it? A. Well, to what extent Mr. Stickler was received, I think that that was a pretty foregone conclusion that he would get the job, . . . A. . . . and someone besides Mr. Evans, I believe it was Mr. Torrance, and the question was: ‘Don’t you think we ought to do something about the Department of Mines on this case?’ Q. Who made that statement, sir? A. I believe it was Mr. Torrance. . . . Q. What was Mr. Evans’ reaction to Mr. Torrance’s inquiry? A. ‘No, we don’t want that.’ ... Q. Mr. Evans did not want the Department of Mines in this matter, did he? A. No. Q. <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>That was pretty definitely understood by you, was it? A. <em>I had that impression. </em>... Q. <em>Why did you conclude </em>that Mr. Evans didn’t want the Department of Mines involved in this? A. Well, actually I don’t think I examined <em>his motive </em>for thinking so at the time. Q. <em>Save you since that time examined it? </em>A. Oh, I thought about it a great deal in the past six or eight months. Q. <em>What has been the conclusion that your thinking has resolved itself into, </em>sir? A. Simply this: That the Department of Mines presumably has in its possession or in its record a full supply of maps of all mining work; and that information should be available alone. Now, the question of whether to employ Department of Mines personnel, whether that could be done or not, is quite another story, or was in my mind then. Since then it has, of course, been done, and we employed — I mean the Commission paid for their assisting personnel. So that it no doubt would have been just as possible earlier as it was later. Q. Let’s give it a little more validity, sir, to the conclusion, I believe. Isn’t this a fact: If the Department of Mines had been consulted it would have done just what it has already done and there wouldn’t be any Manu-Mine contract? A. I believe that is a fair statement. Q. In other words, Manu-Mine couldn’t have gone into a contract that more than $10 million had been paid on if the Department of Mines had been consulted, <em>isn’t that a fair conclusion? </em>A. <em>I think so. </em>Q. So, therefore, Mr. Evans, didn’t want the Department of Mines involved in this matter, did he? A. That was clear enough to me. Q. So if the Department of Mines had been involved, Mr. Evans’ nephew would not have been involved, is that right? A. I think that is true too. . . . Q. We want to know why, sir. Do you have a reason to ascribe for that? A. The only reason I can ascribe to that is that Mr. Evans might have thought that I would get the contract set up perhaps sooner <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>than Mr. Stone, or something like that; <em>maybe he had a special purpose in the back of his mind at the time. </em>Q. <em>What could that have been? </em>A. Well, probably another purpose which could have been in the back of his mind was that I was the man who would, say, be duped, put it that way, or, at least, carry out his order to his satisfaction. Q. In other words, or have you now concluded that Mr. Evans did think that he might more easily have you handle the contract of February 28, 1955, than Mr. Roger Stone? A. I would conclude that, yes, sir. Q. There is a reason, isn’t there, sir, for most every bit of human conduct? A. Correct. Q. You have ascribed that as a reason, and you have had an opportunity to reflect on it, have you not, sir? A. Yes, sir. Q. That is your considered opinion this afternoon, isn’t it? A. Yes, sir, I think so. ... Q. Did you conclude at that time that Mr. Evans did not want any other drillers in there because there would have been a competitive bidding on that amount of work which Avould have contrasted to the $12.50 per foot that Manu-Mine was making? A. <em>At this juncture I would say yes. </em>Q. Isn’t that the reason why no further drillers were brought into that area? Didn’t Mr. Evans make it pretty clear to you if any other driller was brought in there there might be a question concerning the $12.50 per foot? A. I would gather that much very clearly, that if anything like competitive bidding was accomplished that that figure might be reduced. That is my opinion; yes, sir. Q. Therefore, you would conclude from that that Mr. Evans gave the instruction to go ahead and drill, and drill regardless of the cost, isn’t that right? A. Yes, sir. ... Q. Other than that, you felt the influence that Mr. Evans exerted was a primary motive behind this contract for renegotiation? A. Yes, there is no doubt about that. Q. And from decision by Mr. Evans you had no redress? Did he have other Commissioners under his thumb, in your opinion, <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>as he had the department heads? A. Mr. Evans as I have said dominated the Commission. He got what he wanted and that refers to the other members of the Commission as well, by one method or another. Somehow whatever he wanted to do the Commission agreed to do.”</blockquote>
