Yoder, the appellant, instituted an assumpsit action against the Luzerne Township School District, Fayette County, to recover for work done and materials and supplies furnished in connection with the paving of certain school house playgrounds of the School District.</p>

The contract provided that no extra work was to be done unless ordered in writing. Without complying with the provisions of the Public School Code respecting advertisement and without the benefit of a resolution of the School Board, the area surfaced by Yoder was increased to 10,240 square yards and the base changed from a 6" to a 4" base. These changes were made pursuant to oral directions of the school directors who, singly or in groups, visited the job sites from time to time.</p>

Yoder has already been paid $29,174.60 and now seeks to recover the balance of $15,000.</p>

L. 30, and amendments thereto which require' a public advertisement for bids for such contracts as well as formal corporate action thereon.</p>
