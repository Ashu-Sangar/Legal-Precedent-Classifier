In re William Sultan, 115 No. Car. 57. For all that is necessary to convert a criminal under the <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>laws of a State into a fugitive from justice is that he should have left the State after having incurred guilt there, Roberts v.

In the meantime, however, unless granted injunctive relief, they will be taken from their homes in California and extradited to Philadelphia, with consequent loss of liberty, and with a resultant enormous expense to defendants of transporting to and maintaining in Philadelphia themselves and their witnesses who live in California.</p>
