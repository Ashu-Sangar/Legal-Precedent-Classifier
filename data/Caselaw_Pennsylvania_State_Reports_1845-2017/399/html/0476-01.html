Chief Justice Gibson in <em>Hock v. Hock, </em>6 S. &amp; R. 47 succinctly stated this rule: “Proof of execution must be made by two witnesses, each of whom must separately depose to all the facts necessary to complete the chain of evidence, so that no link in it may depend on the credibility of but one”. More recently the rule was concisely stated by Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Steen in <em>James’ Estate, </em>supra (p. 275) : “There must be a strict compliance with these statutory provisions, and a will is not valid unless executed precisely in accordance therewith. If executed by mark, it is not a lawful instrument unless testator’s name was subscribed in his presence and by his direction and authority: Hunter’s Estate, <a href="/pa/328/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="328 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="1179662" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0484-01">328 Pa. 484</a>. . . . But, . . ., the facts that such direction was given and that testator’s name was subscribed in his presence must be proved, under the act, by two or more competent witnesses, each of whose testimony must be complete, independently of the other’s, as to the existence of those circumstances and the performance of those acts which the statute requires to exist and to be done as conditions essential to the validity of the will”. As a safeguard against possible fraud in the execution of wills the “two witness rule” needs no defense at this late date.</p>

He spoke with his attorney who obtained from him data as to the names of the intended beneficiaries and what they were to receive, and the attorney then drafted a will in accordance with the desires of the dying man.</p>

In order to forestall deception and fraud, the law also provides that the mark must be made in the presence of two witnesses who will sign the will in his presence. This was done in the case before us for consideration. H. E. Holloway and Margaret B. King, standing by his bed, witnessed Rhodes making his mark, with the aid of the scrivener, Attorney Vance E. Booher, on the will.</p>

Rhodes. This was also done in accordance with law. Section 2(2) of the Wills Act provides: “If the testator is unable to sign his name for any reason, a will to which he makes his mark and <em>to which his name is subscribed in his presence before or after he makes his mark, </em>shall be as valid as though he had signed his name thereto.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

It says that the Wills Act requires that the name of the testator must be written into the will in the presence of tAvo witnesses. I will repeat what the Wills Act says <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>in this regard: “If the testator is unable to sign his name for any reason, a will to which he makes -his mark and to which his name is subscribed in his PRESENCE BEEORE OR APTER HE MAKES HIS MARK, shall be as valid as though he had signed his name thereto: Provided: <em>He makes his mark in the presence of two witnesses </em>who sign their names to the will in his presence.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

There is nothing in the statement: “to which his name is subscribed in his presence before or after he makes his mark,” which indicates how that subscription shall be proved. In the absence of any specific quantum of proof required by the Act, the proof shall be supplied in any manner that it can be proved in accordance with existing rules of evidence. Thus it may be proved by a number of' witnesses, it may be proved by one witness alone, it may be proved by circumstantial evidence. In the case at bar, the subscription of the testator’s name was proved by the testimony of the scrivener, plus circumstantial evidence which utterly excludes any possibility of fraud or deception.</p>

In that insistence, the Majority reads into Section 2(2) of the Wills Act language which is simply not there. The Majority assumes that because the proviso at the end of Section 2(2) says: <em>“Provided: He makes his mark in the presence of tioo witnesses who sign </em>■ <em>their names to the will in his presence ” </em>this means that everything connected with the making of a will under <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>the circumstances indicated must be proved <em>by two </em>witnesses.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[138,476,1148,701]]]'>If the Majority’s reasoning in this respect is carried to its logical conclusion, then everything connected with a will must be proved by two witnesses. For instance, two witnesses would be required to prove the actual writing of the will, that is, its physical manufacture. But we know that a will is not a will until it is signed by the testator. What happens prior tc the signature is' mere prelude and requires no special proof of its happening. For instance the proponent of a will does not have to give an explanation of misspelled words or even interlineations in the will unless there is some charge that the will was tampered with <em>after </em>it was signed.</p>
    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.6",509,[139,1189,1156,472]]]'>When a will is signed by a mark, the writing in of the testator’s name above or beneath his mark is merely a matter of identification and is not intended to provide any additional weight to the authenticity of the will. If the testator is illiterate to the extent that he knows no writing at all, the subscription of his name' will mean nothing to him except that it is a formality which gives him assurance that all is being done in accordance with his wishes.</p>

In that event, Section 2(2) of the Wills Act would read: “If the testator is unable to sign his name for any reason, a will to which he makes his mark and to which his name is subscribed in his presence before or after he makes his mark, shall be as valid as though he had signed his name thereto: Provided, <em>that the subscription of his name </em>and the making of his mark shall be done in the presence of two witnesses who sign their names to the will in his presence.” But the Legislature did not do this.</p>
    <p id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[232,1014,1152,905]]]'>From time to time this court interprets language employed by the Legislature in a manner which would suggest that the Legislature is inordinately penurious in the expenditure of words or that there is a shortage of ink in the legislative chambers or committee room where the bills have been drafted. To me it seems utterly absurd that the drafter of a piece of legislation of the importance of the Wills Act would forget, within the space of two sentences, so important a requirement as the one this Court now says is in Section 2(2) by inference. The fact that the drafter, after speaking of the subscription of the testator’s name, omits in the very next sentence any reference to the manner in which that subscription is to be proved, should be conclusive proof that he did not intend that the subscription had to be established by any particular number of witnesses.</p>

As I have already said, if all features of a will must be proved by two witnesses, then two witnesses would have to testify that they actually saw the typist at the typing operation, or, if the will is handwritten, two witnesses would have to testify that they saw the scrivener dipping his pen in the ink bottle and physically applying the pen to the paper. Two witnesses would have to prove that the testator had not been duly influenced, etc., etc.</p>

I believe in Stare Decisis when it accords with demonstrable verities, but I refuse to be guided by an obviously misguided hand. I refuse to participate in the perpetuation of a proved error. I refuse to assent to a dogmatic repudiation of a testator’s expressed desire when we know that the very purpose of all testamentary law is to ascertain the will of the testator and to effectuate it.</p>

And yet, after making all these resolves, no less wholesome and truthful because they are cliches, the Majority proceeds to dim the pole star, to demolish the armchair, and to read into the will what is not <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>only not within the four corners of the will but completely outside the dwelling of the testator’s thoughts, desires, and expressed intention.</p>

Nevertheless, I draw from these expressions the inescapable conclusion that the courts want to effectuate the testator’s desires. Here, there is no doubt of the testator’s intention, but, notwithstanding, the Court renounces the testator’s intentions by introducing conditions which do not form part of the law. Once the authenticity of a testamentary writing is established, the courts should be eager to see its provisions translated into reality and not seek barriers to prevent the owner of the property from speaking his desires, even though his words are spoken from the grave.</p>
