Both the appellant’s and the furniture company’s uses fail to conform to the zoning restrictions of the district, but since the furniture company’s use began prior to 1933, it was maintained as a legal nonconforming use under the zoning ordinance of 1933.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

That court remanded the case to the zoning board for the purpose of taking additional testimony and making additional findings.

The relevant sections of the 1933 ordinance provide: “. . . (3) Change of Use. A nonconforming building or use shall be considered as such unless and until it complies with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Such use shall not be changed to a use designated for a district having less restrictive regulations. (4) Discontinued Use.

There the question was whether a tailoring shop could be maintained as a nonconforming use as a matter of right in a “B” residential district because the property’s history disclosed that a:real estate office had <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>once been maintained there as a legal nonconforming nse. A real estate office and a tailoring shop had identical zoning classifications. Construing subsections (3) and (4) together, the court held that the correct application of the ordinance did not require that the new use merely have the same classification as did the former use, but that the new use conform to the restrictive provisions set forth the <em>district in which the new use is requested. </em>By our interpretation therefore, the zoning ordinance of 1933 required that where a nonconforming use had been changed, it had to conform to the current restrictions for the specific district; otherwise a variance had to be obtained. Since appellant’s proposed use admittedly does not meet the zoning restrictions for the district, he is not entitled to his requested use as a matter of right under the 1933 ordinance.</p>

      <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>The zoning board has twice considered appellant’s case; each time it concluded that he had failed to show an unnecessary hardship and that his proposed use was contrary to the public interest. The lower court affirmed the zoning board’s ruling because it found competent evidence in the record to support the conclusion .that a variance would be contrary to the public interest. Mindful of our scope of review in these matters, we have carefully studied the record and find ample evidence to sustain each of the zoning board’s determinations. While some argument is made that the zoning board failed to make specific findings on the matter of unnecessary hardship, we think it is clear that the only thing appellant has shown is an economic hardship resulting from the fact that the present building cannot be used for residential purposes. For an economic hardship, self-inflicted by appellant, redress in the form of a variance is not mandatory. <em>Upper St. Clair Township Grange Zoning Case, </em>supra.
