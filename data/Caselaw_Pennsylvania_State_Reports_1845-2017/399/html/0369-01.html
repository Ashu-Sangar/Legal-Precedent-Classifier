Accordingly, on September 14, 1956, road crews, under the direction of the district traffic engineer of the department, removed the barricades which had sealed the new road from motorists during its construction. At the same time they put up, at the southern terminus of the highway, signs and arrows directing northbound motorists to the newly built road and they posted, at the various entrances to the old road, signs warning <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>motorists not to enter. The same procedure, (with opposing directions, of course), was followed at the northern terminus of the highway.</p>

A Mrs. O. Katherine Henry, traveling northwardly to Connellsville in a Ford station wagon, ignored the newly built road and took up the old road (now reserved for southbound traffic only). At a point about one-half mile before Connellsville, her car collided with a Mercury automobile being driven southwardly on that same road by John E. Francis. The violence of impact was such that both were killed outrightly. The administrator of the estate of John E. Francis brought a wrongful and death survival action against the administrator of the estate of Mrs. Henry.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Only a case destitute of the slightest merit in law can be brought to such an abrupt end. Of course, there are such cases, and the broom of nonsuit is well used to sweep them out of the courtroom needed for the many cases having ostensible merit, but the record does not disclose that this case was one for the broom.</p>
    <p id="b394-4" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[235,906,1144,258]]]'>The trial court, affirmed by a court en banc, came to the conclusion that the plaintiff failed to prove that the actions of Mrs. Henry constituted negligence.

In view of this incontestable premise, it is difficult to comprehend how and why the court entered a nonsuit, since the evidence presented on the plaintiffs side does not speak in a soft voice of negligence on the part of the defendant’s decedent.</p>

Although the court below mildly questions that the motoring public was committed to using the new highway for northbound traffic on September 15th, it is highly significant that on that day the only two eyewitnesses to the Francis-Henry accident were actually on the new highway proceeding northwardly to Connellsville. Nor can it be ignored <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>that officials and employees of the Department of Highways testified that the new road was open to the public on September 15th, and that signs, adequately informing the public with regard to the use of the two roads, were conspicuously posted. Formal records of the Department further documented the fact that on September 14th signs were erected and barriers removed so that all southbound traffic would move on the old road and all northbound traffic would take the new road.</p>
    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[181,897,1148,746]]]'>If, therefore, the old roadway was, on September 15th, committed to southbound traffic exclusively, it is obvious that Mrs. Henry, motoring northwardly to Connellsville on that road, was traveling on a road where she had no right to be. In a word, she was traveling in a direction opposite to the direction allowed by law. This strange event should have been enough to give the trial court pause as to whether her conduct did not, in itself, prima faciedly constitute negligence. That conduct, however, did not seem to impress the court at all. In its opinion, it said: “There was no proof of negligence on the part of Mrs. Henry except that she was going north in the southbound lane.”</p>

In affirming the judgment for the plaintiff entered in the trial court, the Superior Court said: “This was not an intersection case, and no question as to right of way was involved. Each driver was required to keep on his own side of the road ...

In the <em>Miles </em>case the plaintiff charged that her injuries were due to the fact that the defendant’s car was being operated on the wrong side of the highway. The trial court granted binding instructions for the defendant on the premise that the plaintiff had failed to make out a case of negligence. This Court reversed, Chief Justice Maxby saying: “It has been held that the fact that an automobile is on the wrong side of the highway makes out a prima facie case of negligence. See Amey v.

In such a situation a trial court could contemplate entering a nonsuit only in the event the plaintiff’s evidence revealed that Mrs. Henry got on the wrong'road without negligence on her part. But even in such a situation, a nonsuit would not be proper if, in addition to the exculpating evidence just indicated, there was still other evidence that Mrs. Henry was negligent. It would be left to a jury, or other fact-finding tribunal, in such a state of affairs, to determine if the plaintiff had proved his case.</p>

It may be established by eyewitnesses, circumstantial evidence, photographs, measurements and a combination of a hundred varying methods of proof, but there can be no question that one <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>of the most effective ways of demonstrating negligence is to show that the alleged fault-finder was traveling-in the wrong direction on a road legally closed to him. Such proof, of course, would not be conclusive, but it at least would call upon the defendant to explain what he or she was doing in the interdicted territory.</p>
    <p id="b397-4" data-blocks='[["BL_397.5",397,[162,679,1147,208]]]'>The court said further: “In the case at bar there was no proof of Mrs. Henry’s knowledge that she was knowingly going the wrong way, testing an obvious danger, or assuming any extraordinary risks.”</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.6",397,[162,897,1147,481]]]'>The plaintiff could not be expected to prove what was impossible of proof. How could the plaintiff or any witness know what was in Mrs. Henry’s mind? Whatever knowledge she had about road conditions was something locked within the impenetrable vaults of her own consciousness and that knowledge died with her at the time of the accident. But the court endeavored to argue her ease posthumously by asserting that “Mrs. Henry could well have been legitimately confused.”</p>
    <p id="b397-6" data-blocks='[["BL_397.7",397,[160,1389,1148,318]]]'>No court has such omniscience that it can, within the law, enter a nonsuit on the supposed thinking of a deceased person.

Thus it says that: “Defendant produced some testimony that barricades preventing use of the new road by traffic making a left turn north off Oglevee Lane were not removed until the Monday after the accident”; that a Marie Bandnarik, a defendant witness, “testified that her companion, driving from the direction of Uniontown, had stopped on the 15th, before using the new piece of road, for the very purpose of determining whether the new. road was open, and that there were then no signs to guide them, <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>but they saw other cars using the new road and decided that it must be open”; and that: “Defendant offered witnesses to show that some cars were still using the old road for northbound movement even after the accident here involved.” But this is all evidence which a jury would consider in determining whether the defendant had explained away the admitted incongruity of being on the wrong road. However, we must repeat that the court below entered a nonsuit — and a jury has no authority to declare a nonsuit. A non-suit is strictly a legal proceeding and is within the province of the court exclusively.</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[241,1008,1144,252]]]'>Moreover, the fact that a few cars used the old road for northbound traffic after the accident occurred could in no way prejudice the claim of the plaintiff as to what the defendant’s decedent did on September 15, 1956.</p>
    <p id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[239,1281,1146,315]]]'>The court also found the plaintiff’s decedent guilty of contributory negligence and said: “From the photographs, and the testimony of Trooper Bingaman, it seems clear that plaintiff’s decedent could have averted the accident by turning into the right hand lane if he had been alert and maintaining a proper lookout.”</p>
    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.6",398,[237,1609,1145,643]]]'>Here again the court is arguing facts and here again it ignores the fundamental rule that in considering a nonsuit, all inferences rising from the evidence must be interpreted, in favor of the plaintiff. But one does not even need to resort to this rule to show the lower court’s error with regard to the testimony of Trooper Bingaman. This police officer arrived at the scene of the accident an hour after the collision and after the vehicles and the bodies had been removed. He testified in the nature of-an expert, which, of course, he was quite well qualified to be, having had 14 years’ experience on the Pennsylvania State Police.</p>

After examining the skid marks in the road, studying the terrain and topography involved, Trooper Bingaman testified as follows: “Q. Now where did the point of impact, as you observed from these skid marks, occur with relation to the curve and the hill that exists at that section of the road? A. Well the road has a slight curve to the left going that way. Wait until I get that, a slight curve to the right traveling south, and the skid marks were just over a slight knoll, and the point of impact was some distance over this knoll on the left hand side of the highway. Q. Now, are you now thoroughly familiar with that vicinity? A. Yes, sir, I have traveled it many times. Q. Now with relation to this knoll that you talked about as being near the approximate point of impact, are there grades going down both ways, that is toward Connellsville and toward UniontQwn in connection with that knoll? A. Yes, there are. Q. And in your opinion and from your expérience after having traveled that road as often as you say you have, would these parties have had the ability to see each other within any length of time? A.

If such a predicament should develop and a collision result, the motorist on his own side of the thoroughfare cannot be declared guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law on the theory that he did not have an assured clear distance ahead.”</p>

According to the testimony of Trooper Bingaman of the State Police, there was no indication that either car was exceeding the speed limit of 50 miles per hour. He also testified that at that speed there would be a reaction time of 55 feet, and 111 feet brake traction to make a complete stop.
