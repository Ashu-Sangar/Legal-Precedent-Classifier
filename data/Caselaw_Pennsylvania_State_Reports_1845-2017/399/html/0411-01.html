    <p id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.7",435,[161,598,1151,691]]]'>A week later he filed a petition for a Sanity Commission and one was appointed by the court below: it found appellant mentally ill but not of criminal tendency. In a supplementary report it found him unable to comprehend his position, unable to confer with counsel, and unable to make a rational defense, and in addition to describing his symptoms and behavior it reported a history of treatment from 1948 to 1951, in 1955, and in 1959, including two periods in a mental hospital under shock therapy. It added that in the opinion of the commissioners his condition, which stems from cerebral sclerosis, would not improve but would worsen.</p>
    <p id="b435-5" data-blocks='[["BL_435.8",435,[159,1317,1148,373]]]'>Appellant was indicted for murder after the court below, on November 20, had approved the Commissioners’ report and had found that appellant was mentally ill. However, it disagreed with the commission’s ultimate conclusion and found that appellant was of criminal tendency. The court then ordered him committed to Farview State Hospital. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b435-6" data-blocks='[["BL_435.9",435,[158,1708,1147,320]]]'>In its opinion the court said: “The Court considered the nature of the crime, the former mental condition of the defendant, his repeated need of treatment, his attempt to strangle himself, and the finding of the commission that his mental condition would not improve but would gradually become worse . . .”</p>
    <p id="b435-7" data-blocks='[["BL_435.10",435,[158,2043,1147,323]]]'>The court also referred to the defendant’s “failure, omission, and violation of duty” (Black’s Law Dictionary, 3rd ed., “Delinquency”), as evidence of habitual delinquency, and declared that Farview would best guarantee maximum protection to both defendant and the community.</p>

      <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>The Mental Health Act of June 12, 1951, P. L. .533, 50 PS §1071 et seq., specifies in Art. II, §230(b), 50 PS §1140(b), that the “Parview State Hospital shall be exclusively devoted to the care of patients convicted of crime or with criminal tendencies.” And Art. I, §102(4), 50 PS §1072(4), lists “tendency to habitual delinquency” as a meaning of “criminal tendency”. Finally, it is clear from Art. Ill, §345(d), 50 PS §1225(d), that it is the court that is to be satisfied of the defendant’s mental illness.</p>

In <em>Moon </em>we said: “Assuming the commission found appellant a proper subject for commitment under this standard, its findings while persuasive were nevertheless advisory only and nof mandatory upon the court, for under Section 345(d) of the Act it is the court and not the commission which must be satisfied that appellant is mentally ill under the standard prescribed. It follows that the court in the instant case could have rejected, although not arbitrarily or capriciously, the commission’s findings and conclusions and could have independently determined from the evidence that appellant’s capacity to use his customary self-control, judgment and discretion had not been so lessened that it was necessary or advisable for him to be under care. . . <em>P'</em>

The court <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>has told us what it considered but has not shared with us the reasons why such consideration should lead to an opposite result. Nor do we have the benefit of the commission’s testimony. All of the cases cited immediately, supra, mention testimony and evidence. In <em>Patskin, </em>for example, we observed that the lower court made its findings “after a careful and conscientious study of (a) the written report of the Comission, and (b) their answers to the questions asked by the Court at the oral examination, and (c) a reading and consideration of the record and the transcript of the- testimony of the ivitnesses interviewed by the Commission.”</p>

    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.6",438,[229,1117,1147,536]]]'>We have seen how summarily the court below disposed of this case in the first instance. Although the Sanity Commission recommended that the defendant Ezio Baldassarre be committed to a hospital for mental illness, the court, without summoning a single witness, and without examining the defendant, committed Baldassarre to the Farview State Hospital, which is an institution for the criminal insane, — pathetic creatures who reflect the ultimate in pathological and violent irresponsibility.</p>
    <p id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.7",438,[223,1665,1149,424]]]'>The meager record before us shows that the alleged hearing conducted by the court below was so short in point of time that the courtroom door had scarcely opened when it was closed, and the hearing was over, and Ezio Baldassarre was on his way to the home of the doomed. Although the Farview Hospital is undoubtedly excellently operated, it still stands out, in the minds of many people, as a house of horrors.</p>

He has not been tried for the killing which brought about his arrest, so that he is not a criminal, and, so far as criminal tendency is concerned, the only evidence in the record is that he is <em>not </em>of criminal tendency.</p>
    <p id="b439-6" data-blocks='[["BL_439.6",439,[159,1262,1150,809]]]'>The men appointed by the court below to form the examining commission were men of repute, experience and unquestioned integrity, two of them being physicians with over 25 years experience. Yet, the court treated the report of these commissioners as if they were strangers and interlopers. The commissioners were conscientious in seeking the truth. They brought before them Dr. Harvey Bartle, Jr., a psychiatrist of standing who had already treated Baldassarre as a patient; they examined Cyril Mr. Bruke and Alexander P. Baldassarre, son-in-law and son to the defendant; they questioned three hospital attendants and Warden John I. Gable. After taking this testimony and deliberating on it, they came to the conclusion that the defendant was <em>not </em>of criminal tendency.</p>

How would the presence of a stenographer disturb the defendant any more than the presence of a court clerk or a tipstaff, or the judge himself? Perhaps the presence of a doctor might disturb the defendant, but this would be no reason for denying the defendant medical care.</p>
