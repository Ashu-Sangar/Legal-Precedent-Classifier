She then filed a complaint in equity against the defendant for an accounting. By preliminary objections defendant challenged the jurisdiction of the court below to adjudicate the matter, asserting that all of the relief sought by the plaintiff involved the internal affairs of a foreign corporation. The lower court dismissed the complaint, and this appeal under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, 12 PS §672, followed.</p>

It is because courts voluntarily choose not to interfere in the internal affairs of a foreign corporation that they decline to hear such cases; it is not because they lack power to do so. <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v.

The defendant, Tampax, Inc., is a DelaAvare Corporation with its principal place of business in New York City. The defendant manufactures and distributes Tampax, a catamenial device used for feminine hygienic purposes. On March 15, 1955, in consideration of plaintiff’s work in having the sale of Tampax tampons made legal in Scandinavia and for other unspecified reasons, plaintiff and defendant entered into a written agreement which in substance provided that the defendant would transfer to plaintiff 25% of the capital stock of a corporation to be formed for the purpose of doing business in Denmark, Norway and Sweden or, in case the business should be organized in a form other than a corporation, a 25% share of the Scandinavian business formed. In addition plaintiff was to receive 25% of the net profits of the business in Scandinavia, regardless of the form of the enterprise, earned after March 1, 1955. The agreement concluded with the stipulation that any disagreement between the parties over the provisions of the agreement should be settled in accordance with the laws of Denmark and that certain courts in Copenhagen, Denmark, would be competent courts to adjudicate controversies between the parties relating to the agreement.</p>

Later, the defendant restricted the Danish company to sales of its product in Denmark only and designated an independent agency, Midelfart &amp; Company, located in Oslo, Norway, to conduct its <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>business in Norway. No proportional share of the Norway agency has been given to plaintiff.

Aside from some well defined areas, see Eestatement, Conflict of Laws, § §192-202 (1934), whether or not our taking jurisdiction might result in such interference will depend upon the particular facts of the case. <em>Kahn v. American Cone &amp; Pretzel Co., </em>supra. Generally, however, such interference occurs only where the suit is predicated upon rights derived from some status within the corporate association, and where the suit is brought by or against persons in their capacities as shareholders, officers and directors. In the exceptional case where jurisdiction has been refused even though the action was predicated on rights derived from other than the association relationship, the internal affairs of a foreign corporation were inextricably involved.</p>

    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[157,861,1153,1407]]]'>We cannot agree with the lower court that the instant case is governed by <em>Mulligan’s Estate, </em>or that it falls within the “internal affairs” rule. The crux of plaintiff’s claim here is that the defendant corporation, of which plaintiff is not a shareholder, has, pursuant to an ordered scheme, purposely manipulated its subsidiaries so as to defeat plaintiff’s right under her contract with the defendant corporation. The plaintiff does not question the correctness of the defendant’s acts with reference to a general policy of corporate management; regardless of whether each of the defendant’s acts might be unobjectionable when individually considered, she contends that they were intentionally made to defraud her of her rights in violation of an alleged duty owed by the defendant under the contract. Any review we might make of the acts of the defendant with regard to the internal affairs of its foreign corporate subsidiaries would not be for the purpose of determining their individual correctness, but rather to review them as evidence of an intentional scheme to violate contractual duties. Any decree entered by our courts would involve damages to a promisee for breach of contract, not damages to a shareholder for mismanagement by directors of a foreign corporation. Accordingly, the loAver court incorrectly decided that it was bound to dismiss the instant case.</p>

It is well within the power of the court, in the interests of justice, to decline to exercise its jurisdiction where, upon consideration of the parties, the witnesses, the situs of the cause of action and other kindred reasons, the litigation can more appropriately be conducted in another forum. See <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. </em>Gilbert, <a href="/us/330/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="330 U.S. 501" data-case-ids="354212" data-case-paths="/us/330/0501-01">supra;</a> <em>Koster v.

S. 518</a> (1947). The American Law Institute, in its Restatement (2d), Conflict of Laws (Tentative Draft No. 4 April 5, 1957), formulates the rule this way: “§117e. Foeum Non Conveniens. While the plaintiff ordinarily controls choice of the forum, a court does not exercise jurisdiction if it is a seriously inappropriate forum for the trial of the action so long as an appropriate forum is available to the plaintiff.’’<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Whether a suit should be dismissed under the doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens will depend largely upon the particular facts and upon the discretion of the trial court. Such exercise of discretion will be overruled on appeal only when abused.</p>

Factors to be considered. The two most important factors look to the court’s retention of the case. They are (1) that <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>since it is for the plaintiff to choose the place of suit, his choice of a forum should not he disturbed except for weighty reasons, and (2) that the action will not be dismissed in any event unless an alternative forum is available to the plaintiff. Because of the second factor, the suit will be entertained, no matter how inappropriate the forum may be, if defendant cannot be subjected to jurisdiction in other states. The same will be true if plaintiff’s cause of action would elsewhere be barred by the statute of limitations, unless the court is willing to accept defendant’s stipulation that he will not raise this defense in the second state.</p>

This has been done as follows by Mr. Justice Jackson in Gulf Oil Corp. v.

S. 501</a>, 508 (1947) : ‘If the combination and weight of factors requisite to given results are difficult to forecast or state, those to be considered are not difficult to name. An interest to be considered, and one likely to be most pressed, is the private interest of the litigant. Important considerations are the relative ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view Avould be appropriate to the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive. There may also be questions as to the enforceability of a judgment if one is obtained. The court will weigh relative advantages and obstacles to a fair trial. . . .</p>

There is an appropriateness, too, in having the trial ... in a forum that is at home with the state law that must govern the case, rather than having a court in some other forum untangle problems in conflict of laws, and in law foreign to itself.’</p>

Reviewing the facts pleaded in the light of the principles outlined above, we find that the parties are nonresidents, and that the defendant corporation is not registered to do business in this state (nor is it alleged that any offices are being maintained within our borders). The contract upon which this action is predicated was entered into in Copenhagen, Denmark, and is to be performed mostly in the Scandinavian countries and partly in New York State. Aside from the serious conflict of laws problems which will arise in determining which law applies, we have the problem of the validity of the stipulation in the contract itself that disagreements over its provisions should be settled in accordance with the laws of Denmark, and in the courts of Denmark. The sole connection the case has with Pennsylvania is the fact that a debtor of the defendant could be served herein, thus making a foreign attachment possible.</p>
