He interrupted his general trial instructions and admonished the jurors that such a practice was not permitted. The juror immediately desisted. When the charge was completed, and before the jury retired to the jury room to consider and decide the case, another juror approached the bench and notified the trial judge that he, too, had taken notes and immediately handed over to the judge three pages of handwritten memoranda which he had jotted down during the course of the entire proceedings. The notes, prepared by both jurors involved, were not taken into the jury room. The party-plaintiffs, against whom the jury returned its verdict, sought a new trial on the ground that the taking of the notes by a juror in copious detail, and during most of the trial proceedings, prejudiced their right to a fair trial. The court denied the motion for a new trial and from the judgment entered on the verdict this appeal was taken.</p>

We see no resulting prejudice herein. The notes were not taken into the jury room and were, therefore, not relied upon by the twelve in their consultation and it is this prejudicial practice that is the main sin which the no-note-taking rule aims to obviate. It is when this happens that the danger oí overemphasizing the importance of the notes made by a juror materializes, causing other members of the jury to underestimate, if not totally to disregard, the power and value of their own recollection of the evidence. It also places the note-taking juror in a position of superiority in his own- eyes and in those of the other jurors, and sets up a situation wherein a juror may attempt to exert an undue and unfair influence. None of these objectionable practices occurred in this case for the obvious reason that the notes made by the jurors involved were surrendered into the custody of the trial judge before the deliberations began.</p>
