L. 1163, as amended (20 PS \u00a72080.301, Pkt. Part) ; and that it be further recognized at the rehearing, as a matter of law, that the father, because of his declared unwillingness to have the care, training and rearing of the child in his own home or under his personal supervision and direction elsewhere, is Avithout standing to maintain his habeas corpus proceeding for the child\u2019s custody Avhich he seeks solely for the purpose of placing the child for adoption Avhen he, himself, is presently subject to a court order, entered in an adversary proceeding, for her support. See Commonwealth ex rel. Crozer v. Crozer, 180 Pa. Superior Ct. 381, 119 A. 2d 603.\nAccordingly, the order appealed from is reversed and the record remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.",
