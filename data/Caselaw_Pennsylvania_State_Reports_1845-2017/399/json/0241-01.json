        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nS. Pearce Holton, a lawyer and resident of Philadelphia, died on April 26, 1931. Under the terms of his will, \u2014 executed on March 16, 1929, \u2014 he created several trusts, a provision of one of which trusts is herein presented for construction and interpretation.\nUnder the eleventh paragraph of his will, the testator created a $400,000 trust which provided for the payment of the net income therefrom to the testator\u2019s son, Howard Holton, during his life, and, \u201cat his death and until the expiration of twenty-one years\u201d therefrom, \u201cto divide the net income . . . into as many parts ... as there shall be children of [Howard Holton] living at the quarterly distribution periods and children of [Howard Holton] then dead represented by descendants then living and to subdivide the shares falling to each set of descendants of a deceased child of [Howard Holton] amongst them per stirpes, upon the principle of representation, and to pay over to each child or descendants of a deceased child of [Howard Holton] then found entitled its share of such income . . .\u201d Upon the expiration of the twenty-one year period, the trust principal was to be divided \u201cinto as many parts ... as there shall be children of [Howard Holton] then alive and children of [Howard Holton] then dead, represented by descendants then living, and to subdivide the share falling to each set of descendants of a deceased child of [Howard Holton] amongst them per stirpes . . . and the shares thus ascertained to pay over to each child and descendants of a deceased child then found entitled, absolutely and in fee.\u201d If Howard Holton died \u201cwithout leaving descendants him surviving or leaving descendants they should not survive to take principal\u201d, one-half of the principal of the fund was given to the testamentary appointee or appointees of Howard Holton and the other one-half of the principal was to be added to trusts created under the testator\u2019s will for John M. Holton, Jr,, and Mary Holton Globensky, children of testator\u2019s deceased son, John M. Holton.\nHoward Holton married approximately ten years prior to the date of testator\u2019s will and approximately twelve years prior to the date of testator\u2019s death and of this marriage no children were born. Approximately three years after testator\u2019s death the Howard Holtons adopted a girl, Henrietta Duke Holton, and almost four years after testator\u2019s death they adopted a boy, Samuel Pearce Holton. When Howard Holton died on December 4, 1957, he left to survive him, in addition to his widow, these two adopted children.\nAt an audit of the trustee\u2019s account, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County denied the claims of the two adopted children to this trust fund. Exceptions to this adjudication were dismissed and a final decree entered. From that decree the adopted children have appealed.\nUnder the provisions of testator\u2019s will, are these two children, adopted subsequent to the date of testator\u2019s will, to be considered as Howard Holton\u2019s \u201cchildren\u201d for the purpose of receiving initially the net income from the trust, and, if they survive the requisite twenty-one year period, of receiving eventually distribution of the principal of the trust? In resolving this question two inquiries must be pursued: first, to determine whether, within the four corners of this will, the testator evidenced any intent that Howard Holton\u2019s adopted children should be included in or excluded from the word \u201cchildren\u201d and, if such intent is evidenced, it will prevail; second, in the absence of any evidence of testator\u2019s intent, expressed or implied, in the will, to determine the impact of section 16(b) of the Wills Act of 1917 upon the construction and interpretation of this will.\nAn examination of the language of this will reveals no manifest expression of the testator\u2019s intent in this respect; if such intent is present it must arise by implication. The appellants contend that an implication of an intent on the part of the testator to include adopted children within the word \u201cchildren\u201d arises both from the language of the eleventh paragraph of the will and from a comparison of the language of paragraphs eleventh and twelfth. The appellants argue that in the eleventh paragraph when the testator used the word \u201cdescendants\u201d in juxtaposition with the words \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d he used such words synonymously, and, since we held in Collins Estate, 393 Pa. 195, 142 A. 2d 178, that the word \u201cdescendants\u201d may include adopted children, Collins should control and the words \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d likewise be held inclusive of an adopted child or children. From a study of the language of this will it is apparent that Collins is wholly inapposite. Testator did not use \u201cdescendants\u201d synonymously with \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d; it is clear that the testator\u2019s reference to \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d was to members of a third generation class while his reference to \u201cdescendants\u201d was to members of a fourth generation class. Judge Lefever in the court below aptly stated: \u201c. . . it is clear that the only rights of [the adopted children] are as children or descendants of deceased children of [Howard Holton]. They cannot by implication elevate themselves into a broader class described as \u2018descendants\u2019 . . .\u201d.\nThe appellants further contend that the testator\u2019s use of the word \u201cissue\u201d in the twelfth paragraph of the will \u2014 wherein he created a trust for the benefit of the widow and two children of his deceased son, John M. Holton \u2014 when compared with the testator\u2019s use of the word \u201cdescendants\u201d in the eleventh paragraph is most significant. According to appellants, this significance lies in the fact that \u201cissue\u201d denotes only actual physical offspring, while \u201cdescendants\u201d may include adopted children and the testator, a well trained lawyer, must have employed these different words to indicate an intent in the twelfth paragraph to provide for his deceased son\u2019s natural children and in the eleventh paragraph by the broad term \u201cdescendants\u201d to provide for possible adopted children. Such a contention is without merit. The eleventh and twelfth paragraphs each provide dissimilar gifts for entirely dissimilar situations; it is obvious that the testator selected language which would be appropriate for each different situation. No significance can be attached to this variation in language.\nOur examination of this will reveals no intent, expressed or implied, that the testator contemplated either the inclusion in or the exclusion from the word \u201cchildren\u201d of adopted children. The will is silent on the subject.\nOur next inquiry is the impact, if any, of the Wills Act of 1917, supra, on the construction and interpretation of this will.\nThe legislature in the Wills Act of 1917, \u00a716(b) provided: \u201cWhenever in any will a bequest or devise shall be made to the child or children of any person other than the testator, without naming such child or children, such bequest or devise shall be construed to include any adopted child or children of such other person who were adopted before the date of the will unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.\u201d An examination of this statute clearly reveals the legislative intent: to include within the term \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d of a person other than the testator an adopted \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d provided, however, that such adoption took place before the execution of the will, and to exclude such adopted child or children if the adoption took place after the execution of the will. In Corr\u2019s Estate, 338 Pa. 337, 12 A. 2d 76, this Court considered a somewhat analogous situation. Corr died in 1912 leaving a will executed in 1906; he created a testamentary trust for his daughter for life and gave her a power to appoint among her \u201cchildren and descendants of children\u201d; he provided a gift oyer if she died \u201cleaving no children or descendants of children\u201d. The daughter had no natural children but adopted a son in 1930, eighteen years after Corr\u2019s death. The daughter\u2019s attempt to exercise her power of appointment in favor of her adopted son was held invalid. This Court stated (p. 340) : \u201cPrior to the passage of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P.L. 403, it was the established rule that adopted children could not participate in. testamentary gifts to \u2018children\u2019: [citing cases]. As the testator died five years before the effective date of the Wills Act, this is the rule that must govern the interpretation of his will. But even if the Wills Act [1917] were applicable here, Seidle\u2019s position would be no better, because that statute modifies the former rule of construction only as to persons adopted before the execution of the will. See Section 16(b) of the Wills Act.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)\nIn passing upon the applicability of and the interpretation to be given to the Wills Act, supra, we are mindful that: \u201cStatutes are never presumed to make any innovation in the rules or principles of the common law or prior-existing law beyond what is expressly declared in their provisions: [citing cases]\u201d. Rahn v. Hess, 378 Pa. 264, 270, 271, 106 A. 2d 461; Guthrie\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 530, 536, 182 A. 2d 248. Prior to the passage of the Wills Act of 1917, supra, our courts consistently held that an adopted child or children were not included within testamentary gifts or bequests to a \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d: Commonwealth v.

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMb. Justice Musmanno:\nIs there any difference in law between the legal rights of a natural child and those of an adopted child? I personally do not see, in the enlightened jurisprudence of today, any distinction between the child which comes into the arms of its parents through the mystery of divine creation, inspired by human love, and the child who reaches those same arms through the medium of the law, guided by the same manifestation of love and devotion.\nThe law of Pennsylvania requires an adopting parent to provide his adopted child with the same maintenance, education and guidance which he gives to his natural child. The adopted child is bound to honor, respect and obey his adopting parents the same as a natural child is required to respond to the wishes of his natural parents. The adopted child and the adopting parents inherit and take, by devolution from and through each other, personal estate as next of kin and real estate as heirs, as fully as if the adopted child had been born into the family of the adopting parents.\nMoreover, the full-fledged status of an adopted child in the family of the adopting parents is written not only in the books of the law but in the hearts of all mankind. Thus, in upholding the position of an adopted child we must keep in mind that an enlightened and sympathetic civilization insists that an adopted child must be as by descendants then living, the latter taking per stirpes, solicitously guarded, as zealously protected, and as tenderly cared for as the natural born child.\nAn adopted child is not merely a creature to be loved and p.etted by his adopting benefactors. He becomes the medium for the perpetuation of the family, which is the backbone of society and the hope of intelligent progress in realizing the wholesome and peace-loving dreams of the human race.\nThus, it is with keen regret that I find the Majority of this Court denying to the two adopted children, who are the subjects of litigation in this case, the inheritance which I believe is rightfully theirs. It could be that the writer of the Majority Opinion, who is also the author of the masterful opinion in the Collins Case, 393 Pa. 195, is no less desirous than I of seeing Henrietta Duke Holton and Samuel Pearce Holton II inherit, through their adoptive father, the wealth of that father\u2019s father, but finds, athwart the broad avenue leading to that happy devolution, the Wills Acts of 1917, which' he deems hon-passable. On the contrary, I see an open highway beckoning adoptive-children into the land of full emancipation which a generous and fair-minded people have opened to them.\nLet us take a glance at the facts which have generated this ease which could have been, but unfortunately turns out not to be, the last blow of the hammer breaking the last link in the chain of technicality holding descendants in a bondage never intended by their testator-benefactors. On March 16, 1929, S. Pearce Holton of Philadelphia executed his last will and testament in which he created a $400,000 trust fund, the income of which was to be paid to his son Howard Holton for life. Upon Howard\u2019s death and for 21 years thereafter, the income was to be distributed among the children of Howard living at the quarterly distribution periods, and children of Howard then dead represented upon the principal of representation. At the end of the 21 year period, the trust principal was to be divided among Howard\u2019s children then living and children of Howard then dead represented by descendants then dead, the latter taking per stirpes, upon the principle of representation.\nThe will further provided that if Howard died \u201cwithout leaving descendants him surviving or leaving descendants they should not survive to take principal\u201d, then one-half of the principal of the fund was to go to Howard\u2019s testamentary appointee or appointees and the other one-half of the principal was to be added to trusts created under the Will for John M. Holton, Jr., and Mary Holton Globensky, children of testator\u2019s son John, who was deceased at the time Mr. Holton executed his will.\nWhen Pearce Holton wrote his will, and even at the time of his death, April 24, 1931, Howard had no children. In 1934, however, Howard adopted a girl child, Henrietta Duke Holton, and in 1935, a boy child, S. Pearce Holton, II. Howard died December 4,1957, and on the audit of the trustees\u2019 account after his death, his two adopted children claimed the principal of the trust fund.' Their claim was contested by John\u2019s chil-. dren who claimed one-half of the principal on the ground that adopted children cannot claim as beneficiaries of the trust principal. The court below accepted this claim and thus granted one-half of the trust principal to John\u2019s two children and one-half of the trust principal to Howard\u2019s testamentary appointees.\nThis Court affirms that adjudication.\nSection 16(b) of the Wills Act of 1917 provides: \u201cWhenever in any -will a bequest or devise shall be made to the child or children of any person other than the testator, without naming such child or children, such bequest or devise shall be construed to include any adopted child or children of such other person who were adopted before the date of the will unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nAs already stated, Howard\u2019s children were adopted after the date of Mr. Holton\u2019s will. If no proviso had followed the first part of Section 16(b) as above quoted, the adopted children would certainly find a closed door to the benefits of the Holton will. But the \u201cunless\u201d clause opens that door which the Majority feels is locked and sealed. I believe that an analysis of the language employed by Mr. Holton in his will reveals an open door policy to let in any children Howard might adopt as beneficiaries of his bounty.\nWhen Mr. Holton drafted his will, he not only knew that Howard had no children but that, in all likelihood, his wife would bear him no children. He also was aware, of course, of the possibility that Howard and his wife might adopt children. If he had intended to exclude adopted children from the effect of his will, it would have been quite a simple matter for him to so state.\nOf course, I know that it is not enough to show that he did not exclude adopted children. In view of the specific wording of the Wills Act as quoted, the appellants (the adopted children) must show that Mr. Holton intended to make them his heirs. The proof of that intent is not lacking.\nMr. Holton made clear that the class of children who would qualify as beneficiaries of the will was not to be determined until the death of Howard. In the 11th paragraph of the will he provided for the payment of the net income from a $400,000 trust to his son, Howard Holton, during his life, and, \u201cat his death and until the expiration of twenty-one years\u201d therefrom, \u201cto divide the net income . . . into as many parts ... as there shall be children of (Howard Holton) living at the quarterly distribution periods and children of (Howard Holton) then dead represented by descendants then living and to subdivide the shares falling to each set of descendants of a deceased child of (Howard Holton) amongst them per stirpes, upon the principle of representation, and to pay over to each child or descendants of a deceased child of (Howard Holton) then found entitled its share of such income. . ..\u201d Upon the expiration of the twenty-one year period, the trust principal was to be divided \u201cinto as many parts ... as there shall be children of (Howard Holton) then alive and children of (Howard Holton) then dead, represented by descendants then living, and to subdivide the share falling to each set of descendants of a deceased child of (Howard Holton) amongst them per stirpes . . . and the shares thus ascertained to pay over to each child and descendants of a deceased child then found entitled, absolutely and in fee.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) If Howard Holton died \u201cwithout leaving descendants him surviving or leaving descendants they should not survive to take principal\u201d, then, as already stated, one-half of the principal of the fund was to be distributed to the appointees of Howard Holton and the other one-half was to be added to the trusts created by the testator for the children of his deceased son, John.\nHp to this point, it must be quite evident that Mr. Holton did not intend that the class of beneficiaries (that is, Howard\u2019s children) should be determined before Howard\u2019s death. This being so, it is obvious he was not limiting the scope of his will only to children in existence at the time he wrote his will. When Howard died, his two adopted children were Howard\u2019s children as much as any two natural born children would be. This conclusion is indisputable in the light of Collins Estate, 393 Pa. 195, where Justice Benjamin Jones said: \u201cThrough the legislative mandate an adopted child in 1921 possessed all the rights of a natural child, both as to its adopting parents and the collateral kindred of its adopting parents. As we said in Fisher v. Robinson, 339 Pa. 305, 310, 198 A. 81: \u2018Under section 16(b) of the Intestate Act of 1917, the adopted child then became a member of the family of the adopting parent.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis that of the Court).\nMr. Holton\u2019s will provided that the descendants of a deceased child were to take per stirpes, by representation, the interest of the deceased child. Accordingly, if Howard had had a natural born child and this child, grown up, had adopted children of his own, these adopted children would'most assuredly take under the will because in the Collins case, supra, this. Court held that the term descendants includes adopted children. Thus, this inescapable logical development produces an incongruous situation which it seems to me should be difficult for the Majority to explain away, namely, that adopted children of a deceased child (that is, the great grandchildren of Mr. Holton) may qualify as beneficiaries, whereas adopted children of Howard himself may not qualify. That is to say, remote adopted descendants can participate in the testator\u2019s estate, but adopted grandchildren, more natural objects of the testator\u2019s benevolence, may not participate.\nIf, in an attempt to explain away this anomaly, it is argued that at the time Mr. Holton drew his will, the Collins decision had not been promulgated, it is enough to say in reply that the Collins decision has laid down a rule of interpretation of the word \u201cdescendants\u201d used by the testator. Mr. Holton was an attorney, well versed in estate work, and the possibility of the interpretation of the word \u201cdescendants\u201d could not have escaped him, especially in view of the Intestate Act of 1917 (in effect at the time Mr. Holton executed Ms will) which gives adopted cMldren the same rights as natural born children.\nMr. Holton specifically stated that only in the event Howard died \u201cwithout leaving descendants him surviving or leaving descendants they should not survive to take principal\u201d that the principal would then be distributed one-half to Howard\u2019s appointees and one-half to John\u2019s children. Here, Mr. Holton was referring to Howard\u2019s direct descendants and not descendants of a deceased child as in the previous provisions of the will, and yet he made no attempt to limit the meaning of the term \u201cdescendants\u201d, nor did he refer back to the previous provisions which the Majority, and the court below, rely upon as circumscribing its meaning. In not so limiting the term \u201cdescendants,\u201d Mr. Holton clearly manifested his intention not to use the term \u201cchildren\u201d in the sense of natural children. If such had been his intent he would have also limited the term \u201cdescendants\u201d by express limitation, or by reference back to previous provisions.\nInstead of doing this, however, he provided that one-half of the principal was to go to John\u2019s children only if Howard did not leave \u201cdescendants.\u201d Since, as the Collins case tells us, \u201cdescendants\u201d does include adopted children unless the contrary is shown, Mr. Holton must necessarily have used the word \u201cchildren\u201d in the same unlimited sense as he used \u201cdescendants,\u201d and, inevitably, adopted children must come within its scope.\nIt is also important to note, in analyzing the will, to ascertain Hr. Holton\u2019s intent, that in bequeathing gifts to John\u2019s children, he used language different from that employed in providing for Howard\u2019s children. As already stated, John had predeceased his father, leaving his widow and two children. Mr. Holton left a $400,000 trust, with l/5th of the income payable to John\u2019s widow \u201cand the remaining net income therefrom and at the death or remarriage of the said Evelyn Harrington Holton, whichever event may first occur, the whole thereof until the expiration of twenty-one years from the date of the death of the last survivor of John M. Holton, Jr. and Mary C. Holton, children of my son, John M. Holton, to pay, in equal shares, to such of the children of my said son who shall be living at the quarterly periods of distribution thereof and the issue of any child of his who may then be deceased, such issue to take their deceased ancestor\u2019s share by representation; and upon the expiration of the period of twenty-one years from the date of the death of the last survivor of the children of my said son, John M. Holton.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nThus, in providing for John\u2019s children Mr. Holton did not say that upon their death their children shall take, but that their issue shall take. In Howlett Estate, 366 Pa. 293, \u201cissue\u201d was defined as follows: \u201cIssue of the body, offspring, progeny, natural children, physically born or begotten by the person named as parent. . . Unlike a child or children whose relationship to it or their parent may now be created either by physical birth or by adoption, issue strongly connotes a bl\u00f3od relationship which ai\u2019ises solely by actual birth of the child to the parent.\u201d: Collins Estate, supra, p. 209.\nAnd in disposing of the residuary gift to John\u2019s children in paragraph 14 of the Will, Mr. Holton again pointed out that the gifts were made with \u201cremainders over to their descendants in the manner set forth in Twelfth Item of this my Will. . . .\u201d Thus, Mr. Holton, by this reference back to the terms of paragraph 12 of Ms will, was making clear that the term \u201cdescendants\u201d was to be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 12 of his will which employs the word \u201cissue\u201d and not \u201cchildren\u201d, the word used in referring to.Howard and his descendants.\nMr. Holton was not a layman employing legal language inexpertly. It can readily be assumed that he used the two different terms \u201cissue\u201d and \u201cchildren,\u201d with a difference in mind. Thus, he had a purpose in speaking of John\u2019s children as \u201cissue,\u201d and in referring to Howard\u2019s descendants as \u201cchildren.\u201d He knew that the term \u201cchildren\u201d is much broader in scope than \u201cissue\u201d and is not limited to blood relationship.\n\u25a0 Justice Benjamin B. Jones spoke pertinently on this very point in the Collins case: \u201cIf we examine carefully the legal and technical words which the testatrix employed in describing the recipients of her bounty we can only conclude that she selected such words with discrimination and care. . . . Furthermore, the power of appointment given by testatrix to her \u2018last surviving child\u2019 under paragraph 4(4) was not restricted to persons of the blood. Unless it be present in the word \u2018descendants\u2019 there appears to be no restriction of dis-> tribution to persons of the blood under this will. If the testatrix did not see fit to weave into the fabric of this will a restriction of distribution of her estate to persons of blood descent does the employment of the word \u2018descendants\u2019 compel that w\u00e9 do so? Neither etymologically nor legally does the word \u2018descendants\u2019 connote a blood relationship.\u201d\nIn the case before us, neither did Mr. Holton see fit to weave into the fabric of his. trust provisions for Howard and Ms children a restriction of his estate to persons of blood descent. It must also be obvious from the above quotation that the word \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d would not be sufficient upon which to base such an intent. Justice Jones said further in Collins, supra: \u201cUnder the law as it stood when testatrix died, an adopted child had all the rights of a natural child; when a will\u2019s .terms are consonant with this broadened conception of adoption we will not, in the absence of any evidence, impute to testatrix a discriminatory attitude.\u201d\nAll the terms of the will before us are consonant with an intent on the part of the testator to benefit Howard\u2019s children, whether adopted or natural children. Thus, I do not see why the Majority should regard Section 16(b) of the Wills Act as a barrier shutting out Howard\u2019s adopted children from what is plainly given to them in the will. The clear intent of Mr. Holton, as expressed in the will, breaks down that barrier. \u25a0\nThe barrier is further demolished when we take into consideration: (1) that at the time Mr. Holton wrote Ms will, Howard had already been married ten years and his marriage had been childless; (2) that John\u2019s widow herself (who is opposing Howard\u2019s adopted children in this litigation) testified that Mr. Holton believed, because there was a doctor\u2019s diagnosis to that effect, Howard\u2019s wife was unable to have children; and (3) that between the writing of the will and Mr. Holton\u2019s death, a period of two years, he never changed the provisions of his will providing for Howard\u2019s children. Since it was clinically established that Howard\u2019s wife would not bear children, it would have been a meaningless declaration (one not consonant with Mr. Holton\u2019s serious purposes) for him to make provision for Howard\u2019s children, unless, of course, he had in mind what actually occurred, namely, that Howard would adopt children.\nThus, these eloquent facts take this case into a summarization of the law as stated by the appellees themselves in their brief, namely: \u201cIn 1930, just a year before the testator died, it was summarized in the American' Law Eeports as follows \u25a0 \u2018It' is almost universally agreed that where a provision is made in a will for children of some person other than the testator, an adopted child is presumed not to be included unless there is language in the will, or there are circumstances surrounding the testator at the time he made the will, which malee it clear that the adopted child was intended to. be included/ Annot., 70 A.L.E. 621-622 (1930). (Emphasis supplied.) Presumably, this also was a part of the testator\u2019s background knowledge.\u201d\nConceding that the above summarization of the law constituted part of Mr. Holton\u2019s background knowledge, the result is manifest that he knew that if he displayed a contrary intent and if the surrounding circumstances substantiated a contrary intent, that intent would prevail. Therefore, he chose language in his will which clearly established, as. already discussed, that children adopted by Howard after the execution of Ms will were to be considered Howard\u2019s children and beneficiaries of the trust provisions for them.\nOn this phase of the discussion it would almost seem that Justice Jones\u2019 language in the Collins case had been written to support my dissenting opinion here, i.e., \u201cAppellants, even though their adoption took place subsequent to the execution date of this Will, were at the time the event occurred upon which a distribution of principal was directed to be made by the testatrix\u2014 Edith C. Perry\u2019s death \u2014 in the eyes of the law in exactly the same relationship to testatrix\u2019s daughter as though born of her body. In the absence of any language in this will from which an intent can be inferred to limit the meaning of \u2018descendants\u2019 to persons in the blood line and in view of the broad meaning of \u2018descendants\u2019 to hold that adopted children are excluded from the terms of this will would deprive them of the benefit of the statutory declaration conferring upon them all \u2014 not some \u2014 of the rights of a natural child. Had testatrix\u2019s deceased child been survived by natural children, obviously they would have been \u2018descendants\u2019 of such deceased child. To exclude adopted children\u2014 occupying a status equating that of natural children\u2014 from the class of their adopted mother\u2019s \u2018descendants\u2019 on the basis of an assumed intent on testatrix\u2019s part to exclude from the word \u2018descendants\u2019 persons not of the blood is without basis either in the provisions of this will or in the law in effect when testatrix died. That appellants were not adopted until long after the effective date of the will does not compel a contrary conclusion. Testatrix foresaw that the time of taking by her children\u2019s \u2018descendants\u2019 would be in the distant future and she actually provided that only those \u2018descendants\u2019 would take who survived her child or children; certainly testatrix knew that her child or children legally could and actually might adopt children before the event of taking. Is it any less logical to conclude that testatrix intended that adopted children be included in the class of - takers than to conclude that testatrix \u2022 intended that only natural children or children of the blood be included in such class? Neither etymologically nor historically has the word \u2018descendants\u2019 acquired such significance that it points unerringly in this will \u2014 in the face of the legally accepted equation of status of an adopted child and a natural child \u2014 to an intent to exclude from a testatrix\u2019s bounty children legally adopted by her children.\u201d\n\u25a0It is true that in the case before us, we are dealing with the terms of section 16(b) of the Wills Act and the interpretation of the word \u201cchildren\u201d rather than the word \u201cdescendants\u201d. Nevertheless, the reasoning in the Collins case is most pertinent to the issue of the testator\u2019s intent in the instant case and when applied to the admitted parts leads to but one conclusion, namely: That the testator fully intended to benefit children adopted by Howard after the execution of the will, and that he had no idea of giving a different meaning to the term \u201cdescendants\u201d, of Howard than was given to the term in the Collins case..\nAccordingly, I dissent.\nPearce Holton did make a generous provision for John\u2019s children, who are quite grown-up, so that it must not be assumed that if the adopted children would prevail in this litigation, John\u2019s children would be left empty-handed.\nJohn\u2019s widow testified that Mr. Holton was aware of a doctor\u2019s report to that effect and that he' believed no children would be born of this marriage.",
