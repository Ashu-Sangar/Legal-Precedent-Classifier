        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nThis is an appeal from a refusal to remove a compulsory nonsuit.\nThe evidence must he viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff: Dobb v. Stetzler, 369 Pa. 554, 87 A. 2d 308 (1952). The record considered in this manner discloses the following facts. The plaintiff on a fair, dry day in September, 1954, was walking across Hopewell' Avenue in the community of Aliquippa, Beaver County, when he was struck by an automobile operated by the defendant and was seriously injured.. Hopewell Avenue, an improved public highway, runs north and south, is 30 feet in width, and is divided into three' ten-foot traffic lanes. The westerly lane is used for the parking of motor vehicles, the center lane for southbound traffic, and the easterly lane for northbound traffic.\nPlaintiff was walking south on the sidewalk on the westerly side of the street when a friend, operating an automobile in a northerly direction in the easterly lane, stopped temporarily, hailed the plaintiff and offered him a ride. Plaintiff was crossing the street from west to east between intersections, in the direction of his friend\u2019s automobile, when the accident occurred. At the point where plaintiff started to cross the street, automobiles were parked parallel with and adjacent to the curb. As plaintiff stepped off the curb into the roadway, he saw a truck proceeding south in the westerly lane. He then walked between two parked cars and when he reached the end or outer edge of the parked cars, he looked to his left and saw defendant\u2019s automobile traveling south in the westerly lane at a point located up the street to the north, the distance to which, was estimated by other testimony to be 174 feet. Plaintiff then proceeded to take four or five steps into the street and then looked to his left again and saw that the defendant\u2019s automobile was right on top of him. The impact followed almost instantly.\nPolice investigating the accident found two skid marks in the southbound traffic lane where defendant had been traveling, 24' 3\" in length. They were parallel to the curb. The right, or west, mark was 12' from the west curb and the left, or east, mark was 2%-' from the line dividing the north and southbound lanes. In front of the right, or west, skid mark were two spots of blood 12' from the west curb, or 4%' from the east side of the parked cars. No testimony was offered as to the speed at which defendant\u2019s car was traveling. Its damage consisted of a dent on the right front between the headlight and the center of the grill.\nAt the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the court entered a compulsory nonsuit, holding plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence. Subsequently, the court refused to remove the nonsuit, not only sustaining the finding of the trial judge that plaintiff was contributorily negligent, but also ruling that negligence on the part of the defendant had not been established.\nThe lower court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law was clearly correct. It is axiomatic that the question of contributory negligence should not be taken from the jury\u2019s consideration except in a clear case and only when reasonable minds would not legitimately differ as to the conclusion of its existence: Aaron v. Strausser, 360 Pa. 82, 59 A. 2d 910 (1948).\nIt is not negligence per se for a pedestrian to cross a highway or street in the middle of the block: Nugent v. Joerger, 387 Pa. 330, 127 A. 2d 697 (1956). In doing so, a pedestrian has a perfect right to rely on the exercise of reasonable care by the drivers of automobiles on the highway: Dempsey v. Cuneo Eastern Press Ink Company of Pennsylvania, 318 Pa. 557, 179 A. 220 (1935). However, a pedestrian who crosses a street between intersections is held to a higher degree of care than one who crosses on a crosswalk at a street intersection, and, by the same token, the driver of an automobile is held to a correspondingly lesser degree of care: Harris v. DeFelice, 379 Pa. 469, 109 A. 2d 174 (1954) ; Rucheski v. Wisswesser et al., 355 Pa. 400, 50 A. 2d 291 (1947). It is equally well established that a pedestrian, particularly one crossing between intersections, must not only look before starting to cross the street but must continue to look as he proceeds across. Otherwise, he is guilty of negligence as a matter of law: Aaron v. Strausser (supra) ; Goldberg v. Kelly, 340 Pa. 430, 17 A. 2d 390 (1941) ; Rafferty v. DiJohn, 390 Pa. 123, 135 A. 2d 375 (1957) ; Auel v. White, 389 Pa. 208, 132 A. 2d 350 (1957); Dwyer v. Kellerman, 363 Pa. 593, 70 A. 2d 313 (1950).\nIn the instant case, the plaintiff looked before he started to cross the roadway but it is crystal clear that he did not continue to look as he proceeded to cross the busy thoroughfare. This in itself convicted him of contributory negligence. It was a clear violation of his definite obligation, even if no approaching traffic were visible before he undertook to cross. But, it was even more incumbent upon him to continue to look as a reasonably prudent man interested in his own safety would do, in view of the fact that, before he started to cross, he saw the automobile of the defendant approaching from a comparatively short distance away. His own foolhardiness in blindly jay-walking across a busy street at least contributed to this unfortunate occurrence. This renders recovery impossible under a long line of Pennsylvania authorities.\nThe judgment of the lower court is affirmed.\nAt one point in Bis testimony, plaintiff testified Be was walking between the parked cars when Be looked to Bis left for trafile approaching in a southerly direction, but we are1 assuming Bis most favorable answer in this respect is correct.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno :\nThe effect of the decision of the lower court in the present case, affirmed by this Court, is to cause many a pedestrian to wonder whether, as he is about to cross a street, he should not first acquire a college education. Thus, in the event he is injured while crossing the street, he will be able to express in the purest of English, to the learned judges who hear his case, just what happened, because, otherwise, with all the right on his side, he may still lose, the learned judges being unable to understand, or lacking the patience to understand, what he is saying.\nNikola Shuman, the plaintiff here, was struck by an automobile as he was crossing a street in Aliquippa. He sued the owner of the offending car but, at the ensuing trial, the trial court nonsuited him, declaring him guilty of contributory negligence. But, as I read the record, I find that the only thing of which Nikola Shuman was guilty, was using bad English, which up to this moment has not been regarded as contributory negligence in any case that I find in the books.\nHowever, as unpolished and ungrammatical as Nikola\u2019s speech may have been, he still told a clear enough story which entitled him to go to the jury on the questions of negligence and contributory negligence.\nBriefly stated, the accident happened as Nikola was crossing Hopewell Avenue in Aliquippa between intersections, moving from the western to the eastern side of the roadway. In order to get to the other side, where a friend (Sam Bekitck) was waiting to give him a ride to his destination, Nikola had to pass between two parked cars. Before committing himself to the street he looked to the left and saw an automobile 174 feet away and he concluded that he had sufficient time to cross before it reached Mm. He took four or five steps and then, looking to the left again, he observed the car bearing down on him. He endeavored to avoid the collision, but when once more he looked to the left, the car was about to strike. In desperation he leaped to the hood of the car. When he was asked at the trial: \u201cDid any part of the car hit your right arm?\u201d he replied: \u201cNo. I think when I jump on car that hickey on the hood maybe against the arm.\u201d\nHe was asked: \u201cBy 'hickey\u2019, do you mean the ornament on the front of the car?\u201d\nHe replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I am poor on the English.\u201d\nBut, even being \u201cpoor on the English,\u201d he still painted, with crude paints perhaps, a rather graphic picture of the accident. He said: \u201cThen I get \u2014 when I get in between the cars, I take a look on the left if there was anybody coming, and I saw machine; it look to me too far enough, some kind store down there.\u201d\nObviously, by \u201ctoo far enough\u201d he meant that the car was far enough away for him to cross in safety. He was then asked what happened. He replied: \u201cI take it four or five steps. I think I got plenty time to make it cross, and then turn to left. I notice this\u2014 there is automobile; then I turn left again. I \u2014 car was right on me, trap me, and I make my mind to jump on the hood.\u201d\nOne does not need to speak Serbian dialect to understand that what Nikola was saying here is that he felt confident he had plenty of time within which to traverse the street without harm to himself. After he had taken four or five steps he saw the car again to his left. \u201cI notice this \u2014 there is automobile\u201d. Then he says \u201cI turn left again,\u201d which means that from the time he stepped off the curb to the time he was hit, he looked to his left at least three times. First, at the parked cars, second, when he had taken four or five steps, and third, when the \u201ccar was right on me, trap me.\u201d\nThe trial court offered no explanation as to why it found Nikola so much at fault that his alleged dereliction was not even to be considered by a jury. The court merely arbitrarily declared that Nikola was guilty of contributory negligence. Then this Court, in affirming the nonsuit, said: \u201cThe plaintiff looked before he started to cross the roadway but it is crystal clear that he did not continue to look as he proceeded to cross the busy thoroughfare.\u201d\n\u2022When a pedestrian sees a car 174 feet away he certainly has the right to assume that he can take four or five steps without being run down. He is not required by -law or by common prudence to keep his head screwed to the left as he advances on his legitimate errand. The Majority Opinion admits that Hopewell Avenue was a \u201cbusy thoroughfare.\u201d Thus Nikola had to be concerned about what was ahead of him and to the right of him, as well as to what was on his left. It would not have helped Nikola much if, by keeping his eyes constantly riveted to his left, he had walked into an open manhole ahead.\nIt is true that Nikola crossed Hopewell Avenue between intersections and while ordinarily one may be on safer territory at intersections, the law does not make crossing between intersections an act of contributory negligence. In Nugent v. Joerger, 387 Pa. 330, 332, we said:. \u201cThe tempo of the twentieth century being what, it is the law recognizes that a pedestrian is entitled to cross in the middle of a block in order to gain a few seconds\u2019 time which will hasten him on to his destination.\u201d\nWe said further: \u201cA pedestrian crossing in the middle of a block, in full view of an oncoming car, cannot legally be declared guilty of contributory negligence if - he reasonably assumes that the motorist, having am-pie time within which to stop his car or alter his course to avoid hitting him, will not run him down in defiance of the laws of safety, the standards of the motor code, and the edicts of humanity.\u201d (p. 334, supra).\nIn addition to finding the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence the lower Court concluded that the defendant was not negligent. It seems to me, quite to the contrary, that a very clear case of negligence is made against a motorist when it is shown that he saw, or should have seen, a pedestrian on the street 174 feet ahead of him, and that, in spite of what he sees, he continues ahead with speed unabated and strikes his victim with such force that the impact tears off one of the victim\u2019s shoes, and hurls it 40 feet, in the meantime breaking his right leg and inflicting deep cuts in his arm.\nThe Majority Opinion says: \u201cNo testimony was offered as to the speed at which the defendant\u2019s car was traveling.\u201d\nThere was evidence enough of great speed when it was shown that the defendant\u2019s car skidded 24 feet 3 inches before it came to a stop and, as already stated, one of the plaintiff\u2019s shoes, because of the violence of the impact, flew through the air for 40 feet.\nWe have seen, as Nikola himself said, that he was \u201cpoor on the English.\u201d Is he now to be uncompensated for his broken leg because of his broken English? An idea of the dilapidated vehicle of expression on which he moved through the trial can be gathered from his description on the witness stand of the man who had offered him a ride. He said: \u201cI look at him. I know him. He was work there president Serbian Club, and I see him, and almost at the end of the building to the left he stop; so I go over there on sidewalk.\u201d\nDefendant\u2019s counsel, without attributing to him any malevolent motive, endeavored to have \u2022 Nikola admit contributory negligence, but Nikola, limping as he did in a medium not his own, was agile enough mentally to see what his legal adversary was attempting to do to him, just as he was agile enough to leap on the hood of the car which might otherwise have killed him.\nA perfect case of contributory negligence would be made out against Nikola if he were to say that he was struck immediately after he stepped out betwen the two parked cars. The astute cross-examiner asked Nikola: \u201cWhen you saw this car in front of you, do you remember what it was \u2014 you were just stepping out between the cars, and there was a Ford, and you jumped on the Ford. Do you remember?\u201d\nBut Nikola sidestepped the thrust. He replied: \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t that way. When I look left, I see car too far; so I could make it. I take it four or five steps; then I turn again to my \u2014 throw my eyes over here (indicating) ; the car on me; so I jump.\u201d\nBy \u201ctoo far\u201d he obviously meant the car was too far away for him to have any doubt about his getting across safely.\nDefendant\u2019s counsel now tried to make it appear that Nikola was standing on the curb or had just passed through the parked cars and then, as the car came by, leaped aboard like a truant schoolboy sneaking a ride on a passing truck. Counsel asked: \u201cHere. Look at this. Weren\u2019t you standing right there (indicating) when you saw this car, and then, when it got down close, you jumped on the hood?\u201d\nBut even with his un-college-bred brain, Nikola could see the trap into which defendant\u2019s counsel was attempting to lure him. He replied: \u201cI jump it right away. I make it steps. I make it four or five steps, maybe more, then I jump when car approach me.\u201d\nThe first \u201cI jump it right away\u201d was clearly intended as an inquiring repetition of defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s question, as if to say: \u201cI jump it right away?\u201d And then came the explanation: \u201cI make it four or five steps, maybe more, then I jump when car approach me.\u201d\nThe cross-examiner tried another stratagem: \u201cYou went up just opposite his car, and then you went between the parked cars to go straight across to Bekitch\u2019s car, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nIf Nikola had replied Yes to this question he would have admitted that he had proceeded directly through parked cars and, without looking, walked straight into the path of an oncoming car. Nikola saw this, uneducated as he was, and he replied with a flat \u201cNo.\u201d And then, shattering the cross-examiner\u2019s dream for the suicidal reply, Nikola went on to say very specifically: \u201cI take look when I get between cars.\u201d\nSince we are compelled to read the record in the light most favorable to Nikola, we find, by this answer, added to his other answers, the established fact that Nikola looked before he committed himself to. the crossing, looked as he passed between the parked cars, looked when he had taken four or five steps, and looked just as the car was about to hit him. How many looks must a pedestrian take in order not to be hit by a speeding, heedless car, and even more, so as not to be disastrously hit by an unappraising court nonsuit?\nDefendant\u2019s counsel tried again: \u201cQ. You don\u2019t understand me. You went up the sidewalk until you got up to where Bekitch\u2019s car was opposite you? A. Yes. Q. Right straight ahead? A. Yes, right in front of me. Q. Then you went between the parked cars? A. Yes.\u201d\nAnd now comes the cross-examiner\u2019s pitch: \u201cGoing over to Bekitch\u2019s car?\u201d In other words, going straight ahead to Beldtch\u2019s car without looking.\nBut Nikola saw the curve in the cross-examiner\u2019s throw and he replied: \u201cNo. I look. I didn\u2019t go right away.\u201d\nThe cross-examiner now tried another curve: \u201cThere was a space between the parked cars and the Bekitch car to which you were going, is that right?\u201d\nThis was obviously intended to letch an affirmative answer which could be interpreted as. showing \u25a0 that Nikola pushed out through the open space, not looking, not heeding, not watching out for oncoming cars. But the answer was not what the cross-examiner expected. Nikola was careless about grammar, but not careless about the manner in which he crossed the street. He replied: \u201cI get out between the ears, and then I look, and after I see it was far enough I could make it \u2014 \u201d\nHere the cross-examiner more or less gave up. However, he had not failed. Although he was unable to confuse Nikola, he did succeed in convincing the trial court that, somehow, Nikola was guilty of contributory negligence, not because of what Nikola said but because of what the court did not take the time to understand what Nikola said.\nThus, although Nikola\u2019s natural intelligence and adherence to the simple truth saved him from the bear traps laid down by the cross-examiner, it did not save him from tumbling into the pit of an overly-meticulous juridic-technical appraisement of his stumbling vocabulary.\nAnd so, I end this dissent as I began, namely: When one is contemplating crossing a street he should first take stock of his educational equipment and ask himself certain questions: Will he be able to cope with the intricacies of the English language on the witness stand? Will the judge understand what he is saying, with his heart but only falteringly, with his tongue? Will he be able to describe what he did so that it cannot be twisted into seemingly something else?\nIf he cannot answer all these questions in the affirmative, he had better delay that first step into the Street until he can go to college or at least take a correpondenee course on how to win verdicts and influence technicians. Then, if he crosses the street and is hurt, and he has a good case, he will be able to describe in faultless English and impeccable grammar, unblemished by confusing contributing clauses and split infinitives, just what happened to him. And then, when the verdict is returned in his favor, Justice will remove her blindfold and smile at this demonstration of perfection in an imperfect world.\nAll italics mine.",
