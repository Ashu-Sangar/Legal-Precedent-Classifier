The court made specific findings - of fact and conclusions of law and found accordingly in favor of the plaintiff company in the sum of $28,266.84, with interest thereon from May 16, 1955. The defendant filed exceptions to the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions, which exceptions, after argument thereon before the court en banc, were dismissed and judgment was entered on the trial court\u2019s verdict for the plaintiff. The findings of the trial judge, having evidence to support them, and having been confirmed by the court en banc, have the weight of a jury\u2019s verdict and support the judgment in favor of the plaintiff company.\nJudgment affirmed.",
