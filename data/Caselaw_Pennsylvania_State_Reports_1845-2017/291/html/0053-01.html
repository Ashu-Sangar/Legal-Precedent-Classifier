When the contract was signed, $2,500 was paid to Brown as hand money, and a like additional sum was turned over to him on June 30th, On October 15th, the date named for settlement, <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>the purchaser called upon the seller for the purpose of closing the transaction, but was advised by the latter that he was not prepared to convey the property on that day.

On November 5th, plaintiff interviewed defendant again, tendered to him the balance of the purchase-money, and presented an executed conveyance for the property which he had agreed to transfer as part of the consideration.

      <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>The defense now asserted rests on different averments. It is first alleged that the understanding, not suggested before, was that the Browns should have the right to withdraw from the agreement at any time, if they should so desire, and thereby relieve themselves of any duty to convey. No such reservation appears in the written contract, which is express, in its terms and without ambiguity. “All preliminary negotiations, conversations and verbal agreements are merged in and superseded by the subsequent written contract,...... and unless fraud, accident or mistake be averred, the writing constitutes the agreement between the parties, and its terms cannot be added to nor subtracted from by parol evidence”: Gianni v. Russell, <a href="/pa/281/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="281 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1086994" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0320-01">281 Pa. 320</a>, 323. There was no allegation of the omission of this asserted understanding by reason of fraud, accident or mistake, nor, as found by the court, any evidence to support such a contention, and no such claim was made when defendant refused the demand to. carry out his agreement. The defense set up is unsupported in fact and without merit in law under the evidence adduced at the trial.</p>
    <p id="b79-4" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[183,1470,1153,912]],["BL_80.1",80,[227,344,1152,635]]]'>A second excuse for nonperformance was based on allegations that the original proposition made by Brown, through Clark, a real estate broker, was to sell two properties, the residence now in question, and a theater building, for a lump sum of $180,000, it being averred the understanding was that one should not be disposed of without the other, and Humphrey had agreed to buy both. From the evidence it appears that the agent, originally employed by Brown, came to Brookville for the purpose of securing a purchaser for the two pieces of real estate. Later, he communicated with Humphrey, and finally secured his assent to purchase the residence. He also made efforts to interest the latter in the theater,. and: preliminary negotiations for the acquirement of it by plaintiff followed. A contract to sell the same, dated June 10, 1926, was executed by the Browns, but Humphrey refused to sign the agree<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>ment, and notified the owner that he had determined not to buy. He did suggest giving financial aid to a third party, who was contemplating the purchase. It was not until June 17th or 24th, one or two weeks after the refusal to buy the theater, that the written agreement as to the residence, in which no reference to the other property appears, was entered into, and the hand money paid. When this transaction was concluded, Humphrey paid the agent Clark three per cent commission on the value of the property which he was to give in exchange, and Brown paid to Clark the fees due for the sale of his residence, now in dispute.</p>

The defendants insist that it was only by reason of the representation by Clark, the agent, that such deal would be later consummated, that the articles dated June 17th, the basis of this proceeding, were signed, and that under such circumstances specific performance cannot be granted. Though parol evidence may be offered to show the real understanding when admittedly the written agreement is incomplete (Ward v.

Certainly he could not have agreed to buy on behalf of his principal, if such relation existed, for no authority to so bind had been given in writing, or ratified in that manner, and an attempt on his part to enter into an agreement to purchase, had it been made, would have no effect because of the operation of the statute of frauds: Act March 21, 1772, section 1, 1 Sm. L. 389; Mott v. Kaldes, <a href="/pa/288/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="288 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1100799" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0264-01">288 Pa. 264</a>; Goldstein v. Nichols, <a href="/pa/273/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="273 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1070826" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0107-01">273 Pa. 107</a>. But it is insisted that Clark, acting as agent for plaintiff, could make a representation as to his principal’s purpose, thus obtaining the delivery of the agreement of June 17th, and thereby bind him not to make use of the same until the condition assented to had been complied with. Clark cannot be said to have been the agent of Humphrey to arrange for the purchase of the theater property, which he, as broker, was endeavoring to sell for Brown. He who asserts an agent possesses power to act for' another has the burden of proving it (Fidelity T. &amp; T. Co. v. First Nat. Bank, <a href="/pa/277/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="277 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1079571" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0401-01">277 Pa. 401</a>). Though the agent may testify to acts which establish his authority (Hileman v. Falck, <a href="/pa/263/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="263 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1047445" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0351-01">263 Pa. 351</a>; Lawall v.

Cook, <a href="/pa/289/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="289 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="1103322" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0207-01">289 Pa. 207</a>.</p>

An examination of the record further leads to the conclusion that defendants were not deceived, as suggested. Prior to June 10th, according <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>to Brown’s testimony, plaintiff had given notice that he would not buy tbe theater, and bad refused to execute a written agreement of sale prepared on that date. Tbe testimony of Clark, tbe broker, as to the statements made when tbe agreement of June 17th was executed, does not show any representation made, as now insisted, that Humphrey would buy tbe second property, but, at tbe most, that be would financially aid a third person, if tbe latter should purchase. Tbe defense suggested was without merit, and properly rejected.</p>
