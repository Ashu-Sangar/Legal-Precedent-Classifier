Defendant, requiring additional cash to take up the sight draft, on March 30, 1922, borrowed the necessary amount from plaintiff, and executed to it a bill of sale for one of the trucks contained in the shipment and at the same time, March 30, 1922, a bailment lease of the same ear was entered into by plaintiff and defendant, providing for payment of the <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>entire “rental’’ within two months from its date, with the usual provision for a return of the truck at the end of the term, and reserving to lessee the right to purchase the machine at that time by the further payment of one dollar. Defendant Blough also gave to plaintiff a storage receipt in which the former agreed to keep the motor in his show room and return it to plaintiff on demand. Conformable to this arrangement, plaintiff gave its check to the Cambria Auto Company for the amount of the loan, which defendant endorsed to the bank and applied, together with other funds of his own, in payment of the draft accompanying the bill of lading. Having secured the bill of lading, on payment of the draft, Blough obtained possession of the trucks from the carrier, including the one subject to bailment, and took them to his place of business where they were placed on sale. A similar arrangement, to raise an additional sum needed by defendant, was entered into by the parties on April 8, 1922, and carried out with reference to a Nash touring car.</p>
    <p id="b260-4" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[239,1439,1150,692]]]'>From the above facts the conclusion is inevitable that the real purpose of the transactions between the parties was to secure payment of the loans to defendant from plaintiff. Plaintiff at no time had physical possession of either of the cars in question and did nothing tending to indicate to the public that it had ownership or right to either machine. The records of the carrier merely show shipment of the cars to Blough, forwarding of the bills of lading with the sight drafts attached, through a bank, in accordance with usual business practice, payment of the drafts by defendant, Blough, and delivery to him of the bills of lading, followed by possession taken by him of the cars.</p>

The rent distrained for was subsequently paid, thus eliminating the landlord’s claim. In the. meantime, however, the trustees in bankruptcy of defendant intervened and claimed possession of the cars on the theory that the transactions between plaintiff and defendant were void as to creditors, because of failure to take actual possession of the property by plaintiff, or of any act done or notice given indicating a change of ownership in the machines.</p>

L. 543, a sale of personal property may be avoided by creditors where the seller “continues in possession of the goods, or of negotiable documents of title to the goods, and such retention or possession is fraudulent in fact or is deemed fraudulent under any rule of law.” If it be conceded a fraudulent intent was not contemplated by the parties to this transaction, the effect of their action was nevertheless fraudulent under the general rule of law that, in case of a sale or pledge of personal property, the purchaser or pledgee must take actual possession or do some act which gives notice to the public of the transfer of ownership and possession, otherwise the sale or pledge is void as against innocent purchasers for value or creditors of the seller or pledgor: Root v.
