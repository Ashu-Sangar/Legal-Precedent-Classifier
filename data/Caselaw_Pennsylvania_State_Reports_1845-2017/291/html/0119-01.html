The fire broke out at midnight and burned with terrific intensity throughout the night. It started in the waxing room where many tons of ordinary paper, large quantities of wax paper, and many thousand pounds Of paraffin were located. The heat was so intense that glass windows were melted in adjoining rooms. The particular machine about which this action centered is described as a paper machine located in the room next to the waxing room. It was a large machine, made up of thousands of parts, consisting of many rolls of different designs and sizes, and would require the labor of eight or ten men about two months to assemble on its foundation plates. It was a hundred feet long and nine feet wide and weighed about a hundred tons. The paper stock in fluid form was carried into and through the first section by a wire mesh. This section is comprised of a series of rolls referred to as breast rolls, couch rolls and a number of table or tube noils. From, <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>the first section the paper was carried on a belt through a series of press rolls, during which process some of the moisture was pressed out of it. From the last press roll the paper was passed to what is referred to as the “dry’’ part of the machine, making its way on canvas belts over eighteen “dryers,” a series of steam filled rolls, one above the other; and thence to the finishing apparatus, which consisted of two series of “calendar” rolls and from them to the reel and slitter which slit the different sizes for the market; and from there to the winders. It was driven by.gears with large wooden cogs, with the aid of pulleys. The machine had to be precisely level, the rolls in perfect alignment and absolutely round, and some of the parts true to the extent of from one to two one-thousandths of an inch. It made an exceptionally difficult and high grade of paper and had a daily average capacity of ten tons.</p>
    <p id="b145-3" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[217,1291,1160,413]]]'>The flames from the waxing room, through openings in the wall, swept directly across the paper machine. It was subjected to a continuous hot fire for three hours, so hot it melted babbit bearings. This could be done only when exposed to a temperature of about 600 degrees. An overhead sprinkling system and a fire hose' pushed through a hole in the roof plied water on it in constant flow for hours.</p>
    <p id="b145-4" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[217,1724,1152,423]]]'>The question before the jury was the value of the machine before and after it had been damaged by the fire. Plaintiff’s evidence, if believed by the jury, showed that it was, for all practical purposes, useless. This was contested by defendants. We do not propose to review the evidence as it is a matter of importance to the parties only. The questions raised were solely for the jury, under proper instructions from the court.</p>

We might dispose of all the assignments relating to questions of repairs, by the observation that the affidavit did not set up any offer to repair or rebuild the machine, or any offer to place it in as good a condition as it was before the fire, both as to service and durability; the pleadings were wholly silent on the subject of repairs.</p>

Had the insurance company wished to take advantage of its option to repair, it could have made a contract with Moore and White and subjected itself to the full responsibility of the policy, — to furnish a machine as good and as serviceable as the one that was in use. The appellants cannot seize upon offers made by others, appropriate them to their use as an exercise of their right, and then hold the appellees to the submitted estimate. The question would still remain, What was the amount of the damage, or the difference in value before and after the fire? Had appellants elected to repair and it had been accepted, there would háve been no estimate. Had the companies estimated the cost of repair and submitted the alternative proposition, either to pay the estimate or repair, this would not amount to an acceptance of the option within the policy.

The engineers of both companies stated the machine would not be as good after the repairs as it was before the fire.

These ad<a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>missions go far toward destroying the availability of the offers for any purpose. The court below, in charging the jury, gave full weight to every circumstance defendants could claim through the offers to repair in reduction of plaintiff’s claim. The learned trial judge said, “If you find that the machine could have been repaired for [the amounts contained in the offers to repair] ......so that it would have been substantially as good and serviceable as before the fire, then in that event the recovery for damage to the paper machine would be limited to said amounts.”</p>

The testimony shows the machine was as good as new before the fire, in first-class condition, and, for the manufacture of this class of paper, like a “brand new machine”; no evidence was offered by appellants to show value before the fire. The court instructed the jury to allow depreciation ; the witnesses, in stating value, took it into consideration. Their testimony fixed its worth at from .$125,000 to $97,000, so it is quite evident depreciation must have been allowed, as the verdict was for $86,000. <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>The government’s table is theoretical; it would, of course, be useful if better evidence was not obtainable. The latter was available and could have been secured. “The testimony of competent valuation engineers who examined the property and made estimates in respect of its condition is to be preferred to mere calculation based on averages and assumed probabilities”: McCardle v.

    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[246,894,1150,575]]]'>The sixth assignment complains of the use of the word “assurance” by the engineers in connection with the offer to repair. The two engineers who had estimated the probable cost of repair said they could give no assurance that, after the repairs were made, the machine would be as good as it was before. The word was brought out by the cross-examination: “Q. And after you had all that work done, would the machine be better than it was before the fire? A. I wouldn’t say that. Q. Would it be as good? A. No, sir.” The objection is without foundation.</p>
    <p id="b150-5" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[246,1489,1152,852]]]'>The “for sale” sign placed on the premises did not prevent the insurer from exercising its option to repair, if it wished to do so. The policy did not require the insured to stand by, watch its property wasted by the elements or further destroyed, waiting for the insurance company to determine what it is going to do, without attempting something to protect it or to realize on it. The insured has the right to proceed within a very reasonable time after the fire to put his property in shape, or dispose' of it. Of course, the company should be promptly notified and ample opportunity given it to inspect and determine what it will do. When the insured does this, he is not required to wait until the insurance company at its pleasure decides what course it will pursue. The insurance company here had ample time and the “for sale” sign did not interfere.</p>
