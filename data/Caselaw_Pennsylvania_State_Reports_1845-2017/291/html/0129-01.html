In such case testatrix intended by the use of the word “revert” and its context, to provide that, on the death of her children (the first takers), the respective shares enjoyed by them during life were to go to their children as remaindermen, and to accomplish such result, it was not necessary to say “I give and devise” such an interest to such devisees.</p>

The fact that testatrix used the word “revert” in another part of the will, in its ordinary sense of “going back” by directing that a legacy should “revert” on the death of a legatee to her direct heirs, cannot be used to govern the construction of the gift of the remainder of her estate to her children, inasmuch as the will shows that the word was used on each of these occasions to accomplish a different purpose.</p>

In this gift of $100 to each of her grandchildren, testatrix directs that the amounts in question are to be paid only when lots belonging to her estate are sold to raise the money required for that purpose, stating at this point that her four children are to be executors, and assuming, apparently, that they would sell the lots. All of this plainly shows that, when testatrix provided, “in case of the death of any of the above named grandchildren before receiving the sum of $100.00, the same [was to] revert to [her] direct heirs,” she meant in the event of the death of any of the grandchildren after her own death; for, of course, the lots in question could not be <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>sold as part of her estate (to^ pay the bequests to her grandchildren) until after her death. Testatrix having used the phrase “in case of the death of” to mean death after her own death, in connection with these bequests to her grandchildren, when we find precisely the same phrase used, a few lines later on, in connection with her children, each should be given a like meaning unless there is good reason to the contrary (Martin v. Grinage, <a href="/pa/289/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="289 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="1103298" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0473-01">289 Pa. 473</a>, 484, 485); and there is nothing to suggest that testatrix intended the phrase under discussion to have one meaning in connection with her grandchildren and quite another meaning in connection with her children. Moreover, and particularly, since testatrix provides in the general devise to her children, that they are “to have share and share alike as long as they live,” it is obvious this must mean as long as they live after the death of the giver of such shares, for the estate would not come into existence so that anyone could share therein prior to that event. “The rule of construction” relied on by appellants, “whereby a devise over, in the event of the death of the first taker, is generally understood to mean death occurring in the lifetime of the testator, applies only when the will itself shows no other period to which the words may, on a proper interpretation, be referred; and the rule is never applied where the first takers referred to are treated as living at a period subsequent to the death of testator”: Mebus’s Est., <a href="/pa/273/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="273 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1070827" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0505-01">273 Pa. 505</a>, 516. This rule has no place here, where, as we have shown, the grandchildren are named in the will as devisees with an interest which vested at the death of testatrix, and not as mere substitutionary devisees, to benefit only in the event of the death of their parents during the life of the testatrix.</p>

While the word “revert,” as here used, requires some consideration, — which we shall presently give it, — yet we are not impressed that testatrix employed it in an endeavor to install her children as a source of inheritable succession, or that she used “children” in other than its primary meaning as a word of purchase, as distinguished from one of limitation.</p>

The legal signification of “revert” is for property to go báck to and lodge in a former owner, who parted with it by creating an estate in another, which has expired (Words and Phrases, 2d ed. 6213; Anderson Law Dictionary, 899), or to return to and lodge in the heirs of such former owner; but it is plain that the word was not used with this strict technical meaning in the provision now under consideration, for testatrix could neither have intended the property with which she was dealing to return to herself, as devisor, nor to her children, as heirs, since she specifically provided that the reversion was to be to “their children,” — that is, her grandchildren. There are ample precedents (as will be shown in the course of this opinion) for using the word “revert” as one of devise, to create remainders to take effect after the expiration of particular estates, and this no doubt is what testatrix <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>wanted to accomplish in the present instance. She intended, by the use of “revert” and its context, to provide that, upon the death of her children (the first takers), the respective shares enjoyed by them during life were to go to their children as remaindermen, and to accomplish that result, it was not necessary to say, “I give and devise” such an interest to such devisees; any phraseology which, from its context and the will as a whole, shows an intention to make the gift is sufficient for the purpose: Packer’s Est.

Then the word “descend” conveys the thought of constantly going onward from one generation to another; “revert,” of going back, in <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>some manner or to some extent. Therefore, the latter would hardly be employed by anyone as an outright substitute for the former. Here, so far as can be judged from the light thrown by the will as a whole on the part now before us for construction, testatrix, when writing this particular provision, instead of conceiving, as the law does, of the simultaneous passing from the devisor to the life tenants and ultimate beneficiaries of both the life estates and remainders, apparently thought of her property as moving forward from her to her children, and, on their deaths, back, as it were, to her estate, so that it might serve as a conduit to carry the remainders on to her grandchildren; and, by the use of the word “revert,” she probably sought to express the last two ideas, — of the property going back, in the sense just stated, from the life tenants, then on to the remaindermen. But, whether this surmise as to the mental operations of testatrix be correct or not, in both instances where she employed the word “revert/’ warrant may be found for that course (as we have shown), and the last use of it, to create remainders, has considerable judicial support, as indicated by the decisions cited from other jurisdictions, supra.</p>

This prior use of the word “revert” with a somewhat different meaning from its subsequent use in the general devise to appellants, cannot be allowed to govern or influence our construction of the latter, because it is quite plain, as we have shown in this opinion, that the word was used on each occasion to accomplish a different purpose.</p>
