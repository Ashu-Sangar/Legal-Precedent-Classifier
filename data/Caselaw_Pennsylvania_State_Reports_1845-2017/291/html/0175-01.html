The will, and an agreement signed by testator, his widow and Mr. Leahey (hereinafter set forth at some length), were together probated by the register of wills as decedent’s disposition of his property; but the decree of the orphans’ court sustaining this action was reversed by us, and the probate of the agreement was vacated and set aside: O’Connor’s Est., <a href="/pa/273/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="273 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1070836" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0391-01">273 Pa. 391</a>.

He averred therein that he had not made Mr. Little a party, because the latter, though named in the agreement as trustee, had declared he would not accept the trust. Mr. Little denied this, however, and, having been given leave to intervene, filed a cross-bill, renewing and amplifying the averments of the original bill, and stating that testator made his will “in consideration of the execution by his said wife of the agreement [above referred to] and in reliance upon her good faith and willingness......to fully perform and carry out the same......[and that she] by her voluntary execution and delivery of said agreement......induced [testator] to make and publish his will devising the residue of his estate” to her. He also averred that there were prior wills and agreements, which he quoted, of substantially the same character, and executed under substantially similar circumstances. The widow answered the bill and cross-bill; testimony was taken, the court below found the facts, stated its conclusions of law and decreed the dismissal of both bills at the costs of the respective plaintiffs. On appeal to this court, we specifically approved those findings and conclusions, and affirmed the decree: Leahey v.

They did not ask a decree regarding the personalty, which they averred was under the sole jurisdiction of the orphans’ court, but did as to all the realty, which they alleged was not. The widow and Leahey answered; Little did not. The widow’s answer was substantially the same as in the prior proceedings, with the addition that she recited the findings and decree therein, and averred that they were conclusive here, under the doctrine of res adjudicata. The court below overruled this, and all the other contentions made by her, and decreed that she held the real estate, derived by her under testator’s will, one-half for herself, and the other half in trust for plaintiffs, as collateral heirs of testator, and directed her to convey to them the one-half to which they were thus found to be entitled.

In an attempt to escape the binding effect of the prior adjudication, the court below avoided the necessary inference flowing from that admission, by decreeing a direct conveyance by the widow to the collateral heirs; but in so doing, it fell into a still more grievous error, for it undertook thereby to ignore a vital part of the agreement itself, and to give the half interest to the collateral heirs at the present time, though testator plainly expressed his intention that this should not be done until after the death of the widow, and then that those “deemed unfit and unworthy......shall receive nothing.” Assuming the agreement to be effective for any purpose, this provision is alike binding upon the court, as upon everybody else. If it had violated some statute or policy of the law, it might have been thus ignored; but, as this was not the case, no one has the right to say that, because testator wished the widow to have but part of his estate, the balance may be given forthwith, in whole or in part, to those who are not now, and may never be entitled to it.</p>

The trial judge there held, inter alia, the court in banc approved, and we affirmed the following: “Upon the whole case the conclusion is inevitable that the wife’s signature to the agreement of April 8, 1920, was obtained by her husband’s gross betrayal of a generous and long cultivated confidence, with the result that the agreément is fraudulent and cannot be enforced against her......Evidently anticipating such a conclusion, the plaintiff, in the cross-bill contends......that if the defendant is not bound by the agreement, she nevertheless is not entitled to hold the estate given her by the will, but must reject the will with the agreement, and turn over to the trustees all of the estate, except such as she may claim by the intestate laws......It is the theory of the cross plaintiff that the will and the agreement, both dated April 8, 1920, together formed a contract, in which the will, devising the residuary estate to the defendant, was the consideration for her promise, contained in the agreement, to convey the greater part of the estate to the trustees for the benefit of testator’s collateral relatives. But there was no contract. The defendant’s signature, for the accommodation of her husband, of a paper the contents of which were unknown to her, and were intentionally concealed from her by the testator, resulted in no contract. The will was in no sense a consideration for her signature, for she knew nothing of its provisions, or that it was in any way connected with the paper she was asked to sign. She did not ask the testator to make a will of any sort, or induce him to do so by signing the agreement. She did not deceive or mislead him by her signature, for he knew that she did not, and intended that she should not, know what she was signing. Furthermore, the testator seems to have believed, as his attorney certainly believed, that the defendant would not be bound by the agreement. He intended that the agreement should not be recorded, but should be kept secret, as it could not <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>have been, if it was to be used to compel the performance of the alleged contract. He relied, for the defendant’s performance of the provisions of the agreement, not upon any supposed legal obligation created by it, but on her expected voluntary submission to his wishes, when she should ascertain them after his death. She is not now rescinding any contract, but is defending her rights under her husband’s duly probated will, resisting the plaintiff’s efforts to deprive her of them by means of an alleged contract to which she never gave assent, and by which she cannot be bound. She is acting upon her husband’s assurance, voluntarily pledged after he had seen her sign the treacherous agreement, that he had given her his entire estate......Now, the plaintiffs ask a court of equity to destroy the testator’s will, give the lie to his voluntary assurance to his wife, and make his attempted fraud effective, partially, at least, if not absolutely. There can be no hesitation over the answer to such á request. If the, devise to the defendant had been induced by any act of hers, by disavowing such act she would be held to waive the benefit obtained by it. But the making of the will, although mentioned in the agreement as the consideration therefor, was not so in fact, because the defendant did not know what either the will or the agreement contained, or that they were in any way related to each other.” As a result of these findings the trial judge in that case concluded, the court in banc approved and we affirmed, that <em>“ </em>(1) The defendant is not bound by the agreement of April 8, 1920, and cannot be compelled to carry out its provisions. (2) The will of [testator] vests in the defendant, Margaret B. O’Connor, the entire residuary estate......unencumbered by any trust, and unaffected by any agreement. (3) The plaintiffs have no standing in a court of equity to, set up the agreement of April 8,1920, to which the defendant’s signature was obtained by concealment and fraud, to defeat her title under the testator’s voluntary will.”</p>

The court below thought that the questions here in issue were not adjudicated in the prior case, because we there refused to pass upon the right to partition as prayed for in Mr. Little’s cross-bill. An attentive consideration of our opinion (Leahey v.

As there was no contract, it follows that Little was not a trustee thereunder, and, hence, had no standing, to raise the issues which he sought to have adjudicated; consequently, the court below might have dismissed the cross-bill without deciding more than was necessary under the averments of the original bill and answer, — that is to say, the issues as to alleged fraud; and, when they were found in favor of defendant, the chancellor need only have determined their legal result, namely, that plaintiffs had no right to the relief sought, — or, in other words, no right to enforce the alleged contract against defendant.” What the court below relied on in the present case, were the additional reasons why the cross-bill in that case could not be sustained; it erred in supposing that those reasons invalidated the basic findings which dominated our opinion.</p>

The will gives both to the widow, and the agreement signed by her, if valid, binds both kinds of property in her hands, as effectually as it does either one. It has been conclusively determined that it is of no validity whatsoever.
