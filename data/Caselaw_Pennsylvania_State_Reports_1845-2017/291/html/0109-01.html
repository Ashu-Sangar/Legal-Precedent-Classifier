L. 20, as supplemented by the Acts of June 21, 1919, P. L. 570; May 11, 1921, P. L. 503, and May 1, 1923, P. L. 122) refused to renew the permit and ordered the sign removed. An appeal was taken to the court below, which, in an elaborate adjudication, containing numerous findings of fact and conclusions of law, sustained the order under attack. This appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[257,620,1153,905]]]'>It was further found that the land upon which the sign was erected is in a “B — residence district,” and that it was “thus zoned at the time of the application for and the granting of the permit referred to and [also] when the application for a renewal was made, the refusal of which is here appealed from”; that all parties concerned were aware of these last-mentioned facts when the lease for the land was taken and the sign placed thereon, but the owner and the lessee thought, when they erected the sign, that the territory in question would be changed later on to a “commercial district,” wherein “such signs would be permissible,” though the municipal zoning authorities disagreed with them as to this. Liggett never raised any question as to the proper zoning of the neighborhood in which his property was located until after the refusal to allow the sign to stand.</p>

We agree with the court below that the erection and maintenance of the sign in controversy is part of “the industry or trade of public advertising” in which the Alpha Sign Company is engaged. In that connection the court below well says, “Clearly the erection of such a billboard and its elaborate equipment with electric current, appliances for the application of such current, and daily service of an employee to successfully operate the equipment......is a business of great importance, requiring capital and skill as well as the maintenance of an extensive plant, from which the sign company makes a profit, and it is therefore clearly a trade or industry within the meaning of the act and may be regulated under its terms.” Webster’s International Dictionary defines “industry” as “Any department or branch of......business; especially one which employs much labor and capital and is a distinct branch of trade.” This definition is consistent with that given in other modern dictionaries.

Since that time, however, zoning of cities has become rather universal, and, as shown in our recent opinions (see Ward’s App., <a href="/pa/289/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="289 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1103345" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0458-01">289 Pa. 458</a>; White’s App., <a href="/pa/287/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="287 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1099652" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0259-01">287 Pa. 259</a>), where authorized by act of assembly and reasonable in their application, zoning ordinances are very generally sustained as a proper exercise of the police power. The particular ordinance under consideration does not exclude signs generally from all parts of the City of Pittsburgh; but, while allowing certain kinds of signs, it excludes those of the type of the one here in controversy from districts classified as residential. The United States Supreme Court has held in two cases that a city, exercising the police power, may prohibit the erection of billboards in residence districts: see Cusack Co. v. Chicago, <a href="/citations/?q=243%20U.S.%20526" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="243 U.S. 526">243 U. S. 526</a>; and St. Louis, etc., Co. v.

In the latter case Mr. Justice Holmes states (p. 274) : “Of course the several restrictions [contained in the ordinance before the court] are said to be unreasonable and unconstitutional limitations on the freedom of the individual and the rights of property and land, but the argument comes too late;......billboards...... may be......prohibited in residence districts of a city”: see also State v.

In disposing of this contention the court below well says: “The same argument was advanced in Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., <a href="/us/272/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="272 U.S. 365" data-case-ids="1501273" data-case-paths="/us/272/0365-01">272 U.

Nevertheless, the ordinance was sustained......In Building Inspector v. Stoklosa, 145 N. E. (Mass.) 262, Chief Justice Rugg, at page 264, says: ‘Every such [zoning] division may injure somebody, but if it [the ordinance] be made in the public interest and be reasonable in its general features ......it will not be stricken down merely because a particular individual may think himself aggrieved, or may, in truth, be injured.’ Where an official body in its administrative capacity has acted upon a matter properly before it, the courts will not reverse except where there is a manifest and flagrant abuse of discretion. ......Penn Mut. Life I. Co. v. Cuyler, <a href="/pa/283/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="283 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="1090533" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0422-01">283 Pa. 422</a>, 429.” This principle controls in a case like the present: Ward’s App., <a href="/pa/289/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="289 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1103345" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0458-01">289 Pa. 458</a>, 462 (bottom of page), and Zahn v.

The record of the proceeding before the board shows affirmatively that, in reaching the decision complained of on this appeal, that body based its deter-<a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>initiation entirely upon the fact that the sign in question was of a character not allowed in “a residence district under the provisions of the zoning ordinance”; and, as the court below well states, “It is clear that it was beyond the power of the board to change the zoning effected by the ordinance, by transforming such residence district into a commercial one, to aid appellants to use their property more advantageously......The duty of the board was to enforce the law as it stood, subject to the right to' modify the severity of its provisions,” as authorized by certain sections of the'act of assembly. The mere fact that the board, in enforcing the ordinance, possibly may have been actuated by considerations of the unsightliness of billboards in this district, or may have heeded the opinion of other corporate authorities in that regard, can not influence an appellate tribunal to overthrow the judgment of that official body, based upon the prohibition found in the ordinance itself. When an ordinance such as the one now before us is attacked, it must be presumed that the city council enacted it with a purpose to subserve the public welfare, and hence all intendments are in its favor: Dobbins v. Los Angeles, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20U.S.%20228" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="195 U.S. 228">195 U. S. 228</a>. With the court below, “we recognize the principle which forbids zoning legislation that rests entirely upon esthetic considerations” (White’s App., <a href="/pa/287/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="287 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1099652" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0259-01">287 Pa. 259</a>, 266) ; but, as said in St. Louis Poster Adv.

Under these and other findings of fact upon this record, the contentions thus far discussed cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b141-5" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[208,779,1150,801]]]'>Several assignments complain because the court below admitted evidence which appellants think should have been excluded. Not one of these assignments shows reversible error, and it would serve no useful purpose to discuss them separately; but, we may add that, on hearings without a jury, such as held by the court below in this case, considerable liberality is allowed in ruling on questions of evidence, and, ordinarily, complaints as to such rulings cannot prevail on appeal unless it appears that the admission of objectionable evidence led to and is the .sole support of material findings; which make against appellant, or that the excluded evidence, which ought to have been admitted, would have sustained other findings materially in appellant’s favor. No such state of facts is shown upon the present record.</p>
