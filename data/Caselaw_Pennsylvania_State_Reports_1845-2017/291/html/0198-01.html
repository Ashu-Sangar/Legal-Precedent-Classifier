Many of our cases so hold, but it is only necessary to refer to Potter’s Est., <a href="/pa/257/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="257 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="1032426" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0468-01">257 Pa. 468</a>, 472, because of its similarity to the present one. By testatrix’s will there, she gave the residue of her estate to her nephew for life, with remainder to his children, if any, and in default thereof the “estate is to go to and be divided amongst my next-of-kin in accordance with the intestate laws of the State of Pennsylvania, in the same manner as though I had not made any will,” but excluding a brother who was named. By a codicil she revoked the life estate to the nephew and the remainder to his children. When she died the nephew’s son was one of her next-of-kin. We said: “At the time of such republication, Mrs. Potter undoubtedly knew that appellant was one of her next-of-kin, and had she desired to exclude him could have so stated, or had she then intended to give all of her residuary estate to the two nieces that could have been stated in the codicil. But the mere fact that testatrix revoked the clause making appellant sole legatee, without more, does not preclude him from sharing in the gift to the next-of-kin of which he is one. Construing the will and codicil by the language used, we find nothing to prevent appellant from so sharing.- He is excluded neither by express language nor by necessary implication; in fact, as the express exclusion includes the brother only, the implication would be the other way; as it also would because of the fact that the residuary estate is given to the next-of-kin as a class and not to any particular individuals. Because <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>Mrs. Potter did not desire appellant to have the entire residuary estate does not change his status as next-of-kin or deprive him of the right to share with the others as such: See Hitchcock v. Hitchcock, <a href="/pa/35/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="35 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="990440" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0393-01">35 Pa. 393</a>; Wain’s Est., Vaux’s App., <a href="/pa/156/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="156 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="844935" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0194-01">156 Pa. 194</a>; Gorgas’s Est., Robinson’s App., <a href="/pa/166/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="166 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="864253" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0269-01">166 Pa. 269</a>; Fuller’s Est., <a href="/pa/225/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="225 Pa. 626" data-case-ids="965344" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0626-01">225 Pa. 626</a>.” This reasoning is sound, and the case is controlling. It follows that the court below erred when it excluded appellant from sharing in the distribution.</p>
    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.4",225,[168,857,1150,1295]]]'>There was no error, however, in holding that the children of Mrs. Rachel J. Hill should share in it. Appellant’s contention upon this point, is that since these children were not <em>named </em>in the will, but only in the codicil dated April 21, 1913, they are not within the language of the gift in remainder to “all my other ben<em>eficiaries......named </em>in my will.” This argument is plausible, but not sound. It proceeds upon the theory that to be “named,” the proper names of the distributees must be specified. This is not so, as the word “named” is a “word of various meanings”: Carpenter v. Carpenter, <a href="/ri/12/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="12 R.I. 544" data-case-ids="11269733" data-case-paths="/ri/12/0544-01">12 R. I. 544</a>, 548. It may mean “designated by title,” or simply “designated”: “and of them He chose twelve, whom also He <em>named </em>apostles” (Luke 6, 13); “but ye shall be <em>named </em>the priests of the Lord” (Isaiah 61, 6); <em>“none......named </em>thee but to praise,” etc. These instances might be multiplied; they suffice, however, to show that this particular word has not the exclusive meaning contended for. Its particular meaning may be otherwise, and we are convinced from a careful reading of the will and all the codicils, including those herein quoted, that testator meant by the words “all my other beneficiaries......named in my will,” all the beneficiaries <em>designated </em>in his will.</p>
    <p id="b225-11" data-blocks='[["BL_225.5",225,[169,2163,1151,261]],["BL_226.1",226,[259,358,1150,361]]]'>Moreover, if the contention that the children of Mrs. Hill cannot take because not “named” in the will, is sound, then, since Mrs. Hill was there “named,” she would be entitled to take. The codicil does not exclude those who may have died after the will was made. If <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>the earlier codicil of 1913 is to be read into the -will as of the date of its making, as the court below says it should be, then section 15 (b), of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, 408, possibly might be held to apply (testator having died without leaving lineal descendants), and the gift to Mrs. Hill inure to the benefit of her children.</p>
    <p id="b226-5" data-blocks='[["BL_226.4",226,[250,740,1155,1506]]]'>Whether or not this be so, however, .the same conclusion is reached from another standpoint. By the will, as already pointed out, testator directs “these bequests of my estate to extend to their heirs — executors and administrators of all my legatees and devisees.” By this testator evidently meant, — especially when the above-quoted preamble to the codicil of 1913 is considered,— that if any of the legatees or devisees died before testator, his or her share of the estate, depending on whether it is realty or personalty, shall go to his or her heirs, executors or administrators. That testator so viewed the matter is further evident from his final codicil of November 25, 1917, where he says “I now hereby <em>revoke only that portion of my will </em>dated Jany. 18th, 1906, <em>devising to Mary Martha Hill </em>[one of Rachel J. Hill’s children] my niece <em>her share in my estate </em>devised more specifically by codicil to my will dated April 21st, 1913, and I now hereby devise and bequeath only the income of her share in my estate during her natural life. At her death her share shall pass to all the <em>other </em>beneficiaries <em>named </em>in my will.” As already stated, Mary Martha Hill is not named in the will, unless it is by virtue of the clause extending the bequests to heirs, etc., yet testator, by this last codicil, twice speaks of her as one of the beneficiaries under the will, and hence brings her, — and with her, of course, all the other children of Mrs. Hill, they being in the same situation, — within the terms of the codicil providing for the present trust.</p>

Appellees say that Mary Martha Hill cannot participate in this dis'<a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>tribution, because she was excluded by tbe codicil of November 25,1917, above quoted. Logically, they could assume no other position, in view of their contention that the codicil of December 28,1915, excluded William C. Packer. Possibly because his share will be greater if she is excluded, than if she is not, appellant simply says he agrees with appellees. We are not influenced by either of these considerations. The codicil of 1917 is dealing only with the absolute share to which Mary Martha Hill was entitled under the will and the codicil of 1913. It does not purport to deal with that now being <em>distributed; </em>on the contrary it refers to the change being made as relating only to the share of Mary Martha Hill under the will and codicil of 1913. Because of this, and for the reasons already given, we conclude that Mary Martha Hill, who was one of testator’s next-of-kin, may be a distributee in remainder in this trust estate ; but, as that matter is not squarely before us, and because also all the relevant facts may not have been brought to our attention, we can only give leave to the court below to reopen the adjudication and decree, for the purpose of determining whether or not she is entitled to share in the distribution.</p>
    <p id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[159,1599,1151,205]]]'>The decree of the court below is reversed, without costs to either party, and the record is remitted with a direction that distribution be made in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>
