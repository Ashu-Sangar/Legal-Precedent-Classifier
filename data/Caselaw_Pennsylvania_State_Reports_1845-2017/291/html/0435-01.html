The affidavit of defense admits the note. The <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>defense held sufficient by the court below rests upon an alleged written contract between plaintiffs and defendant, whereby real estate belonging to defendant was conveyed to a trustee to be deeded to plaintiffs if defendant defaulted in payment of his note. As to this the court below states: “We refused judgment......because the agreement shown by the affidavit of defense provided that plaintiffs were obliged to accept certain houses in cancellation and discharge of the indebtedness represented by the [note in suit]. It is averred that the houses were conveyed to the trustee named in the agreement. It is true, the houses were to be regarded as security for the debt, but plaintiffs had no option to accept or refuse to take them in cancellation of the debt if the note was not paid. The trustee was to convey on default and presumably it was the duty of plaintiffs to make demand on the trustee for the title. Defendant avers a deed was tendered, but [however that may be] no default can be attributed to him in this regard, because no duty rested on him to make a tender. When the note was dishonored, the transactions as to the title were necessarily between plaintiffs and the trustee.”</p>
