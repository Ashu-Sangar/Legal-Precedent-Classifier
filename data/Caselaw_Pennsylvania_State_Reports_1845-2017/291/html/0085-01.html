Therefore, plaintiff argues, the contracts sued on were oral contracts; though, as just said, the statement of claim fails to aver either that plaintiff’s so-called acceptances of the terms of defendant’s letters “A (1)” and “B (1)’’ were in fact made by spoken words, or, if so, what words were employed.</p>

      <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>When the correspondence now before us is examined, it shows no offers and acceptances of a character sufficient to make a contract. Exhibit “A (1)” refers in a somewhat general way to certain matters, apparently brought in as terms of a contemplated contract, which are in no manner mentioned in exhibit “A”; so the former is not an acceptance of the latter in such sense that together they would make an agreement between the correspondents. The same is equally true of the second set of letters, “B” and “B (1)”; the latter refers to two epistles received by defendant, namely, “B” and a letter of a different date, not in the record, and the exact contents of which are undisclosed. In other words, neither set of correspondence shows the two essential elements of a contract, a plain offer and unqualified acceptance. “A contract must arise from the acceptance of the last stated terms, and the acceptance [thereof] must be identical, in order to bring the minds of the parties together” : Frick &amp; Lindsay Co. v. Johnstown &amp; S. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/271/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="271 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="295723" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0536-01">271 Pa. 536</a>, 537. It is evident from this correspondence that the parties were negotiating to buy and sell, and that each set of letters refers only to proposed understandings which were to be concluded in the future; whereas, if a right of recovery is to be shown, the terms of a concluded agreement must appear. That these letters in and of themselves do not form contracts is practically admitted by the statement of claim, when, after a recital of the respective sets of exhibits, it adds: “After the exchange of said proposal and acceptance, plaintiff and defendant met,......and the conditions proposed by defendant in its acceptance were accepted by plaintiff.”</p>

We can not so view the situation, however, for, as is said in the brief of counsel for defendant, the “ingenious attempt of plaintiff” to derive contracts out of the correspondence in this case by treating defendant’s letters as final acceptances on definitely stated terms of offers by plaintiff, and then, by spoken words, accepting these acceptances, utterly fails if defendant’s two letters were not in fact acceptances; and, as shown above, the last-mentioned epistles cannot be termed as acceptances, conditional or otherwise, of offers contained in the letters from plaintiff shown on this record. They are merely part of negotiations between the parties, and no amount of oral accepting by plaintiff could convert them into documents in the nature of acceptances of distinct proposals' previously received by defendant, plus definite counter-contractual offers on its part; though this is how they must be viewed in order to sustain appellant’s position.</p>

Here, however, examination of the correspondence shows that neither exhibits “A” (letter of plaintiff) and “A (1)” (reply of defendant), nor those marked “B” (letter of plaintiff) and “B (1)” (reply of defendant), contain internal references on which a court could safely determine that the two papers which figure in either instance in effect constitute one document, show a common understanding, or even contain all the terms under negotiation between the correspondents. What we have just said is more than indicated in a preceding paragraph of the present opinion, and, at this point, it would serve no useful purpose to take time in further demonstration, — though, if necessary, such demonstration could readily be made; it is enough that we find that in neither instance are the letters of plaintiff and defendant so connected by internal references that the former can be read into the latter and thus <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>show a completed whole or indicate such a mutual understanding between the parties that, by simple acceptance of defendant’s letter, the correspondence could be reduced to evidence of the terms of a complete agreement which would satisfy the requirements of the Act of 1915, supra.</p>

Where, as here, the written memoranda depended upon were, beyond question, made in the course of negotiating the contract alleged, not after the event and as a record thereof, it is absolutely necessary that the essential terms of the agreement, as actually consummated between the parties, shall appear without the necessity of oral explanation, and if more than one paper is depended upon for that purpose, the internal references to connect them must be clear to the same extent, no oral evidence being allowed except, as just stated, for purposes of mere identification. Of course, when, as in this case, the law requires a written memorandum of a contract, testimony “cannot be used to supply proof of the terms of the contract itself” (Manufacturers’ L. &amp; H. Co. v. Lamp, <a href="/pa/269/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="269 Pa. 517" data-case-ids="1063503" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0517-01">269 Pa. 517</a>, 520; and see also Northwestern C.

Plaintiff, however, overlooks the words of the section which, to make the provision in question applicable, require not only a legal acceptance of part of the goods, but also that the buyer shall “actually receive same”; and actual receipt of the goods is not even claimed to be a fact in this case.
