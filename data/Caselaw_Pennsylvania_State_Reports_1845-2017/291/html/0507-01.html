The contract provides that lessee promises to “deliver up the premises in good order and repair...... reasonable wear and tear and damage by accidental fire excepted”; again, that, in the event of destruction or damage by fire, the tenant, at the behest of the landlord or the contractor in charge of restoration, is to move his goods and chattels in the demised premises from place to place as required; and further, that the lessee agrees “to make any and all repairs, both interior and exterior to the demised premises......which may become neces<a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>sary during the term of this lease or any renewal thereof.” One of these provisions suggests, that, in case of destruction by fire during the term of the lease, the landlord is to do the rebuilding, another, that the tenant is to rebuild; but taking the lease as a whole, none of them amounts to a covenant binding either lessor or lessee to restore the building. The covenants by the lessee to repair or keep in repair, standing alone, might impose such an obligation on him (36 Corpus Juris 145, section 782; McKinley v. Jutte &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/230/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="230 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="8845574" data-case-paths="/pa/230/0122-01">230 Pa. 122</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.%20244" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="79 A. 244">79 Atl. 244</a>; Hoy v.

The fact that the lessee is thus relieved from an obligation to rebuild does not, however, cast that liability on the lessor; so far as the latter is concerned, in the words of counsel for appellants (the tenant and subtenant), “the general rule is that such a covenant [obliging the landlord to rebuild] is not to be implied” (see Moore v. Weber, <a href="/pa/71/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="71 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1031220" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0429-01">71 Pa. 429</a>, 432), and the provision in the lease that “should the......premises at any time during the term be totally destroyed by fire it is understood and agreed that no rent shall be claimed or collected by......lessor from......lessee until premises shall have been completely rebuilt and placed in tenant-able condition,” imposes no obligation to restore on the lessor: Woodside v.

E. 492</a>; 36 Corpus Juris 145, section 782. This provision, as is agreed in the briefs of counsel on both sides, simply relieves the lessee from his obligation to pay rent until a new building is erected. Again, the provision that the lessee must change his goods and chattels on demised premises from place to place as directed by the lessor, or the contractor in charge of restoration, is only to facilitate the rebuilding of the property if the lessor should <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>wish to do so, and it does not bind the latter to make use of the opportunity thus given to rebuild; much less can it be construed as the express covenant to rebuild which the law requires in order to fix a landlord with that duty.</p>

The lessor has taken the initiative to relieve this unfortunate situation by making the two offers previously mentioned: (1) To erect a nonfireproof building, two stories in height, which, under the Act of 1923, can be used in all its parts as an automobile service station; (2) to erect a three-story nonfireproof building of the same size and construction as the building destroyed. Defendants, as previously stated, refused both of these offers, the first on the ground that, although they could use the two-story building as suggested by plaintiff, they would not be willing to pay for it the rent stipulated in the lease, and the second on the ground that the Act of May 10, 1923, prevents them from using a three-story nonfireproof building for one of the purposes mentioned in the lease, —namely, as a “service station” in connection with their automobile business.</p>

Bed Co. v. Alpha Sign Co., <a href="/pa/289/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="289 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1103324" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0175-01">289 Pa. 175</a>, 180. Nor does the fact that the tenant was specifically restricted in the use of the demised premises to “Offices, Showrooms and service station” purposes raise any such implication; a provision of this kind is not a grant for specified uses. 36 Corpus Juris 89, note 69 (b), well states that stipulations in leases prohibiting certain uses of demised premises are not the same as covenants granting the premises for specific uses; “the former are conditions for the benefit of the lessor, while the latter are agreements for the benefit of the lessee,” citing Shepard v. Sullivan, <a href="/wash/94/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="94 Wash. 134" data-case-ids="627847" data-case-paths="/wash/94/0134-01">94 Wash. 134</a>, 135, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20P.%2034" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="162 P. 34">162 Pac. 34</a>. Here, under this correct, test, the provision in question is merely a condition for the benefit of lessor, and it cannot be construed otherwise. Thus we see that the lease contains no covenant that the demised premises are fit for or will be kept fit for the several uses mentioned in the contract, much less that the property will be so maintained in all its parts.</p>

But a service station is only one of the several uses to which the lessee is restricted. As just mentioned, the lease provides that the tenant shall not use the premises for any purpose other than “Offices, Showrooms, service station in connection with lessee’s automobile business.” Whatever may have been the development of the business conducted on the demised premises, there is no reason for assuming that, when the contract was made, the service station was contemplated as the principal use of those enumerated; indeed the.position and emphasis given to the “Offices” and “Showrooms,” by placing these words first and beginning them with capitals, would rather indicate that “service station” was a subordinate use. The real intention of the provision under consideration was no doubt to restrict the tenant, in his occupancy of the building, to the automobile business, and certainly showrooms and offices form a material part of that business. The Act of 1923, then, would not deprive the tenant of opportunity to make a beneficial use in the automobile business of the three-story building offered by plaintiff, though it would undoubtedly limit such use; but, it is now established in law, that this latter fact is not enough to exonerate a lessee from a contractual obligation to pay rent.</p>

We conclude that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Act of 1923, the offer by the lessor to erect a three-story nonfireproof building was an offer to place the leased premises in such a “tenantable condition” as would, if the building were actually erected, require the tenant to pay rent; and that this controversy in no proper sense falls within the class of cases cited by the court below where a covenant has been rendered so impossible of performance, by reason of the enactment of new law, as to nullify the contract of which the covenant in question formed a material part.

We have not made much point of this alternative offer because, had the building which it proposed been actually erected and then tendered to defendants, it would not have been sufficiently similar to the one destroyed by fire to have required them to recommence payment of rent under the lease; but the offer was no doubt made in a spirit of compromise, to end an unfortunate situation, and its acceptance might have presented a fair method of allow<a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>ing the lessee, or his subtenant, to proceed with the automobile business in all parts of the proposed structure, and of enabling the lessor to receive its rent.

Had this plan been accepted and carried out, both parties would have made somewhat of a sacrifice,— the owners by having erected on their land -an improvement which, at the end of defendants’ lease, would probably produce less revenue than the larger building which the premises were capable of accommodating, and the tenant in having less floor space than it had enjoyed in the original building. While what we have just said about the erection of a two-story building goes to the equities of the situation, the offer by plaintiffs to construct a building of the size and dimensions of the one destroyed and the definite and unconditional refusal of that offer by defendants, are the controlling factors on which the controversy between the parties must be ruled.</p>
    <p id="b545-3" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[137,1492,1155,916]],["BL_546.1",546,[258,358,1150,1399]]]'>One other matter may be noticed before stating the ultimate point on which the controversy turns: While neither the landlord nor the tenant is obliged to erect a new structure, yet, the building» on the demised premises having been “totally destroyed by fire,” no rent can be claimed by the lessor, under the terms of the lease, “until said premises shall have been completely rebuilt [by some one] and placed in a tenantable condition.” In addition to its other contentions, plaintiff argues that to this situation the rule announced in cases such as Buschman v. Wilson, <a href="/md/29/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="29 Md. 553" data-case-ids="1766730" data-case-paths="/md/29/0554-01">29 Md. 553</a>, ought to be applied, that, “Where it is stipulated in a lease that the rent shall cease if the demised premises are [destroyed], the happening of the contingency determines the lease, and the lessee shall thereupon surrender the premises”: see also Snook, etc., Furniture Co. v. Steiner, <a href="/ga/117/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="117 Ga. 363" data-case-ids="606855" data-case-paths="/ga/117/0363-01">117 Ga. 363</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20S.E.%20775" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="43 S.E. 775">43 S. E. 775</a>, 778. It is unnecessary, to apply that <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>rule in this case, for plaintiff has offered to do all that the lease requires in order to reinstate defendants’ obligation to pay rent; which offer defendants have flatly refused. Their refusal is equivalent to an abandonment. “An abandonment by the tenant of demised premises is such a relinquishment as amounts to an implied surrender, and justifies an immediate resumption of the possession by the landlord”: McKinney v. Reader, <a href="/watts/7/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="7 Watts 123" data-case-ids="1846770" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0123-01">7 Watts 123</a>. Finally, since all the essential facts in this connection have been averred in the petition and admitted in the answers, the question of abandonment is one of law which can be determined by the courts; the present case really turns on this point. To reiterate, we have it averred on one side and admitted on the other that the lessor has offered to erect on the demised premises “a three-story nonfireproof building of substantially the same size and construction as the one which was destroyed, and [that it has] been notified by defendants that they will not accept such a building.” This refusal is in legal effect such an abandonment of the lease by defendants as to put an end thereto, if lessor chooses so to treat it (see 35 Corpus Juris 1194, section 502); and the fact that, by not appealing, plaintiff has accepted the declaration of the court below that the lease has terminated, is conclusive proof of its choice in this regard.</p>

The lessor, having averred a willingness to erect the kind of a building which it conceives to be sufficient to entitle it to receive rent from the lessee, and the tender of such a building to defendants, — these facts and the good faith of the tender not being denied, — can have it judicially declared whether, under the governing rules of law, the structure tendered meets the requirements of the situation, and, if <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>erected, would oblige the lessee, or the subtenant, to recommence payment of the rent named in the contract of lease. Lessor can also have a further declaration as to its rights consequent upon a refusal by defendants to accept the kind of a building tendered; and this latter declaration must be, as found by the court below, that the lease is at an end and plaintiff can repossess itself of the demised premises.</p>
    <p id="b547-3" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[141,790,1158,1626]],["BL_548.1",548,[265,362,1151,532]]]'>A prime purpose of the Declaratory Judgments Act is to render “practical help” in ending controversies such as the one now before us: Kariher’s Petition (No. 1), <a href="/pa/284/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="284 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1092095" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0455-01">284 Pa. 455</a>, 471. Had defendants, instead of refusing the offers of plaintiff, simply taken the position that, according to their understanding of the law applicable to the admitted facts, the building tendered would not give them what they were entitled to under the lease, and, on that state of affairs, asked for a declaratory judgment, or joined with plaintiff in asking for such a judgment, their respective rights might have been judicially declared. Then, after such a determination of the governing principles of law as we have here made, plaintiff could either have erected the proposed three-story building, and insisted on payment of rent for the balance of the term named in the contract of lease, or, in place of actually building, plaintiff could have given defendants notice that its offer to build was still open; if, under these circumstances, defendants had persisted in their refusal, plaintiff could have accepted such refusal as an abandonment of the lease. In other words, had the parties seen fit, they could have had the help of a judicial declaration of their respective rights and liabilities before taking a definite stand amounting to an ultimatum on each side and asking for a declaratory judgment on that state of fact. As the case comes before us, we have the lease, the destruction of the building by fire, plaintiff’s offer to erect a new one, and defendants’ refusal, submitted to the court below for judgment thereon, that tribunal’s declaration of law <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>that the lease was at an end, plaintiff’s acquiescence in this conclusion, by not appealing, and defendants’ appeal ; this is the case as the parties made it, and we must adjudge it accordingly. While not agreeing with the court below that, upon the destruction of the old building, the Act of 1923 had the effect of immediately “rescinding” the lease “by operation of law,” we concur in its ultimate conclusion that the lease is extinguished; and since that is the dominating declaration in the case, the judgment appealed from will not be disturbed.</p>
