The agreement contained the following clause: “Settlement to be made on or before November 1, 1925, and said time is hereby agreed to be the essence of this agreement. Should the buyer fail to make settlement as herein provided, the sum or sums paid on account are to be retained by the seller, either on account of the purchase money, or as compensation for the damages and expenses he has been put to in this behalf, as the seller shall elect, and in the latter case this contract shall become null and void and all copies to be returned to seller for cancellation.”</p>

The broker made repeated unsuccessful attempts to deliver the checks to defendant’s agent. On August 1st, he informed the agent of having received the checks and was told to stop in and give them to him, the agent, when he had an opportunity to do so. Subsequently, during the month of August, the broker called at the agent’s office a number of times for the purpose of delivering the checks, each time failing to find him in, until September 6th, twelve days after the time fixed for payment of the additional deposit. The agent at that time refused to accept the checks when tendered, giving as a reason that they were not received at the time fixed in the agreement and the property had in the meantime increased in value. He also objected to the form of the tender then made, though previously, when advised the checks were ready for him, he made no objection on the ground that cash was not offered.</p>
    <p id="b527-3" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[146,1329,1152,521]]]'>Plaintiff made a formal tender of the balance of the purchase-money November 1, 1925, the date specified in the agreement, and, on defendant’s refusal to accept the money and convey the property, plaintiff filed the bill in this case asking for an order of specific performance of the agreement. The defense was based solely on the failure of plaintiff to pay the additional installment on or before August 25th. The court below deemed this sufficient reason for refusing a decree of performance, and dismissed the bill.</p>

    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[254,724,1152,1063]]]'>The contract here involved contained such stipulation, but the dispute is whether it applies to all payments to be made or only to the time of final settlement. We are of opinion the latter construction is the proper one. The provisions for payment of the installments are found at the beginning of the written agreement. This language is followed by various details relating to liens and encumbrances, insurance, title, fixtures, taxes, date on which possession is to be delivered, etc., and then follows the clause “settlement to be made on or before November 1, 1925, and <em>said time </em>is hereby agreed to be the essence of this agreement.” Clearly, “said time” refers to the date of the settlement which immediately precedes it, consequently, it is clear that was the only date the parties deemed of sufficient importance on which to require exact performance. Apparently they did not consider payment of the other installment, — a comparatively small amount, — of such serious consequence as to make its nonpayment a reason for terminating the contract.</p>
