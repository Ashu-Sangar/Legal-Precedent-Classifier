It is necessary for us, therefore, to compare the Acts of 1909 and 1919 and see to what extent the later act differs from the earlier one.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[261,702,1153,1449]]]'>The Act of 1909 provided that the operator of a motor vehicle should have the same right to use all public roads and streets as the driver of any other vehicle; and that no city, borough, etc., should have power to enforce or maintain any ordinance, rule or regulation (1) inconsistent with or fixing a lower rate of speed than that permitted by the act; or [2) requiring of any person any license tax upon or permit to operate motor vehicles upon the public highways; or (3) requiring the registration of any motor vehicle. The Supreme Court held that these provisions gave the owners of motor vehicles rights equal with, but not greater than, those enjoyed by the drivers of wagons, carriages and other vehicles on the public highways, but could not be extended so as to suspend the statutory authority of boroughs to impose a license tax on all hacks, carriages, omnibusses and other vehicles used in carrying persons or property for pay, which constituted a special business justifying police supervision for the protection of the public; that the borough could not require the owner of a motor vehicle to pay a tax as a prerequisite to using the streets of the borough any more than it could tax the owner of a wagon or carriage for such privilege, but that it could levy a license tax upon him for operating such a motor vehicle in carrying passengers for hire within the borough just as it could so tax the owner of any horse-drawn vehicle used in that business.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[263,2163,1150,260]],["BL_503.1",503,[132,357,1152,1243]]]'>The provisions of the Act of 1919 and its amendments of 1925 differ widely from those of the Act of 1909 involved in the Applewold Case. In the first place, the Act of 1909 did not mention motor vehicles carrying passengers for hire and did not attempt to legislate <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>concerning them as such, or discriminate between vehicles operated in the carriage of passengers for hire and those not so operated. The Act of 1919 (including the amendments above referred to), does discriminate between these classes of motor vehicles (see sections 2, 4 and 9, P. L. 1925, pages 256, 260 and 266) and imposes a different schedule of license fees to be paid the Commonwealth. It classifies motor vehicles carrying passengers for hire into (1) motor busses and (2) motor omnibusses, depending on whether they are common carriers and required to obtain certificates of public convenience from the Public Service Commission, or not; and imposes a graduated license tax upon them based on their seating capacity, beginning with'five passengers or less and extending to 53 passengers or more. Both motor busses and motor omnibusses are included in the general term, motor vehicle, which it is expressly declared shall include “all wheeled vehicles operated or propelled by any form of engine, motor or mechanical power......except traction engines, tractors, steam shovels, road rollers, agricultural machinery and vehicles which move upon or are guided by a track, or travel through the air.”</p>

After specifying in section 9 the license fees required to be paid the Commonwealth for the several classes of motor vehicles, and differentiating the fees, required for motor vehicles carrying passengers for hire from those not so operated, the act now in force provides (see page 266, P. L. 1925): “The fees herein set forth for the registration of motor vehicles, trailers and semitrailers shall be in lieu of any other fees or taxes to be imposed by this Commonwealth, or any subdivision thereof, and no city, borough, incór<a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>porated town, township or county, shall require or collect any registration or license fee or tax for any motor vehicle, or license from any operator thereof, except as to motor vehicles transporting passengers for pay or hire within the limits of any city, or from points within such city to points outside of the city limits.” Section 28 (page 281, P. L. 1925) declares the purpose of the act [is] to provide a system or code of law regulating the use and operation of motor vehicles throughout the Commonwealth and in consonance therewith provides that no city, borough, etc., shall hereafter adopt, maintain or enforce any rule or ordinance, inconsistent with the provisions of said act, regulating the use or operation of motor vehicles, other than certain traffic ordinances, rules and regulations not necessary to be recited here, with the following proviso: “Provided that any city may regulate the transportation by motor vehicles of passengers for pay within the limits of such city or from points in the city to points beyond the city limits, and make and enforce regulations for the operation of such vehicles, not inconsistent with this act, and designate certain streets upon which such vehicles may be operated.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[268,1602,1149,685]]]'>It will be noted that, differing from the Act of 1909, the local authorities are not prohibited by the Act of 1919 from merely requiring a license tax or permit to operate motor vehicles upon the public highway, but (1) from requiring or collecting any registration or license fee or tax for any motor vehicle, — which includes a motor bus; it being expressly declared that the license fee paid the Commonwealth shall be in lieu of any other fees or taxes imposed by the Commonwealth or any subdivision thereof; and (2) from adopting or enforcing any ordinance or rule regulating the use and operation of motor vehicles, — which again includes a motor bus.</p>

It may be due to the fact that under the Sproul Act (Act of May 31, 1911, P. L. 468) and its amendments, roads and streets in all local subdivisions except cities may be improved by the State as part of the state highway system, out of the receipts from motor vehicle license fees, or it may be that the larger number of taxicabs and motor busses in cities justifies such classification and regulation. It is only relevant in this proceeding as showing that the legislature intended to withhold from boroughs the authority attempted to be exercised in this case, and for the time being to hold in abeyance, as respects motor vehicles, the general power given in the Borough Code above mentioned. It is similar to the effect of the Public Service Company Law upon the same provision of the Borough Code as respects the right to regulate the rates of common carriers or pas<a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>sengers within boroughs, which is conceded by the appellee.</p>
