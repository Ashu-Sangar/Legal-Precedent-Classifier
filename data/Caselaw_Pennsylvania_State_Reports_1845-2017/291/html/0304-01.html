By the original document referred to, three persons, Schoenberger, Grote and Barbara Bhodes <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>were named in paragraph seven as trustees, and in number eleven the same individuals were selected as executors. By paragraph nine, power was given to “said executors and trustees, acting in either capacity,” to make sale of the real estate on such terms “as to them or the survivor of them” shall be deemed advisable, and further directed that “my executors and trustees” shall not be required to give bond. By the preceding seventh paragraph, already noted, the residue of the estate was devised and bequeathed to the three, by their given names, with direction to hold the same in trust, and from the income pay a monthly sum to a sister for life, using the balance for the maintenance and education of three nieces. Upon the death of the sister the entire income was made payable to the nieces, or their survivor, until the death of the last one. Thereafter, the principal sum was to be divided among certain named charities.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[243,1325,1153,903]]]'>Later, by a codicil, testatrix provided: “I want Ida C. Campbell to act as executrix with (Mellons) Pittsburgh Trust Company and Hermann C. Grote [the latter being the Grote previously named] and any changes dictated in will by Ida C. Campbell to be carried out.” No express appointment of trustees was made, but the trust itself, as defined in paragraph seven of the will, was altered, so as to increase the income of the sister, in these words: “So long as my sister Martha J. Crow lives — she to receive the income as long as she lives— altho any property can be sold or. my personal effects sold or distributed among my nieces as Ida C. Campbell and my sister Mattie arrange and agree to — After my sister’s death the balance of the will can be executed.” There follows a further direction to pay fixed sums to two additional charities upon the termination of the trust.</p>

The court further decided that the codicil, changing the executors, and likewise altering the trust, and increasing the benefit to be derived by her sister during life, impliedly revoked the original appointment of both executors and trustees named in the will, and substituted Ida Campbell, the Pittsburgh Trust Company and Grote, for Schoenberger, Barbara Rhodes and Grote, mentioned in paragraphs seven and eleven of the first instrument executed. Ida Campbell declined to accept the appointment as executrix, but the Pittsburgh Trust Company and Grote qualified, and to them was awarded the balance in trust. Barbara Rhodes, one of the executors and trustees nominated in the will, but not mentioned in the codicil, excepted to the decree, claiming the right to act as trustee, and to have the corpus of the fund awarded to her, in conjunction with Grote, eliminating the Pittsburgh Trust Company, named as executor in the codicil, and has brought this appeal from the refusal of the court below to so direct.</p>

It is true that these interests may be severable, and a renunciation by the nominee of the right to administer the estate may be ineffective, insofar as the right to serve as trustee is concerned: 39 Cyc. 249; Ebert &amp; Barnitz’s App., <a href="/watts/9/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="9 Watts 300" data-case-ids="1850012" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0300-01">9 Watts 300</a>. The will may indicate, however, that the trust was annexed to the office of executor (Innes’s Est., <a href="/whart/4/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="4 Whart. 179" data-case-ids="1835033" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0179-01">4 Whart. 179</a>; Strobel’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.N.C.%20409" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 W.N.C. 409">2 W.

To the ordinary duties of the one chosen to settle the estate may be added the performance of a trust in such manner that the two functions coalesce. It is the duty of the executor as such to pay to a legatee the amount of a legacy in the manner and time provided by the testator, and it does not change the duty that the payment of the principal is postponed, and the income made payable in the meantime. A trust duty may thus be imposed on an executor, which thereby becomes a function of his office. The mere fact that there is a devise or bequest of property to one named in trust does not create a distinct office, if the duties are in reality annexed by the will to those to be performed by the executor: Potter v. Couch, <a href="/us/141/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="141 U.S. 296" data-case-ids="3556200" data-case-paths="/us/141/0296-01">141 U. S. 296</a>; Colt v.

A consideration of the paper before us leads to the conclusion that Mrs. McKallip had no thought of creating distinct offices, but rather that the executors should act as trustees, and the labors imposed in settling the estate, managing the balance, paying the income, and distributing the principal, be carried out by those named acting in either capacity. In this connection it will be noted that, after appointing the trustees, in paragraph seven, she referred, in paragraph nine, to the powers of her executors and trustees, though not having then designated the former, and not doing so until paragraph eleven was written. It would seem clear that the definition of the offices was used by the testatrix interchangeably, and as one and the same, it being her purpose that the three individuals selected, first called trustees, later executors, and in the intervening paragraphs as “executors and trustees,” should be those to whom the complete <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>carrying out of her expressed desires was committed. The codicil does not indicate a wish that additional parties be added, so that five in all should act, but that the three then selected should take the place of those suggested in the will, who had then, by the codicil, imposed upon them the duties of also holding her estate until a final distribution was made.</p>

Judge Penrose said, in Howell’s Est., 12 Pa. Dist. Rep. 193, where two daughters were named as executrices and trustees by will, and the codicil appointed one as sole executrix, making no mention of the trust: “As the appointment of a trustee requires no special form of expression, but may arise, without the use of the word trustee at all, simply by implication from the imposition of duties by the instrument creating the trust, so its revocation may be accomplished with equal informality, — the question being always one of intention, to be gathered from the deed or will in its entirety......The auditing judge, we think, was entirely right in disregarding the precise, literal significa<a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>tion of the word ‘executrix,’ and holding that, by its use, the testatrix intended to include the functions of trustee also.”</p>

It is a fair conclusion, her intention was that those to whom she thus confided her affairs should act as managers to carry out her wishes, until the time came for the division of the principal.</p>
