A charter was granted May 9, 1921, by the Governor of Pennsylvania to the Sesqui-Centennial Exhibition Association, for the purpose of celebrating this important occurrence by holding an exhibition showing the progress of the United States in art, science, industry, trade and commerce. On February 1, 1922, a resolution of the city council was passed reciting that the Sesqui-Centennial Exhibition Association had been formed for the purposes stated, declaring that it was fitting that the City of Philadelphia, in its municipal and corporate character, should assume the leadership in the consummation of the enterprise, and pledging the municipal honor, faith and credit to carry on in every possible way the work of the exhibition; also pledging that the necessary funds would be provided by the municipality as its contribution to the purposes in view, and, specifically, that at least $5,-000,000, and so much more as might be required, would be provided by loan or otherwise, and duly appropriated to the best advantage of the exhibition.</p>

Up to and including June 28,1926, more than $4,-000,000 had been appropriated; and the exhibition was held in that year as contemplated. Notwithstanding the large sums of money received from the municipality, as well as from admission fees, sales of concessions, participation certificates, and other sources, the exhibition was a financial failure. Under the authority of the Act of April 3, 1923, P. L. 50, an ordinance was passed on October 1, 1926, declaring that the purpose for which a certain loan had been previously authorized, on May 16, 1916, by the electors, was impracticable and inad<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>visa,ble, and, further, providing for the submission to the electors of the question of the transfer of this loan from the original purpose to others stated in this ordinance, one of which was to celebrate the sesquicentennial anniversary. The transfer thus suggested was approved by the electors on November 2, 1926, and by ordinance of December 17, 1926, the mayor was authorized to draw and the city controller to countersign warrants to enumerated persons, firms and corporations, in amounts set opposite their respective names, for the payment of bills incurred in connection with the sesquicentennial anniversary exhibition, to the extent of $5,-000,000. The two intervening defendants, the Turner Construction Company and the Austin Company, were among the creditors provided for. Municipal bonds to the above amount were issued and sold to the public; the proceeds of this loan are now in the city treasury, and form the subject-matter of this bill.</p>

In fulfillment of these pledges, the ordinance directed that bills of certain specified creditors should be paid by warrants authorized by the mayor and countersigned by the city controller to the extent of $5,000,000, which was the amount appropriated for the purpose. The validity of the ordinance depends, first, upon whether the city, by its council, could lawfully appropriate money to an agency like the one here employed and for such a purpose; second, whether the city could lawfully use this particular $5,000,000, which was then in the city treasury.</p>

There is no reason why a municipality, unless restricted by statute, should not be permitted to make reasonable appropriations in order to fitly commemorate public events in which all of the citizens thereof are, or should be, interested......Whether this be considered an inherent common-law power of every municipality, or whether it comes within the purview of the general welfare clause of the act [regulating cities of the third class]......the result is the same.” These principles were recently discussed and approved by the New York Court of Appeals in Schieffelin v.

In that case we particularly based our ruling, setting aside the ordinance, on the grounds that the corporation seeking the appropriation was formed and the enterprise conducted “without official sanction of the [city] councils, [so as to make it] municipal in character,” and the appropriation could not “be sustained [as] a moral obligation,” the entertainment not having been authorized in advance by councils.

      <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>The eourt below well remarks: “That the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence was a suitable occasion for the holding of a celebration of a public character, is a matter beyond question; historical events of importance have seldom the significance of this one.” Appellant concedes the propriety of municipal participation in the sesquicentennial celebration, but contends that, since the exhibition conducted for that purpose was managed by a corporation other than the city itself, the latter could not legally make the appropriations under attack. In thus contending, appellant loses sight of the fact that the so-called private corporation was really an agency formed and incorporated for the purpose of carrying on a public undertaking of great magnitude, to which defendant city, under authority of law, had committed itself and pledged its honor and credit by resolutions of council long in advance of the event; he also loses sight of the fact that numerous creditors involved in this case parted with their money and property on the faith and credit of these pledges. The case cannot be looked upon from appellant’s point of view, as one relating to a mere private corporation, in no proper sense aiding in the performance of a municipal undertaking, for such is not the fact. There can be no doubt that, under the cases hereinbefore .considered, the celebration of the sesquicentennial fell within the scope of a public purpose for which the municipality could make proper appropriations, and that it might appropriate the money to an agency like the SesquiCentennial Exhibition Association, selected by the city to carry on the celebration.</p>

However that may be, the Act of July 11, 1923, P. L. 1037, specifically authorizes any city of the first class to borrow money and incur debts for any public exposition celebrating the sesquicentennial anniversary, and the Act of April 6, 1927, P. L. 123 (mentioned more at large in the next two paragraphs of this opinion) empowers the city to appropriate money to pay for services already rendered and materials previously furnished on that account, whether directly to the municipality or to an agency such as the one which figures in this case; hence the ordinance of December 17, 1926, is validated without regard to whether or not it falls within the Act of 1919.</p>

He says the first statute is special legislation because it refers to “one special and specific purpose,” namely, authorizing the borrowing of money and the incurring of debts for a sesquicentennial celebration. The answer to this ground of attack is that the legislature of Pennsylvania at all times has the sovereign power (unless taken away by some prohibition in the Constitution) to authorize cities to incur indebtedness for an exhibition such as the sesquicentennial; albeit the exercise of such power leads to legislation covering a particular class of indebtedness, there is nothing in the Constitution prohibiting this kind of special legislation, if it can be properly so termed. If authority to borrow for the purpose authorized by the Act of 1923 had to be specifically conferred, legislative classification of cities according to the <em>purpose </em>for which money can be borrowed is valid wherever the purpose is one appropriate to a large city and not appropriate to a small one; and if the legislature thought that borrowing money for an international exhibition was an appropriate activity for big cities and not for little ones, it could classify on the basis of this distinction and say that cities of more than a million inhabitants may properly pledge their credit for this kind of a celebration, while cities with smaller population may not. This disposes of the contention that the Act of 1923 is special and local legislation. See also Kraus v. Phila., <a href="/pa/265/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="265 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1051835" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0425-01">265 Pa. 425</a>, 436.

Meyer, <a href="/pa/259/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="259 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1038338" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0306-01">259 Pa. 306</a>, 3.17) recognized debts of the character of those now before us as moral obligations of the city (Bailey v.

The Sesqui-Centennial Exhibition Association was a corporation of the first class, or a corporation not for profit in the legal sense of that term, and as a matter of fact it had no capital, never anticipated reaping any profits, and made none. Though the association was never formally appointed an agent of the City of Philadelphia, it was “incorporated for the purpose of holding and conducting” the Sesqui-Centennial Exhibition, and undoubtedly was-an “agency” in the sense of that term as used in the curative act we are now considering. Counsel for appellant, in making another point, himself says that all the directors of city departments were engaged in the management of the exhibition association, and that it always worked in CoOperation with the municipal authorities. If, therefore, as the court below states, the city, in “carrying out [its] <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>pledges, chooses to recognize as moral obligations certain of the [sesqnicentennial] accounts, remaining unpaid ......, its power to do so cannot be impugned, provided it has the money legally available for the purpose.”</p>

The loan from which this money was derived was first authorized by a vote of the electors on May 16, 1916. Under section 1 of the Act of April 3, 1923, P. L. 50, it is lawful for a city of the first class to transfer previously authorized loans when the original purpose of a loan becomes inadvisable and impracticable, if the purpose which the transfer is intended to accomplish was lawful at the time of the original authorization, and if the electors acquiesce by vote in the new purpose. An ordinance of city council, dated October 1, 1926, declaring the original purpose of the loan authorized in 1916 to be inadvisable and impracticable, provided for a vote of the electors to authorize a transfer to certain other purposes, among which was the one now attempted to be put into effect. The electors, on November 6, 1926, authorized the proposed transfer, and the question is whether the purpose then approved would have been lawful in 1916. Upon examination of the Act of March 11, 1789, section XVI (2 Sm. L. 462, 467), and our own decisions, hereinbefore enumerated, we are convinced that, under the general municipal powers recognized by the latter and the express power to make appropriations for such purposes “as shall be necessary or convenient for the government and welfare of the......city,” conferred by the former, the council possessed ample authority to appropriate, in advance, even in 1916, for sesquicentennial <em>purposes; </em>in fact, that is about the time when preparations for an enterprise of this magnitude should have been commenced, if it were to be a success. There was nothing in the City Charter Law as it stood ip fbff) tq forbid the <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>borrowing of money for such a purpose if that course had been considered necessary at the time; but the subject need not be further pursued, for another curative act removed any doubt there might be as to the legality or regularity of the loan transaction now before us. The Act of March 2, 1927, P. L. 7, validated all elections to approve a change of purpose of loans by cities of the first class and all bond issues of such cities in furtherance of sesquicentennial celebrations; it also waived and validated any defects in procedure connected with such elections or bond issues. Appellant questions the constitutionality of this last-mentioned act; but the same reasons which sustain the Act of April 6, 1927, supra, make the present statute valid legislation. To quote again from the opinion of the court below, “If [the Act of March 2, 1927] is a valid enactment, it must follow that [not only are] certificates of the controller [expressly] waived [but also] any other defects in procedure are cured.” See Swartz v. Carlisle Boro., <a href="/pa/237/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="237 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="988970" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0473-01">237 Pa. 473</a>, 478, 479; Kennedy v.

Phila., <a href="/pa/257/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="257 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="1032380" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0589-01">257 Pa. 589</a>, 599: “The rule of laches applies......from whichever point the proceedings may be viewed,— whether as a taxpayer’s or property owner’s bill; and, when the facts call for its application, the rule may control even in a case where there is involved a public improvement constructed without lawful authority (which we do not hold to be the fact in the present case).”</p>

So far as appears, the defendants, including the intervening creditors, are seeking merely to take advantage of the law ordained by the legislature and acted on by city council. As we said in Kraus v. Phila., <a href="/pa/265/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="265 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1051835" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0425-01">265 Pa. 425</a>, 430, citing prior decisions, “A municipality is merely an agency instituted by the sovereign for the purpose of carrying out in detail the objects of government, and therefore the legislature may enlarge or diminish......its functions.” The expediency of doing the particular things complained of by appellant, and the wisdom of granting the right to do them, have been passed on not only by the state legislature, but also by the city council, and, on at least one occasion, by the people at a general election, and always with approval. The statutes before us represent the sovereign will of the people, speaking through tbflir legislature; the courts may consider <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>only whether they are constitutional, and whether the ordinances passed by the municipality accord with the powers thus conferred. Both these points must be decided in the affirmative, and, on the record before us, this is conclusive.</p>
