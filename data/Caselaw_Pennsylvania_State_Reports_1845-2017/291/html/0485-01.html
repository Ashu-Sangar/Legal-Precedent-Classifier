These contractors had charge of the operation, controlling the various laborers required to handle the material to be removed from the hold of the ship and placed on railroad cars alongside on the wharf. Orders necessary in the carrying out of the task were given by the individual foremen in charge of the three gangs at work, under the general direction of its head foreman, who had supervision of the entire undertaking. The contractors were without the necessary hoisting apparatus, and hired from Howlett, Inc., the defendant, a crane, with a fireman and engineer, who operated it, to aid in the service to be performed, paying compensation at the rate of $10 an hour for the time consumed. The hoisting device secured was attached to a lighter, towed to the off-shore side of the vessel, and rigged with a clam-<a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>shell bucket. This, when in service, was swung over the hold, lowered with the jaws open, closed by the action of the engineer when it had grasped the load to be moved, then raised through the hatchway, and swung to a chute, leading to the waiting cars on the shore, and there emptied. It was not possible for the engineer to see the bucket when dropped into the hold, nor could he determine, when lifted, whether cars were ready on the wharf to receive the material.</p>
    <p id="b509-3" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[138,833,1156,1071]]]'>To secure proper unloading, Murphy, Cook &amp; Company employed one stationed on the ship, whose duty was to furnish by signal the necessary information to the operator of the crane, and give warning by hand if the bucket should be held suspended and not moved across the deck, since cars were not always in place to receive the cargo. On the day of the accident, the bucket was raised as usual, and swung toward the place of emptying, contrary to the order of the hatch tender, as claimed by plaintiff. While making this movement a lump of chalk fell from it, striking the foot of Bojarski, engaged for the moment in adjusting the chute through which the material passed to the wharf below. This action was brought to recover damages for the injury sustained from Howlett, Inc., the owners of the crane, temporarily engaged for hire in the service of the stevedores, Murphy, Cook &amp; Co., and resulted in a verdict for plaintiff. The court below subsequently entered judgment for the defendant n. o. v., and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[138,1923,1151,480]],["BL_510.1",510,[255,345,1150,638]]]'>The single question presented here is as to the liability of the particular defendant sued for the damage inflicted. As already noticed, Howlett, Inc., rented the crane with its foreman and operator to Murphy, Cook <em>&amp; </em>Company, who were the contractors engaged in unloading the vessel. The engineer controlled its movements and the attached bucket, under directions, however, of an employee of the latter. The operator stationed on the lighter, standing alongside, could not de<a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>termine whether the bucket should be moved across the deck to the chute for unloading into the cars on the wharf, as they were beyond his line of vision. For orders as to this he depended on the hatch tender, employed for that purpose by Murphy, Cook &amp; Co. The jury has found his signal to hold the bucket, in the present instance, was disregarded, and, as a result, the second employee of the stevedores injured, which, for present purposes, must be taken as true, in view of the verdict of the jury. Under these circumstances, is defendant liable for the loss sustained by reason of the negligent management of the crane?</p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[253,995,1151,1065]]]'>If Howlett, Inc., were independent contractors, and the employee of Murphy, Cook &amp; Co. was injured by the careless act of the crane operator employed by the former, then a recovery could be had against it: McKnight v.

It hired for temporary service the appliance of defendant, with its operators, but the same was employed under its direction in the furtherance of its business. Howlett, Inc., were paid compensation for the hourly use of the crane and those who managed it, but, for the time being, it was subject to the control of the stevedores.</p>

The payment of compensation, whether by a lump sum for the whole, or at a fixed rate by the hour, or some other manner, though not conclusive, is a circumstance to be considered in determining whether there is an independent contract (39 C. J. 1321), as is the fact that the employment is for no definite period, but that the one hired can be discharged at any time: Flaharty v. Trout, <a href="/pa/290/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="290 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="1104451" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0315-01">290 Pa. 315</a>. Having in view the principles stated, it cannot be said that Howlett, Inc., was an independent contractor for the purpose of unloading the vessel, but was employed by the stevedores to assist in carrying out their obligation.

Here, Murphy, Cook &amp; Co. were stevedores under a contract to unload. The negligent crane operator, though in the general service of Howlett, Inc., was temporarily the servant of the one who hired, and, while so engaged, the latter is not responsible for the engineer’s lack of due care, but the one for whom he is acting for the time is, if any one.

Anderson, <a href="/us/212/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="212 U.S. 215" data-case-ids="5710673" data-case-paths="/us/212/0215-01">supra,</a> and many other American courts, the same facts were presented as now before us, and the nonliability of the owner of the appliance, let with the negligent operator to á stevedore, affirmed. The opinions of the three judges, filed in the case referred to, lucidly discuss the legal principles controlling, and applicable here.</p>

L. R. 1116</a>), will show the respective decisions to depend on the determination as to who, at the time of the accident, had control of the work in which the servant was engaged. If it was under the direction, generally or temporarily, of the one having supervision of the general undertaking, he is held responsible. In the case before us, the crane and its operator were let for use to the stevedore, who had charge of the unloading, and they were under its direction. The hatch tender, an employee of the hirer, gave the signal for movement to the engineer, and the latter, for the time being, was the servant of Murphy, Cook &amp; Co. It is the one, therefore, which must be looked to if any recovery is to be had, and not the de<a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>fendant, Howlett, Inc., who had no supervision of the work to be performed.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[269,465,1152,1015]]]'>Appellant suggests that the improper movement of the bucket across the deck, controlled by signal of the hatchman, was not the sole cause of the injury, but it was due in part to the failure of the engineer to close the bucket, as a result of which clay fell and injured plaintiff. If there was negligence on the part of the crane operator in failing to do so, it was that of the temporary servant of the stevedore, as we have said. We do not understand the claim now made to be that there was any defect in the machinery supplied by Howlett, Inc. The case was not tried on such theory below, and the contention is not supported by the evidence. The court stated in its charge to the jury, without objection or exception by plaintiff: “This bucket came up with the jaws somewhat apart. It is not contended by plaintiff that there was any negligence in that.” It is too late for appellant to alter the legal position from the basis on which the case was tried: Consolidated Cigar Corp. v.
