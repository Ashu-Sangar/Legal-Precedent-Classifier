The township supervisor is not mentioned in any of the Constitutions of the Commonwealth; and the townships themselves, with respect only to the election or appointment of certain of their officers, in section 30 of the Constitution of 1776, in article VI, section 5, of the Constitution of 1790, in article VI, section 7, of the Constitution of 1838, and in article V, section 11, of the Constitution of 1873; and also in article III, section 7, of the last-named <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>Constitution, with respect to the forbidding of local and special legislation as to them. Consequently, under section 2 of the schedule to the Constitution of 1873, all the statutes dealing with the subject now under consideration, which were in force when it was adopted, continued in effect thereafter, and (Georges Twp.

    <p id="b71-3" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[151,818,1154,803]]]'>Among the statutes which thus continued in effect, and could have been amended, was section 92 of the Act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 537, 554, which subjects township supervisors to amercement for neglect of duty, and section 2 of the Act of March 16, 1860, P. L. 174, which provides for their amotion, if they fail to give the bond required by section 1 of that statute. Whether or not section 92 of the Act of 1834, supra, was impliedly repealed by the Act of March 22, 1907, P. L. 27, which provides for the amotion of any township officer, if he is found guilty of a breach of duty, need not be considered, for both those statutes were expressly repealed by the Act of 1917, supra, which substituted for them the provision of section 192, under which the'present proceedings were had.</p>
    <p id="b71-4" data-blocks='[["BL_71.5",71,[151,1630,1154,583]]]'>Since the Constitution of 1873 provides no method by which statutes may be amended (but only that they may not be by reference to their titles only: Article III, section 6), it might be held, perhaps, that section 192 was, in legal effect, but a reenactment of the Act of 1907, which was itself only a permissible amendment of the prior statutes: Georges Twp.

Deshler, <a href="/pa/71/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="71 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="1031225" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0299-01">71 Pa. 299</a>; Com. v.

It follows, if a fair construction of the statute, providing for their election or appointment, results in the conclusion that, under it, they were only intended to be conditionally elected for a specified term, that effect must be given to the legislative intent, notwithstanding the provisions of article VI, section 4, for not otherwise can they “be elected or appointed, as may be directed by law.”</p>

L. 862), that if any of them “refuses or neglects to perform his duties, the court of quarter sessions [upon proper proceedings, .which the instant ones were]......may declare the office vacant and appoint another in his stead, to hold office during the term of the officer deposed.” This latter section as certainly expresses the legislative intent as does the former, and we must assume, therefore, that the legislature intentionally made the term of six years a conditional one, which should end when a breach of duty was adjudged in the way specified. No other conclusion will give full effect to the legislative intent; and in no other way can section 192 be held constitutional, as we must determine it to be, if any reasonable construction of the statute can bring about this result: Com. v.

Benn, <a href="/pa/284/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="284 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1092047" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0421-01">284 Pa. 421</a>, 429. It was referred to in Georges Twp. School Directors, <a href="/pa/286/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="286 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1096468" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0129-01">286 Pa. 129</a>, 133-4; and, though a leaning was there shown towards our present conclusion, the case was ruled on another point. The question is now squarely raised, and we hold, therefore, that, although article VI, section 4, is not limited to what are frequently termed constitutional officers, it is not applicable where the legislature, having the right to fix the length of a term of office, has made it determinable, by judicial proceedings, on other contingencies than the mere passage of time. It follows that the court below erred in dismissing the petition in this case.</p>
    <p id="b74-4" data-blocks='[["BL_74.4",74,[246,1207,1152,419]]]'>Since much stress was argumentatively laid on our decision in Com. v. Reid, <a href="/pa/265/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="265 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1051923" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0328-01">265 Pa. 328</a>, we should add, perhaps, that, in the case of a burgess, there being considered, the legislature had provided no method of amotion for misbehavior in office; hence we held, as pointed out in Georges Twp. School Directors, <a href="/pa/286/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="286 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1096468" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0129-01">286 Pa. 129</a>, 134, for this reason, proceedings under article VI, section 4, could appropriately be had.</p>
    <p id="b74-5" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[244,1638,1152,637]]]'>A motion was made to dismiss the present appeal upon the ground that, since the inception of the proceedings, appellees, under the stress of a mandamus, have done the things which the petition alleged they had neglected to do. It is a novel contention that he who does right when judicially compelled so to do, thereby becomes a faithful official, despite his admittedly prior dereliction, and can thus wholly escape the penalty specified for his neglect of duty; but we leave this, and all other questions which may be raised, to the initial determination of the court below, which has, as yet, passed on none of them.</p>
    <p id="b74-6" data-blocks='[["BL_74.6",74,[244,2288,1149,151]]]'>The order of the court below is reversed, the petition is reinstated, and the record is remitted for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
