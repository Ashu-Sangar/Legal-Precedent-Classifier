    <p id="b275-13" data-blocks='[["BL_275.24",275,[137,1830,1150,585]],["BL_276.1",276,[280,362,1144,87]]]'>At the trial, plaintiff was permitted to ask a builder, called by her as a witness, what was the replacement value of the house and garage on plaintiff’s property at the time it was taken. This evidence was admitted “for the single purpose of corroborating......the witnesses who have testified as to their estimate on the buildings on this property in order to determine the market value placed on the property by them.” Whether or not this was proper, is the only question necessary to be considered by us; the assignment which objects to the trial judge’s reference to the evidence in his charge to the <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>jury, is of no moment, if the testimony was properly admitted.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[276,470,1150,1780]]]'>No other evidence is as unsatisfactory as that necessarily received in this class of cases. Courts and juries are given, by the witnesses, matters of opinion only, the accuracy of which is far more difficult to test than are disputed questions of fact. An endeavor to minimize this uncertainty, may excuse the error which appears in the ruling now complained of, and in the single case supposed to sustain it, but it is error notwithstanding. Even those who are but slightly conversant with the subject, know that, where the building being valued is in a neighborhood which has run down, or where it was erected by an owner for his home, or where it is so located on a large lot as to hinder the proper development of the property after the character of the neighborhood has changed, the replacement value of such house will always be greater than the value of the building as part of the property in its entirety; indeed it may be, and sometimes is, in excess of the market value of <em>the </em>property, including the building. Curiously enough, we have on this record two illustrations of the truth of the above. Plaintiff’s husband testified that “you couldn’t replace [plaintiff’s] property for $75,000......[but] the market value was between $40,000 and $45,000.” It also appeared that a neighboring property, on which an expensive home had been built, could not be sold until the building was torn down. It is clear, therefore, that evidence of the replacement value of plaintiff’s buildings should not have been received, unless the circumstances were so peculiar as to render it absolutely essential, in the interest of justice, to require its admission. We know of no circumstance which could justify it; certainly none appears on this record.</p>

This case well illustrates the wisdom of the rule just stated; for the average juryman would naturally reason that, if the undisputed replacement value was $75,000, the market value of $39,499.50, as fixed by the lowest of plaintiff’s witnesses, must be substantially correct, and this latter sum, with six per cent damages for detention,— as the court below points out, though the force of the calculation was apparently not noticed, — is nearly the same as the verdict of $41,406.31.</p>

An exception to this rule appears, if the examination in chief shows that the “witness considered —in the sense that, in his estimate of value, he was aided by, or relied on — prices paid for properties similarly situated, [in which event] he may be cross-examined as to the prices paid for such other similar properties, as testing his good faith, credibility, accuracy and extent of knowledge,” (Penna.

If it had been <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>shown that there was a fixed relation between the two kinds of value, possibly evidence as to the replacement value would have been admissible by way of corroboration ; but there was no such evidence, .and, as we have shown, there was no such relation.

There may be exceptional instances, when the evidence shows the trees in question to have had a selling value separate and apart from the land (for example, trees growing on a nursery farm), where a different rule would apply; but, under the facts at bar, there can be no doubt that the proper way to determine the pecuniary damage suffered by the destruction of the plaintiff’s <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>trees was through the application of the ordinary rule just referred to.” Certain it is, that Savings &amp; Trust Co. v. Penna. R. R. Co., supra, insofar as it approves the admission of evidence of the value of any one of the items going to make up the value of the property as a whole, clashes with all our other cases on the subject, those decided after as well as before it, and since it is also wrong in principle, it should be, and now is, overruled as to that point.</p>
