In May, 1919, it purchased and took over all the property and assets of three several corporations, to-wit, the Youngstown Clay Products Company, the Carbon Brick Company and the Castle Clay Company; the two former being Ohio and the latter a Pennsylvania corporation. The consideration in each case being the payment of all the <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>debts and liabilities of the respective company and six hundred shares of the common stock of the Liberty Clay Products Company. The only one involved in this appeal is the Youngstown Clay Products Company, which attached to its transfer an itemized schedule of its liabilities, including $24,000 to the Struthers Savings &amp; Banking Company, — represented by several promissory notes. The contract for the purchase of the property and assumption of the liabilities was expressed in writing enacted by the directors and approved by the stockholders of the Liberty Clay Products Company. Thereafter the last named company provided for an issue of preferred stock and, beginning about June, 1919, sold the same to the par value of $183,000, to diverse parties re siding in Pennsylvania and Ohio. This stock was given a preference over the common stock as to both income and assets; but their right to participate in the management of the company’s business arose only when default was made in payment of interest on their stock. While the Youngstown Clay Products Company was an Ohio corporation, its property with its business was largely in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, where its principal asset, the Volant plant was located. The venture proved unprofitable and in 1920, and for each subsequent year, default was made in payment of interest on the preferred stock. In 1920 the Struthers Savings &amp; Banking Company became insolvent and was taken over by the State of Ohio, in which it was located. The $24,000 assumed indebtedness to the bank, with a large accumulation of interest, being unpaid, on December 2, 1924, the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County, where defendant’s principal office was located, at the instance of the superintendent of banks of Ohio, appointed Osborne Mitchell, Esq., receiver of the Liberty Clay Products Company. On the next day the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County appointed P. A. Kanengeiser as ancillary receiver in Pennsylvania. The application for a receiver set out the $24,000 indebtedness and ac<a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>crued interest, which defendant’s answer admitted. This, at least so far as concerned the appointment of the receivers, was ratified at a stockholders’ meeting held December 12, 1924. By leave of court the receivers operated the plant for some six months at a considerable profit, but in the early summer of 1925 a responsible party made an offer of $50,000 for the Volant plant, which the Pennsylvania receiver petitioned the Lawrence County court for leave to accept. Pending this proceeding, certain of the preferred stockholders, acting for themselves and others, asked the court for leave to take over the property of the Liberty Clay Products Company in consideration of paying its debts and liabilities. Upon due consideration, this was granted and the property turned over to a trustee for the preferred stockholders; they giving bond to pay therefor $60,000, or so much thereof as might be necessary to liquidate the indebtedness. Of this sum $20,000 was paid. Thereafter the matter of adjusting the indebtedness was brought before the Lawrence County court and from its final decree, allowing, inter alia, the said claim of the State of Ohio, this appeal was taken on behalf of the preferred stockholders.</p>

In the spring of 1926, at the instance of the Ohio banking commissioner and upon due notice to the Ohio receiver and to the defendant, the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County passed upon and adjusted that state’s claim and entered judgment for the full amount, debt and interest. That is a court of general jurisdiction and from the judgment entered no appeal was taken. An exemplification of the record, duly certified according to the Act of Congress, was presented during the hearing in Lawrence County. The court there, however, did not treat it as conclusive, but went into a painstaking investigation and found as a matter of law and fact that the en<a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>tire claim of the State of Ohio, debt and interest, was an existing legal obligation and decreed accordingly. The defendant being in the court of its domicile where its indebtedness might properly be adjusted, the Lawrence County court might well have rested its adjudication upon the full faith and credit clause of the federal Constitution.

This admission of record was entirely consistent with and in fact was an implied promise to pay and effective as a renewal.

This large indebtedness, amounting with interest to over $30,000, was the basis for appointment of the receiver and defendant’s admission of its validity and consenting to the receivership was consistent with a promise to pay. This answer still stands unchallenged upon the record. Again, the conduct of the preferred stockholders on taking over the property disclosed an understanding that this debt was a liability, otherwise an agreement to pay $30,000, in place of the $60,000, would have been ample. Had the sale of the Yolant plant for the $50,000 been consummated, the proceeds would have been distributable here for the protection of local creditors (Frowert v.

Moreover, on taking over the property the preferred stockholders expressly agreed to pay the debts of the corporation regardless of the domicile.
