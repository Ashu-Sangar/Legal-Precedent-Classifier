After reading the pleadings and considering the able argument of counsel for appellant, we cannot say it is \u201cclear and free from doubt\u201d that the court below erred in refusing judgment: Wilson v. Bryn Mawr T. Co., 225 Pa. 143, 146. Without expressing or intimating any view on the several points argued in the briefs, it is enough to say that this case falls within the established rule that we do not reverse on. appeals from orders such as the one now before us \u201cunless the action of the court below clearly appears to be based on a plain error of law\u201d (Phila. v. Merchant & Evans Co., 289 Pa. 578, 579) ; and no such plain error is clearly, shown by the present record. Therefore, following the usual course pursued under such, circumstances, we will not disturb the order under attack; nor shall we discuss the legal questions in the case \u201ctill an opportunity is had to fully develop the facts at trial\u201d: Brown v. Unger, 269 Pa. 471, 472; see also opinion in Steiner v. Greater Sharon Realty Co., filed simultaneously herewith [the next case below].\nThe order appealed from is affirmed.",
