        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nBy testator\u2019s will he created a trust, and gave to his niece, Mary Packer Blue, who later became Mary Packer Thomas, \u201conly the income [of it]......for her natural life \u2014 at her death this share shall pass to all my other beneficiaries \u2014 except Mary Packer Blue \u2014 named in my will dated January 18,1906.\u201d By agreement of the parties in interest, the securities in testator\u2019s estate were distributed in kind, at the valuation fixed when the amount of the inheritance tax was determined, the trustees receiving a part thereof for the purposes of the trust. While Mrs. Thomas, the life tenant, was still alive, an extraordinary stock dividend was declared. The court below awarded to her only so much thereof as in fact represented income. Appellant, the administrator of her estate, claims that, as the market value of the stock was the same after the dividend was declared as it had been before, the whole of it should have been awarded to her, as life tenant. Whether or not this is correct, is the first question raised on the present appeal. After the death of the life tenant, certain of the trust securities were sold, at a price in excess of the appraisement as above made. The court awarded nearly all of the proceeds to the remaindermen. Appellant claims that the whole of it should have been awarded to him, as her administrator; that the profit thus realized was in legal effect income, though it was not earnings of the corporations accruing after testator\u2019s death. Whether or not this is correct, is the only other question raised on the present appeal. The court below was right on both points.\nWhen they wrote their interesting brief in this case, counsel for appellant did not have the benefit of our careful and elaborate opinion, written by Judge Kephart, in Nirdlinger\u2019s Est., 290 Pa. 457. It reviewed most of our previous cases, bearing on the two points now to be decided, including those relied on by appellant. We there held that, in distributing extraordinary stock dividends between a life tenant and the corpus of a trust which holds the original stock upon which the dividend is declared, the former is entitled to receive, so many of the new shares as represents the net earnings of the corporation accruing after the trust estate acquired the stock upon which the dividend was declared, for they then represent the accrued income; the latter is entitled to retain all the rest of the stock dividend, for it does not represent income. Neither market value, nor any other value than the actual or intact value of the shares, is of any moment in determining how such a distribution is to be made. In making it, there should always be awarded to the corpus of the trust such a number of the shares included in the dividend as, with the shares upon which the dividend was declared, at the actual or intact value of the two after the stock dividend is declared and paid, will aggregate exactly the same sum as the actual or intact value of the original shares at the time the trust acquired them, plus any capital increase thereafter paid to the corporation on account of those shares, and less a proportionate part of any capital losses properly chargeable against them.\nIn Nirdlinger\u2019s Est., supra, we also held that on a sale of the securities in a trust estate, the income included in the purchase price, measured in the way above stated and in that way only, belongs to the life tenant, and any other enhancement in value is not income, and hence belongs to the corpus. If we were to hold otherwise, it could equally well be said that an increase in the value of trust realty, owing to a shifting of population or business, is income of the estate.\nThe decree appealed from directs distribution in the way we have indicated above, and is, therefore, correct.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed at the costs of appellant.",

In distributing extraordinary stock dividends between a life tenant and the corpus of a trust estate, which holds the original stock upon which the dividend was declared, the life tenant is entitled to receive so much of the new shares as represents the net earnings of the corporation, accruing after the trust estate acquired the stock upon which the dividend was declared, for they then represent the accrued income; and the corpus is entitled to retain all the rest of the stock dividend, for it does not represent income.\n2. Neither market value, nor any other value than the actual or intact value of the shares is of any moment in determining how an extraordinary stock dividend is to be distributed between the income and the corpus of a trust estate.\n3. In distributing extraordinary stock dividends between a life tenant and the corpus of a trust estate, the latter is entitled to have awarded to it such a number of shares included in the dividend as, with the shares upon which the dividend was declared, at the actual or intact value of the two, after the stock dividend is declared and paid, will aggregate exactly the same sum as the actual or intact value of the original shares at the time the trust acquired them, plus any capital increase thereafter paid to the corporation, on account of those shares, and less a proportionate part of any capital losses properly chargeable against them.\n4. When the securities in a trust estate are sold, the income included in the purchase price, ascertained in the way specified in the foregoing syllabi, belongs to a life tenant; the balance of the purchase price belongs to the corpus of the trust.\nArgued October 4, 1927.\nBefore Frazer, Walling, Simpson, Kephart, Sadler and Schaffer, JJ.\nAppeal, No. 30, Jan. T., 1928, by Abraham W. Thomas, admr. of Mary Packer Thomas, life tenant, from order of O. C. Northumberland Co., Feb. T., 1919, No. 61, dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report, in Estate of James C. Packer, deceased.\nAffirmed.\nNovember 28, 1927:\nExceptions to auditor\u2019s report. Before Strouss, P. J.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the facts.\nExceptions dismissed. Abraham W. Thomas, administrator of Mary Packer Thomas, deceased, life tenant, appealed.\nError assigned, inter alia, was decree, quoting record.\nAndrew A. Leiser, with him Andrew A. Leiser, Jr., for appellant.\nAny gain over and above the appraised value is \u201cincome\u201d within the meaning of this will: Braun\u2019s App., 105 Pa. 414; Wiltbank\u2019s App., 64 Pa. 256; Thomson\u2019s Est., 153 Pa. 332; Oliver\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 43; Park\u2019s Est., 173 Pa. 190; Quay\u2019s Est., 253 Pa. 80; Boyer\u2019s App., 224 Pa. 144; Thompson\u2019s Est., 262 Pa. 278; Wittmer\u2019s Est., 283 Pa. 311; Harkness\u2019s Est., 283 Pa. 464.\nJ. Fred Schaffer, for appellees.\nA person having a life estate in the stock of a corporation is not entitled to the enhanced value of the stock due to undivided surplus profits; such enhanced value belongs to the remaindermen: Wilcox\u2019s Est., 66 Pa. Superior Ct. 182; Eisner\u2019s Est., 175 Pa. 143; Connolly\u2019s Est., 198 Pa. 137; Graham\u2019s Est., 198 Pa. 216; Hubley\u2019s Est., 16 Phila. 327.\nThe precise point which we are arguing now is not a declaration of a stock dividend, nor yet the case of the creation by the corporation, whose stock is held by the trust, of the right to subscribe and pay for new stock. We are here concerned, as to this $10,169 with an advance of the sale price of the stocks and bonds, over and above the appraised value at the inception of the trust. It is not a question of a stock dividend, nor the right to subscribe and pay for new stock."
