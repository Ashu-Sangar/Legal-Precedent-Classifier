        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nThese two appeals challenge the propriety of the ruling of the court below in a replevin action, after a jury verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor, granting a new trial to defendants and refusing judgment n.o.v. in favor of defendants.\nIn August 1953 Warren Holland, doing business as Hanover Construction Company, orally agreed to purchase from Clayton Fehr and Roy Hahn a Galion roller and an Allis Chalmers grader for the sum of $5,100. On August 12, 1953 Holland (plaintiff) and Felir and Hahn (defendants) entered into a written bailment lease under the terms of which plaintiff was to pay defendants as rental for the grader and roller the sum of $5,100, $2,100 of which was to be paid upon execution of the lease and the balance of $3,000 to be paid in twelve monthly installments of $250 each. The lease did not set forth the date of each month when the monthly installments were to be paid by plaintiff. However, the lease did recite that a note was to be executed and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendants \u201cupon the execution of [the] lease as evidence of and collateral security for the obligation to pay the rental . . .\u201d. On the same date plaintiff executed and delivered to defendants both the lease and the note and paid $2,100, the down payment required under the terms of the lease. The note, signed by plaintiff, was payable to the order of the defendants in the amount of $3,000 and provided, inter alia, for payment by plaintiff of the $3,000 in twelve monthly installments of $250 each, \u201cthe first payment on September 12, 1953 \u2014 interest in advance $180 and on the same date of each month thereafter until fully paid . .\nOn the same day the defendants, in writing, assigned both the lease and note to the Second National Bank of Nazareth, Pa., at the same time endorsing the note. Defendants then received $>3,000 from tbe bank. Plaintiff received possession of tbe grader and roller and paid tbe bank $180, one year\u2019s interest in advance on tbe note.\nOn September 28,1953 plaintiff paid tbe first monthly installment of $250 to tbe bank. On October 19, 1953 tbe bank mailed tbe following notice to tbe plaintiff: \u201cAccording to our records your Consumer Credit Loan payment for $250 was due 10/12. Possibly this was an oversight on your part, and if so, we will appreciate your remittance by mail. If payment has been sent please accept our thanks and disregard this notice\u201d. Plaintiff received this notice in tbe early evening of October 20,1953. Copies of this notice were sent by tbe bank to both defendants. On October 20,1953 \u2014 prior to receipt of tbe notice by tbe plaintiff\u2014 at tbe bank\u2019s direction \u2014 defendants seized and repossessed both tbe grader and roller. The nest day\u2014 October 21, 1953 \u2014 defendants repurchased from tbe bank tbe lease and note which were then reassigned to defendants.\nOn November 7, 1953 plaintiff instituted this re-plevin action. After issue joined tbe action was tried before tbe late Judge Fkack and a jury in tbe Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County. At defendant\u2019s request, tbe jury was instructed to render, in addition to a general verdict, a special verdict on each of two issues: (a) whether tbe bank\u2019s notice of October 19, 1955 to plaintiff constituted a waiver of any default in payment of tbe monthly installment on October 12th, 1953 and (b) whether under tbe terms of tbe lease and note plaintiff was required to make monthly payments on tbe 12th day of each month. Tbe jury returned three verdicts: (1) a general verdict for plaintiff and against defendants for $5,028.75; (2) a special verdict finding that tbe bank\u2019s notice to plaintiff did not constitute a waiver and (3) that the plaintiff was not required to make the monthly payment on the 12th day of each month. Defendants filed motions both for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v. Judge Palmer, for the court en banc, granted defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial but did not pass upon their motion for judgment n.o.v. Plaintiff appeals from the grant of a new trial. Defendants appeal from the refusal of a judgment n.o.v.\nAn examination of the record reveals the existence of such a fundamental error on the part of the trial judge as to obviate the necessity of determining any of the reasons assigned for the reversal of the court below in other respects.\nAssuming, arguendo, that the defendants\u2019 position in respect to the due date of the October payment was correct, the question arises whether the notice sent by the bank to plaintiff on October 19, 1953 constituted a waiver of the date of payment. The only evidence concerning a waiver was the writing contained in the bank\u2019s notice to the plaintiff. The trial judge submitted to the jury for its determination the question whether such writing constituted a waiver.\nWhile ordinarily the question of waiver is a question of fact for a jury (Cole v. Philadelphia Company, 345 Pa. 315, 323, 26 A. 2d 920; Batchelder v. Standard Plunger Elevator Company, 227 Pa. 201, 207, 75 A. 1090; Priester v. Milleman, 161 Pa. Superior Ct. 507, 517, 55 A. 2d 540), yet, where the only evidence as to waiver is a writing, its construction and interpretation and whether or not it constitutes a waiver is a question of law for the court: Sheesley v. Bisbee Lin seed Co., 337 Pa. 197, 200, 10 A. 2d 401; Corcoran for the use of Dill et al. v. The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, 179 Pa. 132, 144, 36 A. 203; Ziegenfuss v. Ziegenfuss et ux., 160 Pa. Superior Ct. 374, 376, 377, 51 A. 2d 508; 56 Am. Jr. \u00a723, p. 126; 88 C.J.S. 499, 500, 501. As the Court said in Corcoran v. The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, 179 Pa. 132, supra, p. 144: \u201cThere was no ambiguity to the letter. It was plain and direct in its statements. Its construction was therefore for the court. It was a fact that might be taken into consideration by the jury that such a letter was written and its legal effect as declared by the court was to be accepted by them and acted upon, but the construction of the letter and whether it was a waiver of the stipulation in the policy were questions for the court.\u201d The submission to the jury of the interpretation of this writing and whether it constituted a waiver was clearly erroneous.\nAn examination of this writing- \u2014 the notice of October 19th \u2014 indicates that it constituted a waiver of the time of payment due by the plaintiff on October 12, 1953. Such being the case, the failure of the plaintiff to pay to the bank this installment due under the lease and the note on October 12, 1953 was waived and there was no justification for the repossession of the roller and the grader on October 20, 1953.\nThe conclusion thus reached obviates any necessity for considering either plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the grant of a new trial or defendant\u2019s appeal from the refusal of judgment n.o.v. Our construction and interpretation of the notice as a waiver clearly establishes the plaintiff\u2019s right to the entry of a judgment on the verdict.\nThe grant of a new trial is reversed, the refusal of a judgment n.o.v. is affirmed and a judgment is directed to be entered on the verdict in favor of plaintiff.\nActually appellants in appeal No. 40 and appellees in appeal No. 51 are assignees of the original plaintiff in the court below.\nThis involves the adoption in entirety of the defendants\u2019 theory and a rejection of the jury\u2019s special finding that the October payment could be paid at any time during the month of October",
