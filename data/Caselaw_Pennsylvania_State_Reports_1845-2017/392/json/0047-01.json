The case was tried to the court below without a jury. The findings of the trial judge are adequately supported by the evidence and, upon exceptions thereto by the defendant, were confirmed by the court en bane. They, therefore, have the weight of a jury\u2019s verdict and the conclusions of law made by the court correctly flowed from the findings so established. Our examination of the record has failed to disclose the slightest merit in any of the appellant\u2019s assignments of error.\nJudgment affirmed.",
