Laurentian, after deducting its costs and commissions, and all Canadian sales taxes and income taxes upon the above mentioned merchandise, deposits the balance to the credit of Belmont in the Royal Bank of Canada. From time to time these net profits, which are earned in a foreign country on goods made in a foreign country, are transferred by Belmont to its bank account in Philadelphia. The City seeks to tax these profits on the basis that Belmont is a partnership which is domiciled in Philadelphia. Belmont’s principal contention is (1) that a partnership is not an entity which can be taxed by Philadelphia, and (2) that because the domicile of the individuals who comprise the partnership is outside of Philadelphia, and none of the business or activities in question are conducted in Philadelphia, the tax cannot be assessed on these profits.</p>
