On August 12, 1953 Holland (plaintiff)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and Felir and Hahn (defendants) entered into a written bailment lease under the terms of which plaintiff was to pay defendants as rental for the grader and roller the sum of $5,100, $2,100 of which was to be paid upon execution of the lease and the balance of $3,000 to be paid in twelve monthly installments of $250 each. <em>The lease did not set forth the date of each month when the monthly installments were to be paid by plaintiff. </em>However, the lease did recite that a note was to be executed and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendants “upon the execution of [the] lease as evidence of and collateral security for the obligation to pay the rental . . .”. On the same date plaintiff executed and delivered to defendants both the lease and the note and paid $2,100, the down payment required under the terms of the lease. The note, signed by plaintiff, was payable to the order of the defendants in the amount of $3,000 and provided, inter alia, for payment by plaintiff of the $3,000 in twelve monthly installments of $250 each, “the first payment on September 12, 1953 — interest in advance $180 and on the same date of each month thereafter until fully paid . .</p>

Possibly this was an oversight on your part, and if so, we will appreciate your remittance by mail. If payment has been sent please accept our thanks and disregard this notice”. Plaintiff received this notice in tbe early evening of October 20,1953. Copies of this notice were sent by tbe bank to both defendants.

After issue joined tbe action was tried before tbe late Judge Fkack and a jury in tbe Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County. At defendant’s request, tbe jury was instructed to render, in addition to a general verdict, a special verdict on each of two issues: (a) whether tbe bank’s notice of October 19, 1955 to plaintiff constituted a waiver of any default in payment of tbe monthly installment on October 12th, 1953 and (b) whether under tbe terms of tbe lease and note plaintiff was required to make monthly payments on tbe 12th day of each month. Tbe jury returned three verdicts: (1) a general verdict for plaintiff and against defendants for $5,028.75; (2) a special verdict finding that tbe bank’s notice to <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>plaintiff did not constitute a waiver and (3) that the plaintiff was not required to make the monthly payment on the 12th day of each month.

Judge Palmer, for the court en banc, granted defendants’ motion for a new trial but did not pass upon their motion for judgment n.o.v. Plaintiff appeals from the grant of a new trial.
