The land uses permitted in this section <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>include single-family detached dwellings on lots of not less than 10,000 square feet.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b224-4" data-blocks='[["BL_224.4",224,[251,496,1146,378]]]'>In 1953, Edwards and a partner purchased for $28,-000 one and a half acres of land situated and fronting on the south side of heavily traveled Lancaster Avenue, some 1300 feet west of the City Line intersection. The normal value of this property, including a dwelling which was in a state of disrepair, was estimated at $12,000.</p>
    <p id="b224-5" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[251,894,1146,434]]]'>To the south of the Edwards’s tract are the grounds of the Lankenau Hospital and a transformer station of the Philadelphia Electric Company. To the east are apartments for hospital personnel and a Theological Seminary. Across Lancaster Avenue, to the north, lies the College of St. Charles Borromeo. Immediately to the west is a private residence, and the area beyond includes a series of single-family homes.</p>

To this end Lankenau’s board of trustees joined with Edwards in petitioning the township board of commissioners to rezone the area so as to permit such use. However, the hospital board subsequently decided to provide space for doctors’ of<a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>fices within the hospital building itself, and shortly thereafter the petition was withdrawn.</p>
    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.4",225,[189,499,1151,1046]]]'>In 1954 Edwards again petitioned the hoard of commissioners to change the zoning of his property, this time to permit the construction of an apartment house thereon. His petition was denied, and in the following year Edwards filed an application for a building permit to construct an apartment house. The building superintendent refused to issue such a permit and Edwards appealed to the board of adjustment for a variance. At the hearing, however, Edwards withdrew his application for a variance and instead took the position that the zoning ordinance as applied to his property was unconstitutional. The board therefore affirmed the action of the superintendent and Edwards took an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County. Extensive testimony was taken by the court, but the hearing judge reserved decision and properly remanded the case to the board of adjustment for consideration of whether Edwards was entitled to a variance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Edwards again appealed to the Court of Common Pleas, and after argument thereon the hearing judge affirmed the decision of the board. Appellee filed exceptions whereupon the hearing judge, speaking for the court <em>en banc, </em>reversed his earlier determination and directed that a variance be granted. From this order of the court the present appeal is taken in the name of the board of adjustment.</p>

While the commissioners of a first class township may appoint counsel to represent the board of adjustment and to defend its decisions in any appeal to court therefrom, Act of September 7, 1955, P. L. 563, 53 P.S. §58107.2, a board of adjustment has no such direct and substantial interest in the subject matter of particular litigation as would give it standing to seek appellate review. Nevertheless, although the present appeal has been taken nominally by the board of adjustment, we find that as a matter of substance the real party thereto is the Lower Merion Township.</p>

The solicitor was instructed by the township commissioners to file an appeal in the present case on behalf of the township. However, for reasons unknown, the solicitor purported to obtain review in the name of the board of adjustment.
