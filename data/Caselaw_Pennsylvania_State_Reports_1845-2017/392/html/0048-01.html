Now he is frequently parodied in books, burlesqued on the stage, caricatured in stories, and regarded lightly in programs of popular entertainment. I am happy to observe, however, that, despite this process of underestimation, the magnificent part played by the lawyer in the history <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>of civilization and progress has been so formidable that he can still command attention and respect wherever he appears — except in some courtrooms.</p>

I have reviewed records of trials where the lawyer, while conscientiously doing his duty in ably and honestly representing his client, was scolded by the judge, lampooned by the judge, screamed at by the judge, and all but eaten up by the judge in moments of Olympian wrath.</p>

I believe that whatever a judge does which represents authority should indeed be supported by the appellate courts, but when a judge departs from a position of reflective impartiality and dominates the courtroom tyranically, his actions should come under the serious scrutiny of this Court, especially if they involve a belittling of attorneys respectfully trying before him. A lawyer in the courtroom is as much entitled to courtesy from the bench as the bench is entitled to courtesy from the lawyer.</p>

Nor did the Judge wash away the damage done by this instruction by adding that his own remarks should not go out with the jury. In the case of <em>Com. v. Wood, </em><a href="/pa-super/118/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="118 Pa. Super. 269" data-case-ids="983137" data-case-paths="/pa-super/118/0269-01">118 Pa.

They may as well decry <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>the introduction of documents and the submission of photographs which illustrate the locale of the controversy. Summations are as much a part of Trial by Jury as the presentation of testimony. If a litigant believes that his antagonist has misrepresented and distorted facts, has fabricated testimony and concealed evidence, how will he express his convictions in this respect except through his attorney? The attorney is the spokesman for the client. It would be strange indeed if the attorney should talk for his client, argue for him, and fight for him before and during the trial, but when the issue reached climax on the battlefield of decision, he should fold his tent of advocacy and silently steal away. Even so, such an act of poltroonery would do no more damage to the client’s cause than to have the judge tell the jury that the cartridges fired by the attorney are all blanks and should be brushed away as idle chaff.</p>
    <p id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[234,1373,1146,376]]]'>Judges who disparage summation arguments ignore that it is in the interests of justice that the jury know the extreme positions taken by the adversaries so that they, the jury, may decide which one conforms to the standards of the law and to the precepts of morality inherent in the law, as announced and explained by the judge.</p>

After conviction he moved for a new trial, assigning as a reason therefor, inter alia, that the Trial Judge had deprived him of due process when he had instructed the jury to disregard his attorney’s plea in his behalf. The motion was refused and the Trial Judge, in his opinion sustaining the refusal, denied that he had withdrawn defense counsel’s argument from consideration by the jury because, he explained: “The Court expressly pointed out to the jury that the <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>evidence consisted of three distinct elements: the oral testimony, <em>the natural inferences of fact arising from the testimony, </em>and the physical exhibits. It occurs to us that when the trial court expressly told the jury that a part of the evidence was the natural inferences of fact, not only the oral testimony, the Court thereby expressly invited the jury to consider all of the arguments in the case, including the arguments of defendant’s attorney.” (Emphasis in original.) But the inferences arising from the testimony are something entirely different from the summation. The lawyer is not an <em>inferer. </em>He speaks plainly. He paints with a bold brush, not with faint dabs of suggestion and inference. And the canvas he presents to the jury is as much a part of Trial by Jury as an exhibit in the case.</p>
    <p id="b87-4" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[174,1220,1147,1036]]]'>But the learned Trial Judge says in his opinion that even if it were to be assumed that he may have erred in the respect indicated, the defendant would still not be entitled to a new trial because counsel made no request for clarification of the charge. The learned Trial Judge said: “He [defendant’s counsel] may not sit back, take his chance on the verdict and then complain, if it is adverse.” I have always felt that in this remark, which is often found in judicial opinions, there is as much sauce for the goose as for the gander. If the lawyer may not sit back and take a chance on the verdict, neither should the Trial Judge have the right to sit back and allow an incorrect charge to go into the jury box. If the judge actually committed an error, should it not have been as obvious to him, as to the lawyer? And if the judge responsible for the error allowed it to slip from his lips undetected, why should the lawyer be charged with having failed to catch it on his eardrums?</p>
    <p id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.5",87,[174,2280,1145,98]],["BL_88.1",88,[246,379,1146,815]]]'>The lower court refused a new trial and the defendant appealed to the Superior Court, which also refused <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>a new trial. The defendant then appealed to this Court which also affirmed the conviction and accepted the opinion of the Superior Court as its own. It echoed the statement of the lower court that the lawyer may not sit back and take a chance on the verdict. It varied the figure of speech, but not the thought, when it said: “Counsel may not remain silent and take his chance of a verdict, and then, if it is adverse, complain of matters which could have been immediately rectified.” But could the error here have been immediately rectified? An incorrect instruction can so throw the scales of justice out of balance that no hasty repair work can bring them back to that delicacy of appraisal needed in the weighing of ponderables and imponderables.</p>

They become the spilled milk of indiscretion which no sopping up can ever recover.

For counsel to have insisted that the court tell the jury that his (counsel’s) remarks were to go out with the jury would have placed him in the position of a semi-defendant himself. In effect the judge had already told the jury that counsel’s speech was unworthy of deliberation. To have argued with the judge in open court about this matter would have made a bad situation worse. Counsel would have made of himself a mendicant pleading for something that had already been cast into the limbo of the irretrievable past. Once the judge tore away counsel’s cloak of reliability before <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>the jury, a fair consideration of the case was no longer possible; and a new trial from that moment became imperative.</p>
