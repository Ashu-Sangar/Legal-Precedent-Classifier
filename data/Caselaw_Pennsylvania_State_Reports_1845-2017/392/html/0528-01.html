At approximately 12:50 a.m., on Monday morning, September 20th, Maurice Gouse was operating his automobile in an eastwardly direction towards Philadelphia and as he passed the Stony Creek Tavern his attention was directed to the breaking of glass. He looked at the Tavern building and saw two men, whom <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>he described as teenagers because of their dress and build, come through the window. He then noticed these same two individuals run to an automobile which was parked on an intersecting street near the Tavern. Gouse saw the lights of the automobile go on and the automobile start up, turn onto the Baltimore Pike, and then proceed in a westwardly direction towards Media, Pa. Gouse attempted to follow the get-away car in his own automobile, but Avas out-distanced. He then reported the incident to police officers who accompanied him to the Stony Greek Tavern and after gaining entrance, discovered the body of Roy Wunder.</p>

Gouse found a bullet on the cocktail lounge seat near the front of the barroom. This was proved to be the fatal bullet and was identified as a .38 S. &amp; W. caliber. The gun used in the killing has never been found. Gouse gave the police a description of the automobile he pursued although he was not certain of some of its characteristics. The automobile as described by Gouse has never been located. It was later discovered that entrance to the taproom Avas gained through a skylight that led into the men’s Avash-room.</p>

However, when he was informed that a murder had taken place at the Tavern, he denied any participation in the robbery.

We got a trolley car and went down to 68th and Elmwood Avenue and went into a luncheonette known as ‘Tony’s’. We met Jim Graham. He told us about a gun store out on the Baltimore Pike which we could burglarize. We stayed around there until 3:00 o’clock and then went into the center of town in Philadelphia in Jim’s car, Jim Graham driving. It was a 1950 Nash station wagon dark, I don’t know what color. We went to 13th and Market in town and hung around the Arcadia until about dusk and then went out on the Baltimore Pike and I was driving at the time and Jim Graham directed. As we were passing the tavern, Jim stated that he knew of it being robbed before or that he himself robbed it. He said that we would find a small cabinet safe inside; that he and Ryder would go in while I stayed slouched in the car. They left the car and that was the last I seen of them until I heard a sound that I cannot identify; a few minutes later the breaking of glass. Then they came running around the corner of the building and jumped in the car. I shot out, down past the light, made a right and made another right a couple blocks down, that’s the last I remember, Jim was directing. I am not familiar with the neighborhood until we finally got back to Tony’s. When me and Ryder emerged from the car, Jim keeping the gun in the car.

They are going to put you in the middle. Sergeant McCrory was sitting beside me, I believe I was handcuffed to Mr. Pitz at the time. Mr. Allen got up and said the hell with you, go burn anyway, we got one; and he walked out.

Greaves stated that he used the name Martin Davis because that was his name prior to the remarriage of his mother early in his life. However, Greaves failed to satisfactorily explain the use of the first name “Ernest” instead of “Martin”, along with the surname of “Greaves”. Greaves recalled having attended a dance with defendant and fixed the particular night in question because it was the night following a wedding attended by him and the defendant.

The first and second alleged errors are closely inter-related and will be disposed of together. Defendant contends that the lower Court erred in refusing his repeated applications for (a) a change of venue, and (b) a continuance. In support of these contentions he states that the Stony Creek <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>Tavern murder bad received a tremendous amount of publicity through newspaper articles and detective stories, thus creating undue excitement and inflammatory public opinion against him. Furthermore, he argues that he was further prejudiced through some additional publicity which resulted from some beer drinking by him and one of his co-defendants in the cell block of the courthouse during the same term of court. More importantly, he contends he was further prejudiced because an alleged confederate, James Ryder, had just been tried in the same courtroom and because the jury trying him had just retired for purposes of deliberation. To further substantiate his contentions he states: “There were 100 jurors called on voir dire and of that number, more than 60% had read about the case and 10% admitted having a preconceived opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the appellant.”</p>

It might, of course, be better if articles covering crime could be withheld from print until the case is over, but this is not the accepted manner of procedure in America. However, we are not satisfied that the defendants’ rights have been prejudiced and believe that they will have a fair trial by jurors, who do not know about the occurrence despite the publicity.”</p>

But an alibi is more that that. It is the <em>whole </em>tree, the <em>whole </em>symphony, the <em>whole </em>beach.

Is the lawyer, with all the worries of an accused man’s life on his hands to be held to a higher standard of awareness than the judge who is accepted as the repository of wisdom and the apogee of intellectual alertness? Why did not the Judge do what he said he would do? Unless the Majority can explain the Judge’s omission in this regard, it cannot in fairness convict the lawyer of omission in performance of duty.

In support of this contention the Majority cites and quotes from <em>Commonwealth v. Jordon, </em><a href="/pa/328/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="328 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1179671" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0439-01">328 Pa. 439</a>, and <em>Commonwealth v.

On the contrary, they are devastating authority to the contrary. In the <em>Jordan </em>case this Court said: “Even if not thus proved, [that is, the alibi], however, <em>the evidence in support of the alibi may, with the other facts in the case raise the reason</em>

Contrarily, his discussion on the subject produced the impelling inference that if there was anything in the world which lacked perfection, it was precisely Richardson’s alibi.</p>

This Court has spoken, on the subject many times. One of the landmarks in this respect is the case of <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Mills, <a href="/pa/350/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="350 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="461122" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0478-01">350 Pa. 478</a>, which the Majority Opinion dismisses at the door. In that case the defendant was charged with murder and his defense was an alibi. The Trial Judge charged: “While the Commonwealth is required to establish the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, all that the defendant is required to do is to establish his alibi by the fair weight or preponderance of the evidence. In other words, the evidence offered by him and his witnesses, in support of his <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>contention that he was at home, in bed, or preparing to go to bed, at the exact time that this shooting took place, must be such, in your minds as lair and reasonable men and women, that it outweighs the evidence produced by the Commonwealth.”</p>
    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[178,655,1144,375]]]'>This Court held, unanimously, that such a charge was inadequate and ordered a new trial. Chief Justice Maxey, speaking for the Court, said: “If the testimony the defendant offered in support of his alibi raised a reasonable doubt in the jurors’ minds as to the defendant’s presence at the scene of the homicide he was entitled to an acquittal.”</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[179,1045,1145,379]]]'>Nowhere in the case at bar did the Trial Judge say that the alibi of itself could raise a reasonable doubt which could entitle the defendant to an acquittal. All he said was that an alibi is a piece of strong evidence. But <em>strong </em>is a relative expression. A cat is strong as against a mouse, but in the jaws of a mastiff a cat is no stronger than the mouse was strong.</p>

Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/128/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="128 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="567100" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0500-01">128 Pa. 500</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.%20344" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="18 A. 344">18 A. 344</a>, Justice Sterrett speaking for this court, said of the charge of the lower court in that case that ‘it constitutes a full, clear and accurate statement of the law on that subject. The burden of proving it was clearly on the prisoner. If he failed to do so to the satisfaction of the jury, the alleged alibi, as a substantive defense, was valueless; but that did not deprive him of the benefit of his evidence on that subject, so far as it, <em>in connection with other testimony in the case, may have had a tendency to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.”</em>

However, it could be that in another part of the trial a question arose as to whether the Commonwealth had proved, as it contended, that the money found on the defendant was the money which had been taken from the victim of the crime. In such a case, even though the jury did not implicitly accept the alibi, the evidence on the alibi could, joined to the evidence on the money, raise a reasonable doubt which would work an acquittal. This kind of a situation could well come within the legal proposition announced by Justice Kephart (later Chief Justice) in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Barrish, </em><a href="/pa/297/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="297 Pa. 160" data-case-ids="1118168" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0160-01">297 Pa. 160</a>, namely, “Where one is accused of having committed a crime and from <em>all the proof submitted, </em>including the evidence as to the alleged alibi, a doubt exists in the jury’s mind as to whether the accused was at the scene of the homicide at the time of the commission of the crime, this may be enough to warrant acquittal because of a reasonable doubt of guilt.”</p>

Mills. </em>But the <em>New </em>case is one not to be driven from the doorstep like a vagrant. It announces a principle, which, so far as I have been able to determine, this Court has never in the past deviated from, namely, “The jury <em>must </em>also be instructed that The evidence in support of the alibi may, with other facts in the case, raise the reasonable doubt of guilt which entitles a defendant to acquittal’.”</p>

Nor was this mandate handed down in the dim and dust-covered days of an ancient past. It was said in 1946 and therefore postdates the <em>Blanchard </em>decision.
