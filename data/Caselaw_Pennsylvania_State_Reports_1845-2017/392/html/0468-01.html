Equipment Company, and (2) in the strip mining operation which they (allegedly) conducted in West Virginia, and (3) in the deep mine operation which they (allegedly) conducted. Defendants denied that plaintiff was a partner, and the Filers testified that plaintiff merely purchased a one-quarter interest in the equipment owned by the Equipment Company.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> The Filers also testified that plaintiff had been paid in full for everything owed him.</p>

It will suffice to say that we believe that the findings of fact and conclusions made by the Chancellor and confirmed by the Court en banc, to wit, that plaintiff did not purchase and did not by any agreement, oral or written, acquire a one-quarter interest in a partnership with the defendants in a strip mining or deep mining operation, are supported by adequate evidence. However, with respect to a partnership in the equipment of the S. &amp; F. Equipment Company, we believe the evidence was sufficient to <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>establish a partnership interest therein, and that the conclusion of the lower Conrt to the contrary cannot be sustained.
