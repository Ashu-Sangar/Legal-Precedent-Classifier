Even in applying permissible standards, officers of a State cannot exclude an applicant when there is no basis for their finding that he fails to meet these standards, or when their action is invidiously discriminatory.” In a Concurring Opinion, joined in by Justices Clark and Harlan, Justice Frankfurter wrote: “Refusal to allow a man to qualify himself for the profession on a wholly arbitrary standard or on a consideration that offends the dictates of reason offends the Due Process Clause.” (p. 249).</p>

But more startling than that is the idea that the State can regulate the size <em>of lobsters. </em>The size <em>of </em>lobsters is left pretty much to the parental solicitude of Mother Nature and Father Time. I presume that in speaking of lobsters, the learned Chancellor was referring to the Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, section 699.7, added May 21, 1943, P.L. 281, section 1, which provides: “Whoever captures, takes or has in his possession, any lobster measuring less than three and one-eighth inches (3%") from the rear of the eye socket along a line parallel to the center line of the body shell (carapace) to the rear end of the body shell (carapace) shall, upon conviction thereof in a summary proceeding, be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding fifty dollars ($50) and in default of the payment of such fine and costs shall be sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding thirty (30) days.” But what the capturing or carrying in one’s pocket or other receptacle of a lobster measuring less than 3%" from rear orbicular socket to posterior carapace has to do with practising law in the courts of Philadelphia, the Chancellor did not specify.</p>

Stephen Kovrak has not been disbarred by any Court, he has not even been charged with misconduct, no one has complained that he lacks in professional equipment and moral character, and yet he is being deprived of his profession, he is enjoined from announcing what is true, namely, that he is a lawyer, that he is a proctor, that he is an attorney at <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>law — all duly certified to by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, over which the Court of Common Pleas or this Court has no jurisdiction whatsoever.</p>

But the practice of the law is not limited to the trial of cases in court. In fact, it is generally known that no trial lawyer, even the most active practitioner, in point of hours, spends as much time before Court and Jury as he must devote to his office. A lawyer does not practise law in a vacuum. In order to prepare for trial, he must have an office in which to meet with his client and witnesses and, if necessary to confer with opposing lawyers.</p>
    <p id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.6",184,[244,1854,1145,479]]]'>It cannot be questioned that Kovrak is authorized by law to offer advice in connection with Federal matters. Where is he to offer this advice? Since the injunction denies him the right to have an office, the only place where he could counsel with those seeking his assistance would be on the street and in the public square. And would this comport with the dignity which should always go with a member of the bar of a United States Court?</p>

    <p id="b185-4" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[182,662,1148,1105]]]'>One of the most difficult steering processes in legal navigation is to hold to the channel of a definitive issue. Consequently, it does not help us in the review of an adjudicated cause if the fact-finding tribunal decides against a party on an approved principle of law which that party does not controvert. Kovrak does not ask for the right to practice law in the State courts, or even to practise State law, neither of which, of course, he is entitled to do. What he does ask for is that this Court reverse the decision of the Court of Common Pleas which has enjoined him from exercising his right to practise law in the manner befitting a member of the bar of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Supreme Court of the United States when those tribunals under their awesome seals have certified that he does possess that right. Since this Court refuses to do what is so obviously required of it by the undisputed documents in the case I cannot possibly agree with the Majority’s decision and I, accordingly, dissent.</p>
