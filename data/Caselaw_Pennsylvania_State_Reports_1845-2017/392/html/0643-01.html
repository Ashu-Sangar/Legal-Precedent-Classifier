Specifically, we have before us in this case the consideration of a law enacted by the Legislature which prohibits merchants of eyeglasses from advertising the selling price of their wares. This would seem, it is repeated, to be an abridgement on the prerogative of a businessman to market his merchandise in accordance with his judgment as to what constitutes good business for himself.

Thus, automobile manufacturers are required to install certain safety features on their mechanical creations, food dispensers must submit their goods to government tests for wholesomeness and salubrity, farmers may not sell milk and butter without meeting established standards of purity. The statute under consideration here is the Act of May 18,1956, which is an amendment to section 9 of the Act of March 30, 1917, P. L. 21, 63 P.S. §237. Section 2 of the amendment reads: “No person, firm or corporation engaged in or connected with the retail sale or dispensing of frames, mountings, lenses, spectacles or eyeglasses used for ophthalmic purposes shall include in any advertising whether by newspaper, magazine, radio, television, signs, displays, or by any other means, the price or prices of the products used for ophthalmic purposes ...”</p>

Is competition not the life of trade? But the statute of 1956 must be read in conjunction with the statute of 1917, of which, as already stated, it is an amendment. The preamble of that Act reads: “Whereas, The eyesight of the citizens of this Commonwealth is endangered by incompetent persons practicing optometry, and due regard for the safety and protection of the citizens demands that only authorized and qualified optometrists shall be permitted to practice optometry: . . .”</p>

Parts 231, as follows: “The practice of optometry is hereby defined to be the employment of any means or methods, other than the use of drugs or surgery, for the examination of the human eye and the analysis of ocular functions, or the prescribing, providing, furnishing, adapting or employing any or all kinds and types of lenses and prisms, visual training orthoptics, ocular exercises, and any and all preventive and corrective methods for the aid, correction or relief of the human eye, its associated structures, appendages and functions, other than the use of drugs or surgery.”</p>

Ullom, trading as <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>Price Optical Co., says that it is not. Ullom, who is a dispensing optician engaged in the preparation and sales of lenses, frames and glasses, contends that this legislation offends against Article I, Sections 1, 7 and 9 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania as well as the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that “it impairs the plaintiff’s right of freedom of speech,” and “constitutes an unauthorized exercise of the police power by arbitrary interference with private business and the imposition of unusual, oppressive, discriminatory and unnecessary restrictions upon a lawful occupation.” He asserts further that the enforcement of the Act of 1956 has caused him to suffer immediate and irreparable injury. He sought and obtained a temporary injunction in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County against the enforcement of the Act by the State Board of Optometrical Examiners of the Department of Public Instruction. The court, however, later dissolved the injunction and dismissed the complaint. The plaintiff appealed.</p>

This Court has already decided that the original Act of 1917 regulating the practice of optometry is a valid exercise of the police power of the State and does not contravene the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Act of 1956 is an extension of the police power on the same subject. If the State may regulate the practice of optometry, as it may; and if it may regulate the manufacture and sale of ophthalmic glasses, an inevitable sequence of optometry, which, of course, it may also do; and if the fitting of those <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>glasses into suitable frames is part of tbe operation of preparing glasses to make them usable — it is inescapable that the State may regulate the manufacture and sale of frames, mountings, lenses, etc. used for ophthalmic purposes. Having conceded that much, it follows that insofar as advertising may have a direct bearing on the quality of lenses, frames, mountings, etc., the State may regulate <em>that </em>also.</p>
    <p id="b682-4" data-blocks='[["BL_682.4",682,[220,820,1148,1315]]]'>All those who have had any experience with eyeglasses, and, after a certain age has been reached, that number embraces the vast majority of the educated citizens of the State, know that an improper fitting or frame to glasses can destroy the therapeutic value of the prescribed lenses. Glasses which do not obey the axis prescribed by the optometrist or which tilt at an inaccurate angle can do as much damage to the wearer as striking one’s eye against a door. It must be assumed that the Legislature had in mind these possibilities when it enacted legislation on the subject of eyeglasses. The grinding of lenses requires a steady hand, an accurate eye and unflagging attention. The naked unground glass which is applied to the emery wheel must be of the highest quality. The combination of excellent material and superb skill can be and is costly. It is, therefore, not conducive to optical health that artisans preparing lenses for the public should be required to stay within unwholesome restrictions in order to meet certain cost standards which are set so that the owner of the business may undersell competitors who do not employ advertising. To fit inferior lenses to an already weakened or bruised organ of sight is like supporting a cripple with papier-mache crutches.</p>

In doing this, the Pennsylvania legislature did not enter into an untrodden field of State regulation. Many other States have felt called upon to restrain merchants in the exercise of their natural inclination to proclaim what they regarded as the excellence of their commodities, where the eyesight of the citizens of the State was involved. Thus, the Supreme Court of Louisiana, passing on a question similar to the one before us in this litigation, said in the case of <em>State v. </em>Rones, <a href="/la/223/0839-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="223 La. 839" data-case-ids="3142904,9910440" data-case-paths="/la/223/0839-01,/so2d/67/0099-01">223 La. 839</a>, <a href="/so2d/67/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="67 So. 2d 99" data-case-ids="9910440" data-case-paths="/so2d/67/0099-01">67 So. 2d 99</a>: “The Courts of other states have had occasion to consider the validity of statutes regulating the advertising by retail dealers of eyeglasses. . . . We are in accord with the views of those upholding such statutes. These courts have decided that the statutes are a reasonable exercise of the police power because they prevent ‘bait advertising’ which attracts the unwary to purchase inferior glasses; eliminate the temptation to, and the pressure upon, customers that result from the assurance that no more than a named price will be charged; protect an uncau-tious and unwary public from being misled and deceived; prevent the increase in sales and the incidental harm that come from unfitted eyeglasses; eliminate to some extent poor quality and poor workmanship which naturally result from the desire to sell spectacles in quantity at a low advertised price for the purpose of underselling competitors.”</p>

But an eyeglass frame is not used in isolation, as Judge Mtjrbah said in dissent below; it is used with lenses; and lenses, pertaining as they do to the human eye, enter the field of health. Therefore, the legislature might conclude that to regulate one effectively it would have to regulate the other. <em>Or it might conclude that both the sellers of frames cund the sellers of lenses were in a business lohere advertising should be limited or even abolished in the public interest. </em>Semler v. Dental Examiners, supra (<a href="/us/294/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="294 U.S. 608" data-case-ids="3924242" data-case-paths="/us/294/0608-01">294 U. S. 608</a>). The advertiser of frames may be using his ads to bring in customers who will buy lenses. If the advertisement of lenses is to be abolished or controlled, the advertising of frames must come under the same restraints; or so the legislature might think.
