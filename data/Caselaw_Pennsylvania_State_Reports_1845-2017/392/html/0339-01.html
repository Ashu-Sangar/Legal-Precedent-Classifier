A settlement of this tax was made by the Department of Revenue on November 9, 1954 in the amount of $153,270.35 and approved by the Department of the Auditor General on November 15, 1954. However, in its return the taxpayer did not report as gross receipts the proceeds from the disposition of United States securities in the amount of $4,226,-380 and from the disposition of other securities in the amount of $76,769.25. Upon the discovery of this omission, and within two years of the settlement of November 9, 1954 as required by the statute, the Department of Revenue on March 1, 1956 resettled the company’s tax, adding the gross proceeds of its securities to the numerator and the denominator of the gross receipts fraction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The tax as resettled amounted to $156,456.22 or an increase of $3,849.85 over the amount previously determined to be due under the settlement of November 9, 1954.

The Court held that the interest rate provided by the above statute applied to taxes levied and uncollected prior to the effective date of the •statute. In <em>Malicies’ Petition, </em>the provision stated: (Act of July 2, 1937) “ ‘Whenever any county has heretofore filed, in the office of the prothonotary of the, proper county, any tax lien or tax liens, and the said county has not, within the period of five years after the date on which any such tax lien was filed or last revived, filed a suggestion of nonpayment and an averment of default to revive the same, then, in any such -case, any such county may, within six months after the final enactment of this act, file a suggestion of nonpayment and an averment of default on any such tax lien for the revival thereof; and such suggestion of nonpayment, and averment of default so entered, shall constitute a valid revival of such lien, and be a lien 'upon the real estate upon which it was a lien at the time the lien was first filed, and said lien may be revived or further revived and collected as other tax ■liens are revived and collectedIt was held that ■a county following the quoted procedure could revive a tax lien against a property where the lien had been ■allowed to lapse prior to the statute’s effective date. <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>There are numerous factors distinguishing the ■clause involved in the present case from the provisions held to be retroactive in both the <em>Specie </em>case and <em>Ma-udes’ Petition. </em>In the <em>Specie </em>case, there was a specific clause, the sole purpose of which was to show the intention of the Legislature that the Act was to be construed retroactively. In addition to the use of the word “heretofore”, the clause specifically stated’ that “All of the provisions . . . shall apply to <em>all </em>taxes . . ■It is obvious that “heretofore” as used in a specific clause relating only to the time that the statute is intended to encompass, and viewed in conjunction with the italicized words, is vastly different from its use in the clause involved in this case. Finally, the Act as •applied retroactively in the <em>Specie </em>case operated on all taxpayers equally, and did not favor one class .over another.</p>

As was stated on p. 142- of that opinion: “. . .

This rule, however, has no application to the statute we are here considering. It belongs- to the class known as remedial, curative or validating legislation. Aside from the question of its application to pending litigation, this act is, by its very nature, one which 'applies retroactively in that, upon the occurrence of, or compliance with, certain, conditions, it .authorizes the revival and collection of tax liens any county .had failed to keep alive. . . .” The Court did not conclude that the statute was retroactive because thé term <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>“heretofore” was used, but because it was apparent from the language of the entire statute that the Legislature intended the statute to be remedial, and thus retroactive.</p>

The provision states: “. . . For the purpose of this section, gross receipts shall not include receipts heretofore or hereafter received from the sale, redemption ... of securities . . .” It is readily apparent that the parties to this proceeding advocate two different interpretations of the above clause. Taxpayer argues that the clause should be read as “. . . gross receipts shall not include [heretofore or hereafter, that is, in any prior or future taxable year] receipts received”. In effect, taxpayer contends that “heretofore or hereafter” refer to and modify “include” and were inserted by the Legislature to show the period of time during which the receipts in question should not be includible as gross receipts. <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>It then urges that since “heretofore” is generally construed as referring to a period of time prior to the effective date of the Act, that the receipts should not have been considered as gross receipts at any time, without limit, prior to January 1, 1956. On the other hand, the Attorney General argues that the clause should he read as “. . . gross receipts shall not include [in the taxable year 1956 and thereafter] receipts, heretofore or hereafter received”. He, in effect, maintains that “heretofore or hereafter” refer to and modify only the word “received”, and that the words “shall not include” refer only to the time when the tax shall become due, and should be controlled by the express effective date provision of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b381-3" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[190,1153,1149,1214]]]'>If the taxpayer’s interpretation were adopted it is obvious that the provision would <em>retroactively </em>operate unequally on two classes of taxpayers. Taxpayers whose fiscal offices are located outside the Commonwealth would have the proceeds from the disposition of securities removed from the denominator of the gross receipts fraction, thus increasing their taxes. On the other hand, taxpayers, such as the one in the instant case, whose fiscal offices are located within the Commonwealth, would have the proceeds from the disposition of securities removed from both the numerator and the denominator, thus reducing their taxes. The former class of taxpayers who would be subjected to increased taxes for prior years would undoubtedly contend, inter alia, that such retroactive construction would be unconstitutional under Article III, Section 3 of the Pennsylvania Constitution because there was nothing in the title of the Act to indicate a retroactive operation of the enactment. It is extremely unlikely that the Legislature intended the quoted clause to operate in this manner, and if it did, we think it would have expressly so provided.</p>

Moreover, the interpretation advocated by him is supported by a literal reading of the provision, while to uphold the taxpayer’s contention that “heretofore” refers to “include” requires a rephrasing of the clause as enacted by the Legislature.</p>

We are presently concerned with the appellant’s corporate net income tax for 1953. The tax for that year and the settlement thereof was controlled by the Corporate Net Income Tax Act as reenacted and amended by the Act of July 20, 1953, P. L. 534.
