    <p id="b300-9" data-blocks='[["BL_300.10",300,[226,992,1145,378]]]'>The court below dismissed the petition of Harry M. Parks, appellant, for leave to file a complaint in trespass against the borough for damages for injuries sustained through the borough’s negligence. The court’s action was based on appellant’s failure to give notice to the borough as required by the Act of 1937, P. L. 2547, 53 PS §5301.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b300-10" data-blocks='[["BL_300.11",300,[224,1384,1146,373]]]'>The plaintiff alleged that he was injured as he fell at a crosswalk on an alley in Clarion borough; that a downspout from the adjacent building allowed water to go over the crosswalk, causing ice to form; and that as a result of his fall his hip was broken and he was hospitalized in the Brookville Hospital and the Veterans’ Hospital at Erie.</p>
    <p id="b300-11" data-blocks='[["BL_300.12",300,[225,1772,1141,99]],["BL_301.1",301,[193,357,1145,482]]]'>The accident was witnessed by William Jones, a part-time employe of the borough, who saw plaintiff <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>fall on the alley and carried Mm to tbe doctor’s office adjacent thereto. Within two or three weeks thereafter, Jones reported to William Shingledecker, — who then and on the date of the accident was the borough street commissioner, — that he had seen the accident; and he explained it to him. Shingledecker acknowledged to Jones that he knew about the accident, and that he also knew that plaintiff had been hospitalized as a result.</p>
    <p id="b301-3" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[193,861,1145,657]]]'>Some time after the accident, but before the expiration of six months and while plaintiff was in the hospital at Erie, plaintiff’s wife met the Clarion County district attorney in the courthouse. She told him that she could not pay the hospital bills herself, and asked him what should be done. He gratuitously advised her not to “put in a bill” to the borough until plaintiff returned home; and stated to her that plaintiff Avould have a year within which to present it to the municipality. Mrs. Parks relied upon this conversation and, while the year was elapsing, did nothing. None of the foregoing has been controverted by defendant.</p>
    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[193,1531,1145,434]]]'>The mere circumstance that the attorney’s advice was gratuitously given does not affect plaintiff’s status. It mxist be realized that district attorneys in smaller counties are constantly called upon gratuitously to advise people on non-criminal matters. These district attorneys heed such requests. This case stands as though the district attorney had been employed and paid.</p>

It is to be noted also that in the <em>Zade </em>case those having knowledge of the accident were the township commissioners.</p>

      <p id="b302-8" data-blocks='[["BL_302.7",302,[232,1874,1145,455]]]'> We may add that the plaintiff strongly claims that the defendant borough was insured, and cites a copy of letter written by the plaintiff’s attorney to the borough. The defendant claims that this letter was not offered in evidence, although a copy is attached to the record of the testimony. Regardless of that fact, we venture the opinion that the better way to try these cases is for the plaintiff to file a complaint, and then when defendant makes an appropriate motion that the Act is not complied with, to go into the matter of whether the municipality is insured.
