The rationale of the rule lay in the bounden duty of a public charity as a trustee to apply its funds in furtherance of its beneficent purpose. As declared by this court in 1888 in <em>Fire Insurance Patrol v. Boyd, </em>supra, — “A public charity, whether incorporated or not, is but a trustee, and is bound to apply its funds in furtherance of the charity and not otherwise. This doctrine is hoary with antiquity and prevails alike in this country and in England where it originated as early as the reign of Edward Y, and it was announced in the Year Book of that period.”</p>

      <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>However, the doctrine has since been abandoned in England and in a number of American jurisdictions. The confused status of the decisions among the various jurisdictions was well epitomized by Mr. Justice Rutledge, then of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in <em>President and Directors of Georgetown College v. Hughes, </em><a href="/f2d/130/0810-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="130 F.2d 810" data-case-ids="1154471" data-case-paths="/f2d/130/0810-01">130 F. 2d 810</a>, 812, as follows: “Paradoxes of principle, fictional assumptions of fact and consequence, and confused results characterize judicial disposition of these claims. From full immunity, through varied but inconsistent qualifications to general responsibility is the gamut of decision. The cases are almost riotous with dissent. Reasons are even more varied than results.” Nonetheless, the law on this subject in Pennsylvania is clear. Charitable institutions are not subject to liability for tort. It is that rule which the appellants would have us now abandon by court decision.</p>

Pittsburgh, </em>supra, in which the opinions for both the majority and the minority were agreed that the rule should remain as heretofore short of legislative change. Mr. Chief Justice Steen, speaking for the majority, said that, “notwithstanding the violent criticisms that have been directed by academic legal writers against the doctrine of the immunity of charitable organizations from tort liability, and notwithstanding also the fact that there is considerable conflict in the judicial decisions on the subject among the several States, our own Commonwealth has, from the earliest times, stood firm in its adherence to the principle of immunity.” The majority opinion further pertinently stated that “If and when there is to be any change in the doctrine of the immunity of charitable institutions from tort liability, it ought to be effected, not by the courts, but by the legislature, which is, of <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>course, the ultimate tribunal to determine public policy.” The dissenter in the <em>Bond </em>case likewise recognized that “The doctrine of immunity of charities has in recent years been recurrently criticized as outmoded, unrealistic, illogical, inconsistent and not in public interest, but nevertheless . . . agree [d] with the majority that the principle is now too firmly imbedded in our law to be removed except by legislation . . .</p>
    <p id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[237,813,1146,1155]]]'>A rule of non-liability, even though judge-made, that has become as firmly fixed in the law of this State as has the charitable immunity from tort liability, should not be abrogated otherwise than by a statute made to operate prospectively. If the rule were to be abandoned by court decision, it would lay open to liability all charities for their torts of the past that were not barred by the statute of limitations at the time of the rendition of the rescinding decision. The injustice of such an imposition of liability upon charities that theretofore had a right to rely on the rule of immunity is readily apparent. Whereas, if and when the rule is abrogated prospectively, which the legislature could provide, all charities then made subject to tort liability for the future could protect themselves by appropriate insurance. Moreover, whether, in this day of traffic hazards from automotive vehicles of charities as well as of all others, the rule as to charitable immunity should be rescinded poses a question of public policy which falls peculiarly within the competence of the legislature.</p>

From time to time we have seen that a doctrine for which the Commonwealth stood firmly, was later proved to have a defective foundation and it finally collapsed in spite of the firm support of this Court. Thus for many decades it was the law in Pennsylvania that no recovery was possible where the plaintiff, in a railroad accident, could not specifically prove the defect in the railroad equipment which had brought about the damage of which he complained. In 1913 in the case of <em>Bradley v. Lake Shore and Michigan, </em><a href="/pa/238/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="238 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="991536" data-case-paths="/pa/238/0315-01">238 Pa. 315</a>, the plaintiff was struck by an iron brake bar which flew from a railroad train as he, an intending passenger, was waiting for a train. He brought an action in trespass against the railroad company but was nonsuited. This Court upheld the nonsuit with the rather unique explanation that the plaintiff was a victim of an “accident pure and simple.” What is any negligence case but the result of an accident pure and simple? Forty years later, in the case of <em>Mack v. Reading, </em><a href="/pa/377/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="377 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="1249540" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0135-01">377 Pa. 135</a>, this Court acknowledged that <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>no trespass ease can be disposed of with the meager and naked statement that the plaintiff was injured in an “accident pure and simple.” On March 22, 1954, by a unanimous decision, we repudiated the doctrine and the supposed <em>stare decisis </em>of the <em>Bradley </em>case.

      <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>It is argued that a successful lawsuit against a charitable hospital might endanger its financial standing. The man who has a legitimate action against a railroad company is allowed to recover even though the payment of a resulting verdict might bankrupt the railroad. It is for the railroad company to decide how it shall pay. It is not for the court to weigh the benefit to the railroad company’s victim against the possible curtailment of train service. The curtailment of train service is something to be considered by other agencies of government. The same is true of hospitals. If payment of damages reduces services offered by a hospital it is for the hospital authorities to devise ways and means of obtaining the funds required for the continuing and efficient functioning of the hospital. It is also a matter of community responsibility. In fact that very responsibility has been recognized everywhere in America. Legislatures approve appropriations for hospitals, community fund drives collect money for hospitals, generous testators leave splendid legacies of money to hospitals.</p>

Nor can it sensibly be feared, although it has indeed been so <em>argued, </em>that if hospitals are compelled to liquidate damage claims this will mean an increase in causes for lawsuits. It cannot reasonably be contended that with the overruling of the immunity doctrine, patients will throw themselves from their beds, burn themselves with X-ray machines, rip off bandages, break plaster of Paris casts, and take the wrong medicine in order to further disable themselves and thus collect money damages. No sane person would prefer money to a sane and healthy body, free of pain, agony, and torment.</p>

This surely can not be offered as a sound reason for immunity. There is nothing in the history of the times which would suggest that hospitals, in company with the butcher, baker, and candlestick maker, would hesitate to increase rates to meet pecuniary responsibilities in this regard or any regard. But hospitals would not need to increase their rates exorbitantly. Insurance coverage would considerably lessen the burden of meeting damage verdicts. Justice Rutledge of the U. S.

Furthermore, practitioners know that many charities have voluntarily undertaken to purchase liability insurance in which the insurer agrees not to plead the defense of charitable immunity. Other charities have taken out insurance against liability without such agreement in anticipation of a change in the law.
