    <blockquote id="b304-6" data-blocks='[["BL_304.8",304,[251,754,1147,430]]]'>“It is hardly open to dispute that the appellant is conducting a prohibited business enterprise in a residential zone. He uses the barn on the premises as the headquarters of the business of repairing and maintaining pumps, he has a telephone in the office in the barn and maintains a full time secretary there, he has an inventory of $20,000 in parts and has two machines which he uses in his business set up in the barn.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b304-8" data-blocks='[["BL_304.10",304,[249,1533,1146,206]]]'>“1. That since the business of the appellant has no reasonable relationship to the public health, safety and morals, the Board of Adjustment had no discretion in the matter and should have granted the variance.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b304-9" data-blocks='[["BL_304.11",304,[247,1753,1145,265]]]'>“2. That since the appellant’s business had no reasonable relationship to the public health, safety or morals, the Zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to said business for it deprived appellant of his property without due process of law.</blockquote>

The very essence of Zoning is the designation of certain areas for different use purposes. Business may not encroach on residential areas except through the medium of a special exception or variance. The conditions under which a variance can be granted are fully set <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>forth in the Springfield Zoning Ordinance and the enabling Act.</blockquote>

The statutory law of zoning would be replaced by the law of nuisance. We will discuss the element of the public welfare when we consider appellant’s second contention.</blockquote>

It is in the interest of public welfare that land in a community be used and developed in an orderly manner in accordance with a comprehensive plan.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[173,1364,1146,487]]]'>“By its very nature zoning impinges upon the right of a land owner to use his land in any way that he desires so long as he does not unduly interfere with his neighbor’s right to use and enjoy his land. To this extent, zoning imposes a hardship on every land owner subject to the provisions of a zoning ordinance. It is a hardship, however, made necessary by considerations of the public welfare and is imposed by virtue of the police power.</blockquote>

He knew or should have known that a business use was prohibited even though that use did not disturb or interfere with his neighbors. If we were to hold that the Zoning Ordinance of Springfield Township was unconstitutional as applied to the appellant’s property, then we would throw every zone open to prohibited uses if it could be shown that the prohibited <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>use did not offend against the public health, safety or morals, and we would in effect put an end to all zoning.</blockquote>
