    <p id="b256-6" data-blocks='[["BL_256.8",256,[260,693,1146,378]]]'>Farmers’ Northern Market Company filed a complaint to qniet title to the right to the nse of an alley 12 feet wide which was part of the land owned by plaintiff. Defendants, whose property abuts the alley, claimed an irrevocable right to use the alley and to maintain a fire escape overhanging the alley which they acquired by prescription.</p>
    <p id="b256-7" data-blocks='[["BL_256.9",256,[256,1084,1148,920]]]'>Plaintiff<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> is the owner of a market house property (which has since been abandoned for market purposes), situate on the northwest corner of North Queen Street and West Walnut Street and extends the length of the block to Market Street, in the City of Lancaster. Plaintiff bought the property in 1872, prior to which time it was an inn property. A strip of land approximately 12 feet wide has been used as an alley or passageway by defendants and their predecessors in title or the public, for approximately 83 years. It extends along the whole length of the market house along the back of the market house from North Queen Street to Market Street. The building on defendants’ property is set back about 2 feet from their property line and thus creates a 2 feet wide strip which appears to be part of the alley, but as to which the Market Company asserts no claim.</p>

Defendants concede that they failed to prove that they had maintained the fire escape which <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>overhangs the alley, for 21 years. The issue on this appeal, therefore, boils down to the question of whether defendants had acquired a right to the use of the 12 feet wide alley by adverse user for over 21 years.</p>

Accordingly, the use must be such as to indicate that it is claimed as a right and is not the effect of indulgence or anything short of a grant: Gibbs v.
