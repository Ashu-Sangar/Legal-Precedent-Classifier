The appellees, by preliminary objections, raised the defense that under a provision of the written lease appellants had waived any right to recover damages arising from any negligent conduct on the part of the appellees in connection with maintenance of the apartment house. A motion for judgment on the pleadings having been filed, the court below entered a judgment for appellees and against appellants. From the entry of that judgment this appeal was taken.</p>

The language of the lease throughout clearly evidences that when the word “premises” is employed by the parties in reference to the appellants’ apartment it is either preceded or followed by a word or words of description or modification such as “demised” and “leased”.</p>

The defendants take a contrary position, arguing that the word “premises” was not intended to be restricted to the plaintiffs’ apartment but that it applied to the entire building.
