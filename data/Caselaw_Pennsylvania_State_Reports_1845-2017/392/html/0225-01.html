The defendant, L. <em>&amp; </em>IT. Stores, Inc., in Chester, Pennsylvania, which had been selling plaintiff Mathieson’s products, was not one of the dealers who had entered into such a contract. L. &amp; H. Stores, Inc., was informed by the plaintiff, however, that it was nevertheless bound by the terms of the contracts negotiated by the plaintiff with the other dealers. The defendant ignored this notice and sold ammunition for prices less than those marked on the boxes.</p>

    <p id="b261-3" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[172,487,1150,1221]]]'>It might seem at first blush that the equities of the case are with the defendant because inherently it should have the right to sell its own goods at such prices as it pleases. However, there is more to the picture than what seems to meet the eye and reason. On June 5, 1935, the General Assembly placed on the statute boohs what is known as the Fair Trade Act ( P. L. 268; 73 PS §7, et seq.) which permits dealers to agree with producers of commodities not to sell except at prices promulgated by the producers. The Act declares it to be “unfair competition” for a dealer to cut prices below those thus agreed upon even though the dealer is not a party to the price-congealing contract. Section 2 of the Act specifically says: “Wilfully and knowingly advertising, offering for sale, or selling any commodity at less than the price stipulated in any contract entered into pursuant to the provisions of section one of this act, <em>whether the person so advertising, offering for sale, or selling is, or is not, a party to such contract, </em>is unfair competition and is actionable at the suit of such vendor, buyer or purchaser of such commodity.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

This contention overlooks one of the important reasons behind the enactment of the Federal Trade Agreements Act, namely, to protect a manufacturer’s good will, created or enlarged by the employment of certain trade marks and brand names which have become recognized and accepted as symbols of a certain standard of value, quality, and merchantability. The Supreme Court of the United States addressed itself to this very principle in the case of <em>Old Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagram Distillers Corp., </em><a href="/us/299/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="299 U.S. 183" data-case-ids="5721451" data-case-paths="/us/299/0183-01">299 U.S. 183</a>, where it said: “Generally speaking (state court decisions) sustained contracts standardizing the price at which ‘identified’ commodities subsequently might be sold, where the price standardization is primarily effected to protect the good will created or enlarged by the identifying mark or brand. . . Good will is a valuable contributing aid to business — sometimes the most valuable contributing asset of the producer or distributor of commodities. And distinctive trademarks, labels and brands, are legitimate aids to the creation or enlargement of such good will. It is well settled that the proprietor of the good will ‘is entitled to protection as against one who attempts to deprive him of the benefits resulting from the same, by using his labels and trade mark without his consent and authority.’ McLean v. Fleming, <a href="/us/96/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="96 U.S. 245" data-case-ids="3382050" data-case-paths="/us/96/0245-01">96 U.S. 245</a>, 252, [<a href="/us/96/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="96 U.S. 245" data-case-ids="3382050" data-case-paths="/us/96/0245-01">24 L. Ed. 828</a>, 831]. ‘Courts afford redress or relief upon the ground that a party has a valuable interest in the good-will of his trade or business, and in the trade-marks adopted to maintain and extend it.’ Hanover Mill<a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>ing Co. v. Metcalf, <a href="/us/240/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="240 U.S. 403" data-case-ids="3690148" data-case-paths="/us/240/0403-01">240 U.S. 403</a>, 412, [<a href="/us/240/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="240 U.S. 403" data-case-ids="3690148" data-case-paths="/us/240/0403-01">60 L.

The ownership of the good will, we repeat, remains unchanged, notwithstanding the commodity has been parted with. Section 2 of the act does not prevent a purchaser of the commodity bearing the mark from selling the commodity alone at any price he pleases. It interferes only when he sells with the aid of the good will of the vendor; and it interferes then only to protect that good will against injury. <em>It proceeds upon the theory that the sale of identified goods at less than the price fixed by the owner of the marie or brand is an assault upon the good will, and constitutes what the statute denominates ‘unfaÁ/r competition.' </em>. . . There is a great body of fact and opinion tending to show that price cutting by retail dealers is not only injurious to the good will and business of the producer and distributor of identified goods, but injurious to the general public as well.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

The enjoined dealer argued that the manufacturer was not being damaged but in fact was being benefited by what he was doing, since the selling of the perfume in smaller quantities stimulated sales.

Plaintiff apparently takes the view that if its perfume is widely used in the market to which defendant caters, it will lose its prestige in that market to which plaintiff addresses its sales appeal. . . Plaintiff, shoAving that it has been damaged by defendant’s actions in so selling its perfumes below the ‘stipulated price’ per ounce or fraction thereof, invokes the Pair Trade Act of this Commonwealth and asks a court of equity to vindicate against defendant the rights plaintiff claims that Act gives it. The court below decided that plaintiff was entitled to the relief it sought. With the court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law we agree.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

But the test <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>of the application of the Fair Trade Act is not predicated on these arguments even assuming all of them to be built upon fact. The Supreme Court said in the <em>Old Dearborn Distributing Co. </em>case, supra, that the sale of the goods “at less than the price fixed by the owner of the mark or brand is an assault upon the good will, and constitutes what the statute denominates ‘unfair competition.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b265-3" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[164,837,1149,591]]]'>The defendant contends further that the plaintiff may not single it out for injunctive penalization while it allows other offenders to go unpunished. In effect it seeks to invoke the “clean hands” doctrine, and in this connection it calls attention to the Act of May 25, 1956 (P.L. 1756). Without conceding that that Act would apply to the facts in this case, it is enough to point out that it post dates the filing of the complaint in equity. Moreover the record does not show that the plaintiff in any way discriminated against the defendant.</p>
