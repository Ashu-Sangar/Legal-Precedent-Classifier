Plaintiff, who is the appellant, brought a complaint in equity against her brother, Max Korr, and Florence Korr, widow of her brother Leon Korr, individually and as executrix of Leon’s estate. She prayed for an accounting of certain partnership assets pursuant to a partnership agreement entered into by her in 1937, and for a statutory dissolution of the partnership.</p>

Plaintiff thereupon filed an amended complaint in wdiich she joined her husband, Nathan Silver, as a party defendant, and averred further facts in an attempt to overcome the bar of laches.</p>

Plaintiff further alleged (1) that another brother, Leon, who, as above mentioned, is now deceased, <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>entered the business in 1942 and became a partner in 1944, and that the partnership of 1937 was either dissolved without notice to her or is still in existence; (2) that the interest of Esther Korr was purchased by the partnership in 1946; (3) that plaintiff received $5 to $10 per week from the partnership for the first feAV months in 1937 and has received nothing since that time, despite frequent demands and promises beginning in 1944, repeated in 1946, and in 1952; (4) that since December 30, 1944, the enterprise has been conducted either by Max Korr or by Leon Korr or by Max Korr and Florence Korr, widow of Leon Korr, or by a partnership consisting of Max Korr, Leon Korr or Florence Korr, individually and/or as executrix of Leon’s estate, and by <em>Nathan Silver, her husband.</em>
