Thus, in relating the facts, we must take as a verity the believable evidence of the Commonwealth; and so considered, we have the following: At approximately 8:30 P.M., on the evening of June 14, 1957, Louis Turk died as a result of being shot in the arm and back, while standing in the yard of his home in <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>Young Township, Indiana County. Shortly after noon, of the same day, defendant had gone to the deceased’s home and asked for him. The victim’s wife informed defendant that he was working in the field. The defendant talked to her for about fifteen minutes, during which time he stated that he wanted to take her and the victim for a ride. He then left, presumably to return to his home, which was across the road from the Turk home and some 235 feet distant therefrom.</p>
    <p id="b594-4" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[254,873,1155,1481]],["BL_595.1",595,[145,381,1147,923]]]'>The victim’s son and daughter-in-law, John and Dorothy Turk, lived next door to the double house owned by the victim and occupied on one side by George Horn and on the other side by the defendant. At approximately 5:15 defendant approached the victim’s son, John Turk, who was then working in his garden, and proceeded to be quarrelsome and abusive toward him and his wife, Dorothy Turk. Particularly he bitterly complained about the victim raising his rent. This colloquy ended by the Turks entering their home. At approximately 8:15 P.M., according to Mary Turk, wife of the victim, defendant came again to their home and talked for several minutes about an argument which he had had with their son and daughter-in-law. When admonished by Mary Turk that he should not engage in such arguments, he took a pistol from his pocket and declared that he was “so mad 1 pretty near kill them.” When she again told him to refrain from, bothering them, he then pointed the pistol toward her and, in her words, declared “I kill you.” Thereupon the victim requested him to leave, and after defendant repeated his displeasure over the increased rent, he walked out, followed by the victim. Upon arriving at the berm of the road at the end of the walk leading thereto from the house, he turned and shot the victim in the arm. The victim turned his back upon him, calling for help, and at this point defendant shot <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>him in the back. He then fired at Mary Turk, who was standing in the doorway of their home, and struck her in the neck. Following this, he returned to his home, obtained his truck, and drove past the Turk home at a slow rate of speed. All of these incidents of shooting were observed not only by the victim’s wife, but also by their son and daughter-in-law, John and Dorothy Turk. Their identification of defendant was positive and without conflict. In addition, George Horn, defendant’s neighbor, also testified to the fact that he talked to defendant outside his home at some time beginning with “ten or fifteen minutes after 8:00,” during which time the defendant related the argument which he had engaged in with John and Dorothy Turk. He also testified that he left to go back into his own home to view “The Life of Riley,” a program televised at 8:30 P.M.</p>

But to sustain this position is to disregard the Commonwealth’s testimony. Premeditation was definitely and affirmatively established by the testimony of Mary Turk; and malice is reasonably inferred from the circumstances. “Legal malice may be inferred and found from the attending circumstances”: <em>Commonwealth v. Bolish, </em><a href="/pa/381/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="381 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1258899" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0500-01">381 Pa. 500</a>, 511, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.2d%20464" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="113 A.2d 464">113 A. 2d 464</a>.

The nature of the wounds inflicted indicate such a specific intent to kill as points to first degree murder. The absence of a struggle and the location of the wounds support the finding of a deliberate and premeditated murder and fully justify the verdict.” So in the instant case the proof, together with its reasonable inferences, establish the elements required to sustain the verdict.

Holley, </em><a href="/pa/358/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="358 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="8845487" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0296-01">358 Pa. 296</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%20546" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="56 A.2d 546">56 A. 2d 546</a>.

Thus, contrary to the defendant’s claim, the court did not err in failing to charge on motive, which was never made an issue in the case.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[262,1378,1145,983]]]'>Defendant strenuously urges that the court also erred in refusing to admit testimony “about the members of the Turk family except as to their truth and veracity or prior conviction of crime.” His offer was to show that Mary Turk had operated a “speakeasy,” had had quarrels in times past with her husband, and that a number of years prior to this occurrence she had lived with another man. The court was under no right or duty to admit such testimony. It could have served no proper purpose either in establishing the guilt or innocence of defendant or in attacking the credibility of . the witnesses. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Bednorciki, </em><a href="/pa/264/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="264 Pa. 124" data-case-ids="1048480" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0124-01">264 Pa. 124</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20A.%20666" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="107 A. 666">107 A. 666</a>, and <em>Commomoealth v.

      <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>Defendant’s contention that it was physically impossible for defendant to have shot the victim — this on the theory that there were minor conflicts in testimony — cannot be sustained. The testimony was quite direct and positive by the eyewitnesses and the pathologists, as to positions of the parties, the course of the bullets, and the cause of death, all of which were left with the jury for determination. This argument of the defendant is solely for the jury, being entirely factual, and that body chose to believe the testimony of the Commonwealth. Nor ivas it necessary to produce the pistol used in the killing. The Commonwealth established by three witnesses that defendant fired fatal shots from a pistol, and the fact that the Commonwealth failed to find it after the occurrence is not material to its case. In fact, it is not even necessary to produce the victim’s body to prove the corpus delicti in homicide, it being sufficient that there he before the jury evidence from which it can find that the death resulted from a felonious act: <em>Commonwealth v. Agoston, </em><a href="/pa/364/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="364 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="1223458" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0464-01">364 Pa. 464</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%20575" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="72 A.2d 575">72 A. 2d 575</a>.</p>

After a very strong and lengthy charge on the burden imposed upon the Commonwealth to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the court charged: “Now the theory of the defense in this case is that the defendant was not there; that he had nothing to do with this shooting. We say to you that that type of defense is known as an alibi. <em>An alibi is a perfect defense if you believe it. </em>It is designed to prove that the defendant during the whole of the time was away from the place where the crime was committed, and that he could not have participated in- it. Evidence of this kind should be carefully scrutinized and weighed by the jury as in all cases, which requires frequently very great nicety as to the recollection -by <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>witnesses of particular dates and events, of particular hours or half hours or even minutes of the day on which the offense to which it relates was committed. The setting up of an alibi as a defense does not change the burden upon the Commonwealth by the pleas of not guilty of the prisoner, or waive his right to demand from the Commonwealth, before he can be convicted, a full and complete proof of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but where a person sets up an alibi as a defense, <em>the burden of proving his alibi to the satisfaction of the jury is thrown upon him. </em>If he does not do this, his defense of alibi falls completely.” (Italics supplied). It will be noted at this point that the court, at the conclusion of its charge, twice inquired of counsel whether they desired anything further, and no requests in this regard were made, although making several other requests. In any event, the charge was proper. In <em>Commonwealth v. Jordan, </em><a href="/pa/328/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="328 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1179671" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0439-01">328 Pa. 439</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.%2010" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="196 A. 10">196 A. 10</a>, at page 446, we declared that “the measure of proof required for the defense of alibi is merely a preponderance of the evidence, or, as it is sometimes stated, <em>proof ‘to the satisfaction of the jury/” </em>(Italics supplied).

It is designed to prove that the defendant during the whole of the time was away from the place where the crime was committed, and that he could not have participated in it. Evidence of this kind should be carefully scrutinized and weighed by the jury as in all cases, Avhich requires frequently very great nicety as to the recollection by witnesses of particular dates and events, of particular hours or half hours or even minutes of the day on which the offense to which it relates was committed. The setting up of an alibi as a defense does not change the burden upon the Commonwealth by the plea of not guilty of the prisoner, or waive his right to demand from the Commonwealth, before he can be convicted, <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>a full and complete proof of Ms guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but where a person sets up an alibi as a defense, the burden of proving bis alibi to the satisfaction of the jury is thrown upon him. If he does not do this, his defense of alibi falls completely.”</p>
    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[258,663,1144,872]]]'>It will be noted that the judge said that alibi was designed to prove that the defendant was away from the place where the crime was committed “during the whole of the time.” There was no obligation on the part of the defendant to prove that he was absent from the scene of the crime “during the whole of the time.” What is meant by “the whole of the time“? Does that mean that if the murder occurred in the evening, the defendant must show that he was nowhere near the scene of the crime during the entire evening? The shooting in this case occurred at 8:30 p.m. One of the defendant’s witnesses said she saw the defendant at McIntyre, four-tenths of a mile away at 8:30. It was enough for Gate’s defense that he prove that he was not at the Turk home, where Louis Turk met his death, when, and only when, the fatal shot was fired.</p>

The judge said that the defendant had to prove his alibi “to the satisfaction of the jury.” What would satisfy the jury? The judge mentioned only one standard of proof in the entire charge, namely, proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In referring to proof beyond a reasonable doubt he equated it in one instance with satisfying the jury. He said: “The law says that the burden of proof of guilt of a defendant is upon the Commonwealth, and goes to the extent of requiring the Commonwealth to produce before the jury, that is this jury in tMs case, evidence and testimony of such a type and character <em>as will </em>

As far back- as 1878, this Court said, speaking through Justice Gordon <em>(Turner v. Com., </em><a href="/pa/86/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="86 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1056643" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0054-01">86 Pa. 54</a>, 73) : “Proof of an alibi is as much a traverse of the crime charged as any other defence, and <em>proof tending to establish it, though not clear, may, nevertheless, with other facts of the ease, raise doubt enough to produce an acquittal: </em>We are inclined to think with Mr. Greenlead (Ev. vol. 1, <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>sec. 81b) that the true rule in criminal cases, notwithstanding some decisions to the contrary, is, that the burden of proof never shifts, but rests upon the prosecution throughout, so that, in all cases, a conviction can be had only after the jury have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant’s guilt. From this it results, that, <em>if from any, or from all the evidence taken together, a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt is raised, there should </em>be an acquittal.” Of all this in the trial judge’s charge there is nothing. And in this appalling omission the Majority sees nothing wrong.</p>

This Court seems satisfied to ignore its own rulings because it is convinced that the defendant is guilty, but what is to happen in future cases where the evidence may not be as convincing as the Majority believes the evidence is convincing in this case?</p>
