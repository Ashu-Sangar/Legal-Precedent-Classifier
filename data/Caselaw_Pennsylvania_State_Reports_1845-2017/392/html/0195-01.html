    <p id="b230-10" data-blocks='[["BL_230.15",230,[240,1631,1146,486]]]'>Prior to the adoption of any zoning ordinance by the City of Philadelphia, Baldwin Overall Service, Inc., (herein called Baldwin) ivas the owner of premises 1724-34 North 8th Street whereon it conducted a laundry business. When the zoning ordinance was adopted the area was classified as D-l Residential, a classification which prohibited the conduct of a laundry business. The laundry business continued as a nonconforming use.</p>

After two duly advertised hearings at which no one appeared to protest, the Zoning Board of Adjustment granted Baldwin’s application for a variance with an attached condition that all loading and unloading of the laundry trucks be done off the street.</p>

Philip Freed, who lives in the general neighborhood but on a street one removed from the area in question, appealed from the decision of the zoning board to the court of common pleas. The court below, although it took no testimony, reversed the grant of the variance by the zoning board. From that order this appeal was taken.</p>

    <p id="b232-4" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[232,1277,1147,818]]]'>The court below based its reversal of the zoning board upon the ground that the board treated the petition for variance as an extension of a non-conforming use and that the record before the board indicated a lack of consideration of material matters. The court below clearly erred in this respect. It was not the function of the court below to substitute its findings for that of the board but, on the contrary, simply to ascertain whether the board’s findings and conclusions were supported by adequate evidence and whether the board abused its discretion. An examination of the record indicates that there was adequate evidence to support the findings and conclusions of the board and the board did not commit any abuse of its discretion in granting the variance.</p>
