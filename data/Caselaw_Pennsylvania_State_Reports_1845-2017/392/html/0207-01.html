On two occasions the “Acting Division Chairman” demanded these records and files but Zawada refused to surrender them. Instead, the four lodges went into Court of Common Pleas No. 1 of Philadelphia County where they obtained orders which restrained the Brotherhood from interfering with the performance of the duties of the elected officials of the four lodges until a final disposition by the Court of the charter forfeiture litigation. Later on, the court approved an agreement of counsel, in implementation of the restraining order, which provided that Zawada and the “Acting Division Chairman” should, pending final determination of the charter forfeiture litigation, jointly execute certain documents concerning grievances and that the “Protective Chairmen” of the four lodges could continue to file and process grievance claims just as they had done prior to the initiation of any litigation.</p>

This action was tried without a jury and, on August 3, 1956, the trial judge filed a memorandum opinion in which he found for appellee upon the ground there was not a verbal contract between the parties to pay to Zawada a salary,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and in which he expressly refused to pass upon Zawada’s right to recover the reasonable value of his services on the basis of a quantum meruit in this action. Appellant at this point had the choice of either filing exceptions to the court’s dismissal of her assumpsit action, or, of seeking a recovery upon the theory of a quantum meruit. The appellant chose the latter course; she contended that she had never based her claim upon the theory of an express contract and that, since she had already proven that Zawada had a right to recover upon a quantum meruit basis, she did not have to file a new action. Having adopted this position, appellant, instead of amending her original complaint or instituting a new suit, sought to amend her answer to new matter in this action by averring that “an implied contract exists for the payment of services rendered by the [appellant’s] assignor; that in any <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>event [appellant] is entitled to recover on a quantum meruit basis for services rendered to the [appellee] by her assignor”.</p>

An examination of the complaint does not reveal any <em>specific </em>allegation either of an express or an implied contract; in fact, neither the word contract nor the words quantum meruit appear in the complaint. It was in the answer to new matter averred by the appellee that the appellant, by implication, pleaded an express verbal contract when she denied appellee’s averment that no contract existed. The only possible theory of the appellant’s complaint is that it is based on an express contract; this being so, within its framework, no right to recover on the theory of a quantum meruit, or an implied contract, can be sustained.</p>

This stipulation gave appellant certain distinct advantages. At that time the appellant had permitted the period during which exceptions could be filed to the first opinion and order to elapse without taking action. Furthermore, on the date on which the stipulation was made only two days remained of the period prescribed by statute during which she could take an appeal to this Court from the judgment entered in the contract action: Act of May 19, 1897, P.L. 67, §4, as amended, 12 PS §1136. Instead of perfecting such an appeal she bargained for and secured the opening of the judgment on the <em>clearly expressed </em>condition that the decision in the contract action should be res judicata. It is evident that the appellant entered into this stipulation because she deemed it advantageous to the strategic conduct of her case; by means of it she was able to present her argument for recovery on the basis of quantum meruit without either bringing a new action or amending her complaint in the first action. Appellant greatly benefited in this respect because the lower court, in its second opinion, <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>had expressly denied her right to do this very thing and. its allowance dispensed with the necessity for faking additional testimony.

This argument, albeit ingenious, is without merit in. view of the lower court’s holding, voluntarily acquiesced in by the appellant, that Zawada was not <em>wrongfully </em>deposed from office and, in fact, was not even dismissed at all, but simply became ineligible to hold the position because of the forfeiture of the charter of the lodge from which his status as a representative officer derived. Under this holding Zawada cannot be considered the de jure — the lawful— officer who was deposed by the Brotherhood’s appointee. To argue that Zawada was the de jure officer is to collaterally attack the trial court’s decision on the <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>contract question wbicli the appellant stipulated was to be res judicata.</p>
    <p id="b253-4" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[180,491,1147,815]]]'>The principles which underly the theory of quantum meruit are expressed in § §1 and 2 of the Restatement, Restitution, which states: “§1. A person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other. §2. A person who officiously confers a benefit upon another is not entitled to restitution therefor.” In view of what we have said above the conclusion is inevitable that Za-wada’s services were officiously conferred, having been performed against the appellee’s wishes and in spite of the appellee’s best efforts to avoid them, and at a time when a legally appointed officer was available to perform the same services but was restrained from all interference with Zawada by the court order which Zawada had secured.</p>
    <p id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[179,1329,1147,822]]]'>The appellant further argues that Zawada’s services, even though forced upon the appellee, were privileged because they were necessary for the protection of Zawada or of third persons. By this argument she seeks to come within the exception to §2 covered by §§112-117 of the Restatement, Restitution, contending that the appellee had failed to provide the members of the lodges involved in the “rebellion” with adequate non-discriminatory representation. As the lower court correctly pointed out, this argument is without merit because of the complete lack of evidence that the ap-pellee did not intend to provide all its members with representation and because the officer appointed for this purpose was prevented by Zawada’s efforts from functioning effectively.</p>
    <p id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.6",253,[180,2164,1146,210]],["BL_254.1",254,[242,386,1144,431]]]'>The appellant also contends that the appellee was unjustly enriched because the “Acting Division Chairman” appointed by the Brotherhood as his replacement whs paid no extra salary for his services. The trial <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>judge ruled out all questioning concerning such salary as irrelevant. With this ruling we are in complete accord. Whatever compensation was or was not received by the “Acting Division Chairman” would have no bearing at all on the cost to the Brotherhood of patching up the breach in its organizational framework caused by the acts of the rebellious locals and the resulting ineligibility of its “Division Chairman”.</p>
    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[236,829,1150,1320]]]'>The bitterness and strife within this international labor union over the last several years has been intense and we cannot help but note Zawada’s deep involvement throughout every aspect of the dispute. Zawada undoubtedly rendered services to the Brotherhood but, with the exception of a small amount of work with regard to a lodge not a party to the dispute but directly traceable to the chaos resulting from the division of authority, those services were forced upon the Brotherhood against its wishes and are of questionable worth. Nor can we disregard the fact that the Brotherhood was caused great expense in having to furnish one of its officers as Zawada’s successor, in having to furnish that successor with a staff of assistants and in being forced to suffer through a period of divided authority in its government which caused needless duplication of effort, chaos and loss of prestige. The record clearly shows that Zawada, while occupying his judicially protected office, was actively engaged in activities detrimental to the authority of the union. To allow Zawada’s assignee to recover the value of the services he forced upon' the appellee would frustrate the whole purpose of the law of restitution. Cf: <em>Gerson v.
