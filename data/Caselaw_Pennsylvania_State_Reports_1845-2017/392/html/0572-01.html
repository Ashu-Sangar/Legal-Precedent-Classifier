The court sustained the preliminary objections and entered judgment for the defendants.

The cashier, in regular course, handed the note to the clerk in the prothonotary’s office whose duty it was to index judgments. The clerk is an employee of the County of Allegheny allocated to the prothonotary’s office. Under the “Russell Index System” which is used in the prothonotary’s office for the indexing of judgments, Orris’ judgment against Whitaker should have been indexed under the key letters “TR”. Instead, it was improperly indexed under the key letter “T” alone. The complaint does not aver that the prothonotary ordered or directed the manner of indexing the note or had any knowledge of it. Had the judgment been properly indexed, it would have been a lien on property in Allegheny County which Miss Whitaker, the debtor, owned at the time of the filing of the note for entry but which she subsequently sold and conveyed to a third person for a consideration of $11,000 before the error in the indexing of Orris’ judgment was detected and corrected.

Corse, 17 Grat. 230) has been long recognized, and is one of general application. ‘The distinction generally turns upon the question whether the persons employed are his servants, employed voluntarily or privately, paid by him and responsible to him, or whether they are his official subordinates, nominated perhaps by him, but officers of the government; in other Avords, whether the situation of the inferior is that of a public officer or a private servant.’ In the former case the official superior is not liable for the inferior’s acts, in the latter he is: American Lead.

The negligent acts alleged were performed by the postmaster’s clerks or assistants who were appointed by him but paid by the United States Government. This court upheld the trial judge’s charge that the defendant was liable only for his own personal misconduct or neglect and not for that of his subordinates. Chief Justice Gibson spoke as follows: “That the privity which springs from appointment to office constitutes the relation Of master <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>and servant betwixt the immediate parties, is a principle on which no government has been, or can be, constructed; the man is the servant of the party that pays him.”</p>

Story on Agency, §319.” In that case, it was held that a collector of customs is not personally liable for the negligence of a subordinate in keeping the trunk of an arriving passenger on a pier rather than properly sending it to the public store. As a result of the subordinate’s negligence, the trunk was destroyed by fire. The Supreme Court recognized that “The subordinate who was guilty of the wrong, if any, would undoubtedly be liable personally for the tort, but to permit a recovery against the collector, on the facts of this case, would be to establish a principle which would paralyze the public service. Competent persons could not be found to fill positions of the kind, if they knew they would be held liable for all the torts and wrongs committed by a large body of subordinates, in the discharge of duties which it would be utterly impossible for the superior officer to discharge in person.” Continuing, the Supreme Court further pointed out that “In Keenan v.

It is interesting to note that the rationale of the rule enunciated in <em>Hazard v.

But control is by no means the only essential factor. Equally important to the relation of master and servant is the fact as to whose matters or pecuniary interests the subordinate is employed to serve. The Restatement, Agency, §220(1), in defining a servant specifies two requisites, viz., “A servant is a person employed to perform services for another <em>in his affairs </em>and-who, with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the service, is subject to the other’s control or right of control” (Emphasis supplied).

If the rule were otherwise, the burden which such a liability would impose on public officers (most of whom serve on fixed modest salaries) would be onerous to the point of being unbearable. If Roberts were to be held liable for the negligence of the indexing clerk in his office under the facts of this case, all public officers would be liable for the negligent acts committed, within the scope of their employment, by all employees under the control of such officers. It is unnecessary to multiply the many illustrations, that readily come to mind, of the dire consequences to which such a rule would lead. It is sufficient to observe that a recovery against a public officer for such a liability might readily consume several years’ salary or even the savings of a lifetime. Public service would indeed become a perilous venture which could be undertaken safely only by those who are so impecunious as to be permanently execution-proof.</p>

To carry on the many phases of the work of the prothonotary’s office, it is necessary for the County of Allegheny to employ 165 persons.

The number of employees in the office of the prothonotary and their salaries are determined by the County Salary Board, a body which consists of the three County Commissioners, the County Controller, and the head of the particular office whose personnel requirements are, at the time being, under consideration. It is plain enough that the County of Allegheny, rather than the prothonotary, is in fact the employer of the clerks who work in his office.

We may advert, in passing, to a rule of law which would seem to deny to the plaintiff a right of recovery against anyone for damages for the clerk’s mistake in indexing the judgment. It is the duty of a person offering an instrument for record to see that it is both properly recorded and properly indexed: <em>Prouty v. Marshall, </em><a href="/pa/225/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="225 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="965327" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0570-01">225 Pa. 570</a>, 576-577, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20A.%20550" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="74 A. 550">74 A. 550</a>. Speaking for a unanimous court in the <em>Prouty </em>case, Mr. Justice Potter said, “In the <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>case at bar, the duty was upon the mortgagee to give notice that L. J. Marshall had executed to her a mortgage upon the premises in question. If from any cause she fell short of giving legal notice [i.e., by recording and indexing], the consequence must fall upon her. She cannot hide behind the mistake of the recorder. It is an easy matter for a mortgagee, or a grantee in each particular instance, either in person, or by a representative, to look at the record, and see that the instrument has been properly entered.” The decision in the <em>Prouty </em>case, supra, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court: see <a href="/pa-super/36/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="36 Pa. Super. 527" data-case-ids="874357" data-case-paths="/pa-super/36/0527-01">36 Pa. Superior Ct. 527</a>. In a subsequent case <em>(Apollo Borough v.

In treating with this question it is to be kept clearly in mind that it is not liability of Roberts under the rule of <em>re-spondeat superior </em>which the fidelity bond covers or was intended to cover. The principal sum of the bond, which is of course the limit of the surety’s liability, is $40,000 — a sum that can hardly be thought to have been intended as insurance against possible liabilities of the prothonotary growing out of his transactions with the public aggregating annually $93,000,000. Liability under the bond depends entirely upon its express provisions and not on an interpretation of it affected by the law of master and servant.</p>

And, since the clause also provides that “his deputies, clerks, assistants, and appointees” shall faithfully perform their duties, the plaintiff argues that the signers of the bond are liable thereunder for the negligent acts of such deputies, clerks, assistants and appointees. However, there is a further provision in the bond which negates liability of the principal for negligent acts of his subordinates, etc., committed (as in this case) in a manner other than as contemplated by the bond which stipulates that the principal and surety “are <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>beld and firmly bound unto the County Op Allegheny, a political sub-division of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, for the use of the said County of Allegheny and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and of such other party or parties <em>for whom </em>he shall collect or receive money, as the interest of each shall appear, in case of a breach of the conditions hereof, in the sum of Forty Thousand And 00/100 ($40,-000.00) Dollars . .

But Orris does not claim that any money was paid into the prothonotary’s office for his benefit. He avers that he paid the statutory filing fee of $2.50 at the time he filed his judgment note. That, of course, was money received <em>from </em>him and not <em>for </em>him. The averment is plainly irrelevant to the requirement of the bond. If the bond had been designed for the protection of all parties who file judgments or other legal instruments in the office of the prothon-otary, for which they pay the required fees, it should have expressly so stated. But, it provides only that actions can be brought “for the use of the said County of Allegheny and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and of such other party or parties <em>for whom </em>he [the principal] shall collect or receive money . . (Emphasis supplied). Thus, by the bond’s express terms, private individuals are not protected by it unless money has been paid to the prothonotary for their account or benefit — a situation which arises ordinarily as a result of a court order providing for the payment of money into court or an impounding of moneys for any reason. The present plaintiff is not within the category of designated beneficiaries under the bond. To allow him a recovery on the bond would be to im<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>pose a liability upon Roberts for which he is not responsible. For even though the Casualty Company .would pay the recovery in the first instance, Roberts would be liable over to the Casualty Company as the principal in the bond. As already stated, the bond is a fidelity bond to the County of Allegheny for use, etc., and not an indemnity bond to Roberts. The bonding company is but a surety; and it is well settled that a surety which has been compelled to pay a loss is entitled to enforce reimbursement from the principal: <em>Lacock v.

It is obvious that a Prothono-tary could not personally supervise or check judgments approximating 300,000 in number which are entered in Allegheny County each year. Nevertheless, if the Legislature requires as a necessary <em>prerequisite </em>to a Prothonotary “entering upon the duties of his office” that he give a surety bond to cover damages resulting from <em>errors </em>in the execution of the duties of his office, as well as for embezzlement, <em>the Courts have no right to ignore the mandate of the Legislature. </em>Moreover, if the Prothonotary is not liable for errors of his deputies, clerks, assistants and appointees unless he <em>personally </em>participated therein, <em>he could easily avoid all liability, </em>thus leaving the public without adequate protection, by merely assigning certain duties to each deputy, clerk, assistant and appointee, and refrain and abstain from any personal activity in the performance of his official duties. <em>To so interpret the Acts and in particular the present bond, would be contrary to their language, as well as to the public interest. </em>Furthermore, the Prothonotary admits, as, we repeat, he must, that if one of his deputies or clerks or assistants or appointees embezzled money which has been paid into his office, he would be personally liable under the aforesaid Statutes and <em>under this bond. </em>If, as is conceded, the language of the Statutes and of the bond is broad enough to cover embezzlements by his deputies, clerks, assistants and appointees, it cannot possibly be narrowed so as to exclude acts of negligence by his deputies, clerks, assistants and appointees, <em>since the language covering performance of duties and payment of monies is, under the Act of 1834 and also under the “condition” of this bond, exactly the same.</em>

For example, under the principle or maxim of “respondeat superior” (i.e., principal and agent, employer and employee, master and servant) the individual or partnership — whether it be investment bankers or lawyers or insurance brokers or any other private business, and whether it be composed of one man or many men, and whether one or hundreds or thousands of agents or employees or servants are employed — is liable for the negligence of (his or) their agents or employees or servants in carrying out the duties of the principal or superior. If, for example, X orders the purchase of 100 shares of General Motors at 50 and an employee of the brokerage firm forgets to enter the order or enters an erroneous order, the partners are liable for the damages, even though there was no fraud or embezzlement, and even though none of the partners was personally guilty of negligence. The books are literally filled with cases where employers have been held liable in damages for the negligence of their automobile driver (agent, employee or servant), yet in such cases there was no fraud, there was no negligence on the part of the principal or employer personally, and it was a “practical” impossibility for him, as it was for the Prothonotary, to personally perform or supervise the work of the agent, employee or servant. This is so commonplace we sometimes forget that the maxim of respondeat superior is not, and, in practice and principle, cannot be limited merely to negligence in automobile cases.</p>

This indemnity insurance can be obtained, as it has been in the County of Philadelphia, for a very small premium which, incidentally, is paid by the County.
