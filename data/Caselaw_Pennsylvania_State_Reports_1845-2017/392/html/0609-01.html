The triers of the facts could have believed the plaintiff’s narration of those circumstances and still found that he was not the injured and innocent spouse. Thus, if they did not believe his testimony as to the alleged indignities other than the desertion, or if they believed that such indignities were not sufficient evidence of the required course of conduct, the dismissal of the action would have been proper.

The Superior Court held that if defendant left the marital home and was absent for two years, the burden was on her to prove that her “leaving” was justifiable or was a con-sentable separation. That is an obviously unjustifiable interpretation of the language, meaning and intent of the aforesaid Legislative Act. Plaintiff does not prove the required statutory wilful and malicious desertion <em>by merely proving an absence of his spouse </em>from his habitation for two years, nor does such proof even make out a prima facie case. <em>Wilful and malicious desertion as used in the Act (1) means intentionally, deliberately and maliciously leaving the other spouse </em>
