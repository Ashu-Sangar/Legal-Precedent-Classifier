Thereafter, however, the executors and trustees of decedent’s estate declined to make further payments contending that the decedent’s obligations under the separation agreement terminated on his death. Mrs. Wolf-sohn then brought the present action against the estate and, alleging the absence of any dispute of fact, moved for judgment on the pleadings which included her complaint, defendants’ answer containing new matter and plaintiff’s reply to new matter.</p>
    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[182,999,1148,932]]]'>The trial court held that the decedent’s estate had no obligation to plaintiff under the agreement, and therefore denied Mrs. Wolfsohn’s motion. However, believing that factual issues might be involved in determining whether the estate, (on the theory of promissory estoppel), ivas under a duty to reimburse plaintiff for her expenditures for rent, the court refused to enter judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendants. Although the court’s order is interlocutory, plaintiff has properly taken this appeal therefrom under the provisions of the Act of April 18, 1874, P. L. 64, §§1, 2, 12 P.S. §§1097-1098. See <em>Grossman v. Hill, </em><a href="/pa/384/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="384 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="1263137" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0590-01">384 Pa. 590</a>, 592 n.1, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%2069" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="122 A.2d 69">122 A. 2d 69</a> (1956 ; <em>Epstein v.

Defendants argue that the Wolfsohn agreement constituted only an acknowledgment and a mutually accepted measure of the decedent’s legal duty, and was therefore not binding upon the husband’s estate. See <em>Patton v. Patton, </em><a href="/pennyp/2/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Pennyp. 394" data-case-ids="218953" data-case-paths="/pennyp/2/0394-01">2 Penny. 394</a> (1882). On the other hand, if the parties to a separation agreement intend <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>that the husband assume obligations beyond those imposed by law, the obligations will survive the husband’s death and so bind his estate. The plaintiff claims that this principle controls the interpretation of the present agreement. <em>Cf. Huffman v. Huffman, </em><a href="/pa/311/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="311 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1146276" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0123-01">311 Pa. 123</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20570" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="166 A. 570">166 Atl. 570</a> (1933).</p>
    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[224,709,1145,210]]]'>Support for both views can be found in the provisions of the agreement before us, but in our disposition of the matter, the conflict must be resolved in favor of the survival of the obligations.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[219,933,1148,598]]]'>The Wolfsohn contract was more than a mere agreement for maintenance and support. It imposed duties and obligations upon both parties beyond payment and acceptance of support monies. The decedent undertook to perform obligations to his wife additional to those required by law. The plaintiff bound herself to execute jointly with her husband the Federal Income Tax Return for the year 1955 and thereafter. Absent this agreement plaintiff was under no duty to file a joint return, and her promise so to do constituted legal consideration for her husband’s undertaking.</p>
    <p id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.6",166,[214,1542,1148,367]]]'>Undoubtedly, it was anticipated that by signing the joint returns plaintiff would confer material and important benefits upon the decedent in the form of substantial tax savings. In fact, part of this benefit was realized; Mrs. Wolfsohn executed the 1955 tax return which was due within 20 days after the support agreement was entered into.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
