When these directors voted as stockholders, in a stockholders’ meeting, they held no trust relation to the company which would deprive them of the right to vote as their interests dictated. As shareholders they, like other owners of the stock, had a voting capacity to the extent of the number of shares they held in the corporation. The right to vote their shares was a privilege of which they could not be deprived. While the majority stockholders may not use their voting power to defraud the minority stockholders, yet they have the right to protect their own interests in the stock by voting as they deem best in the stockholders’ meeting. <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>
      <em>This </em>might, <em>as it did in the case in hand, result in sustaining them in obtaining a salary from the corporation. . . . </em>Each stockholder had a right to vote in the shareholders’ meeting as he thought best to protect his own individual interest. Such interest would naturally and necessarily influence him in voting, but it would not deprive him of the right to vote on the ratification of the action of the directors. <em>To hold otherwise, would be to permit a minority stockholder to control the majority stockholders and their property. </em>This cannot be done. The majority stockholders may not as against the corporation and a minority stockholder dissipate or waste its funds or fraudulently dispose of them in any way, either by ratifying the action of the board of directors in voting themselves illegal salaries or by any other act. But where the action of the board of directors is not fraudulent or unfair to the <em>extent </em>of amounting to fraud and the action of the directors may be ratified by the shareholders, the well-settled general rule is that the stock of the director who is benefited is to be counted, even though the vote would have failed had his stock not been voted: 2 Cook on Corp., sec. 662; Booth v.
