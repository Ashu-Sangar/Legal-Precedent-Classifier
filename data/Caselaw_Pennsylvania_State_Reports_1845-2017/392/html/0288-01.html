That first payday could not <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>possibly fall in May because, in that event, the “preceding calendar month” would have to be April and, of course, the contract of employment under consideration did not exist in April.

On May 6, 1949, the Company deducted the dues for April, 1949, which totalled $1950, and prepared to send a check to cover the amount to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union. Before, however, the Company could actually mail the check, Edward A. Yoe and five others representing 972 employees, whose dues had been deducted, brought an action of assumpsit in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County against Lieber-knecht for the $1950. The Union brought suit for the same sum. Lieberknecht filed a petition for inter-pleader, which was granted, and accordingly paid the $1950 into Court. The Union and Yoe et al. inter-pleaded against the sum. Following an interlocutory proceeding which took the case to the Superior Court, the court of common pleas, after a hearing by Judge Hess sitting as court and jury, adjudicated the conflicting claims in favor of the Union.</p>

Yoe et al. filed exceptions to the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and verdict, and the exceptions were argued before a court <em>en </em>banc, which agreed with the Trial Judge that the $1950 were dues collected for the month of April, 1949, but decided that the Union was not entitled to the money because the check-off authorization terminated on May 1, 1949, simultaneously with the ending of the collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the Company. The Union appealed to the Superior Court which affirmed the decision of the lower court. We granted allocatur and the case was heard by us.</p>

Since the Union received its first check in Jnne, 1947, and did not receive any in May, 1949, it should not require considerable mathematical calculation to arrive at the conclusion that the intervening time totals only 23 months and not 24 months. Thus, the Union is not asking for “an additional month’s deductions” as the Majority says. What it is claiming, and properly so, is payment for the 24th month of services rendered to Yoe et al. in accordance with the agreements entered into with the Company and with Yoe et al.</p>

Those resources can only come from dues paid by members of the union. In order to be assured of a continuing inflow of potential assets, most unions today have a check-off arrangement with the employer whereby the employer deducts the dues from the wages coming to the employee and pays it to the union.- This check-off agreement is inextricably-intertwined .with the collective bargaining agreement. Since ; the strength of a union depends largely on. the-soundness--of its treasury, it must be quite ap<a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>parent that, to the extent that it may be weakened, by lack of funds, to that extent it will be less effective in holding firmly the bond between the company and the employees in the latter’s discharge of their obligations to the company. It is thus to the best interests of the employer, once it has entered into a contract with a union, to support and respect the check-off in its every phase, as laid down by the compact with the union.</p>

But the decision of this Court does more than take away $1950 from its rightful owner. It sows seeds of demoralization in the field of labor-management relationship. What is to happen to all contracts which read precisely as the one here under consideration? Are all unions to be deprived of that last month’s dues? Is any given year, so far as collection of dues is concerned, to be reduced from 12 months to 11 months?

If a landlord authorizes a renting agent to collect the monthly rent on a lease running from January 1, 1956 to December 31, 1956, it is simply a waste of time to argue that the last month’s rent would not be collectible in January, 1957 because the lease expired December, 1956. The authority to collect the last month’s rent under the lease would naturally extend beyond the final month’s rent and for such time as would reasonably be required to make the collection. Common sense is as much a part of every contract as heat is an inevitable concomitant of fire. To insist that the last month’s rent would be uncollectible because the collection can only come after the last month of occupancy has been enjoyed is like insisting that the tail of a dog cannot possibly be part of the dog since it follows the dog. Yoe and his associates in this lawsuit signed a check-off authorization wherein, for a consideration, they assigned a certain sum from their wages each month to the parent United Steelworkers of America, a Union of which they were a part.

The company was made an agent to collect dues for the life of the contract. The life of the contract included April, 1949. It was impossible to pay the men for April until April had lived its 30 days. Thus, by the sheer workings of the inexorable demands of time, the collection could only take place in May. To say that the Company was not required to collect the April dues, once April had run its course is as absurd as saying that the employees should not have been paid in May for the wages earned in April because the contract of employment expired at the end of April.

Thus, the only possible question which could arise would be whether the Union should receive the $1950 through the medium of the collecting Company. But the money is no longer in the possession of the Company. The money is in Court under interpleader proceedings, and the object of such a proceeding is to <em>ascertain the true owner of the money being held by the Court. </em>Since, in all the litigation revolving around the $1950 there has been no adjudication other than that the $1950 belongs to the Union, it is simply incomprehensible to me under what authority the Court turns the money over to Yoe et al. who have no more right to it than the most covetous stranger would have to somebody else’s money in a bank, upon which he looks with an avaricious eye.</p>
