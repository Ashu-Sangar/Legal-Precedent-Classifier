The right was in relation to a sum of money which had been deposited in the defendant bank in escrow, to be paid to the plaintiffs npon fulfillment of certain contingencies agreed npon by the parties in settlement of the property rights of Mary Dora, one of the plaintiffs, against her husband, George Dora, one of the defendants. The remaining defendants are the four children of George Dora by a former marriage. The settlement agreement was entered into during the trial of an equity suit which Mary Dora had instituted against the present individual defendants, at which time the chancellor made the following order: “And now, to wit, May 17, 1954, this matter came on for hearing after conclusion of the testimony, the case is continued as settled.

The appel-lees argue, however, that the defendants failed to present a point for binding instructions prior to the court’s submission of the case to the jury and were, therefore, without standing to file a motion for judgment n.o.v. after the rendition of the verdict, citing <em>Essex Packers Limited v. Kisecker, </em><a href="/pa/373/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="373 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1240420" data-case-paths="/pa/373/0351-01">373 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20A.2d%20544" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="95 A.2d 544">95 A. 2d 544</a>. Such is, of course, the unexceptionable rule. But we are not persuaded that the defendants did not present timely a point for binding instructions which the trial court denied. The following appears in the printed record. After the court had specifically passed upon a number of points for charge submitted by the defendants, counsel for the defendants stated, — “Your Honor, I have contained also in there some requests for binding instructions and specific instructions. They are all in the same blue back. They are on the last page. <em>The </em>Court: All right; That is refused too. . . . <em>The </em>Court: I refusé the first request for binding instructions.”</p>

    <p id="b472-5" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[250,880,1149,878]]]'>■ The agreement was in writing. Whether or not it amounted to a contract to obtain a divorce was a question of law to be passed upon by the court on the basis of the terms of the written instrument. The learned court below correctly decided that question in the negative and, accordingly, instructed the jury in relation thereto as follows: “The agreement doesn’t provide that either side shall get a divorce, because it wouldn’t be any good if it did; that would be against public policy to malee an agreement to get a divorce. It does mention a divorce. That is a limitation put upon the bank; they were not to pay out any money which was deposited with them under the escrow agreement unless a divorce decree was' given to them by either party. So far as that is concerned, it does not provide that either side shall get a divorce.”</p>

Jur. §15, p. 266, that “The mere fact that a contract is to be performed only if a divorce decree is entered, or that it is to be inoperative if a divorce is denied or if the plaintiff fails to obtain it by a certain date, does not establish that it is contrary to public policy. It is held that where the parties have separated or contemplate an immediate separation, and it is believed that one of them has a cause of action for a divorce, they are free to enter into bona fide agreements relating to alimony, or <em>the adjustment of property </em>rights, although the duty to <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>pay permanent alimony and the settlement of property rights are the subject of a final decree and are usually to be performed after the decree is entered.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

    <p id="b473-6" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[159,998,1149,1324]]]'>The verdict as molded by the trial judge comported with the jury’s expressed intent except, perhaps, for the precatory words appearing at the conclusion of the note from the jury to the court which indicated that the plaintiffs were to receive the sums awarded them by the jury “As long as Mary Dora comply with the escrow agreement in full but should not pay for any property damage.” The conditions thus embraced cannot, of course, be attached to the verdict without making the judgment thereon less than complete and exe-cutionable. At this stage, the condition can best be complied with in a practical manner. Counsel will, of course, be cognizant whether any of the obligations assumed by the plaintiffs in the escrow agreement remain unfulfilled and, if there are, will move promptly to fulfill them to the satisfaction of the trial judge. It is to be noted in this connection, however, that the requirements of the escrow agreement with respect to the exhibition by the plaintiffs of a certified copy of a divorce decree in favor of Mary Dora and her timely surrender of the specified property, which she once occupied, have both been met substantially. Consequently, nothing further is left for the plaintiffs to do in such regard.</p>
