This testimony, together with other testimony concerning the decedent’s condition, prompted this Court to state (p. 640) : “Since the testamentary incapacity of decedent was so clearly established we need not discuss the effect of a will drawn by an attorney and witnessed by a physician and a bank officer.

But to exclude all other testimony would be altogether unreasonable. If no witnesses are admitted, but those present at the execution, and they are base enough to perjure themselves, it will be impossible to set aside a will made by a man of unsound mind. But besides, soundness of mind being but matter of opinion, the subscribing witnesses may be mistaken, though they are men of integrity. If others of equal integrity and understanding had seen the testator an hour before, and an hour after the execution of the will, and were of opinion that he was <em>non compos, </em>in consequence of a disorder not generally subject to intermissions, and supported this opinion, by relating the words and actions of the testator which induced them to think him of unsound mind, it would surely be proper, that the jury should hear those witnesses, in order to form a judgment of their own, as to the state of mind at the moment of execution”.

And he said: ‘Yes, that’s what I want you for.’ And then, I began interrogating him about the will. Q. As you spoke to him about the will, what did you do? A. Well, I recall that I said to him something about: ‘Now, you want your funeral expenses paid for, and you want your burial paid for, and, if you owe anybody money, you want to pay them, too. Is that right?’ And, he started to talk to me in Italian. Well, I don’t speak the Italian language, and I never trust myself too much on understanding it. And, I told him. I said, in Italian to him, as best I could say it, I said: ‘Talk to me in English.’ And, he would —told me in English, ‘Yes, it’s all right to pay all my bills.’ Then, I said to him: ‘Now, what do you want to do with your property?’ He then would name a property. He would say: ‘My house.’ And, I would say: ‘Well, where is it?’ He would give me the address, just as they appear in this <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>will and in the will which was probated. And, I would ask him who he would want to give it to, and he would tell me. And, I would ask him: ‘Is he a cousin of yours, or something like that?’ He called these children, the D’Allesandros, his nieces and his nephews. Q. To interrupt you for just a moment. As he would name these parcels of real estate and say what he wanted done with them, were you simultaneously, drawing this will, or this exhibit, whatever it is that is before you — instrument, that was executed on the 19th? A. What I would do is: after he had told me he wanted to give a house, and I would ask him. these questions, and what not, and after I got it all straight, I would write it down, and then repeat it back to him and ask him if that is what he meant. And then he would say: ‘yes.’ For instance, I remember his coming down to the two D’Allesandro girls, Ann D’Allesandro and Mary D’Al-lesandro, and he left a property to Ann D’Allesandro. And, I said to him: ‘Well, is she married?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ I said: ‘What is her married name? What is her name now?’ He said: ‘Oh, I don’t know,’ he said. I remember looking up to ask Eose Benedict, because I felt pretty sure that she was familiar with these D’Allesandros — if she knew their married names. And, she did not. And that is why, in the will, it appears that the marriage name was unknown, or, as it appears here, ‘The former Ann D’Allesandro,’ and, ‘The former Mary D’Allesandro.’ Then, he went on down through the rest of the will and he came down to the church. And, by the way, I want to say now, I heard Mrs. Gion-donato here make a statement on the stand that he talked mostly in Italian. Well, that’s not true. As a matter of fact, he would have to speak to me — I would say more in English, because no matter what he would say in Italian, I would want him to repeat it in English. And, some of the things he would say in English, <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>first. Now, be came down to the church, and he wanted to give three thousand dollars to the church. I did mention the name of the church. That’s correct. I said to him, I said: ‘Now, what church do you want to give this to?’ He said: ‘You know, the Italian church.’ I said: ‘The Italian church in Conshohoeken?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ So, being familiar with there is only one church in Conshohoeken, and that’s why St. Cosmos and Damian Church appears in the will. Then, after he got through with that, he said that that was all the property that he had. And I said: ‘Now, do you have anything beside property?’ Because, being familiar with the old Italians, when they talk about property, they talk about real estate. I said: ‘Do you have anything else? Do you have a bank account, or anything like that?’ He said: ‘Oh, yes. I got money in the bank.’ I said: ‘What do you want to do with that?’ I said: ‘You ought to leave it to somebody. You are making a will, you ought to leave the rest of whatever you have to somebody else, or, to one of these children.’ So, he pointed down to Bose, and he said: ‘You give it to Bose, because, Bosie is going to bury me and take care of me if I die.’ I said: ‘Do you want her to take charge of the funeral, and the burial?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ Now, I did talk to him about the fact that he had a widow in-Italy, and I said: ‘Now, what do you want to do about this wife of yours in Italy?’ And, he said: ‘I don’t want to give, her anything.’ So, I had explained to him, as best I could, without using any technical terms, that she might have a right to come over here, or, through some representative, make a claim against the will; and, if she did, how she might be successful. And, he understood. He understood me. And, I went a little further, and I asked him: ‘Now, if she Avins; if she comes over here and she is entitled to something, who do you want her to take it <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>from? Do you want her to take it from one of them, from all of them?’ He said: ‘No, each one has to give their share.’ Now, as to the executor in the will: I explained to Mr. Maseiantonio that he should have an executor in the will. Now, as I recall it, he didn’t understand — he didn’t quite understand that too well, and, I think I used the word administrator. He understood that a little better. I think, it, more or less, corresponds to the Italian word. And he said: ‘Well, I don’t know,’ he said, ‘how about you?’ And, I didn’t know whether he meant about I being the executor, or, what did I think. I interpreted it to be the latter. And, I told him that I would recommend that some bank be appointed. And, he said: ‘Well, you take care of it. Whatever you say is all right.’ We came to the end of the will. Of course, actually, I had asked Bose Benedict, on the way up to the hospital, whether or not he could write his name. But, anyhow, I did ask him, prior to his affixing his mark, whether or not he could write his name. He told me he couldn’t. I asked him if he could make a mark and he said: ‘Yes,’ he could make a mark. I said to him: ‘Now, somebody has to write your name here. Who do you want to write your name on here?’ He said: ‘You write it.’ So, I wrote his name on the will, leaving a space between the surname, the Christian name, and the last name, and asked him, then, I said: ‘You want to sign it?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ I said: ‘Here.’ And, I handed ■him the pen and he made an X on this will. It was a little — his hand was not real steady, and yet, I wouldn’t say it was shaky. But, the mark was legible, but, it wasn’t real firm. And, I said to him, I said: ‘Do it a little harder. Make it a little firmer.’ And, he went over it. And, I said to him — oh, by the way, I had, at that time — prior to that time — I had asked this woman back here, Mrs. Giondonato and Mrs. Bene-<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>diet to come over prior to this time — and, I said to Mm, I said: ‘Now, look. You have to have witnesses on a will like this.’ I said: ‘Now, who do you want to witness it?’ And, he said to me: ‘Well, everybody.’ And, there were just the three of us there in the room. And, the furthest one, I think, was Rose Benedict, and, she couldn’t have been standing, oh, any further than this (indicating) away from him. Q. You are indicating about five feet? A. Or less; in that vicinity. So, I signed my name, first; Rose signed her name. And then, Rose, as I recall it, explained to Miss. Gion-donato, in Italian — because, she had said this to me in English — that he just asked her to sign her name on this will. That is, as to the execution of the will. Q. Now, with respect to each of the paragraphs which appear on that will, would it be fair to say that there was conversation in both Italian and in English? A. I don’t want to say that, because, I am not sure that everyone of them was in Italian. Everyone of them was, definitely, in English. Q. With respect to many of the paragraphs, at least, might it not be said that there were remarks made in Italian, as well as in English? A. Oh, yes. Q. And, as these remarks were made in Italian, were they, in your opinion, made within the hearing of Miss Giondonato? A. Yes. . . .”</blockquote>

Q. 1955. <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>I beg your pardon. Please tell us wbat happened on that day. A. I would say it was some time after three o’clock. I had made arrangements to pick up Eose ■Benedict to go back to the hospital. I picked her up, 'and got up to the hospital somewhere in around quarter to four that afternoon. Q. Was there anybody there when you arrived? A. There was not. Walked into the room, walked over to the bedside. And, I Avouldn’t say he was sleeping but, I would say that he just wasn’t aware of anybody being in the room. Looked like he might have been day-dreaming. I said hello to him, and he looked up, and he saw me, and he saw Mrs. Benedict, who had walked around the side of the bed with me. He said: ‘Hello.’ I asked him how he was feeling. He told me he wasn’t feeling too good; he wasn’t feeling as good as he was yesterday. I asked him to shake my hand, again. Which he did. I said: ‘Squeeze it.’ Which he did. And, he had about —almost as much strength as he had the day before. At least, in his hand. So, then, I told him that I came back with that — with the will he made yesterday, except it was made on the typewriter and, it looked a little bit neater. And, I told him that I wanted him to listen to me — I guess I was just being a little overcautious — but, I read the will to him verbatim, just as it was drawn. And then, I took each paragraph separately, and went over the paragraph, explaining to him exactly what was in it, and asked him if it was all right, if that was the way he wanted it. And, he would reply, ‘Yes,’ or ‘Okay.’ Went through the complete will that way. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘you’re sure you want to make this will?’ or something to that effect. He said: ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘it’s the same like it was yesterday.’ And, we went through the ritual of exécut-ing the will. And, I told him at that time, again, I went through the fact that someone had to write his <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>name. He asked me to write it. Someone bad to witness it. He said: ‘Well, you and Rosie.’ I said: ‘All right.’ And, we witnessed the will. Q. Getting down to the execution of the will, would you please tell the Court precisely the manner in which that instrument was executed? A. I then asked him if he could write his name. He said: ‘No.’ And, I asked him if he could make his mark. He said: ‘Tes.’ I said to him, I said: ‘Now, someone has to sign your name. Who do you want to sign it?’ He said: ‘You.’ I wrote his name, leaving a space between his first and his last name. Then, handed him the pen. I said: ‘Now, you make the cross over here.’ And, he made the cross. I took the pen, and, I wrote over the top of the X ‘his’ and below it ‘mark,’ and then, explained to him — or, it may have been even before, that we had to witness the will. But, anyhow, he said: ‘You and Rosie sign it.’ I think I signed it first. I don’t have it here, but I probably would. And then, I handed the pen to Mrs. Benedict, and she signed it. . . . Q. Did you know any of the de-visees named in this will? A. I only know — I do hot know any of the four specific devisees; never knew them before. Q. The first time you ever heard their names mentioned, then, was on the 19th? A. Let me say this: I have heard the name of D’Allesandro, because, there are a few D’Allesandro families; but, I did not know any of these devisees in this will. Q. Now, with respect to the residuary legatee. Did you know Mrs. Benedict? A. Yes, I knew Mrs. Benedict, but, I would say, in all the years that I knew her, I don’t think I spoke to her any more than ten minutes in all those years, prior to this occasion. . . . Q. Did you know, prior to July 19, 1955, who owned the several parcels of real estate which aré concerned here? A. No, I did not. Q. You knew nothing about that real estate? A. Absolutely nothing. Q. During the time that <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>you spoke to tbe decedent, either on July 19th or on July 20th, was there any prompting from anyone with respect to the dissolution of this man’s estate? A. No prompting whatsoever. . . .”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b446-4" data-blocks='[["BL_446.4",446,[235,598,1148,1709]]]'>“By Me. Lowe: Q. Is there anything else that you care to add, with respect to the execution of the last will? A. Only say this: that there never was, in my mind, any doubt whatsoever, that this man fully realized what he was doing, and fully appreciated the fact to whom he was leaving the property. There was never the slightest doubt — I took all precautions which I know in engaging him in conversation and making sure his answers were responsive, and going over with him, not only once, as on the 19th, hut, also, again, on the 20th, and, I do not know- — did not know at that time— the decedent, the fact that he owned this property which it eventually turned out that he did own, or anyone of the devisees of the will who were not in that room. I only know Bose Benedict, I would say, prior to that time a ten minutes’ talking in all the years that I knew her. ... I feel I am better qualified to determine whether or not a man has testamentary capacity, than any one else. And, if there was the slightest doubt in my mind, after I had spoken with him, and, purposely had this small conversation with him, I would have gone over for a doctor and a nurse — -but, preferably, a doctor. . . . Q. And didn’t you consider it a bit irregular to have a residuary legatee sign this will? A. Mr. Dennis, I will say this to you: over a period of four or five years, I have written, perhaps, a hundred and fifty wills, and, on those one hundred and fifty wills, I would say that out of one hundred and forty of those cases, one of the witnesses is a beneficiary under the will, because, that is usually the one who accompanies the person to your office.”</blockquote>

In that case the will was prepared by a lawyer and witnessed by a bank officer and decedent’s physician. Decedent was born in 1892, weak-minded. On May 26, 1947, a guardian was appointed for his estate after he had been adjudged to be weak-minded, unable to take care of his estate, and liable to become the victim of designing persons. It was admitted that “decedent had the mental developments, habits and intellectual attainments of a child of approximately <em>five </em>years.” The Court in an opinion by Justice Stearne, said (page 636) : “The findings of fact are, therefore, equivalent to a verdict of a jury. On appeal the function of an appellate court is to determine whether or not the hearing judge’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, approved by the court in banc, are sufficiently supported by the evidence.” The Court also stated (639-640) : “The determinant question is whether or not decedent possessed <em>sufficient </em>mental capacity to make a will. . . . In testing the extent of decedent’s testamentary capacity, Dr. Hen-ninger, a psychiatrist, called by the proponent, testified: ‘Anxious to determine, if I could, to what extent he was aware of his worldly goods, we went into that to some extent. He had no definite knowledge of his wealth at all. He knew that he had a guardi<a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>an and that money came from the bank to him, and that he owned the house he lived in, and that he had enough he didn’t have to work. I wouldn’t feel that beyond that he had much knowledge of his means at all.’ Upon this evaluation the doctor was of opinion, as were proponent’s other witnesses, that decedent possessed sufficient testamentary capacity to make a will provided that all decedent was required to know was a ‘general’ knowledge of what property he possessed and his next of kin. The witness frankly stated that, if the requirement of such testamentary capacity necessitated a ‘full’ knowledge of his estate and kindred, decedent did not have such capacity. Our examination of the evidence convinces us, as it did the learned hearing judge and the court in banc, that the decedent was so mentally deficient that he was incapable of possessing, and did not possess, the quantum and quality of knowledge of his estate and the natural objects of his bounty which he was required to possess in order to have testamentary capacity.” The Oourt also stated (page 640) : “We are not favorably impressed, however, with the manner and circumstances under which the wiU was prepared and executed.” That case was so obviously correctly decided and the propositions of law cited therein so sound, that we cannot understand how the' majority opinion believes it supports the conclusion it reaches.</p>
