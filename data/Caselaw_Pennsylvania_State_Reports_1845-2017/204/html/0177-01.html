    <p class="summary" id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.13",208,[285,1164,1194,819]]]'>At the trial it appeared that on October 10,1900, the Robinson Machine Company agreed in writing to furnish and deliver to F. N. Kirk a ten-foot fan, together with engine for driving same, and belt for connecting engine with the fan. It was covenanted that the fan should produce 150,000 cubic feet of air at a three-feet water gauge. The price was $1,200. Kirk subsequently organized the defendant corporation, which assumed the contract. At the trial it appeared that the fan furnished was not of the capacity stated in the agreement. The plaintiff offered testimony that H. J. McCracken, the general business manager of the defendant, had orally agreed that the contract in writing should be modified so that a direct instead of a belt connection should be installed, and that the capacity stated in the written contract should not be required. The change, however, was not to affect the price mentioned in the written agreement.</p>

It was a case for the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>jury and if they believed the testimony of the plaintiff there was evidence sufficient to support the verdict they returned. They being the judges of the facts of the case and the credibility of witnesses, it is not for the court to say they should have adopted the theory of the defendant company and given controlling weight to the testimony of its witnesses. It would not have been unreasonable to have done so, but we cannot say that the jury made such a palpable mistake of judgment in doing so as would justify the court in setting aside the verdict.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b209-3" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[127,843,1187,603]]]'>As to the fifth reason assigned in support of the motion for a new trial, it is only necessary to say that the court did charge that the recovery, so far as the fan and engine were concerned, must be for the whole claim or nothing; but this was not only in accordance with the theory of both sides of this case as manifested during the trial, but in accordance with the defendant’s theory, as evidenced by the points for instruction presented by its counsel. The defendant expressly repudiated the claim that the plaintiff could recover for a portion of the price of the fan, and insisted that he could only recover the contract price, and that after satisfactory proof of the performance of his part of the contract.</p>
