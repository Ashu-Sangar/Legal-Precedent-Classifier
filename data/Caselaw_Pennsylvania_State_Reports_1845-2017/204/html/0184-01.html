The lease provided that the lessees should pay certain royalties and also taxes and premiums on insurance, and that in case of a default in these payments for a period of twenty days after the same should become due and payable, the lessors should have a right to cancel and annul the agreement, and might enter judgment under an ejectment clause contained in the lease. The record showed that the lessees failed to make the payments above provided for, and after a default of several months the plaintiffs entered judgment under the ejectment clause. The court after hearing evidence upon a rule to open judgment discharged the rule.</p>
