No. 207, June term, 1880, of this court, the property was sold by the sheriff to Mrs. Patterson for $50.00. In June, 1880, Mrs. Patterson sold the property to Thomas Fawcett and Madison Bailey, but previous to this and before the sheriff’s sale on the scire facias and purchase by Mrs. Patterson, Fawcett and Bailey, at the solicitation of Peter Baker, the then owner of the property, agreed verbally with him that they would advance the money to pay Mrs. Patterson the amount of her mortgage and take a deed from her for the land and hold the title for his benefit, and as security for the money thus advanced, until it could be sold and Fawcett and Bailey were paid for all moneys advanced by them, the balance should belong to Baker. Under this arrangement, to which Mrs. Patterson agreed, the property was sold to her as stated, and by her conveyed to Fawcett and Bailey, who paid some money and gave their mortgage on the property to her for the balance, which they subsequently paid.

M. Watson, Esq., attorney for Fawcett and Bailey, bought in the property for $6,200, had deed made to him, and on June 7, 1883, conveyed one undivided half thereof to Fawcett for the consideration of $1.00, and the other half to Bailey for a like consideration. Subsequently they had a habere facias issued at No. 25, October term, 1886, and Baker was turned out of possession by the sheriff on the date above stated. While Baker was in possession he paid the taxes on the property and also some $2,200, of the principal debt due Mrs. Patterson on the mortgage of Fawcett and Bailey. The evidence shows that in 1883, Baker procured a person willing to purchase the property, but Fawcett and Bailey refused to sell, alleging that $14,000, the amount offered, was not enough by some $6,000. The purpose of Bailey and Fawcett in getting Mrs. Patterson to proceed and bring suit upon the mortgage was to get rid of any trust that might exist under the arrangement between them and Baker. The evidence further shows that in 1899, the property in suit was bought under an agreement with the American Land Company from Madison Bailey’s heirs and Austin L. Bailey, grantee of Thomas Fawcett, and deed was made therefor on January 16, <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>1900, for the consideration of some $80,000 or $85,000. At the time the agreement for the purchase was entered into this suit had not been brought, and nothing appeared upon the abstract of title furnished the counsel for the company exceptthe old ejectment at No. 619, January term, 1885, Bailey and Fawcett v. Peter Baker, the ancestor of plaintiffs, and proceedings thereunder by which Baker was dispossessed and the property delivered to Bailey and Fawcett. After the agreement for the purchase of the property, but before the execution of the deed, counsel for the company was notified by Mr. Stone, counsel for the present plaintiffs (the heirs of Peter Baker) that they claimed title to the property, he made no mention of any writing exhibiting the trust, and referred the counsel for company to Mr. Baker’s answer in the prior ejectment for information as to what Baker’s claim was. An examination of this did not indicate that the agreement was in writing, and counsel therefore concluded it was merely in parol and passed the title.</p>

    <p id="b558-10" data-blocks='[["BL_558.18",558,[286,1974,1187,303]]]'>Appellants’ claim in the present suit is upon an equitable title growing out of the agreement made concurrently with the conveyance by Mrs. Patterson to Bailey and Fawcett in June, 1880. By the conveyances and proceedings set out in appellants’ abstract the legal title is admitted to be in appellees and no other equity is asserted against it but that arising from the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b558-11" data-blocks='[["BL_558.19",558,[287,2283,1183,139]],["BL_559.1",559,[134,360,1186,1274]]]'>. Turning now to the ejectment by Bailey and Fawcett in 1885 against Peter Baker, it is olearas held by the learned judge below, that the title involved there was the same as that involved here. <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>That was an ejectment by the holders of the legal title under the conveyances down to and including that b}r Mrs. Patterson to the plaintiffs Bailey and Fawcett. The defense after a general denial of “ the validity and legality of the proceedings in Common Pleas of September term, 1877,” etc. (resulting in the sheriff’s sale to Mrs. Patterson), set up further that “ should it appear otherwise on trial, still the plaintiffs hold the title subject to the defendants’ right to hold, occupy and possess the premises as set forth in his sworn statement filed herewith.” The sworn statement thus referred to and made part of the abstract of title, set up an agreement that Bailey and Fawcett took and held the title for the benefit of the defendant Baker and only to secure themselves the repayment of the money advanced to assist him. It was not stated expressly that the agreement was in writing but with this exception the agreement does not differ in any material respect from that sued upon now, and there is no claim that there was ever more than one agreement between the parties upon the subject. That the defense was not developed fully, if at all, at that trial does not affect the force of the judgment. It was indicated and could have been made fully under the pleadings and was therefore concluded. The issue between the parties was identical in the two actions, the validity of the same equity against the same legal title, and the verdict and judgment in the first were a final adjudication and a bar to the present effort for further contest.</p>

It is admitted that Bailey and Fawcett, under the agreement took title as security for the repayment of money advanced by them for the assistance of Baker. They claimed that it was a mere parol mortgage, but Baker claimed and the jury have now found that the agreement was in writing. It was therefore a mortgage to secure advances but with no time of repayment agreed. They were not bound to wait indefinitely, but could have filed a bill calling upon Baker to redeem within such time as equity should decree, or to permit a sale and liquidation. A decree in either form would have ended the trust. Instead of pursuing this course, however, they chose to proceed upon a subsequently acquired legal title. The agreement was made in June, 1880, at which date they gave their mortgage to Mrs. Patterson. In 1882, Mrs. Patterson sued out her mortgage and <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>title under the judicial sale came again to Bailey and Fawcett who then brought ejectment and recovered judgment .and were put in possession by the sheriff in July, 1885. This was not a mere recovery of possession as mortgagee or trustee for Baker, for under the agreement Baker was to remain in possession. It was a clear repudiation of any further trust under the agreement and the assertion of title as purchasers at sheriff’s sale under a paramount incumbrance. Baker and his successors, the appelants made no counter move for fourteen years. It was .then too late: Bruner v.
