    <p class="summary" id="b136-8" data-blocks='[["BL_136.15",136,[268,1152,1189,1068]]]'>We have carefully read the testimony, examined the petition and answer, and have carefully considered the arguments of counsel. We note that several credits or rather amounts which the defendant claims should be allowed as credits, aggregating a considerable sum, were paid to the several solicitors of the association, plaintiff, but which plaintiff in answer to the petition denies any obligation to allow. The amount of fines seem enormous when we consider that fines can only be charged against defaulters for six months. As to when these fines should begin and when they should cease, there is not sufficient evidence before us to warrant our making the calculation nor is there any averment in the answer that fines were not exacted after the period of six months, dating from defendant’s defalcation, and we feel that plaintiff within whose power and province it was so to do, should have submitted a calculation from which the court could have determined whether the liquidation was the result of a calculation made according to law. There are many matters of fact which the court ought not to be asked to pass upon in this proceeding, and therefore we have concluded to submit the matter to that tribunal which is constituted to try issues of fact.</p>
