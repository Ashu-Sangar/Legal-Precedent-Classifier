These branches were respectively known as the Remington and Conway branches, and had not been constructed at the time of the filing of the bill. The Beaver Valley Traction Company leased the railway and franchises of the People’s Electric Street Railway Company, and under this lease claimed the right to construct a street railway on the state road at the points where the two branches crossed that road. Plaintiff denied the validity of this lease, in so far as it gave power to construct a street railway on a country or township road. The plaintiff also denied that the traction company had secured the local and municipal consent prerequisite to its right to construct its line.</p>
