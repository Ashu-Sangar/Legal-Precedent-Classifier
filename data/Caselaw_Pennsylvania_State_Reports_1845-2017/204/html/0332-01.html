Why should this court withhold its hand in this matter to allow M. H. Stevenson to offer in evidence in the orphans’ court a record which has already been adjudged by the Supreme Court not oniy a nullity, but not competent evidence to establish the claim which he seeks to establish in the orphans’ court? We therefore hold that the judgment entered to No. <em>57, </em>November term, 1897, and all the proceedings under it, are a nullity, and that the motion to strike off should prevail, and that the respondent in his answer has not shown any just ground for our delaying the entry of the decree asked for until he can use the record as it now stands as evidence in the orphans’ court.</p>

But we can make no such assumption ; on the contrary, the fact that the estate of Stephen Smith owes James B.

It may be, as stated in the answer, that the respondent has been put to expense by reason of this sheriff’s sale in preparing his paper-books for the Supreme Court in the cases that reached there by a blunder or inadvertence of this court in entering this judgment, but if, in place of giving notice to bidders at the sheriff’s sale that the purchaser would take no title, he had come into this court and called our attention to the blunder we had made in entering the default judgment, we would certainly have quashed the writ of lev. fa. and then struck the judgment from the record, and there would have been no expense for him to have paid. Decrees for default judgments are always prepared by counsel and are handed up and signed on motion day without much examination, and as our court rules provide for their being opened or stricken off on cause shown, the election is with the party dissatisfied with the judgment to pursue either courseand we have no criticism to make of the course the respondent chose to take, we only say that he cannot charge the expenses incurred to “ the unconscionable conduct of James B. Tenan.” He should either charge them to the inadvertence of the court in signing the decree for the default judgment, or to his not calling the attention of this court to the slip it had made before the sheriff’s sale was made.</p>

The learned judge granted the motion and struck from the records the judgment and decree as being “ legal nullities and possessed of no efficiency whatever.” On three separate appeals to this court, in litigation involving the -validity of the judgment, we have declared it void and of no efficacy whatever. We have also held that the deed and the receipt of the sheriff by the lien creditor were likewise of no force or validity. “The sheriff’s sale under the judgment,” says Chief Justice Green in Smith’s Estate, <a href="/pa/194/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="194 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="912459" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0259-01">194 Pa. 259</a>, “ was a void sale and the deed to the purchaser was a void deed. It not only conferred no’ title, it was a legal nullity. In other words, the judgment and all the subsequent proceedings were the same as if they had never taken place-; they had no existence in any manner which the law could or would recognize.” Such was the opinion of this court, after deliberate consideration, upon the validity of the judgment and subsequent proceedings on the scire facias <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>issued on the mortgage. Eegarding this opinion as authoritative, the learned trial judge struck from the record the proceedings to foreclose the mortgage. His opinion thoroughly justifies his action. There can be no sufficient reason assigned why a judgment or proceeding, adjudged by this court to be void and of no legal effect, should be permitted to remain on the record of the court of first instance. Until it is stricken from the record and its invalidity thus declared, it can and may be enforced by the same or another tribunal. Thus the records of the court may be used as evidence to enforce a claim which this court declares to have no legal existence, or to defeat a claim which is justly and equitable due.</p>
    <p id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[124,992,1187,667]]]'>Here the correction of the record was resisted by the appellant in order that he might use it to prevent the allowance of the appellee’s claim by an auditor appointed to distribute a fund in another court. So long as the record of the common pleas showed a satisfaction of the claim, the orphans’ court could not allow it to participate in the distribution of a fund arising from the sale of the debtor’s real estate. The judgment and proceeding thereon, declared by this court to be void and of no legal efficacy whatever, would therefore prevent the appellee from enforcing the payment of his claim out of the fund for distribution. The necessity for correcting the record is therefore apparent and the learned court below was entirely right in granting the motion for that purpose.</p>
