In such a case an instruction that the jury must be “ satisfied that the defendant was insane when he committed the act,” is proper, since it tends to call the attention of the jury to the distinction between the degree of proof required of the prisoner on that subject, and the requirement on the commonwealth to satisfy the jury of the prisoner’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The instruction is in aid of the prisoner’s case.</p>

L. 15, to review the evidence. The effect of the evidence was for the jury, not for the court.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.6",249,[103,785,1184,507]]]'>The onfy defense was insanity and that also was for the jury. The burden of proof was upon the prisoner, and there was no error in so charging. The judge’s language that the jury must be “ satisfied that the defendant was insane when he committed the act ” tended to call the attention of the jury to the distinction between the degree of proof required of the prisoner on that subject and the requirement of the commonwealth to satisfy the jury of the prisoner’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The expression was in aid of the prisoner’s case and could not have been reasonably understood in any other sense.</p>
