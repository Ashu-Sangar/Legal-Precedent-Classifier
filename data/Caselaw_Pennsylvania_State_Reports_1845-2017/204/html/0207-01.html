    <p class="summary" id="b239-7" data-blocks='[["BL_239.6",239,[105,1311,1192,1083]]]'>Nor do we think the position that a deputy consul general had no right to take acknowledgment is sustained by reason or authority. The Act of January 16, 1827, P. L. 9, provides that the acknowledgment of a deed by married women or others may be taken in any foreign country, before any consul or vice consul of the United States appointed for that country. The Act of April 9; 1849, P. L. 527, sec. 12, provides that the written consent of a married woman to the conveyance of her property may be acknowledged out of the United States, before any minister, ambassador, charge d’affairs, consul or vice consul. The act of April 2,1859, P. L. 352, provides that all ambassadors, ministers plenipotentiary, charge d’affairs or others, exercising public ministerial functions shall have the acknowledgment of any person. Rev. Stat. U. S. sec. 1674, provides that consular officers shall include consul generals, consuls, commercial agents and none others. Rev. Stat. U. S. sec. 1750, provides that every secretary of legation and consular officer shall have power to perform any act, which any notary public is authorized to perform within the United States. It has been held that the acknowledgment of a married woman before a United States commercial agent in Canada is sufficient: Moore v. Miller, <a href="/pa/147/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="147 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="829874" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0378-01">147 Pa. 378</a>.</p>

A deputy in the name of his principal: ” 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency of Law (1st ed.), p. 144.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[268,581,1202,559]]]'>Even if the acknowledgment had been defective, it is cured by the Act of June 1, 1891, P. L. 159, which provides that all conveyances heretofore or hereafter acknowledged before any deputy consul .... shall be valid to all intents and purposes as if the same had been acknowledged before a notary public. As to the other defense, if want of consideration, it is not well taken. An affidavit of defense to a sci. fa. on a mortgage which . denies the indebtedness, but fails to deny the execution of the mortgage is insufficient to prevent judgment: May vV Meehan, <a href="/pa/159/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="159 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="850173" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0419-01">159 Pa. 419</a>; Woods v.

    <p class="summary" id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[280,1152,1191,664]]]'>It may be true that Mrs. Linton received no part of the consideration money of the mortgage. But there is no denial that her attorney in fact did receive it by virtue of the power she had placed in his hands. The affidavit of defense admits that there was an appearance before an officer, that we have found competent to take the acknowledgment and <em>“ </em>attempted ” to execute it. That being the admitted fact we think the official certificate is conclusive of every fact appearing on its face. When the affiant further swore she never “legally” executed, she drew' a wrong legal conclusion. An affidavit of defense should state facts not conclusions. On the whole it seems to us that the affidavit of defense is but a flimsy pretense to postpone the collection of an honest debt.</p>

She rather relies upon her averment that her acknowledgment before the deputy consul general was invalid, in which she is mistaken, as is clearly shown by the learned judge below in his references to the several acts of assembly upon the subject. In all other respects the affidavit of defense is insufficient, and the judgment for want,of its sufficiency is affirmed.</p>
