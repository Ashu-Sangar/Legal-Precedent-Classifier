Plaintiff himself was the only witness produced to avoid the effect of the writing, and this was totally insufficient to establish a trust or authorize the submission of the question of reformation of the contract to the jury.</p>

The learned judge below, however, properly held that the evidence was insufficient for this purpose. The defendant, though an attorney at law, was not attorney for plaintiff <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>when he acquired title. By agreement among the heirs, defendant had bought in the property for them at an orphans’ court sale in 1894 at a nominal price, but this sale was set aside upon objections, among others, of this <em>plaintiff; </em>and at the subsequent sale, defendant, who had in the meantime bought the interests of most of the heirs, including the plaintiff who was in haste to realize his interest in money, purchased the property in his own right as the highest bidder for its full value. Whatever relation of trust had previously existed was completely terminated by that sale.</p>
