On the day of the accident it began to “ pound ” in a way indicating that something was out of order, and the master mechanic and plaintiff, himself a practical machinist, familiar with the engine, were engaged in making an investigation to find out what was the matter, when the explosion took place. The only negligence charged was that the master mechanic apparently thinking he had discovered the source of the trouble and that it was not serious, told plaintiff to start the engine, while plaintiff thought there should be a further examination. Both were close to the engine looking and listening to discover the cause of the knocking when the accident occurred. <em>Held </em>that a nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

His testimony disclosed the fact that up until within a few minutes before the accident occurred there had been no trouble whatsoever with the engine, and, in fact, only five or ten minutes before the trouble with the engine commenced, the master mechanic, employed by the defendant company, remarked to the plaintiff on the satisfactory manner in which the engine was acting. Then without apparent cause the engine commenced to pound, and plaintiff stopped it and signaled for the master mechanic; instead came the superintendent, to whom the plaintiff said that there was “ Something serious the matter.” The master mechanic came later, and he and the plaintiff examined the engine carefully, and found nothing wrong of any consequence. After this examina<a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>tion plaintiff was ordered to start the engine, but insisted there was something seriously wrong, without in anywise designating what it was. He started it slowly, but says he tried to stand clear of any danger of injury, although the master mechanic was down with his ear to the crosshead, listening to the working of that part of the machine, and the superintendent was also close to the engine. Then, on a further order, he ran the engine at the customary speed necessary to operate the mill, and almost immediately the wrist pin broke, and plaintiff suffered injury.</p>
