The reason given for the last mentioned exoneration in the minute book of the school board is the fact that Wm. Robbins was a “ soldier ” and not liable for such tax. The reason for exonerating the tax collector from the collection of the school tax is not set out in the minute book, but Wm. Robbins testifies that this exoneration was allowed for the reason that the property was two miles distant from any school. Whatever the reason may have been, it clearly enough appears from the minute book of the school board that, on April 3, 1875, Wm. Hood, collector, was exonerated from the collection of this tax.</p>

The law requires the deputy surveyor, in executing a war-' rant of survey, to actually go upon and measure the land to which it relates, and to mark the same upon -the ground. If the deputy contents himself, in the performance of" his duty, with merely plotting a supposed survey in his chamber and making a return thereof, it is a breach of the law, and such a return and the acceptance thereof raise only a prima facie presumption .of performance of duty which may be overthrown by proof of the facts, and, in such a case, no title will pass, but the land will be left open to another applicant, who may legally take it up and obtain a good title therefor, through a later warrant and survey, made according to law.</p>

Locating the four returned and accepted surveys of 1794, which are involved in this interference through the means mentioned in the sixth and seventh paragraphs, and supplementing the legal effect of such location by the presumption mentioned in the third and fourth paragraphs, we conclude that the defendant is possessed of the only title which the commonwealth had to give by warrant and survey, and that, therefore, the conditional conclusions in the first and second paragraphs become absolute and unconditional.

If these facts appear the demand for regularity of procedure is satisfied, since the act of 1815.</p>

The source from which these essential facts are to be ascertained is the records in the commissioners’ office.

There is no express provision in the law requiring that the commissioners shall in any prescribed mode certify to the treasurer what taxes on unseated lands are unpaid, for the treasurer is himself the proper collector of such taxes under the law.</p>

The fact that on the treasurer’s sale book there is found written over an enumeration of unpaid county, school and road taxes for Cook township, what in form purports to be a statement of tbe collector of county and state taxes with respect to such taxes on seated lands, made for the purpose of obtaining from the commissioners an exoneration from the collection thereof, for the reasons therein set out, will not be construed to be a statement with respect to school taxes on unseated lands, which such a collector was not charged with the collection of, and could not be legally exonerated of, and it will not be considered as having any connection with the legal procedure whereby the treasurer made sale of the land for the collection of the school taxes. If the mode of making an entry on the treasurer’s books of unpaid school taxes on such lands was irregular, by reason of its associating such taxes with a statement to the commissioners concerning other taxes made by the collector thereof, but which statement, even when confined to its proper subject-matter, had no legal demand for its presence on the treasurer’s books, such'irregularity of procedure is cured by the act of 1815.</p>

It will be assumed, in favor of a title coining through such a sale, that the treasurer obtained his information with respect to the school taxes on unseated lands, of which taxes he alone is given power to compel collection, from the proper source viz: from the commissioners’ office. It will be assumed, too, that a proper return to that office was made by the collector of school taxes for Cook township, when he testifies that he made a return, and the amount of tax for which the land was sold corresponds with the amount that the collector was exonerated of (according to the records of the school board), because it was charged on unseated lands assessed to Jacob Hays’s heirs. The fact that this return cannot now be found in the commissioners’ office will not destroy the force of these presumptions and thereby invalidate the title coming through the sale.</p>
