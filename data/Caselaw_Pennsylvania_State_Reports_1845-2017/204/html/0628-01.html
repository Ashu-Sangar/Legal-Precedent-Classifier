The defendant disclaims title to the real estate described in the pramipe except “ all the coal in and underlying the land described in the writ” with certain mining rights and privileges, the title to which coal and mining rights is claimed by the defendant by virtue of the sale for the payment of debts in pursuance of the order of the orphans’ court, and the subsequent vesting of the title in the defendant by the deed of William Coleman. The plaintiffs deny that the proceedings in the orphans’ court vested the title to any part of the real estate in Coleman, for the reason, as claimed by them, that the court had no authority to order a private sale for the payment of debts, and they also deny that if the court had authority to make the decree, it authorized the sale of any coal except the “ upper or Pittsburg vein ” of coal under the land described in the praecipe and writ in this case. The learned trial judge held that the orphans’ court sale divested the title to the property sold, but, against the objection of the defendant, submitted to the jury to determine “ whether the Pittsburg vein alone answers the description of the ‘ body of coal ’ referred to in the executor’s petition,” on which the order of sale was made.

Babcock, it is said by Shaw, C. J., speaking for the court, that when the description in a deed or devise is clear and explicit, and without ambiguity, there is no room for construction, or for the admission of parol evidence, to prove that the parties intended something different.</p>
    <p id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[148,844,1182,1235]]]'>Applying these principles to the case in hand, we think that extrinsic evidence was not necessary, and hence not admissible to discover or ascertain tlie subject-matter to which the language used in the orphans’ court proceedings, descriptive of the property to be sold, applied. We have recited above the terms used throughout the proceedings. The “ body of coal ” referred to in the first part of the petition is clearly defined and explained in the subsequent parts of tlie petition to be “ the coal underlying the said real estate,” and “ the whole of said coal underlying the surface.” It was to the interest of the parties concerned, as averred in the petition, not that the “ body of coal,” but that “ the coal underlying the said real estate of said testator ” should be sold. This is a distinct averment of the petition, and clearly referable thereto in the subsequent parts of the petition are the expressions “ the whole of said coal underlying the surface of said testator’s land,” which was to be mortgaged, and “ said coal ” which was surveyed and described in the petition. It was this coal designated as “ the coal above described,” which the executors, in the petition, asked for an order to sell. There is therefore no uncertainty or ambiguity in the terms employed in the petition or the decree of the court to designate the property to be sold. It was the coal, and not a, part of the coal, underlying the surface particularly described in the petition.</p>

The deed of the executors to Coleman recites that King became in his lifetime seized “ as of fee of certain lands and coal thereunder ” in Plum township, and conveys “ all the following described coal,” <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>giving a description of tbe land by courses and distances as set forth in the petition presented to the orphans’ court. This deed, the act of the parties who represented ■ the estate of decedent, confirms the interpretation we have put on the language used in the petition. The property thus conveyed was reported to the court by the executors as “ the coal described in the petition,” and the sale thereof was confirmed in accordance with the prayer of the executors. The action of the court and of the executors throughout leaves no doubt and creates no ambiguity as to the quantum of coal sold and conveyed.</p>
    <p id="b664-5" data-blocks='[["BL_664.4",664,[284,890,1189,562]]]'>Had the word “ seam,” “ vein ” or “ strata ” been used, the position of the plaintiffs would have had some ground to support it. Had the application been for an order to sell the seam, vein or strata of coal underlying the surface, extrinsic evidence would have been necessary to determine which of the several seams or strata beneath the surface was embraced in the petition and decree of the court. Neither of these words, however, was used, but instead, language was employed, which clearly designates the subject-matter of the proceeding in the orphans’ court, and leaves no doubt as to what property was sold and conveyed by its authority.</p>
    <p id="b664-6" data-blocks='[["BL_664.5",664,[284,1459,1186,200]]]'>We are all of opinion that under the evidence presented to the court below the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover, and that a verdict should have been directed for the defendant company.</p>
    <p id="b664-7" data-blocks='[["BL_664.6",664,[283,1666,1188,304]]]'>The fifteenth assignment of error is sustained, the judgment is reversed, and judgment is now directed to be entered for the defendant company for the coal underlying the surface described in the deed of Thomas King’s executors to William Coleman, dated April 29, 1871, and recorded in the recorder’s office of Allegheny county in deed book, vol. 274, p. 108.</p>
