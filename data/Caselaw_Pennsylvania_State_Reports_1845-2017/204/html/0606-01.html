An inspection of the plain wording of the statute, as we have quoted it above, from section 10, shows that it does not. There is a general provision in the fifth clause of section 1, which authorizes the company to hold, purchase, etc., pipes, tubing, tanks, office and such other machinery, devices or arrangements as the purposes of the corporation require. And these words are followed by language conferring the “right also to enter upon, take and occupy such lands, easements and other property as may be required,” not for the general purposes of the company, but, notice the limitation “ for the purpose of laying its pipes for transporting and distributing gas.”</p>

And the court finds from the testimony that “ it is not impracticable to operate a pipe line without a telephone or telegraph line, but that it is highly inconvenient and expensive to do so.”</p>
    <p id="b641-4" data-blocks='[["BL_641.5",641,[114,1273,1183,301]]]'>Inconvenience is not enough to justify a claim to a grant by implied necessity. As was said in Phillips v. Dunkirk, etc., R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/78/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="78 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1040376" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0177-01">78 Pa. 177</a>, “the right of eminent domain is a very high and arbitrary one, and arises only ox necessitate rei, and will not be presumed to exist in a corporation, unless by express legislative grant.”</p>
    <p id="b641-5" data-blocks='[["BL_641.6",641,[112,1583,1182,251]]]'>And in Penna. R. R. Co.’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/98/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="98 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="496984" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0150-01">98 Pa. 150</a>, this court held, that in favor of the right of eminent domain, “there can be no implication, unless it arises from a necessity so absolute, that without it, the grant itself will be defeated. It must also be a necessity that arises from the very nature of things.”</p>
    <p id="b641-6" data-blocks='[["BL_641.7",641,[111,1841,1182,455]]]'>An illustration of a necessary incident to the grant of authority, is that of a bridge company requiring the power to take land for its abutments. Without it, a bridge could not be built. So in the laying out of a road, unless land be taken upon which to construct the road, it cannot be laid out. But in the present case, the construction and operation of a pipe line, does not, in the nature of things, involve the construction along with it, and upon the same right of way, of a telegraph or telephone line.</p>
    <p id="b641-7" data-blocks='[["BL_641.8",641,[110,2305,1181,149]],["BL_642.1",642,[313,378,1186,354]]]'>Undoubtedly, as found by the court helow, the use of a telephone line in managing the business is a very important aid. But it does not appear from the testimony in the case, that it <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>is of special importance that such a line should follow the precise course of the pipe line. Indeed, unless the easement acquired by the company, be enlarged considerably beyond the limits indicated in the opinion in Clements v. Phila. Co., supra, there would be no place upon the line of the right of way, for the setting of the poles, and the stringing of wire, required in a telephone line.</p>
    <p id="b642-4" data-blocks='[["BL_642.4",642,[312,741,1186,404]]]'>In much of the evidence taken, it is apparent that the witnesses failed to distinguish between the necessity for the use of a telephone line in connection with the business, and the necessity for having that line constructed immediately along, and upon the right of way of the pipe line. No necessity is shown by the evidence for placing a telephone line upon the precise route followed by the pipe line. And it would seem that every requisite would be subserved by a line approximately near.</p>
    <p id="b642-5" data-blocks='[["BL_642.5",642,[311,1154,1186,354]]]'>If the exigencies of the business require it, the appellant company can obtain authority to construct a telephone line, by securing in its interest, a charter for that purpose. But neither in its present charter, nor in the statute under which it is incorporated, can be found authority, express or implied, for constructing under the right of eminent domain, a telegraph or telephone line, along and upon its right of way.</p>
    <p id="b642-6" data-blocks='[["BL_642.6",642,[311,1516,1185,147]]]'>The assignments of error are overruled, the decree of the court below is affirmed, and this appeal is dismissed at the cost of appellant.</p>
