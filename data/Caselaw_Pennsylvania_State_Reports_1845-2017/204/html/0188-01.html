Thus it was held in Cooper v. Scott, <a href="/pa/62/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="62 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1017265" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0189-01">62 Pa. 189</a>, that where no special provision is made for the maintenance of an infant legatee, interest will be paid on the legacy, although not payable until a future time. This having been the attitude which Dr. Jacoby voluntarily assumed toward the Downs children in respect of their education, a liberal construction must be given to his bequest in the execution of his purpose. “ The mother,” said testator, “ shall be entitled to receive and receipt for the interest of such of her children as shall be under the age of twenty-one years, provided she uses the same for educating her said children.” But from what time should this education begin ? Treated in the light of reason, from the date of testator’s death. The will spoke, and the children became the beneficial owners of the estate from that date; and their education was as important, and as much within testator’s purpose, and the accruing “ income ” just as much needed before, as after, the formal investment of the corpus. This purpose could not be carried on without present means ; and it is therefore reasonable to infer the liability of all the “ income ” which might accrue during the minority of the beneficiaries, whether before or after the investment of the proceeds of sale made. This is in accordance with the principle of Spangler’s Est., <a href="/watts-serg/9/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 135" data-case-ids="12169163" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0135-01">9 W. &amp; S. 135</a>, now firmly settled, that where there is a present gift of income as distinguished from the use of the residue itself, the legatee is entitled, in the absence of a contrary intent appearing in the will, to all that is made from testator’s death. There is nothing on the face of this will that necessarily limits Mrs. Downs to the “ use ” of that “ income ” which may be earned by the investments which the trustees shall make. There is certainly no restriction there of rents and dividends which may accrue ; and if there be no restriction as to these, the natural inference is that there was none intended as to interest. What was said in the will in reference to interest is a restriction, not on the liability of “ income ” earned from the date of testator’s death, to the pur<a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>pose of education, but on the time of payment, and was evidently intended as an administrative provision simply. Testator’s beneficial purpose was never intended to await mere administrative delays which might prolong- investment far beyond the usual period of settlement. It was immaterial in whose hands the “ income ” was earned. Time was of essence in the education of these beneficiaries, and the means for -its accomplishment must have been made commensurate. There is an expression of intent in the will that the proceeds of “ sales ” made should be transferred to and invested by the Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company as the corpus of the trust estate; on the other hand there is not only no express direction that the “ income ” should form part of the corpus, but the whole tenor of the will implies a different destination. There was no reason why the corpus should have been increased by accumulation; for it was ample without; but the education of these children was essential to enable them to make proper use of it and accomplish testator’s purpose.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[142,1312,1190,818]]]'>The functions of the two trustees named are defined with sufficient clearness. To the safe deposit and trust company is very fittingly given the trust to hold and invest the corpus of the estate ; and to Mrs. Downs is given the trust to “receive and receipt for ” the net income and use it for the education of her children. The Safe Deposit <em>&amp; </em>Trust Company is neither expressly nor impliedly given discretion in respect of “ payment ” or “ use.” It is on the mother alone that the trust of “ use ” is imposed. She had charge of the children and no doubt the testator saw that she was the fittest person to judge of their needs. The will declares that she should be “ entitled ” to receive the “ income ” raised by the trustee for investment with a qualification as respects the generality of its use for which she alone was responsible. Her responsibility began where that of the Safe Deposit Company ended. Her trust was entirely free and independent of theirs.</p>
