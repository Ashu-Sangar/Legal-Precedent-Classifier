    <p id="b368-11" data-blocks='[["BL_368.16",368,[289,1159,1190,915]]]'>The allowance of the claim of J. B. Tenan, to participate in the fund for distribution, was resisted by the appellant on the ground that it had been paid by the judgment and proceedings thereon on the scire facias on the mortgage at No. 57, November term, 1899, of the court of common pleas of Washington county. At the instance of Tenan, however, prior to the allowance of his claim by the orphans’ court, the common pleas struck from its records said judgment and the decree approving the sheriff's special return on the levari facias issued on the judgment, and the action of that court has this day been affirmed by this court. It therefore follows that Tenan’s claim was properly allowed out of the fund for distribution by the orphans’ court. This court so held in an exhaustive opinion by the late Chief Justice Gbeen in Smith’s Estate, <a href="/pa/194/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="194 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="912459" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0259-01">194 Pa. 259</a>. The right of the appellee to have payment of his claim from the estate of Stephen Smith, deceased, was adjudicated in that case and for the reasons given in the opinion this decree must be affirmed.</p>
