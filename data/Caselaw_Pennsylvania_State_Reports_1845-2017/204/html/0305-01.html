Superior Ct. 71</a>, the court of common pleas is required to find two facts to be true from the petition before said act is mandatory of an issue; they are the facts of the petitioner’s possession and the (respondent’s) or adversary’s denial of the title. Of the fact of the petitioner’s possession there is no denial, and we so find the fact of the petitioner’s possession in this case; but we do not find as a fact, the denial by this adversary of the petitioner’s title, but an affirmance of the petitioner’s title by his adversary to said <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>coal and mining rights.

If it can be held under the undisputed facts of this case that the Act of June 10, 1893, P. L. 415, applies, on a trial on an issue framed, before the respondent could recover, if the facts found by a jury were with him, he would have to tender the purchase money, and this would be in effect turning an action of ejectment into a proceeding for specific performance of a contract, an existing remedy for the enforcement and determination of contracts that the act of June 10, 1893, was never intended and does not supersede, nor does said act provide a new remedy to settle and adjudicate questions arising out of contract, nor a new remedy for the specific performance or cancelation of contracts relating to the sale of real estate.</p>

As to these facts there is no dispute between the parties, but each charges the other with subsequent default in the performance of his covenants.</p>
    <p id="b338-11" data-blocks='[["BL_338.14",338,[282,2046,1206,241]]]'>The learned judge below held that there was no denial of , plaintiff’s title but that defendant’s claim was in affirmance of it and an assertion of a mere equity in subordination and dependent upon it, under the contract.

The defendant here, it is true, does not deny the plaintiff’s former title or assert in himself a title par<a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>amount, but he does deny the plaintiff’s present title and right of possession by a claim that it has passed out of plaintiff to himself under the agreement. This is exactly the kind of denial of title that is involved in an equitable ejectment on the contract of sale, denial of present title by affirming prior title but averring that it has passed to the vendee. It is conceded on all hands that such an ejectment would lie here and the statute expressly gives the verdict in an issue under the present rule the same force and effect as in an ejectment on an equitable title.</p>

It tends to equalize and assimilate the position of claimants of title whether in or out of possession. As was pointed out in Del. &amp; Hudson Canal Co. v.

The act of March 21,1806, has no bearing on the case, for the act of 1893 does not give a new right enforceable only in the prescribed way, but merely a new remedy for a right always existing, to defend title and possession. And the new remedy is plainly intended to be cumulative only. All the old remedies remain unaffected. Either party may go into equity, the vendor for rescission or cancelation of the contract, and the vendee for specific performance.

In either of these ways he can have his case <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>tried by a jury, but formerly the vendor had no such remedy. On a mere option-which he did not admit had been accepted, as in the present case, he could not sue at law and could only get rid of the cloud on his title by going into equity.

    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[259,667,1188,861]]]'>The act expressly assimilates the proceeding to an equitable ejectment, and there is no valid reason why the remedy should not have a liberal construction in furtherance of the expressed purpose. If the plaintiff is in possession under claim of title and the defendant makes an adverse claim, whether by title paramount or title dependent by contract on his own, the dispute or denial within the contemplation of the act exists and a case for an issue is made out. The control of the court over both the form and the substance of the issue is ample, and should be exercised to fit the requirements of the real controversy between the parties. The defendant on coming in to answer the rule may disclaim, as provided in the act, or he may deny default on his part and ask for a conditional verdict, as if in ejectment, or he may set up a default by the plaintiff and elect to,,recover damages under a plea of set-off, as in an action for breach of contract.
