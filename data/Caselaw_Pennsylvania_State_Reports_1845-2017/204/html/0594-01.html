    <p class="syllabus" id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[303,610,1187,814]]]'>In an action by a brakeman against his employer to recover damages for personal injuries, it appeared that the defendant, a manufacturing company, maintained and operated a railroad through its yards. At the time of the accident plaintiff was riding on an engine, and the engine ran off the track at a curve, resulting in an injury to the plaintiff'. Plaintiff claimed that the accident was due to defective tracks. The particular defect complained of was a lack of solidity, which had existed for sometime, at and near the point where the accident occurred. The tracks were laid upon a cinder bed, which caught fire and burned, or smoldered away, under the surface; this seemed to change the character or condition of the cinders, and weakened the cohering power of the ballast, or support under the rails, which in turn brought about an uneven lowering of the track. The track was also curved just there, and when rounding the bend, the swaying of the engine caused the rail on one side to sink, so that the result was to increase and emphasize the swinging of the engine and cars. This was not so extreme, however, as to cause the place to be considered impassable, nor did it appear from the testimony that an engine had ever before left the track at that point. <em>Held, </em>that the court could not say as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>

The plaintiff, Leo Hammer, was employed as a brakeman, at the time of the accident, which resulted in the injuries here complained of. The negligence charged against the defendant company was the failure to keep its tracks in reasonably safe repair. The jury found that the tracks were defective, and the fact is conceded in the argument for appellant; and it is further contended that the danger in using the tracks was so obvious that the plaintiff assumed all risk of injury therefrom, and for that reason was not entitled to recover. The particular defect complained of was a lack of solidity, which had existed, for sometime, at and near the point where the accident occurred. The tracks were laid upon a cinder bed, which caught fire and burned, or smoldered away, under the surface; this seemed to change the character or condition of the cinders, and weakened the cohering power of the ballast or support under the rails, which in turn brought about an uneven lowering of the track.
