In March, 1892, a properly certified copy of the will and of the proceedings admitting it to probate were filed in the register’s office of Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, and the will and certificates were copied at length in a will book in that office. The husband of the testatrix was the sole devisee under her will. In March, 1892, he conveyed the real estate devised, which was situated in this state, to the grantor of the defendants in the ejectment. In July, 1896, proceedings to contest the will were instituted in Ohio, and terminated in March, 1898, in a judgment in favor of the contestants. In October, 1899, the heirs at law of the testatrix, having secured a conveyance to themselves of the husband’s interest in the real estate, as tenant by the curtesy, brought this action.</p>

The limit of time is now reduced by the Act of 1895, P. L. 305, to three years. No contest having been commenced within the period of time fixed by the act, the probate of the will is conclusive as to the real estate in question, unless the failure of the record to show the entry of a formal and specific decree of probate is a fatal defect which invalidates the proceeding in the register’s office of Allegheny county.

In Holliday v. Ward, <a href="/pa/19/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="19 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="970641" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0485-01">19 Pa. 485</a>, it was said by Black, C. J.: “ It is not usual to enter a formal decree of probate on the record, but the want of it is not fatal. It will be presumed from the issuing of letters testamentary, or perhaps from other acts of the register which he would have no legal right to do in a case where proof of the will had failed.” In Guthrie v. Kerr, <a href="/pa/85/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="85 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="440525" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0303-01">85 Pa. 303</a>, in referring to a paper purporting to be a will, as to which no action had been taken by the register, it was said: “ If it had been expressly declared to be proved, if without that it had been recorded, or letters testamentary or of administration cum testamento annexo had been issued, or perhaps if it had been simply filed, an adjudication by the officer would be presumed.” To the same effect are Coleman’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/163/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="163 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="859028" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0334-01">163 Pa. 334</a>, and other cases.</p>

In the first two the wills were executed in the state, but there is no ground for a distinction between the judgment of a register admitting to probate a domestic will on the oaths of witnesses, and his judgment on a foreign will proved here by a duly certified record. His jurisdiction in both cases is derived from the same source, and the same rule of policy should apply to them: Lovett’s Executors v. Mathews, <a href="/pa/24/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="24 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="9504579" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0330-01">24 Pa. 330</a>.
