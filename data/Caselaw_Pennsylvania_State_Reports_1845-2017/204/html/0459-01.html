All the stockholders named in the articles of association were employees of the Carnegie Steel Company, Limited, which company was the real and beneficial owner of all the capital stock of the railroad, any shares not held in its own name being held by individuals for the purpose of maintaining the organization. At, and before the time of the chartering and construction of the Union Railroad Company, the Carnegie Steel Company, Limited, owned and operated very extensive furnaces and manufacturing plants on each side of the Monongahela river, and along the route of the Union Railroad Company, which establishments were connected, in part at least, by railroad tracks, so that manufactured and raw material, and material in the process of manufacture, could be transferred from one part of the system to another.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b490-6" data-blocks='[["BL_490.6",490,[280,1513,1187,250]]]'>3. The primary object of the promoters and stockholders of the Union Railroad Company, being in effect the Carnegie Steel Company, Limited, was to more perfectly connect these plants with each other, and with the various railroads passing through the Monongahela valley, on either, side of the river.</p>

When the Union Railroad Company in the construction of its road proposed to take land of a width sufficient for two tracks, and over and across the plaintiff’s land, a bond was filed in the court of common pleas by the railroad company for that purpose, and the parties came in communication about the damages, and as to a proposition of sale made by the plaintiff. The plaintiff took legal advice as to whether the defendants had or bad not the right of eminent domain, although this fact does not appear to have been known to the railroad company at the time. The plaintiff objected to the amount of the bond filed, and it was agreed that they would take the company itself without security, rather than have a bond filed which they deemed too small in amount. To express this agreement a letter, dated March 10, 1899, was written by the plaintiff to the railroad company, agreeing that the defendant company might withdraw the bond, and that the damages should be determined without the filing of a bond, the company to have the right to proceed in the meantime with the construction of the road, under its right of eminent domain. The two tracks were thereupon laid over the plaintiff’s land, and the company has been since that time operated over it, and extensive additions and improvements have been made upon the road since that time.</p>

But it does not put him in the commonwealth’s place or clothe the court at his instance with the commonwealth’s general powers of inquiry.

It was held that the charter showing the franchise to build a branch was conclusive, the court saying that if there was bad faith, “the commonwealth would be the proper party to complain.”</p>
    <p id="b495-4" data-blocks='[["BL_495.5",495,[152,1196,1182,396]]]'>In Gaw v. Bristol, etc., R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/196/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="196 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="916800" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0442-01">196 Pa. 442</a>, a similar question was determined in the same way though the operating motive for the incorporation of the railroad was admitted to be the accomplishment of an object in which the corporators had been previously defeated, the distinguished counsel frankly arguing that “ it is not an illegal evasion to accomplish a desired result, lawful in itself, by discovering a legal way to do the thing desired.”</p>
    <p id="b495-5" data-blocks='[["BL_495.6",495,[150,1612,1181,403]]]'>In Oliver v. Thompson’s Run Bridge Co., <a href="/pa/197/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="197 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="918633" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0344-01">197 Pa. 344</a>, it was again held that where a bridge was being constructed across a ravine, in accordance with the charter of a bridge company for that purpose, it was not a good objection under the act of 1871 that the building of the bridge may have been inspired by the desire of a passenger railway company to secure a means of passage over the ravine, which it could not obtain for itself for lack of the right of eminent domain.</p>
    <p id="b495-6" data-blocks='[["BL_495.7",495,[148,2024,1181,406]],["BL_496.1",496,[275,369,1189,397]]]'>These cases are conclusive that under the act 1871 the inquiry is limited to the grant in the charter to do the thing complained of. If the power is there given, the authority of the court to interfere is at an end. The further questions of good faith in obtaining the charter or in acting under it can only be raised by the commonwealth. In the present case, as already said, the real substance of the complaint is not that defendants are doing something that the charter does not authorize but that <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>they are not doing something the charter enjoins, to wit: not furnishing passenger cars at all, and not furnishing stations or freight cars which the public can use as they have a right to use a public railroad. It is a conclusive reply that if the defendants should now provide stations, passenger and freight trains, time schedules, etc., there could be no question of the charter right to do so, and yet plaintiff’s whole complaint would be swept away on the facts.</p>
    <p id="b496-4" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[272,784,1190,614]]]'>Much reliance is placed by appellant on Edgewood Railroad Company’s Appeal, T9 Pa. 257, but the distinction is obvious. There the acts complained of were not omissions of any part of the charter duty (as is averred here), but were acts affirmatively shown not to be authorized by the charter. Such a case was directly within the act of 1871. Mory v. Oley Valley Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/199/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="199 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="922907" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0152-01">199 Pa. 152</a>, was another case of the same kind and the decision was put on the same ground. “ The only possible conclusion,” said our Brother Brown, “ is that it (defendant) has undertaken to exercise a right expressly withheld from it by the statute creating it. . . . For a case like this the act of June 19, 1871, was passed.”</p>
