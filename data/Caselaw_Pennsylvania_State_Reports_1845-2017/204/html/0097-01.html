At the time Mr. Hosack made the contract in suit other similar contracts were taken by Mr. Wick in that neighborhood and in the adjacent and continuous locality for a distance of about forty miles. The Hosack land at the time the agreement was made was about sixteen miles distant from the nearest railroad. The construction of a railroad through or near the premises to take the minerals to a market was contemplated.
