In this space, a staircase was built to the top of the building. A doorway, six feet wide, opened into this space from Fifth avenue, and the stairs started up from the side next to the bank building at a distance of about six feet from the doorway, and the flight of stairs went up from side to side of the space with continuous landings at the level of the stories.</p>

Sometime after the fire the defendant drew up plans for the alteration of his building, including the putting in of an elevator and a change in the number of stories, by making three stories out of a third and fourth and adding what would be a sixth story, and by changing the front, and submitted these plans, or some of them, to the plaintiff, and requested the plaintiff to agree to them. The bank, after considering the matter, <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>declined to agree to the changes. Negotiations were then had between the counsel of the respective parties, and while these were pending, the defendant proceeded with his plan, tore down the staircase, rebuilt it in part, and put a wall ten feet high on top of the walls enclosing the nine by fifteen foot space heretofore described, and extended the staircase up into it, to connect with his new sixth story. This work was done without the knowledge of the plaintiff, it being all inside the building, and done with the rest of the work of rebuilding the burnt portions of defendant’s house, the upper stories of the bank building either being unoccupied, or the tenants not objecting.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b423-3" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[112,952,1184,252]]]'>The plaintiff bank filed the bill herein and applied for a pre* liminary injunction, which was granted, restraining the defendant from further interfering with the stairs, except to protect them with banisters, and from taking down and changing the front and from further proceeding with the work.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[107,1213,1188,924]]]'>The changes actually made by the defendant, up to the time of filing the bill, were: He raised the first platform two or three feet above its former level, for the purpose of giving headroom to reach his elevator from the front door, and to do so was obliged to bring the foot of the stairs two feet nearer to the door than it was before. In raising this platform he made new cuts into the wall of the bank building in which to place the supports, and similar changes were made in the various platforms of the stories above the first, the same being broken into two parts so as to reach the changed position of the doors in his building, and the headway over the stairs in one or two places was reduced to as low as seven feet. The stairs, as so altered by him, wore much less conformable to the windows in the front than they were before, and the light to the staircase is materially interfered with. This the defendant claims will be practically remedied if he is allowed to change the front according to his design. The platforms of the stairs still conform to the stories of the plaintiff’s building.</p>

All the other doors of the elevator are into defendant’s building on the west side of the elevator shaft, and not into the stairway. Persons using the elevator instead of the stairs to reach the upper stories of defendant’s building, enter through the door, the middle of which is on the outer line of the two properties, and proceed thence to the left to the elevator, the stairway starting up on the right. There is no place in which the plaintiff could put an elevator opening to his building in the space used for the stairway, except by removing the stairway.</p>

Of this the plaintiff complains that it will cause the whole of the nine-foot space to appear to be a part of defendant’s building, and that the change is unnecessary.</p>

That' the joint erection and occupation of the stairway and the area in which it is located were by agreement is known here just as it is implied in a prescription, but in the absence of any evidence either written or oral as to the terms of the agreement, the court can only determine what it was by what was done without dispute by the parties on the land at the time and subsequently. That is the test of the nature and extent of an easement by prescription and it must be the test here. The inference from the evidence is not that each party gave the other an unlimited right to use the common area for such purposes and in such manner as he might desire or even for general use for a stairway, but that the right was definitely confined to the common area as it was established by the parties at the time and as it continued to be jointly used.</p>
