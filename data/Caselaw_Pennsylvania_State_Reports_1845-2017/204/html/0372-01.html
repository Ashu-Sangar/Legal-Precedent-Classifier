It will be observed that, although the title to the real estate purchased under the act of 1851 vested in the directors of the poor provided for in the said act, the money necessary to purchase land and erect buildings and maintain the poor was raised by an additional general tax levied upon the whole county by the county commissioners.

L. 539. The defendants, on the other hand, contend that the provisions of the Act of June 4, 1879, P. L. 78, entitled “An act to create poor districts and to authorize purchase of lands and erection of buildings, to furnish relief and give employment to the destitute poor and paupers of this commonwealth,” apply. Under section 11 of the latter act it is made the duty of the county commissioners “ from time to time to receive, maintain, provide for and employ all paupers, poor and indigent persons within their district entitled to relief <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>and having a settlement therein. The duties heretofore performed by overseers of poor within such districts shall be done and performed by said commissioners, with the same rights and subject to the same penalties.” The provisions of this act, under which the county of Beaver is a single poor district, undoubtedly give the commissioners authority to do and perform all the several acts in reference to the maintenance and employment of the poor, from the performance of which the plaintiffs’ bill asks to have them enjoined and restrained, and this seems to be conceded by the plaintiffs unless, as they claim, the said act is unconstitutional. The unconstitutionality of the Act of June 4, 1879, P. L. 78, is, therefore, the question which, under various phases, constitutes the real bone of contention in the ease. It is assailed by the plaintiffs on three several grounds:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b405-4" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[187,1091,616,33]]]'>First. That the title is defective.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_405.5",405,[140,1143,1183,506]]]'>Second. That it is local and special, (a) in that it requires, under the 3d and 4th sections thereof a vote of the qualified electors of each county to determine whether or not it shall have a poorhouse; (i) in that it provides in section 20 that “ when any county embraces within its limits an incorporated city, such city and the territory embraced within it shall not be included in such poor district, and- such city shall not be in anyway affected by this law, but all the other parts of such county shall in such cases compose the poor district of that county.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b405-6" data-blocks='[["BL_405.6",405,[140,1660,1183,609]]]'>The question of the constitutionality of the act does not seem to have been argued in the court below, the court remarking in its opinion, “ The court has not had the benefit of the argument of counsel in passing upon this question and, when the bill was presented, the act of 1879 was not considered by either side.” The objection to the title seems to have been raised in the mind of the plaintiffs still later, as is shown by the fact that the argument in relation thereto is contained in an insert in the argument. The question, however, is of such importance that we waive all technicalities and consider the question as if it had been properly argued in the court below and duly presented here.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b405-7" data-blocks='[["BL_405.7",405,[141,2278,1181,147]],["BL_406.1",406,[274,368,1185,140]]]'>1. As to the title. In Com. v. Lloyd, <a href="/pa-super/2/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Pa. Super. 6" data-case-ids="270640" data-case-paths="/pa-super/2/0006-01">2 Pa. Superior Ct. 6</a>, the subject of the sufficiency of the title of an act of assembly was very fully considered and all our cases to that date care<a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>fully analyzed and, as a result, it was there stated that “ it is not necessary that the title of an act should be a complete index of its contents.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.4",406,[270,525,1190,1750]]]'>“ If the title fairly gives notice of the subject of the act so as reasonably to lead to an inquiry into the body of the bill, it is all that is necessary.” The title of this bill is general but it is comprehensive. It does not descend to details but no one interested in the general subject of the formation of poor districts, the purchase of lands and the erection of buildings and the furnishing of relief and giving employment to the destitute poor would not have such general notice as would lead him to make inquiry into the body of the bill. There is nothing in the bill which does not relate to the general subject outlined in the title. The opinion of Mr. Justice Mitchell in Sugar Notch Borough, <a href="/pa/192/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="192 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="908988" data-case-paths="/pa/192/0349-01">192 Pa. 349</a>, applies in many respects to all the questions raised in this case. It is there said : “ It must not be lost sight of that the attitude of courts is not one of hostility to acts whose constitutionality is attacked. On the contrary, all the presumptions are in their favor and courts are not to be astute in finding or sustaining objections. The evil at which the constitution was aimed is thus stated with great clearness by the present chief justice in Road in Phoenixville, <a href="/pa/109/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="109 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="542296" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0044-01">109 Pa. 44</a>: “ The design and scope of this constitutional amendment, adopted in 1864, are readily understood when we consider the mischief which it was intended to remedy. Prior to that date the vicious practice had obtained of incorporating in one bill a variety of distinct and independent subjects of legislation. The real purpose of the bill was often, and sometimes intentionally, disguised by a misleading title or covered by the all comprehensive phrase, ‘ and for other purposes,’ with which the title of many omnibus bills concluded. Members of legislature, as well as the general public, were thus misled or kept in ignorance as to the true character of proposed legislation. This being the evil intended to be remedied, the constitutional requirement as to the title is not to be strained to apply to cases not really within its reasonable intent.” See also Com. v. Gilligan, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20Pa.%20204" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="195 Pa. 204">195 Pa. 204</a>.</p>

The objection to the bill that it is not general in its application is not well founded. It relates to every county within the commonwealth. It is true that it excepts cities from its opera<a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>tion, but if the legislature has power to legislate for the government of cities and provide affirmative legislation for their peculiar needs, and not only so, but to legislate for the several classes of cities, how much more should it have power to except cities in general from the operation of laws which are not applicable to their peculiar needs? Nor is the objection a valid one that because the city of Philadelphia and the county of Philadelphia are coextensive and the law excepts cities from its operation that it is, therefore, local. If for any reason the boundaries of the city of Philadelphia should be reduced so as not to be identical with the boundaries of the county or, if the boundaries of the county were enlarged so as to extend beyond the present limits of the city, the law would apply to it as well as to other counties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="Au7q" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[117,1095,1185,654]]]'>3. There is no similarity between this act and that of June 23, 1885, P. L. 142, relating to the repeal of section 1 of the fence law of 1700,1 Sm. L. 13. The law itself in that case was not to become effective within the limits of any county unless so determined by a vote of the people, and, inasmuch as the vote might be in favor of the repeal in one county and against it in another, the operation of the law would become local and it was so held in Frost v. Cherry, <a href="/pa/122/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="122 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1948380" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0417-01">122 Pa. 417</a> ; but in this case it is not the question of the operation of the law which is left to a vote of the people, but simply the question of the purchase of real estate under its provisions, the law remaining in force within the county, whether the vote be for or against the purchase of such real estate.</p>

The property belonged to the county notwithstanding the fact that the title is in “ the directors of the poor and of the house of employment for the county of Beaver,” instead of “ Beaver county poor district,” as provided in the act of 1879. The property was purchased by the levy of a general tax and each individual citizen is as much interested in the property in the one case as in the other.</p>

In the other, the machinery for carrying out the provisions of the law is entirely within the bands of the county commissioners and is thereby simplified and the expenses of administration presumably reduced.</p>
