The affidavit of defense admitted the incorporation. The suit was defended and prosecuted to judgment. After the recovery of judgment it appeared that the West Penn Sheet Steel Company was not a corporation, but was a partnership, although it transacted business through a president, secretary and board of directors; that a charter had been procured under the name of West Penn Steel Sheet Company but had never been acted under or accepted. The plaintiff in the judgment filed a bill in equity to charge the partners individually with the judgment, on the ground that their action in maintaining an organization in similitude of a corporation and in defending the suit as a corporation was a fraud. A demurrer was filed to the bill. <em>Held, </em>that the demurrer should be sustained.</p>

Turning to the bill for the reason, we find therein the only one given to be “ that in preparing to bring its suit, your orator was informed and led to believe that the said defendants were really doing business as a corporation of the state of Pennsylvania.” Who so informed it ? For aught the bill shows, it may have been an utter stranger without any knowledge whatever as tó the character in which defendants carried on their business. It is not alleged in the bill, that the defendants or any of them, or any person representing them, misinformed the plaintiff or misled it in bringing suit against the corporation. The plaintiff had the means of discovering whether or not the defendants were incorporated or not. The Act of April 29, 1874, P.

Let us see what facts are alleged that they have since done or omitted constituting a fraud. It is charged in the bill: first, that they caused an appearance to be entered for them admitting their corporate existence and defending on the merits, knowing that they were not a corporation and that it was a partnership debt. This in effect is, that they did not plead <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>“ nul tiel corporation ” but pleaded “non assumpsit ” and went to trial on the merits. The penalty for this would be that as to the claim sued upon they are forever estopped from denying that they are a corporation. But it would be strange indeed, that if the plaintiff alleged that defendants contracted the debt as a corporation and the defendants did not deny it in their pleadings, that thereby they committed a fraud upon the plaintiff which rendered every stockholder in the corporation individually liable as partners.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[316,824,1186,510]]]'>The next allegation of fact is that the defendants carried on their said business in the similitude of a corporation, having a president, secretary and board of directors, and procured a charter under the name of the West Penn Steel Company. As we have heretofore said, the plaintiff could not have been deceived by this if it had examined the records. There it would have found the correct name of the concern and whether it could hold them as a corporation or as a partnership. It is no fraud or index of fraud for a partnership to have a president, secretary and board of directors.</p>
