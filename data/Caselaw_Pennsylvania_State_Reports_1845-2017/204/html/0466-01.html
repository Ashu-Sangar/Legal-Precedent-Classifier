From the overwhelming weight of the facts and circumstances, and inferences therefrom, it irresistibly follows that there was no such partnership; but even if the purchase money was paid by him—a fact unsupported by any credible testimony, and unequivocally denied by his wife—there is no evidence that at the execution and delivery of the conveyance to Mrs. Carson, it was understood by both her and her husband that she was taking the title in trust for her husband: <a href="/citations/?q=199%20Pa.%20635" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="199 Pa. 635">199 Pa. 635</a>.</p>

It may be conceded that the presumption ordinarily was so at that time. But the income from her separate property was hers. If the hotel had been leased to a third party, the rent would unquestionably have been her separate estate, after as well as before marriage. The conduct of the parties, as appears from the undisputed evidence, shows that it continued to be so regarded and treated by both the parties here. The income from the business was handed over to her, deposited in her name in her own bank account just as it had been before the marriage, drawn out only on her checks, and when used to pay for the property now in suit, the title was with knowledge and assent of plaintiff taken in her name, and so remained for thirteen years until this suit. The action is an equitable ejectment on tbe ground of a resulting trust from a purchase with plaintiff’s money. Without stopping to discuss the other objections raised in the argument, it is enough to say that plaintiff wholly failed to show that the purchase money was his. As the judge could not have sustained a finding for plaintiff on the admitted facts, he was right in directing a verdict for defendant.</p>
