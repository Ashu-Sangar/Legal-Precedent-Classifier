    "head_matter": "Rankin Regular Baptist Church v. Edwards, Appellant.\nDeed\u2014Conveyance to church corporation for mission purposes.\nA conveyance to a church corporation of a lot of ground \u201c to have and to hold the said lot of ground for mission school purposes,\u201d without any provision that a building should be erected on the land, or that the lot shall be used exclusively for the purpose named, and without any provision for reversion, or limitation over in case of nonuser, vests in the grantee a good marketable title in fee simple.\nSubmitted Nov. 7, 1902.\nAppeal, No. 198, Oct. T., 1902, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., Oct. Term, 1902, No. 19, on the case stated in suit of Rankin Regular Baptist Church v. Isaac R. Edwards.\nBefore Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated to determine the marketable title to real estate.\nFrazer, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nBy agreement in writing duly executed the defendant agreed to purchase from the plaintiff a lot of ground described in the case stated, which the plaintiff obtained from the First Baptist Church of Braddock. The facts agreed upon are as follows :\nOn April 25,1898, the trustees under the will of W. G. Hawkins conveyed to three persons named as trustees of the First Baptist Church of Braddock, for the consideration of $600, the lot of ground in controversy, \u201c to have and to hold the said lot of ground for mission school purposes, hereditaments.\u201d etc. The trustees afterwards, upon the incorporation of the First Baptist Church of Braddock, conveyed the lot to the corporation, to have and to hold the same \u201cfor mission school purposes.\u201d Upon delivery of the deed from the Hawkins trustees a small church building was erected upon the lot by the congregation of the Braddock Baptist Church, in which a Mission Sunday School was organized and conducted. From the Mission Sunday School a congregation was formed which was lately incorporated as the \u201c Rankin Regular Baptist Church,\u201d and thereupon the lot was conveyed by the First Baptist Church of Braddock to the plaintiff \u201cto have and to hold the same for mission school purposes,\u201d etc. In a subsequent deed, however, made for the purpose of correcting an error in the plaintiff\u2019s name as grantee, the words for \u201c mission school purposes \u201d were omitted. Defendant now refuses to accept the lot, alleging that plaintiff\u2019s title is not a \u201c good marketable title in fee simple.\u201d If we find that plaintiff is possessed of a \u2018\u2018good marketable title in fee simple,\u201d judgment to be entered in favor of plaintiff for $1,700 : if not, then judgment to be entered for defendant. The sole question here is, do the words \u201c for mission school purposes,\u201d in the deed of the Hawkins trustees, raise a condition. We are of opinion that they do not. It is not provided in the deed that a building shall be erected upon the lot and be used exclusively for \u201c mission school purposes,\u201d nor is any penalty established by which the lot will revert in case of the non user of the ground for the purpose named. Under these circumstances, the authorities are uniform that a conditional estate is not created. We have not been referred to any case in which a grant reciting a special purpose without other words has been held to be a condition. Our examination of the oases upon the question shows the contrary to be the law : Cook v. Trimble, 9 Watts, 15; First M. E. Church of Columbia v. Old Columbia Public Ground Co., 108 Pa. 608; Wilkes-Barre v. Wyoming Historical, etc., Society, 134 Pa. 616.\nIn this case, in our opinion, the words \u201c for mission school purposes \u201d do not indicate a clear intent to create a condition. We, therefore, conclude that plaintiff has a marketable title to the property, and do now enter judgment in favor of plaintiff and against defendant for the sum of $1,700, with costs of suit.\nError assigned was the judgment of the court.\nH. M. /Scott, for appellent.\nC. Elmer Bown, for appellee.\nNovember 11, 1902:"
