L. 15, to review the evidence. The effect of the evidence was for the jury, not for the court.\nThe onfy defense was insanity and that also was for the jury. The burden of proof was upon the prisoner, and there was no error in so charging. The judge\u2019s language that the jury must be \u201c satisfied that the defendant was insane when he committed the act \u201d tended to call the attention of the jury to the distinction between the degree of proof required of the prisoner on that subject and the requirement of the commonwealth to satisfy the jury of the prisoner\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The expression was in aid of the prisoner\u2019s case and could not have been reasonably understood in any other sense.\nJudgment affirmed and record remitted to the court below for execution according to law.",

    "head_matter": "Commonwealth v. Kilpatrick, Appellant.\nCriminal law\u2014Murder\u2014Elements of murder of the first degree.\nA conviction of murder of the first degree will be sustained where the evidence shows that prior to the killing the prisoner procured a pistol, threatened to let his victim\u2019s \u201c blood out on the street,\u201d and finally fired the pistol at a vital part.\nCriminal law\u2014\u25a0Murder\u2014Insanity\u2014Burden of proof .\nOn the -trial of an indictment for murder where the defense is insanity, the burden of proving insanity is upon the prisoner. In such a case an instruction that the jury must be \u201c satisfied that the defendant was insane when he committed the act,\u201d is proper, since it tends to call the attention of the jury to the distinction between the degree of proof required of the prisoner on that subject, and the requirement on the commonwealth to satisfy the jury of the prisoner\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The instruction is in aid of the prisoner\u2019s case.\nArgued Nov. 10, 1902.\nAppeal, No. 280, Jan. T., 1902, by defendant, from judgment of O. & T., Del. Co., March T., 1902, on verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree in case of Commonwealth v. Robert Kilpatrick.\nBefore Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nIndictment for murder.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the case.\nVerdict of guilty of murder of the first degree.\nErrors assigned were:\n1. Under all the evidence the defendant should have been acquitted on the ground of insanity.\n2. Under all the evidence the defendant should not have been convicted of a greater crime than murder in the second degree.\n3. The learned court below erred in charging the jury as follows : \u201c If you are satisfied that the defendant was insane when he committed this act, insane to the extent that he was irresponsible, you should acquit him on the-ground of insanity.\u201d\nJohn M. Broomall, for appellant.\nJosiah Smith, district attorney, for appellee, was not heard.\nNovember 11, 1902:"
