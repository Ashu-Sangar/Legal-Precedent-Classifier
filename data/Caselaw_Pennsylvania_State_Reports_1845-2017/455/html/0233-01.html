Upon appellant’s resignation from Le-high to take a position with another firm, he demanded delivery of the policy to him. This denied, the present suit in equity was brought to compel transfer of ownership of the policy, including all dividends thereon, to plaintiff. The complaint also prayed that the employer be declared a trustee of the policy for plaintiff’s benefit, and that it be ordered to pay to plaintiff an amount equal to all of the premiums paid on the policy from the date of issuance, together with dividends and interest thereon. After a trial the complaint was dismissed. The court <em>en bane </em>overruled exceptions to the chancellor’s adjudication, and entered a final decree, from which this appeal was taken.</p>

The further additional payment to Mr. Anthony to cover the payment of income tax incurred by reason of the enhanced bonus is clear indication that the f1077.00 was not compensation; this additional payment was obviously designed to make Mr. Anthony whole with respect to tax paid by him on income purportedly his but which was not in fact his and which he never actually received. Appellant’s claim that the employer Company has been unjustly enriched at his expense seems clearly to be an attempt to make of the Company’s tax manipulation a windfall to himself. But the fact that fictitious accounting, which we of course do not condone, may entail liability to the taxing authorities does not serve to vest a right of action in this appellant, who was in no way injured.</p>

Now then was this payment of $1077.00 charged in any way to John P. Anthony? A. The amount was credited to John P. Anthony, yes. Q. Now can you explain to the court just how this was done? A. The law states that it would be discriminatory to take a key man insurance policy out on one man and not all the employees of the company and therefore you could not deduct, the partnership could not deduct the amount of the premium paid. When I related this to Mr. Perose I stated and recommended that it would not be contradictory that if he issued this amount to the New York Life but if John Anthony would pick this amount up on his personal tax return <em>&lt;md if we included an amount in Ms bonus to pay the </em>taxes— . . .

Did you have anything to do with including the amount of income tax in the money which was allowed as a bonus to Mr. Anthony? . . . [objection made and overruled] A. <em>Yes, </em>because I was very closely in confidence with the partnership and the partners therein even to the extent that the $5000.00 check in September 30, 1967 is in my own handwriting and, therefore, I determined in what percentage bracket the tax impact of this $1077.00 would fall, and therefore, mentioned that to Mr. Perose or the partners as to what <em>could he included therein to cover the taw. </em>Q. Did you ever have any conversation with Mr. Anthony in connection with the $1077.00 that was paid for the premium for this policy? A. Yes sir. <em>... I mentioned to Mr. Anthony </em>that, <em>what accounting procedures I was implementing </em>for the best tax advantage of all parties concerned, and that everyone would benefit therefrom, <em>and if he had any objection thereto that he would advise me since I did include this amount on his W-B or </em>issue <em>to </em>him a 1099. Q. What did he say? A. He, not quoting exact words, but it was agreeable even to the fact that for two years I filed his personal tax so that we both had adequate knowledge of what procedures we were following. ... Q. At that time was there anything said about the $1077.00, the amount of the premium? A. Just that I asked him if he was receiving ample dollars to pay the tax thereon. Q.

The practice was that in December of each year there would be a listing made of the salary that had been paid to Mr. Anthony on a weekly basis, a listing of expenses <em>and a listing of other benefits that were paid to him or for him and on his </em>behalf, correct? A. <em>It was his wages which at that time was $200.00 a week. It was the expenses that occurred plus the gift that we gave to him at the end of the year which </em>

Instead of accepting the seventeen-year record of written documentation and the <em>admission </em>of the employer’s partner which is unequivocal, the majority <em>selects </em>portions of the testimony of the employer’s accountant and concludes that the employee “knew of and acquiesced” in a tax avoidance device, and “understood” that his W-2 forms did not reflect his true compensation.

He did testify that he discussed with his <em>employer </em>a tax avoidance device but <em>the employee was never present </em>in these discussions with the employer. Employers all over America may be discussing tax avoidance devices with their accountants—but those discussions surely cannot legally affect an employee’s rights. Moreover, when we examine <em>exactly </em>what the accountant told the employee, we find <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>only very <em>equivocal testimony, </em>and <em>no testimony that a tax avoidance device </em>was ever discussed with the employee. The accountant was most cautious in his testimony about his discussions with the employee. We must examine <em>exactly </em>what the accountant said, not what we think he said. All of the accountant’s testimony about a tax avoidance device concerns Ms conversations <em>with the employer—not the employee. </em>When asked what he told the employee, the accountant said he mentioned “the accounting procedures . . . for the best tax advantages of all parties . . . everyone would benefit. ..TMs is a far cry from the majority conclusion that the employee was told his payroll deductions were a sham.

He testified, according to the majority, that he helped the employee prepare his tax returns. So what? He never said he told the employee that the employee was not to receive any insurance benefit from the yearly payroll deduction. In addition, the accountant admitted that he helped the employee with Ms tax return for <em>only two yews </em>and <em>he could not remember </em>what years. This help could have occurred years after the yearly payroll deduction began. The accountant also admitted that for over fifteen years he had nothing to do with determining the total amount of the employee’s yearly compensation. He testified that he would tell a partner the approximate amount that would have to be included in the employee’s bonus to pay taxes on the payroll deduction for insurance—but the partner, not the accountant, then determined the total amount of the employee’s regular draws and bonus compensation. The accountant had nothing to do, by his own admission, with the amount of the employee’s gross pay and did not participate in the year-end compensation and bonus review between the employee and a partner. The accountant <em>hnew nothing </em>about conversations between the employee and the employer concerning the employee’s true total compensation.
