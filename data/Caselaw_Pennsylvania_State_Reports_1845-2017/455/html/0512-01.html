During the time those funds were absent from the hands of the accountant, the residuary legatees were deprived of the earnings on those fund [sic]. On the other hand, the [appellants] received the benefit from the use of those funds without any liability therefor. Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion that a reasonable interest charge is wholly equitable.”</p>

L. 373, Art. VII, §718, <em>as amended, </em>72 P.S. §2485-718(c). The estate is under no duty to pay the tax; thus when it does pay the tax the legatee benefits directly. Such payment resembles a loan and since the payment is working in his favor an interest charge on the legatee is both reasonable and equitable.</p>
    <p id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[173,712,1153,637]]]'>On the other hand, the Federal estate tax is a tax on the transfer of property and liability for the payment of the tax is imposed directly on the estate by Section 2002 of the Federal Estate and Grift Tax Code. The Pennsylvania Estate Tax Apportionment Act operates to equalize the impact of the Federal estate tax by apportioning the tax burden among those persons with am interest in property includable in the estate. Although the ultimate impact of the tax may be passed along to the beneficiaries, when the executor pays the Federal estate tax he is fulfilling <em>his </em>duty; there is no loan feature.</p>

Such a consideration could reasonably be anticipated on the Legislature’s behalf where they have drafted such extensive legislation. Since the Estate Tax Apportionment Act has been amended numerous times since its inception, the legislature has had ample opportunity to act on this matter. We deem it unwise for this Court to add such a provision to the Act now.</p>
