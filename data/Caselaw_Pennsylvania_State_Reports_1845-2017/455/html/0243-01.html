As to the first basis for the finding of unfair competition, we point out that Famularo was free to compete and obtain this contract so long as it did not involve the use of <em>confidential </em>customer information. <em>See Morgan’s Home Equipment Corp. v. Martucci, </em><a href="/pa/390/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="390 Pa. 618" data-case-ids="1275672" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0618-01">390 Pa. 618</a>, 623, <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a><a href="/citations/?q=136%20A.2d%20838" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="136 A.2d 838">136 A. 2d 838</a>, 842 (1957). Trilog had a contract with Girard to perform work which was limited to the shareholders’ records and never performed any work involving trustees’ records. It is difficult to see what <em>confidential </em>customer information Famularo could have used in his contract with Girard. Although the trial court ultimately concluded that Famularo used <em>confidential </em>information, there are no findings which sustain that conclusion. The trial court did find that the trustees’ records and the shareholders’ records (1) were in the same department; (2) were related in physical location; (3) had the same officers; (4) differed in the number of employees; (5) used the same cage; and (6) overlapped to a minor extent. None of these findings, however, shed any light on what <em>confidential </em>customer information was used by Famularo in his contract with Girard. To the contrary, many key findings of the trial court point to exactly an opposite conclusion. The trial court found that (1) Trilog (and, thus, Famularo) never worked with the trustees’ records; (2) Famularo’s information was slight as to the trustees’ records when he left Trilog; and (3) Famularo only acquired the bulk of his information about the trustees’ records after he left Trilog.</p>

      <em>General </em>information as distinguished from <em>confidential </em>information which Famularo may have obtained about Girard is irrelevant. To enjoin use of information, it “must be the particular secrets of the complaining employer, not general secrets of the trade in which he is engaged . . . .” <em>Macbeth-Evans Glass Co. v. Schnelbach, </em><a href="/pa/239/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="239 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="995954" data-case-paths="/pa/239/0076-01">239 Pa. 76</a>, 85, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20A.%20688" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="86 A. 688">86 A. 688</a>, 691 (1913).

    <p id="b313-3" data-blocks='[["BL_313.4",313,[169,628,1153,648]]]'>The second basis for the trial court’s conclusion that Famularo unfairly competed rested on the following two findings: (1) Famularo proposed a revision in the shareholders’ record system in an attempt to oust Trilog <em>“at least as to procedure and computer uses” </em>and (2) Famularo proposed a reorganization of the entire Corporate Trust Department. These two findings, as other findings of the trial court, are not related to the use of any <em>confidential </em>customer information. Neither of these proposals were ever implemented. Even if they had been, no <em>confidential </em>information was used by Famularo in these proposals.</p>
    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[170,1288,1153,974]]]'>Girard’s Corporate Trust Department used data processing many years before Trilog or Famularo began any work at Girard. The department had used various computer programs which were developed by its own data processing staff and the department had its own computer. Trilog was hired to develop and improve the data processing system for the shareholders’ records. The computer program which Trilog developed was in a “computer language” which could not be used in Girard’s own computer, and Girard, therefore, had to lease computer time from Trilog for the shareholders’ record system. At the time the unimplemented proposals referred to by the trial court were made, Trilog had completed its initial work on the shareholders’ record system and had received substantial compensation. Much of its income from Girard, at the time of the above proposals, involved the leasing of Trilog’s computer for the shareholders’ record system.</p>

The proposal to reorganize the Corporate Trust Department involved the converting of all the computer programs of Girard into the same “computer language” so that Girard would not be required to lease outside computer time and, thus, would fully utilize its own computer. No <em>confidential </em>information was used or required. Any intelligent and creative programmer, even if he had never worked at Girard, could have made the same recommendations if he had a minimum of general information about data processing in Girard’s Corporate Trust Department. If the proposal had been implemented, Trilog, of course, would have been “ousted” and would no longer have been needed to provide leased computer time. But again, we repeat, Famularo was not barred from competing with Trilog or ousting Trilog from its work with Girard. He was only bound not to unfairly compete with Trilog by using <em>confidential </em>customer information acquired as a Trilog employee. In <em>Van Products Co. v. General Welding &amp; Fabricating Co., </em><a href="/pa/419/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="419 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1896850" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0248-01">419 Pa. 248</a>, 262-263, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20769" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="213 A.2d 769">213 A. 2d 769</a>, 777 (1965), we said: “It is clear that this jurisdiction affords protection to an employer’s confidential customer information. ...

Famularo in effect promised not to practice his profession <em>anywhere for anyone </em>in developing a shareholders’ record system. His promise is similar to a covenant by an attorney not to try murder cases <em>anywhere for anyone </em>because he gained experience in trying murder cases from his former employer, or a covenant by a bricklayer not to build an apartment house <em>anywhere for anyone </em>because his former employer gave him his first opportunity to use his bricklaying talent in building an apartment house.

That covenant is divisible into two parts: (1) not to come under the employ of any customer or client of Trilog’s, and (2) not to come under the employ of any business or individual with which the employee has come into contact or acquaintance principally through his employment with Trilog. Each part is broader than necessary for the protection of the employer’s interest and neither are divisible in any way which would allow a narrower restriction to remain intact without a rewriting. <em>See Reading Aviation Service, Inc. v.

This prohibits them from accepting with any customer or client of Trilog, <em>any employment anywhere. </em>There is no restriction on the kind of employment prohibited or upon the territory covered. By its terms, the promise prevents the employee from accepting employment with a Trilog customer in <em>any </em>capacity. It covers employment totally unrelated to whatever work the employee performed for Trilog. Although Marabella and Gawrys worked as data processing employees for Trilog, they are barred from working as janitors, bank managers, truck drivers, doctors, lawyers, or Indian chiefs—for any customer or client of Trilog. Such a covenant is a completely unreasonable <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>restraint of trade and cannot be upheld. Moreover, there is no limitation as to territory. Such a failure to limit the territory application of the covenant also renders the covenant invalid.</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[195,527,1162,975]]]'>In the second part of the covenant, Marabella and Gawrys promised not to come under the employ of any business or individual with which they came into contact or acquaintance principally through their employment with Trilog. This promise is more unreasonable and burdensome than the first promise. It prohibits, as does the first, <em>any employment anywhere </em>and thus is not related to the protection of any reasonable employer interest. Such a covenant is so far-reaching, that it becomes ludicrous. It <em>bars </em>Marabella and Gawrys from accepting employment as bartenders in Ireland from the father of the sister-in-law of the aunt of the elevator operator whom Marabella and Gawrys happens to meet in a <em>bar </em>in Scranton while on Trilog’s business. Such a restraint is illegal. Therefore, we conclude that both parts of the covenant not to compete in the contracts of Marabella and Gawrys are void and will not be rewritten by this Court.</p>
