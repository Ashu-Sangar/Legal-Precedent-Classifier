Appellee Schonek’s appointment was to an office which was not vacant prior to the Senate’s final adjournment. The Governor did not submit any nominees for <em>permanent appointment </em>to the three offices vacant prior to the Senate’s final adjournment. A permanent appointment requires the submission of a nominee to the Senate under the second sentence of article IV, section 8(b). After the Senate’s final adjournment, the Governor made <em>temporary appointments </em>to these offices. Such appointments under the first sentence of article IV, section 8(b), do not require the submission of nominees to the Senate. The relevant part of article IV, section 8(b), provides: “(b) Except as may now or hereafter be otherwise provided in this Constitution as to appellate and other judges, [the Governor] may, during the recess of the Senate, fill vacancies happening in offices to which he appoints by granting commissions expiring at the end of its session and fill vacancies happening in the office of Auditor General or State Treasurer or in any other elective office he is authorized to fill.

More recently, in <em>Ritenour v. Peirce, </em><a href="/pa/442/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="442 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1935401" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0001-01">442 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=272%20A.2d%20900" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="272 A.2d 900">272 A. 2d 900</a> (1971), in an alternate ground for the decision, the rationale of <em>La-jean </em>was followed. <em>See Creamer v.

In <em>Ritenour, </em>a temporary recess appointment was upheld to an office which was vacant prior to the Senate’s final adjournment. The appellants have not questioned the rationale or holdings of either <em>Lafean </em>or <em>Ritenour. </em>They point out, however, that in both <em>Lafean </em>and <em>Ritenour, </em>the Governor had submitted a nominee to the Senate prior to the Senate’s final adjournment. In <em>Lafean, </em>the Senate rejected the nominee and in <em>Ritenour </em>the Senate failed to act; whereas in the cases before us, the Governor did not submit nominees to the Senate prior to its final adjournment. The lack of any nominations, according to the appellants, should preclude temporary recess appointments, after the Senate’s final adjournment, to offices which were vacant prior to the final adjournment.</p>

While it is gen<a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>erally true, that the word “shall” in a constitution is interpreted as a mandatory provision, it does not follow that non-submission of a nominee under the second sentence precludes the Governor from exercising the authority separately granted under the first sentence which contains no specific limitation on the authority granted except as to the time limit of the temporary recess appointment. Article IV, section 8(b), does not say that submission of a nominee under the second sentence is a prerequisite to the exercise of the authority granted in the first sentence. We would have to read such a provision into the Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b239-3" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[171,958,1149,1029]]]'>The appellants, as members of the legislative branch of government, have asked the judicial branch to declare an act of the executive branch to be in violation of the Constitution. In the face of constitutional challenges we have frequently said that the legislative acts of the legislative branch, the General Assembly, in which the supreme legislative power is vested (article II, section 1), are to be presumed constitutional unless clearly shown to be otherwise. The judicial branch must apply that same restraint and that same test in the face of constitutional challenges to the executive acts of the executive branch, the Governor, in whom the supreme executive power is vested (article IV, section 1). Such acts must be presumed constitutional unless clearly shown to be otherwise. In <em>Lafean, </em>this Court refused to read into article IV, section 8(b), any limitation on the Governor’s explicit authority to make temporary recess appointments.

The argument was made that if the Governor could make a temporary recess appointment of a person already rejected by the Senate, the constitutional provision requiring the consent of the <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>Senate would be meaningless. <em>Lafean, </em>nonetheless, refused to read any limitation into the constitutional authority of the Governor to make temporary recess appointments, saying that: “[t]he constitutional provision places no express limitation upon the choice of the Governor in appointing to fill vacancies.” <a href="/pa/261/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="261 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="1042275" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0057-01">261 Pa. at 62</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20494" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="104 A. 494">104 A. at 495</a>. <em>Lafean </em>rejected the argument that: “the people, in adopting the constitutional provision in question [placed] an implied limitation upon the power of the Governor to fill vacancies by reason of also having provided that appointments for regular terms of service, or unexpired terms, should require the approval of the Senate.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20494" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="104 A. 494">Id.</a> Lafean </em>distinguished between the Governor’s authority to fill vacancies for a <em>temporary period </em>and his authority to <em>permanently </em>fill vacancies for a <em>full or unexpvred term. </em>The temporary appointment authority does not require the consent of the Senate under any circumstances, because there is no such provision in the Constitution. The authority to appoint <em>permanently </em>for a full term, or the balance of an unexpired term, is the only executive authority requiring Senate consent. <em>Lefean </em>said: “It thus appears the Governor is authorized to fill a vacancy temporarily . . . but not for a full or unexpired term. . . .” <em><a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20494" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="104 A. 494">Id.</a></em>

Since that time, article IV, section 8 <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>(b), has been amended and the wording changed with no indication in the changes that the Governor’s authority to make <em>temporary appointments </em>was limited by the provision which subjects <em>permanent appointments </em>to Senate confirmation. In fact, the 1967 amendment to article IV, section 8(b), appears to strengthen the rationale of Lafean—the executive authority to appoint <em>temporary appointees </em>is distinct and separate from the authority to appoint <em>permanent appointees. </em>The 1874 Constitution said that the Governor “shall have the power to <em>fill all vacancies that may happen, </em>in offices to which he may appoint, <em>during the recess </em>of the Senate, by granting Commissions . . . .” (Emphasis added.)

The two phrases read together arguably meant that a vacancy had to happen during the recess in order for the Governor to exercise his authority to make temporary appointments. That argument has been considerably weakened, if not destroyed, by the 1967 amendment. The phrase, <em>during the recess of the Senate, </em>was relocated and now can only modify the words, <em>[the </em>Governor] <em>may. </em>The phrase cannot be read as modifying the words, <em>vacancies happening in offices. </em>The phrase, <em>during the recess of the Senate, </em>now only tells us when the Governor may temporarily appoint— <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>not when the vacancy must occur.

The Governor had not submitted any nominees to the Senate even though the vacancies existed while the Senate was in session. Recess appointments were then made following the Senate’s final adjournment. These appointments were held to be valid by an evenly divided court. (One justice did not participate.)

The Constitution of Pennsylvania provides for regular and special sessions of the General Assembly. Pa. Const. art. II, § §4, 8, 9, art III, §12, art. IV, §12, art. XI, §l(a). Unless a regular session ended with final adjournment, there would have been no need to provide for special sessions. The only natural reading of the many references in the Constitution to regular sessions and special sessions requires the conclusion that a regular session ends with the final adjournment of the General Assembly. We conclude, as did this Court unanimously in <em>Creamer, </em>that final adjournment ends a regular session of the legislature. When the Governor made the four (4) temporary appointments involved in this appeal, the 155th regular session of the General Assembly had already ended. Therefore, the provision in the first sentence of article IY, section 8(b), which provides that temporary appointments shall expire “at the end of <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>[tlie Senate’s] session,” can only refer to a Senate session ending after the appointments were made.

Appellants argue that the concurrence of the House of Representatives in the Senate’s adjournment resolution was forty-five minutes late and, therefore, no final adjournment occurred.
