He was sentenced to a term of three to six years’ imprisonment. At the expiration of his three-year minimum, Collins was paroled, but on June 11, 1970, while on parole, Collins was arrested for possession of narcotics. On November 7, 1970, he was convicted of the charge of possesion of narcotics and was given a probationary sentence. On December 3, 1970, the parole board, without a hearing, recommitted Collins as a convicted parole violator and he was incarcerated to serve the three remaining years of the sentence on his 1964 conviction.

He was paroled on March 8, 1966, but subsequently arrested on March 1, 1967, and convicted on June 5, 1967, on another charge. He was sentenced to one to two years on that charge.

Richardson, <a href="/citations/?q=403%20U.S.%20365" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="403 U.S. 365">403 U.S. 365</a>, 374 (1971). Whether any procedural protections are due depends on the extent to which an individual will be ‘condemned to suffer grievous loss.’ Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, <a href="/us/341/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="341 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1148059" data-case-paths="/us/341/0123-01">341 U.S. 123</a>, 168 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring), quoted in Goldberg v.

The question is not merely the ‘weight’ of the individual’s interest, but whether the nature of the interest is one within the contemplation of the ‘liberty or property’ language of the Fourteenth Amendment. Fuentes v. Shevin, <a href="/us/407/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="407 U.S. 67" data-case-ids="9136631" data-case-paths="/us/407/0067-01">407 U.S. 67</a> (1972). Once it is determined that due process applies the question remains what process is due. It has been said so often by this Court and others as not to require citation of authority that due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. ‘[Consideration of what procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the governmental function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action.’ Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, <a href="/us/367/0886-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="367 U.S. 886" data-case-ids="1785544" data-case-paths="/us/367/0886-01">367 U.S. 886</a>, 895 (1961). To say that the concept of due process is flexible does not mean that judges are at large to apply it to any and all relationships. Its flexibility is in its scope once it has been determined that some process is due; it is a recognition that not all situations calling for procedural safeguards call for the same kind of procedure.</blockquote>

The liberty of a parolee enables him to do a wide range of things open to persons who have never been convicted of any crime. The parolee has been released from prison based on an evaluation that he shows reasonable promise of being able to return to society and function as a responsible self-reliant person. Subject to the conditions of his parole, he can be gainfully employed and is free to be with family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life. Though the State properly subjects him to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens, his condition is very different from that of confinement to a prison. He may have been on parole for a number of years and may be living a relatively normal life at the time he is faced with revocation. The parolee has relied on at least an implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if he fails to live up to the parole conditions. In many cases the parolee faces lengthy incarceration if his parole is revoked.</blockquote>

It is hardly useful any longer to try to deal with this problem in terms of whether the parolee’s liberty is a ‘right’ or a ‘privilege’. By whatever name the liberty is valuable and must be seen as within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. Its termination calls for some orderly process, however informal.</blockquote>

The State has found the parolee guilty of a crime against the people. That finding justifies imposing extensive restrictions on the individual’s liberty. Release of the parolee before the end of his prison sentence is made <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>with the recognition that with many prisoners there is a risk that they will not be able to live in society without committing additional antisocial acts. Given the previous conviction and the proper imposition of conditions, the State has an overwhelming interest in being able to return the individual to imprisonment without the burden of a new adversary criminal trial if in fact he has failed to abide by the conditions of his parole.</blockquote>

Although the parolee is often formally described as being ‘in custody’, the argument cannot even be made here that summary treatment is necessary as it may be Avith respect to controlling a large group of potentially disruptive prisoners in actual custody. Nor are we persuaded by the argument that revocation is so totally a discretionary matter that some form of hearing would be administratively intolerable. A simple factual hearing will not interfere with the exercise of discretion.

The first, a “preliminary hearing”, is to be conducted before an impartial official prior to reimprisonment of the parolee and is to inquire only into whether there exists probable cause to believe that a condition of parole has been violated (i.e., in the cases now before us, whether the parolee has been convicted of another crime). The second hearing is to consider the consequences of the violation, i.e., whether the parolee should in the best interests of society be returned to prison.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

One might well ask what purpose the lawyer would serve in such a hearing. The only issue is the fact of the conviction itself, and as to that issue it can safely be said that there is little, if any, risk of injustice.

Ct. 2593</a> (1972), upon which the majority mainly rely for their decision in this case, the United States Supreme Court ruled that before a State may revoke the parole of an alleged technical parole violator (i.e., one who violated conditions of parole), constitutional due process requires that the parolee receive adequate written notice of the claimed violations, disclosure of the evidence against him, an opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses before a neutral and detached body, such as a traditional parole board, and a statement of findings by the hearing body detailing why the parole is revoked. It did not rule as the majority opinion indicates that a hearing and the other protective procedures mentioned are required if the revocation is based on the parolee’s conviction of a crime while on parole. Nonetheless, I agree with the <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>majority that such procedures are wise and should be followed in all revocation parole cases.

    <p id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[202,531,1157,637]]]'>The above conclusion is also influenced by the fact that, even where the revocation is grounded on the commission of a crime while on parole, the Board of Parole may in its discretion abstain from entering a revocation order. See The Act of August 6, 1941, P. L. 861, §21.1, as amended, 61 P.S. §331.21a. At such a hearing, while the parolee may not relitigate issues already determined against him in another forum, such as the commission of the crime (see <em>Morrissey and Booher v. Brewer, </em><a href="/us/408/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="408 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="1782797" data-case-paths="/us/408/0471-01">supra),</a> he will have the opportunity of presenting evidence to influence the Board’s discretion in his favor.</p>
    <p id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[194,1188,1162,810]]]'>However, I strongly disagree with the majority’s ruling that a convicted parolee must be given the assistance of legal counsel at a revocation hearing. In <em>Morrissey, </em>the Court specifically refrained from resolving whether the assistance of counsel is required at a revocation parole hearing based on technical violations. But, it did emphasize the required hearing need not be before a board including judicial officers or lawyers, and also significantly said parole revocation “is not part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations.” 408 U.S. at 480, <a href="/us/408/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="408 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="1782797" data-case-paths="/us/408/0471-01">92 S.

Since the record failed to include evidence sustaining the State’s assertion as <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>to this the Court remanded the record for further proceedings and said: “If it is determined that petitioners [the parolees] admitted parole violations to the Parole Board . . . and if those violations are found to be reasonable grounds for revoking parole under state standards, that would end the matter. If the procedures . . . are found to meet the standards laid down in this opinion that, too, would dispose of the due process claims for these cases.” It appears to me that if the assistance of counsel is constitutionally required, the Court would not have ordered such a remand, but would have reversed the orders of revocation forthwith. 408 U.S. at 490, <a href="/us/408/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="408 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="1782797" data-case-paths="/us/408/0471-01">92 S.

Our decision in <em>Tins on </em>apparently gives the parolee more than is constitutionally required. Cf. <em>Morrissey and Booher v. Brewer. </em>Regardless of this, a substantia] difference exists between the situation where the revocation of parole is based on technical violations and that where the revocation is based on the commission of a crime while on parole. In the former instance, the truth of the commission of the violations has never been litigated or established and if the parolee denies such violations occurred, in all fairness he should have the opportunity to refute the charges with the assistance of counsel. However, in the situation where the commission of crimes, while on parole has been established either by trial or guilty plea in another forum, this issue may not be relitigated in the parole revocation hearing. But since the parolee may offer evidence at such a hearing of extenuating circumstances to influence the Board’s decision, the question may arise, as to how such a hearing differs from the proceeding where sentence is imposed by a court following <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>a conviction of criminal charges and in which counsel is constitutionally required. The simple answer is that, unlike a sentencing hearing, a revocation parole hearing “is not part of the criminal prosecution . . . and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations.” 408 U.S. at 480, <a href="/us/408/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="408 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="1782797" data-case-paths="/us/408/0471-01">92 S.
