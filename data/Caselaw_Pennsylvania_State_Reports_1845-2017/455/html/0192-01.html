Two days later Mrs. Prynn died. Her will was probated on September 29, 1970. Testatrix’s heirs-at-law, five first cousins, objected to certain charitable bequests<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in the 1970 will on the theory that these bequests were invalid because made within thirty days of death.

This provision, the heirs allege, nullified several specific bequests and the disposition of one-quarter of the residuary bequest. The heirs reasoned that since each of the three residuary beneficiaries were entitled to only one-quarter of the residue in the 1962 will, the increase to a one-third share in the 1970 will constituted a “new gift,” invalid under section 2507(1). This portion of the residue and the new specific charitable bequests, it was argued, passed by intestacy to the heirs-at-law.</p>
    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[204,917,1157,809]]]'>The orphans’ court concluded that although the charitable bequests had been made within thirty days of death, they were not invalid. The court held that sections 2514(10) and (11) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> require that the challenged gifts, both specific and residuary, pass to the residuary beneficiaries and not to the heirs-at-law. The court could find no authority for decreeing a partial intestacy even if all residuary beneficiaries are charities taking “new gifts.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Since section 2507 (1) invalidates a bequest only “to the extent that someone who would benefit by its invalidity objects,” and the heirs could not benefit, the court held all charitable bequests, specific and residuary, valid. The heirs have renewed their argument on appeal.</p>

Thus, the bequests to the three 1970 residuary beneficiaries were increased by the revocation but, by the terms of the 1970 amendment to section 2507 (1), these are not to be considered “new gifts.” The three may therefore take their increased residuary shares. If any specific bequest in the 1970 will were found invalid, nothing would prevent it from passing by the residuary clause. Accordingly, the heirs could in no circumstances benefit from the invalidity of any bequest provided by the 1970 will. Since the heirs cannot benefit, they have no standing to object.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
