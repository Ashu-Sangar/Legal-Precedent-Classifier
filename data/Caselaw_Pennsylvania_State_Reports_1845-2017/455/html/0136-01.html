There the defendant after submitting a timely notice of his alibi witnesses, requested the Commonwealth to present him with a complete list of prosecution witnesses. The trial court refused the request and the Superior Court affirmed the ruling stating: “Presently, the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure do not require that the Commonwealth disclose the names of its witnesses to the defense. Until the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure are amended, the defense has no right to the names of prosecution witnesses prior to trial.” Id. at 285, <a href="/citations/?q=303%20A.2d%20519" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="303 A.2d 519">303 A. 2d at 522</a>.</p>

The Court clearly indicated in <em>Wa/i'dius </em>that the reciprocal right, the State must in turn grant to the defendant, is the privilege to discover the State’s rebuttal witnesses pertaining to his alibi. The Pennsylvania rules are patently deficient in this respect.</p>
    <p id="b203-3" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[172,852,1152,920]]]'>The Commonwealth also places great reliance on the fact that Section 312(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure does provide for an exception to the alibi notice rule if “the interests of justice require it.” It asserts “it is obvious that if it would be a violation of due process to deny testimony of an alibi witness due to lack of notice, the interest of justice would demand that such a witness be allowed to testify.” Section (b) of Rule 312 is substantially similar to the provision in the Oregon statute permitting the trial court to allow alibi evidence “for good cause” shown, even in the absence of timely notice. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Wardius </em>pertinently states at 478-79, <a href="/us/412/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="412 U.S. 470" data-case-ids="6173453" data-case-paths="/us/412/0470-01">93 S.
