Thus, there would rarely be a time when the introduction of such evidence would produce some result favorable to the defendant. Nevertheless, there may be situations where a defense attorney is substantially certain that the prosecution will utilize a defendant’s prior convictions if he decides to testify. In those situations, it may be reasonable trial strategy for the defense counsel to bring those convictions out on direct examination in order to mimmize their impact, thus muting the prosecution’s thunder. Before doing so, however, counsel should be convinced that such evidence is available to the prosecution, <em>i.e., </em>that the convictions would properly be admissible to impeach the defendant’s credibility. In the absence of such certainty, counsel would be acting “ineffectively” if he introduced an aspect of his client’s criminal record which was, in fact, not competent evidence. Thus, our present inquiry must focus on whether counsel for the appellant justifiably believed that the record of these convictions was admissible.</p>

He relies principally on our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. McIntyre, </em><a href="/pa/417/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="417 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="1894003" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0415-01">417 Pa. 415</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20257" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="208 A.2d 257">208 A. 2d 257</a> (1965), wherein we held that the introduction of the defendant’s convictions for crimes committed subsequent to the charge being-tried was reversible error. What appellant fails to note, however, is that in <em>McIntyre </em>we <em>specifically </em>limited our holding to the “particular facts and circum<a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>stances of [that] case.” <a href="/pa/417/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="417 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="1894003" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0415-01">417 Pa. at 922</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20257" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="208 A.2d 257">208 A. 2d at 261</a>. The factual posture therein involved included the trying of <em>less </em>serious but subsequently committed charges prior to the trying of the <em>more </em>serious offense, which in that case was murder. Thus, our concern in <em>McIntyre </em>was the potential danger of calendar juggling to create a record prior to trying the more serious offense. <a href="/pa/417/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="417 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="1894003" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0415-01">417 Pa. at 422</a>, 423 n. 14, 208 A. at 261 n. 14. This restricted reading of <em>McIntyre </em>is supported by the Superior Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Conard, </em><a href="/pa-super/206/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="206 Pa. Super. 33" data-case-ids="773080" data-case-paths="/pa-super/206/0033-01">206 Pa.

In <em>Conard, </em>Judge Jacobs distinguished <em>McIntyre </em>in this manner: “This is not a capital case and there is no indication of court calendar manipulation. . . . Inasmuch as the Supreme Court, in McIntyre, did not abrogate the general rule in Pennsylvania permitting defendant’s credibility to be impeached by showing prior convictions of felonies, we are of the opinion that the prior convictions admitted into evidence in this case fall under the general rule rather than the exception enunciated in the McIntyre case. <em>The credibility of the witness is being attacked as of the time of the trial not as of the time of the commission of the offense for which he is being tried” </em><a href="/pa-super/206/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="206 Pa. Super. 33" data-case-ids="773080" data-case-paths="/pa-super/206/0033-01">206 Pa.

Subsequently, in <em>Richardson, </em>this Court distinguished <em>McIntyre </em>in a similar manner: “In McIntyre, we were concerned about the possibility that the Commonwealth might arrange the order of the defendant’s trials for the purpose of creating a record. In this case there is no evidence that the Commonwealth was attempting to create such a record. Appellant was indicted in Philadelphia for the felonies and in Delaware County for the murder in the same month. Trial was delayed in Delaware County because appellant moved <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>for a change in venne. Therefore, there does not appear to be anything sinister in the fact that appellant was tried in Philadelphia on the felony charges and then tried for nmrder in Delaware County. We have studied the record and do not find that appellant was denied due process by the introduction of the record of his convictions in Philadelphia at his murder trial.” <a href="/pa/433/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="433 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="1920952" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0195-01">433 Pa. at 201</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=249%20A.2d%20307" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="249 A.2d 307">249 A. 2d at 310</a>. In the present case, as in <em>Richardson, </em>there is no indication of calendar manipulation to create a record. The more serious offenses were tried first, thus negating any attempt to “build up” a record. Hence, the appellant’s prior convictions were not barred from admissibility under the <em>McIntyre </em>rationale and we cannot therefore characterize counsel’s representation as “ineffective” on <em>that </em>basis.</p>

A verdict of guilty, without more, stands on a different plane. The most it establishes is that the jury believed the accused to be guilty. But until sentence is pronounced the issue is not necessarily closed; a new trial may be granted or judgment be arrested. In either event the verdict goes for naught. It may injure the witness in the estimation of the jury, just as in a less degree the mere indictment of the witness would. But as evidence that the moral character of the witness for truth is bad it is unreliable because of its incompleteness.” <a href="/pa-super/59/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="59 Pa.
