Trying one segment of this involved multi-party securities case in the orphans’ court while the federal action continues would place an unnecessary extra burden on the litigants. Even had the pendent claims been tried, as suggested, in the orphans’ court with the extensive hearings necessarily required and attendant delay, the adjudication would not be dispositive of plaintiffs’ federal claims against the estate. This procedure would not in any realistic sense advance the public interest in expediting distribution of decedents’ estates, nor would it promote the efficient utilization of state-federal judicial resources. An appreciation of the intricacies of the Penn Central litigation, and considerations of comity, as well as the policy of section 3389, indicate the desirability of deference to the federal court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

Although counsel requests total suspension for an indefinite period, the court in making “such provision ... as shall be equitable,” nevertheless retains and must consider the broad range of options permitted by section 3389. It is for the court in its discretion to determine whether any fund shall be withheld and, if so, the amount withheld and the interval of any postponement of distribution. Of course, if any principal is ordered retained by the fiduciary, the court, in its discretion, may make the income generated by that portion of the principal available to the individual or charitable beneficiaries.
