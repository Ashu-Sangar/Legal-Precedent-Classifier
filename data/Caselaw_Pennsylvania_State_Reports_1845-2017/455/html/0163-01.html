He was arraigned before Allegheny County Deputy Coroner Michael J. Cassidy on the same day. A preliminary hearing, at which Little appeared with counsel, was held before Deputy Coroner Cassidy on September 11th. Appellee was held for action by the Crand Jury, which returned indictments of murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter. On the advice of counsel, Little entered a general plea of guilty in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division.

With the case in this posture, the question of the competency of counsel in the proceedings prior to the plea is relevant only to the basic question whether the plea was voluntarily and intelligently made. <em>Commonwealth v. Dennis, </em><a href="/pa/451/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="451 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1948585" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0340-01">451 Pa. 340</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=304%20A.2d%20111" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="304 A.2d 111">304 A. 2d 111</a> (1973). Here, however, it is clear that the lower court did not address itself to the validity of the plea, since it granted the relief requested on what it considered to be jurisdictional grounds.</p>

In view of our decision today, there is no need for us to consider this point or the others raised by the lower court, and we express no opinion on them.</p>
