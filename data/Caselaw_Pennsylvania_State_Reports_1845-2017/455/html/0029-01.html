As the Federal District Court wrote in the very similar Cleaver case <em>[Cleaver v.

Since the state is the adversary . . . there is a gross inherent imbalance of experience and expertise between the parties if the parents are not represented by counsel. The parent’s interest in the liberty of the child, in his care and in his control, has long been recognized as a fundamental interest. . . . Such an interest may not be curtailed by the state without a meaningful opportunity to be heard, which in these circumstances includes the assistance of counsel.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[173,1235,1159,588]]]'>By its very nature, the proceedings in the instant case are very different from those involved in <em>Watson Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/450/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="450 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="1947028" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0579-01">450 Pa. 579</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20861" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="301 A.2d 861">301 A. 2d 861</a> (1973). In <em>Watson Appeal, </em>we held that a natural mother who institutes proceedings to terminate her parental rights voluntarily cannot later complain that she should have had counsel appointed for her at the proceedings in which her parental rights were voluntarily terminated. In <em>Watson Appeal, </em>there was no adversary. The natural parent was voluntarily giving up her child and had been fully informed of the consequences of that decision.</p>

Consequently the appellant’s adversaries have the burden of proving that they are entitled by law to terminate those rights. In such a proceeding, it would be grossly unfair to force appellant to defend against the appellees’ case without the assistance of someone, trained in the law, who could test the <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>appellees’ case by the rules of evidence and the techniques of cross-examination.</p>

However, the record indicates that she was not provided with counsel until the conclusion of the hearing, when the court had already entered a decree terminating her parental rights. Not until then did the court tell her that, since she did not have counsel, she should contact the attorney in charge of the Law Association’s Committee on providing legal services to the indigent, and the court would give her twenty days to attack the decree terminating her parental rights.

As the New York Court of Appeals explained in the <em>Matter of Ella R.

[Citing cases.] For this rule to apply, however, the record must show in the case of an indigent defendant that he is informed of or fully understands that the court will provide him with counsel without charge if he so desires.
