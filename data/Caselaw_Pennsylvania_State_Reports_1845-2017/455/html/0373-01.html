He made no post-trial motions and took no appeal. Within three months he filed his first Post Conviction Hearing Act petition which was denied without a hearing, <em>Commonwealth v. Via, </em>89 Dauph. 336 (1968). In 1970 he filed a second PCHA petition in which he made the following contentions:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (1) the confession used against him at trial was coerced and made without adequate warnings, (2) a witness in petitioner’s behalf is now available who can show that the testimony of one of the Commonwealth’s witnesses was perjured, <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>(3) that the court-appointed trial attorney was incompetent, and (4) that assigned counsel on his first PCHA petition was incompetent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Only an involuntary or unknowing failure to exercise one’s right to appeal would circumvent the operation of section 4 and, although appellant claims a denial of his right to appeal, there is no factual basis for this assertion in accordance with Act of January 25,1966, <em>supra </em>§5, 19 P.S. §1180-5, see also <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

However, appellant was aware earlier of the evidence which he now asserts, to wit, that a co-defendant was willing to state that petitioner was not involved in the burglary incident. Although appellant claims that this witness was unavailable at the <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>time of trial due to his incarceration in another county, such witness was still known to appellant and arrangements to acquire his testimony could have been made.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, appellant’s first two contentions are finally litigated or waived for failure to proceed on direct appeal and failure to allege any extraordinary circumstances which would prevent the operation of a waiver.

However, here, during the first PCHA proceeding, appellant was assigned counsel who was a member of the same office that represented him at trial. We will not view the failure to raise a claim of incompetency as a waiver where an individual in the subsequent proceeding is represented by the same counsel or one of his associates. The law will not assume that counsel has advised his client of his inadequacies or those of his associates. Therefore, we cannot assume a knowing and understanding waiver of this issue.</p>
