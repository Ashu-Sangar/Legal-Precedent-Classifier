We need not, however, reach this question since we conclude that the Commonwealth Court properly denied relief because appellant failed to state an issue cognizable on appeal.</p>

Appellant assumed that all testimony and documentary evidence presented to the administrative agencies automatically became part of the record in the Commonwealth Court. This assumption was erroneous. <em>Commonwealth v. Yorktowne Paper Mills, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/419/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="419 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1896848" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0363-01">419 Pa. 363</a>, 368-70, <a href="/citations/?q=214%20A.2d%20203" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="214 A.2d 203">214 A.2d 203</a>, 206 (1965).</p>
    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[210,1183,1159,418]]]'>Consequently appellant in its stipulation of facts failed to allege that the property was purchased for use outside the Commonwealth. This allegation, the foundation upon which appellant’s entire theory of recovery is built, was not in the record before the court nor, as required by section 1104, in the specification of objections. Therefore the appeal was correctly dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[209,1622,1160,699]],["BL_193.1",193,[160,305,1152,153]]]'>It is argued, however, that the stipulation’s reservation of the right to introduce additional evidence permits appellant to present testimony or documents indicating the destination of the purchased items. While this interpretation may, in fact, be correct, it fails to furnish any basis for disturbing the Commonwealth Court’s adjudication. The present record reflects no effort to introduce any additional evidence until after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Court hearing. The refusal of the court to reopen the record for submission of additional evidence is a matter of discretion. <em>Commonwealth v. Deitch Co., </em><a href="/pa/449/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="449 Pa. 88" data-case-ids="1945623" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0088-01">449 Pa. 88</a>, 100-01, <a href="/citations/?q=295%20A.2d%20834" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="295 A.2d 834">295 A.2d 834</a>, 841 (1972). There is no indication of abuse <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>of discretion where, as here, the court declined to reopen the record of a case already argued and submitted on a stipulation of facts.</p>
    <p id="b193-3" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[158,471,1153,692]]]'>Furthermore, even assuming that additional evidence had been received, appellant’s “Appeal and Specifications”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> to the Commonwealth Court do not raise any issue justiciable by a court on a hearing de novo. In the specifications Anastasi “appeal [ed] the decision dated March 24, 1972, of the Board of Finance and Revenue . . . for the following reasons: 1. The decision was against the weight of the evidence. 2. The decision was arbitrary and capricious. 3. Petitioner presented sufficient affidavits and oral testimony to sustain its position. 4. The Bureau of Taxes for Education failed to meet the burden of proof necessary to sustain its order and assessment.”</p>
    <p id="b193-4" data-blocks='[["BL_193.5",193,[155,1184,1154,362]]]'>It is obvious, as the Commonwealth Court observed, that on appeal de novo the sufficiency or weight of the evidence previously presented is not a cognizable issue. Here specifications 1 through 3 challenged only the weight and sufficiency of the evidence submitted in the administrative hearings and did not state a justiciable issue in the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Indeed, on the record before the Commonwealth Court no question was presented since appellant stipulated a prima facie taxable sale in Pennsylvania. <em>Commonwealth v. Carheart Corp., </em><a href="/pa/450/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="450 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="1947074" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0192-01">450 Pa. 192</a>, 195-96, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20628" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="299 A.2d 628">299 A.2d 628</a>, 630-31 (1973).

We <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>there observed that the “evidentiary record binds the Commonwealth—as it does the taxpayer—and is determinative of this tax controversy.” Id. at 196, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20628" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="299 A.2d 628">299 A. 2d at 630</a>.</p>
    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[197,523,1156,374]]]'>As the Commonwealth in <em>Carheart </em>stipulated facts preventing imposition of the tax, here taxpayer by its stipulation has precluded a refund.
