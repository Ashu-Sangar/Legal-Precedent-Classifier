It is a writ which is not of absolute right but rests largely in the sound discretion of the court. It will never be granted where there is a complete and effective remedy by appeal, certiorari, writ of error, injunction, or otherwise [citing cases]. As pointed out in the last cited authority [United States Alkali Export Association, Inc. v. United States, <a href="/us/325/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="325 U.S. 196" data-case-ids="6155980" data-case-paths="/us/325/0196-01">325 U.S. 196</a>] (p. 203), ‘appellate courts are reluctant to interfere with decisions of lower courts, even on jurisdictional questions, which they are competent to decide and which are reviewable in the regular course of appeal. .. .

    <p id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[190,861,1149,698]]]'>I recognize that the ordinary route for challenging a subpoena is through contempt. However, I am in fundamental disagreement with such an approach where there is substantial question concerning the authority to issue the subpoena. In such a case, a party with real doubt as to his legal status is forced to act upon that status at his peril. If he refuses to obey the subpoena and his challenge is not sustained, he will be subject to criminal sanction. If he obeys the subpoena, his challenge may well be moot because the harm he sought to avoid—be it unreasonable search and seizure, self-incrimination or a general invasion of privacy—has already occurred.</p>
