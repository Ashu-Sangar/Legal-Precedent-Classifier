After a brief altercation, Presley was shot in the leg as he attempted to flee. At or about this time Officer Thompson, a member of the Philadelphia Police Department, while on patrol with his partner, heard what appeared to them to be the sound of gunfire. They responded by driving their vehicle in the direction of the sound where they observed appellant and two other men. Appellant attempted to flee but was quickly apprehended. A search of his person uncovered a .22 caliber derringer pistol which contained one spent cartridge and one live cartridge.

After conviction and sentence in the court below an appeal was taken to the Superior Court which affirmed the judgment of sentence per curiam. <em>Commonwealth v.

There is little question that the facts of this case present a clear illustration of an unreasonable delay between a warrantless arrest and arraignment. Here the Commonwealth seeks to excuse the delay by offering as the reason the need to review their files of unsolved robberies and to notify those victims to attend who gave descriptions of an assailant similar to the appearance of the appellant. Clearly this does not provide a basis for a finding that the delay was reasonable. While we do not require that the investigatory process cease at the time of a warrantless arrest we do require compliance with Rule 118 prior to any investigative procedure conducted for the purpose of gathering further evidence against the accused if that procedure is dependent upon the waiving of a constitutional right.</p>
