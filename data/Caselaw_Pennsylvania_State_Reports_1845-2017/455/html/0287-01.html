Appellant, a corporation engaged in the publi<a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>cation, of a weekly newspaper, brought an action in equity seeking to enjoin preliminarily the union, which was the certified bargaining unit for eighteen of the newspaper’s sixty-one employees, from engaging in what the employer alleged to be unlawful “mass picketing.” The employer asked the court to limit the number of pickets and the distances which they must remain from each other. After the union filed preliminary objections, and the employer filed an amended complaint, a hearing was held on November 16, 1973. On November 20, 1973, the chancellor issued a decree denying the employer’s application for the preliminary injunction and ordered the employer to pay reasonable costs and expenses in defending the suit, and counsel fees in the amount of §1,000 to appellees’ counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In fact, no one was prevented from entering the employer’s plant by the pickets except those members of the printers’ union who attempted to enter the South Washington Street entrance and the State Street entrance during the brief intervals when large numbers of the striking newspaper guild’s members were picketing at those two entrances. However, it is not clear that the printers really desired access, since the chancellor found that the members of the printers’ union had previously been accustomed to entering the plant by a rear entrance which was not picketed during the strike but had been instructed to enter only through the two entrances which were being picketed after an agreement reached between the employer and the printers’ union less than <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>forty-eight hours before the newspaper guild began the strike. Moreover, the chancellor further found that when pickets were reduced to two or three in number from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., the members of the printers’ union made no attempt to enter the premises, even though they were still gathered at the street comer adjacent to the employer’s plant. All of these facts indicate that the confrontation between the pickets and the printers was staged and amply support the chancellor’s conclusion that when the employer reached an agreement with the printers and had the printers report for work at the two front entrances rather than rear entrance they customarily used, “it was not coincidental but was part of a plan by the [appellant] intended to prejudice the [appellee] union in its collective bargaining with [appellant].”</p>
