It is true, of course, that the original opinions in <em>Campana </em>still exist in the published reports and continue to declare a clearly-stated, albeit incorrect, principle of federal constitutional law. I assume, however, that in view of its disinclination to permit the United States Supreme Court to pass upon that decision, this Court cannot justifiably hereafter take the position that the rule of compulsory joinder set forth in <em>Campana </em>is compelled by the Federal Constitution.
