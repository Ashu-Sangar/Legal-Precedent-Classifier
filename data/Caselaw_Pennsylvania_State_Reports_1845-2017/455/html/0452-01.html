The plaintiffs are adjoining landowners. The complaint named William L. Recker as defendant; however, by stipulation High View Mobile Park, Inc. was added as a party-defendant prior to trial. After an extended hearing, the chancellor entered an adjudication and decree nisi in favor of the defendants. Some of the plaintiffs, including Robert C. Buckingham and his wife, Joanne, filed exceptions to the adjudication and decree nisi, but these exceptions were later dismissed by a court en banc and the decree nisi was made final.

Recker and Madeline Recker, his wife, became the owners in fee of a 155 acre tract of land in Union Township. Between 1956 and 1962, William P. Recker and Madeline Recker made eleven separate conveyances out of this 155 acre tract. The appellants were the grantees in one such conveyance. Each deed in these conveyances granted title to the grantees therein to a lot or lots of land subject to certain “covenants, conditions and restrictions” which were designated as “covenants running with the land.” One such covenant provided “[n]ot more than one dwelling house shall be constructed on each lot as shown on the plan.” Another provided that the construction plans for each dwelling house and septic tank installation were subject to the approval of the grantors prior to construction. In addition, each deed included the following restrictions dealing with trailers: “No trailer, basement, tent, shack, garage, or any outbuilding other than a dwelling house approved as herein provided erected thereon shall at any time be used as a <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>residence.” Further, all hut two of the eleven deeds contained the following prohibition: “No trailer shall be placed, or parked on the above described land for use of occupancy as a dwelling house or for any other purpose whatever.”</p>

Becker, deceased. In November 1971, the plan for construction of the park was approved by the township’s Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors. On May 1, 1972, the township’s Zoning Board of Adjustment issued the necessary building permit. On May 30th, title to the 148 acre tract was purchased by High View Mobile Park, Inc. [High View] for $65,000. William L. Becker owns one-third of the stock in this corporation and serves as its secretary-treasurer. The instant action was instituted on June 5th.</p>

He deemed this unnecessary and ruled the plaintiffs failed to establish a general scheme of development restricting the use of trailers on the entire tract, because: (1) there was no express covenant in the deeds to Buckingham and the other purchasers of the lots prohibiting the use of trailers on the entire 155 acres; and (2) there was no proof at trial of a plan laying out the entire 155 acres in building lots.</p>

However, proof of the existence of a plan laying <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>out the laud in building lots was not essential to establishing the existence of such an intention.

However, such evidence is admissible to prove the intent of the parties when the written instrument is vague and ambiguous. <em>Factor v.

Instantly, as noted previously, the deeds to the plaintiffs from William F. Recker and Madeline Recker included in part a covenant, “ [n] ot more than one dwelling house shall be constructed on each lot <em>as shown on the plan.” </em>[Emphasis added.] This “plan” was not recorded and the deeds do not explain it. Hence, the deeds are ambiguous as to the identity and the extent of the land this plan encompassed, and, thus, parol testimony may be introduced. If the grantors intended and referred to the Provost plan, then the building lots outlined therein and only those lots would be included in the general plan of development intended by the grantors, and, as such, would be subject to the restrictions intended for all of the land included within the develop<a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>ment plan. Assuming High View is an innocent purchaser for value, the deeds to the plaintiffs which were a matter of public record would constitute constructive notice that some development plan with building restrictions existed and was intended by the owners.

    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[183,645,1157,748]]]'>Since the credibility of the testimony, as to what portion of the 155 acres was encompassed by the grantors’ development plan is for determination by the chancellor, we remand the record for that purpose. However, we hasten to note this caveat. The deeds were ambiguous only as to the bounds of the development plan intended by the owners of the tract, and, only parol testimony clarifying this facet of the deeds may be considered. Parol testimony concerning oral promises and representations made to the individual purchasers which concern matters other than the scope and identity of the plan would clearly constitute an attempt to vary or add to the contents of the deeds, and, as such, are violative of the Parol Evidence Eule.</p>
