The Commonwealth’s case was established primarily through the testimony of three individuals who admitted committing the burglary and stated appellant participated. Toth denied participating in the burglary and attempted to show that the testimony of the three Commonwealth witnesses who implicated him was fabricated to “get him,” and in order for them to receive lenient treatment from the district attorney. To sustain this position, appellant called on Thomas McDonald to testify he had been confined in the Chester County prison at the same time as two of these witnesses, and heard them say they intended to implicate the appellant in the hotel and other burglaries in order to save themselves. The district attorney objected to the testimony as hearsay, but the defense counsel correctly counterargued the testimony was offered, not for the truth of the matter, but to prove the statement was made. The trial judge admitted the testimony.</p>

I objected because he was testifying as to all these things that Barlow and Taggart said in response to the questions asked by Mr. Potter [defense counsel]. Then Mr. Potter, as I recall, said, ‘Well, we’re not entering this for the truth of it.’ In other words, Mr. Potter said that they weren’t putting this in because it was true. I had no idea why it was <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>put in, but apparently Mr. Potter didn’t believe it.” Defense counsel immediately made a motion for a mistrial, which the trial judge refused to grant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The district attorney’s remarks were clearly unwarranted and prejudicial, and a mistrial should have been granted.</p>

The comment of the district attorney completely distorted the purpose of the testimony, so much so that in a few sentences the appellant’s defense was substantially impaired, if not destroyed. In effect, the jury was told no one believed McDonald’s testimony was true, not even appellant’s counsel, and the natural conclusion the jury would draw from this was to disregard the testimony. <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>Such conduct by a district attorney is improper and beyond the scope of fair play.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

If convinced of it, his duty is to lead them to his own judgment by pointing out to them, intelligently and impartially, the evidence which cannot fairly justify any other conclusion. ‘The district attorney is a quasi-judicial officer. He represents the commonwealth, and the commonwealth demands no victims. It seeks justice only, equal and impartial justice, and it is as much the duty of the district attorney to see that no innocent man suffers, as it is to see that no guilty man escapes. Hence, he should act impartial<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>ly.
