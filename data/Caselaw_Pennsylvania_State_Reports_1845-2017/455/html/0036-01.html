After a hearing during which Wright was without counsel, the court found that the total amount accrued under said orders was $4195; that Wright was credited with payments of only $213 since entry of the first order, and, hence, was in arrears in the amount of $3982. The court then entered the following order: “$1000 or six months in the House of Correction.” The one thousand dollars was not paid and Wright was committed.</p>

In view of the conclusions that follow, it is unnecessary to reach this constitutional issue in this case.</p>
    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[176,907,1142,921]]]'>As noted before, the support proceedings, here involved, were instituted and prosecuted under the Act of 1953, supra, 62 P.S. 2043.39(b), which provides as follows: “Any <em>wilful </em>failure to comply with any order of the court may be deemed a contempt of court and except in counties of the first class may be punishable by the court by commitment to the county jail or house of correction. In counties of the first class, any person who is found, after hearing, to have <em>wilfully </em>failed to comply with any order of the court may be adjudged in contempt of court and may be punished by the court by commitment to the county jail or house of correction until compliance with said order, but in no case for a period exceeding six (6) months, and the court in its order shall state the condition upon which fulfillment will result in the release of such person.” [Emphasis added.]</p>
    <p id="b101-6" data-blocks='[["BL_101.6",101,[178,1840,1142,317]]]'>Thus, the act explicitly states that in counties of the first class [Philadelphia is a county of the first class], a <em>wilful </em>noncompliance of a support order, entered pursuant to the provisions of the Act of 1953, is necessary before there may be a finding of contempt and imposition of a jail sentence.</p>

There was no testimony from any source to discredit or disprove this testimony.</p>

    <p id="b102-5" data-blocks='[["BL_102.5",102,[196,911,1147,641]]]'>While the term “wilful” is a word of many meanings, depending on the context in which it is used, it seems clear to us that, as used in the statute instantly involved, “wilful” means an intentional, designed act and one without justifiable excuse. As noted before, the only testimony in the tidal court was that Wright was then penniless and unable, through no fault of his own, to pay any sum on the delinquencies. Such a record does not support a finding of wilful noncompliance, required by the Act of 1953. Compare, <em>Commonwealth v. Pewatts, </em><a href="/pa-super/200/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="200 Pa. Super. 22" data-case-ids="762894" data-case-paths="/pa-super/200/0022-01">200 Pa.

    <p id="b102-6" data-blocks='[["BL_102.6",102,[197,1565,1151,799]]]'>The trial court reasoned that since Wright was young and in good health, his continued unemployment, coupled with his chronic failure to make contributions towards the support of the children, constituted a wilful disregard of the court’s orders. To this, we cannot subscribe. If the record warranted the conclusion that Wright refused to work, and, thus through his own fault was rendered incapable of making payments on the outstanding support orders, this might well constitute a wilful noncompliance under the Act of 1953. However, this is not such a case, and whether criminal sanctions may constitutionally be imposed, under the circumstances, need not be resolved here. The determination of that complex issue must await a proper case.</p>

Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.
