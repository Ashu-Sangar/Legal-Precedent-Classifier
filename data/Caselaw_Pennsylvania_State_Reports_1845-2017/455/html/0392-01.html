In the interim, the Commonwealth had filed an amended complaint on March 17, 1971, which consisted of four counts.

The mine was first opened in 1915 and following a series of different operators, Barnes &amp; Tucker took over operation of the mine in 1939 when it acquired the assets of its subsidiary, Bames Coal Company, upon that company’s dissolution. During the operation of the mine by Barnes &amp; Tucker, four different certificates or permits were issued by the Sanitary Water Board for acid mine discharge in connection with the operation of Mine No. 15.</p>

An application was made to cover a proposed plan of drainage for all of Barnes &amp; Tucker’s mining operations in both the B and D seams.

The 1965 amendments became effective January 1, 1966. Prior permit holders were treated in Section 315(d) of the Act, which provided: “Any permit approving the drainage and disposal of industrial wastes from a coal mine and issued by the board prior to the effective date of this act shall be deemed to be a permit issued pursuant to this section. The permit shall be valid for one year from the effective date of this act or for such additional period as the board might allow. Nothing herein shall limit the board’s power to modify, suspend, or revoke any such permit under the provisions of Subsection (c) of this section.” Pursuant to this section, Barnes &amp; Tucker applied for and was granted three extensions of time to operate under its mine drainage permit No. 564M5, subject to certain conditions. The last extension was effective until May 31, 1969. During the period of these extensions, however, Barnes &amp; Tucker filed an application for a new mine drainage permit to cover both Mines Nos. 15 and 24 on a form prescribed for post-1965 amendment permits. This application was filed on October 17, 1967, and on March 22, 1968, Permit No. 567M035 was issued. The <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>Commonwealth.

Furthermore, under both permits the plan of drainage for Mine No. 15 was the same. Consequently, the only legal relevance in a determination of the governing drainage permit would be the effect of the conditions imposed upon the issuance of Permit No. 567M035 and Permit No. 564M5 and the extensions thereto.

Moreover, at all times permit holders were on notice that the exemption from regulation of acid mine drainage was applicable only until “practical means for the removal of the polluting properties of such drainage shall become known.” 35 P.S. §691.310 (repealed 1965).

There has been no showing that the Commonwealth’s action was an intentional discrimination in the enforcement of the law. Indeed, since to a large extent this is a case of first impression, and recognizing the substantial costs of litigation here involved, it is only reasonable that the Commonwealth await the ultimate outcome of this case before bringing similar actions.</p>

Much of the testimony below was concerning the mines adjacent to Mine No. 15, the barriers and cut throughs between them, the quantity and quality of water generated in each of the mines, the amount of fugitive water migrating into Mine No. 15, and whether, but for the fugitive waters, any discharge would occur at Mine No. 15. We believe a finding in regard to the sources of water being discharged from Mine No. 15 would be relevant in a determination of the appropriate relief. In this regard we note a key distinction from the situations present in <em>Commonwealth v. Harmar Coal Co. </em>and <em>Commonwealth v.

Those cases involved the <em>pumping </em>of water from abandoned mines in connection with the <em>operation </em>of working mines. In the present case we are essentially dealing with a natural discharge (but for the pumping at Duman Dam) from an <em>abandoned </em>mine which may include acid mine drainage which originated in adjacent abandoned mines.</p>
