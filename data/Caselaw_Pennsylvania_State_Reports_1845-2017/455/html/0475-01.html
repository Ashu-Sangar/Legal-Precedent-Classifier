Stewart Merwarth and Ada Merwarth, owned a piece of property located in Lower Saucon Township, Northampton County. The property was subject to a mortgage held by Asa S. Knechel Estate and Mabel E. Knechel, as mortgagees. In jthe same year, the mortgagees instituted foreclosure proceedings against appellants. On October 8, 1965, the property was exposed to a sheriff’s sale and sold to Robert M. Moore.</p>
    <p id="b538-11" data-blocks='[["BL_538.16",538,[207,1853,1159,319]]]'>Shortly after the sheriff’s sale, the purchaser was advised by his attorney that the sale was defective due to certain procedural irregularities in the sale. On January 11, 1966, the Merwarths, Moore and Ann S. Townsend, appellee, entered into a written agreement which provided as follows:</p>

On January 24, the court entered a decree relating to the stipulation, Avhich provided as follows:</p>

Stewart Merwarth and Ada A. Merwarth, have obtained certain advantages under the terms of the agreement entered into between them and Ann S. Townsend on January 11, 1966, and farther for the reason that the said judgment debtors have interposed no objection to a confirmation of said sale held <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>on October 8, 1965, and have by their counsel joined in the above Stipulation, the Court hereby Orders and decrees that the sale to Ann S.

    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.4",540,[189,718,1158,538]]]'>For five and one-half years, during which time the Merwarths occupied the premises, Mrs. Townsend refused to execute a deed as required by the agreement. Finally, on August 6, 1971, suit was filed by the Merwarths. The chancellor, after taking testimony, found that the agreement which the Merwarths sought to enforce was incapable of specific performance due to the fact that the agreement did not contain a description of the property sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b540-5" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[189,1269,1157,591]]]'>The Merwarths offered into evidence a survey, prepared for Mrs. Townsend, that delineated the tract occupied by them which was to be conveyed to them. The description of the property contained in this survey should have been considered as having defined the five to six acre tract which Mrs. Townsend had agreed to convey in the agreement executed by the parties on January 11, 1966. As such, it might be considered to have been incorporated in the agreement by reference, since the agreement specifically required that such a survey be prepared.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b541-3" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[168,493,1151,210]]]'>In <em>Yinger, supra, </em>the agreement described the property as “the property known as RD No. 1 New Cumberland, Jacob Springer’s 80 acres more or less wich [sic] will exclude 7 acres of the 87 acres more or less.”</p>
    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[167,717,1152,374]]]'>We allowed parol evidence to be admitted, which supplied an accurate description of the property to be conveyed, explaining: “Parol evidence to describe the land intended to be sold is one thing, and parol evidence to apply a written description to land is another and very different thing, and for that purpose is admissible.” 452 Pa. at page 68.</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.6",541,[166,1103,1152,263]]]'>In our view, on the basis of the survey and other evidence presented indicating that all parties knew which property was being occupied by the Merwarths and was to be reconveyed to them, the agreement was capable of specific performance.</p>
    <p id="b541-6" data-blocks='[["BL_541.7",541,[164,1379,1153,702]]]'>Mrs. Townsend argues that even assuming that the agreement is specific enough as to description of the property in question, the agreement is unenforceable because it is not supported by consideration. We do not agree. The Merwarths gave up a right to set aside the sheriff’s sale for want of conformity to law in return for the settlement agreement arrived at between the parties. This waiver of a valid defense to a sheriff’s sale was certainly more than sufficient consideration. It would be manifestly unjust for Mrs. Townsend to refuse to convey the tract, including all of the buildings, as shown by the survey, after appellants had kept their part of the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b541-7" data-blocks='[["BL_541.8",541,[164,2094,1153,209]],["BL_542.1",542,[200,333,1156,99]]]'>Mrs. Townsend also argues that appellants were guilty of laches. Again, we do not agree. The parties had attempted several times to comply with the agreement, but each time one side or the other objected for <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>specified reasons. This conduct does not constitute laches on the part of either party.</p>
    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[199,444,1157,206]]]'>Decree reversed. Case remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs to be borne by appellee.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[199,663,1156,90]]]'>Mr. Chief Justice Jones took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>
