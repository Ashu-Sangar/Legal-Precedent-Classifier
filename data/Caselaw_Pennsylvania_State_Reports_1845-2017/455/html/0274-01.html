In support of this factual theory, the Commonwealth points to several convincing factors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Nevertheless, for the reasons given below and particularly in view of our decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em>Pearce. </em>That distinction, however, is not significant here since both the United States Supreme Court and this Court have also held that a court is without power to increase an <em>existing </em>sentence, once the defendant has begun to serve that sentence. <em>See Ex parte Lange, </em>85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163 (1873); <em>Commonwealth v.

In light of the above principles enunciated in <em>Allen, </em>we must hold that the modification of sentence in the present case, having occurred after the appellant was returned to prison pursuant to a commitment order, violated the federal and state constitutional guarantees against double jeopardy.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[168,1024,1158,809]]]'>There is, however, one more problem. As was noted in the opinion of the court below, the eight and one-half to ten year sentence initially imposed after the federal court order is unlawful since the minimum is greater than one-half the maximum. Act of September 26, 1951, P. L. 1460, §1, 19 P.S. §1057. The method of correcting this illegality, however, is not to increase the maximum until the sentence comports with the statute as did the lower court in this case; rather, in light of our foregoing discussion, the appropriate action must be to reduce the minimum term until there is statutory compliance and under no circumstances to increase either minimum or maximum term. Hence, a five to ten year sentence is the most severe punishment which can be imposed on appellant at this time.</p>

In doing so, the court misconstrued its proper role in the sentencing function. In this Commonwealth, it is the maximum term which has legal effect as the sentence, and the minimum must conform to the maximum. See <em>Commonwealth v. Daniel, </em>supra.

Superior Ct. 332</a> (1913). The Act of 1951 directs that a sentence which seeks to commit a male offender to a State Penitentiary must contain a maximum and minimum sentence. With equal force the provision requires that the maximum not exceed the maximum punishment set by the legislature for the crime charged and that the minimum not exceed one half of the maximum imposed by the court. Non-compliance with the express directions of the act conferring the power to sentence can only result in an ineffective and futile attempt to exercise that power.</p>

There the trial judge sentenced appellant Bozza to a simple term of imprisonment in violation of the statute which required as a minimum mandatory penalty both a fine and term of imprisonment. Five hours later the judge recalled Bozza and imposed a $100 fine in addition to the original imprisonment sentence. In upholding this action the Supreme Court stated: “If this inadvertent error cannot be corrected in the manner used here by the trial court, no valid and enforceable sentence can be imposed at all. Cf. Jordan v. United States, <a href="/f2d/60/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="60 F.2d 4" data-case-ids="914871" data-case-paths="/f2d/60/0004-01">60 F.2d 4</a>, 6, with Barrow v.

This Court has rejected the ‘doctrine that a prisoner, whose guilt is established, by a regular verdict, is to escape punishment altogether, because the court committed an error in passing the sentence.’ In re Bonner, supra at 260. The Constitution does not require that sentencing should be a game in which a wrong move by the judge means immunity for the prisoner. See King v. United States, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20App.%20D.C.%2010" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="69 App. D.C. 10">69 App. D.C. 10</a>, 15, <a href="/f2d/98/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="98 F.2d 291" data-case-ids="990176" data-case-paths="/f2d/98/0291-01">98 F.2d 291</a>, 296. In this case the court ‘only set aside what it had no authority to do and substitute [d] directions required by the law to be done upon the conviction of the offender.’ In re Bonner, supra at 260. It did not twice put petitioner in jeopardy for the same offense. The sentence, as corrected, imposes a valid punishment for an offense instead of an invalid punishment for that offense.” <a href="/us/330/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="330 U.S. 160" data-case-ids="354020" data-case-paths="/us/330/0160-01">330 U.S. at 166-167</a>.
