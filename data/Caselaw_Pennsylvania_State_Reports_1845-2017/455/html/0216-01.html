Reading the charge as a whole, as we must, <em>Commonwealth v. Stafford, </em><a href="/pa/451/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="451 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="1948566" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0095-01">451 Pa. 95</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20600" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="301 A.2d 600">301 A. 2d 600</a> (1973); <em>Commonwealth v. Hawkins, </em><a href="/pa/448/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="448 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="1944684" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0206-01">448 Pa. 206</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20302" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="292 A.2d 302">292 A. 2d 302</a> (1972), it is clear that this reference was directed to a specific intent to kill. It is basic law that even an accidental or unintentional death may be a felony murder. <em>Commonwealth v. Elliot, </em><a href="/pa/349/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="349 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="458696" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0488-01">349 Pa. 488</a>, 491, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.2d%20582" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="37 A.2d 582">37 A. 2d 582</a> (1944). Under such circumstances it is obvious that the question of intoxication would have no relevance. Voluntary intoxication does not provide an excuse or justification for criminal conduct under our law, <em>Commonwealth v. Ingram, supra; Commonwealth v. Reid, </em><a href="/pa/432/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="432 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="1919690" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0319-01">432 Pa. 319</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20783" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="247 A.2d 783">247 A. 2d 783</a> (1968); <em>Commonwealth v. Walters, </em><a href="/pa/431/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="431 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1917416" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0074-01">431 Pa. 74</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20757" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="244 A.2d 757">244 A. 2d 757</a> (1968). In homicide cases its only relevance is to tend <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>to demonstrate that because of this condition the defendant was rendered incapable to form a specific intent necessary to establish a non-felony first degree murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
