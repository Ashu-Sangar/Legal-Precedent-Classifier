Dixon was carrying a full length shotgun with at least the barrel of the gun plainly visible. The trio then turned south together on Marshall Street and continued their fast gait until they came upon Reginald Fambrough, who was walking alone north on the opposite side of Marshall Street. The trio then crossed the street together and stopped Fambrough, whereupon Dixon fatally shot him. At the time Leach and his companions were standing in a group about two feet from the victim. After the shooting, Leach and his companions fled from the scene together.</p>

It is true that to aid or abet in the commission of a crime, one must be an active partner in the intent to commit it. See <em>Commonwealth v. McFadden, </em>supra, and <em>Commonwealth v. Strantz, </em><a href="/pa/328/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="328 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1179695" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0033-01">328 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2075" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="195 A. 75">195 A. 75</a> (1937). However, the Commonwealth is entitled to the benefit of all reasonable inferences arising from the evidence <em>[Commonwealth v. Bartlett, </em><a href="/pa/446/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="446 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1941725" data-case-paths="/pa/446/0392-01">446 Pa. 392</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20796" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="288 A.2d 796">288 A. 2d 796</a> (1972)], and the jury could certainly reasonably infer from the evidence in this case that Leach was an active partner in Dixon’s lethal plan.</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[161,1341,1154,861]]]'>It is argued the evidence merely established Leach’s presence at the scene of the crime. What we said in <em>Commonwealth v.

See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Giovanetti, <a href="/pa/341/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="341 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1204485" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0345-01">341 Pa. 345</a>, 353, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="19 A.2d 119">19 A. 2d 119</a>, 123 (1941); 1 Wharton, Criminal Law and Procedure, §144, at 248 (Anderson 1957). On the other hand, ‘[g]uilt or innocence of the abettor . . . is not determined by the quantum of his advice or encouragement. If it is rendered to induce another to commit the crime and actually has this effect, no more is required.’ Perkins, Parties to Crimes, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20581" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="89 U.
