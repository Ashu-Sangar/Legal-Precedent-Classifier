She was calling for her brother, David. Russell Wright, the appellant, then 26 years old, was observed leaning from an adjacent window, swinging his arms towards Lorraine. Lorraine lost her balance and fell to her death.</p>

He was apprehended in New York City nearly two months later. He was charged and <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>ultimately convicted by a jury of assault with intent to ravish and of murder in the first degree. Post-trial motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge, sentence on the other charge being suspended. This appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b544-4" data-blocks='[["BL_544.4",544,[196,586,1156,748]]]'>Viewing the testimony, as we must, most favorably to the Commonwealth,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the following facts appear. The apartment from the window of which Lorraine Miles fell was occupied by her and the other members of the Miles family. On the night in question, the only persons in the apartment were the decedent and six younger children: her sisters, Pamela, age 11; Carol, age 8; and Wilhelmina, age 4; her brother, Maurice David (“David”), age 12; and her cousins, Sonia, age 3 and Curtis Osborne, age 12. No adult was present. For several weeks prior to this occurrence, Russell Wright had also been staying in the apartment, sleeping on a couch in the living room. The other children slept in the bedroom.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[195,1354,1155,700]],["BL_545.1",545,[161,335,1150,482]]]'>On the night in question, Lorraine and the other younger children had had an argument, as a result of which Lorraine left the bedroom and entered the living-room, which was then empty, and began to knit. Soon thereafter, Russell Wright came into the apartment from the outside. He reprimanded the children for not being in bed, and then ordered Lorraine to take off her clothes and get into bed with him. Lorraine refused, and Wright slapped her, repeating his demand. At this point, the three older children, David, Pamela and Curtis, in the fear that Wright was about to rape Lorraine, tried to enter the living room, but found the door locked. Thinking to telephone the police, the three children ran <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>down the outside fire escape, which could be reached from the bedroom window, only to find that they lacked the coins to make the call. It was as they returned to the apartment building that they saw Lorraine on the window ledge, and witnessed her fall. They could not be certain whether the swinging motions which Wright was making with his arms were in an attempt to push Lorraine from the ledge or to pull her back into the apartment.</p>
    <p id="b545-4" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[160,830,1150,1027]]]'>The Commonwealth’s case relied principally upon the testimony of the three children who had attempted to phone the police and had witnessed the decedent’s subsequent fall; their accounts of the night’s events provided the jury with the facts which have been outlined above. To buttress this evidence, the Commonwealth called three witnesses to testify to previous acts of sexual misconduct by the appellant, directed to Carol, David and Lorraine. The first of these witnesses was Carol Miles, who was nine years old at the time of the trial; she testified that, four months prior to her sister’s death, the appellant had taken herself, Carol, into the bathroom and performed an act of sodomy upon her. In addition to her detailed account of this event, Carol stated that she had informed her brother David of it, and that he later told Lorraine about it. Carol also testified that she had been told by David that the appellant had offered him a dollar if he would consent to an act of sodomy.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.5",545,[159,1871,1151,427]]]'>David Miles, 13 years old at the time of trial, testified that, at some point within the two weeks preceding Lorraine’s death, the appellant had threatened to stab him if he would not consent to a,n act of sodomy. Additionally, he responded affirmatively to the Commonwealth’s question as to whether he had related to Lorraine what Carol had told him and whether Lorraine had mentioned to him an incident involving herself.</p>

      <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>The remaining evidence of prior sexual misconduct was presented by Mrs. Fannie Fannings, a volunteer community worker, who testified that, a few days before her death, Lorraine had come to Mrs. Fannings’ apartment at 11:30 at night, explaining that the appellant had attempted to have some form of sexual contact with her and that she had, therefore, taken the children out of the apartment and led them to Mrs. Fannings’ apartment. All of the children, including Lorraine, were in their night clothes, and the witness estimated that the walk would have taken them an hour.</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[194,938,1157,915]]]'>The appellant contends that this testimony of prior misconduct was improperly admitted. He attacks the testimony of Carol Miles and David Miles on the ground of relevancy, and challenges the testimony of Mrs. Fannings as being impermissible hearsay; Carol’s testimony concerning what she was told by her brother David is also challenged on hearsay grounds. The only part of this challenged testimony which was objected to at trial, however, was Mrs. Fannings’ recounting of the decedent’s declaration that the appellant had attempted sexual relations with the decedent; consequently, it is only this hearsay question which is properly before us. <em>Commonwealth v.
