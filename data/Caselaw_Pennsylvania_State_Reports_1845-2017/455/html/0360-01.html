    <p id="b423-6" data-blocks='[["BL_423.9",423,[182,1083,1150,370]]]'>This appeal arises from an order of the Superior Court which affirmed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, granting the motion of appellees, The Travelers Insurance Company and The Travelers Indemnity Company, for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment.

Tropiano, an employee of Vare Brothers, was injured during the course of his employment. Appellant, at the time of his injury, was covered by workmen’s compensation insurance, and the insurance was written by Travelers. After a series of treatments proved unfruitful and, in fact, harmful to him, appellant filed suit in trespass against several doctors and appellees herein. Appellees then moved for a judgment on the pleadings and/or a motion for a summary judgment, which was granted on the basis that appellees herein were immune from common law tort liability on the basis of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. The issue then presented to this court, through its grant of allocatur, is as follows: Whether an employer’s workmen’s compensation carrier is immune from liability in trespass to an employee for <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>injuries allegedly caused by tbe insurer’s negligence in supplying medical services in tbe treatment and care of any injury previously sustained by tbe employee in tbe course of bis employment.</p>

The medical treatment of injuries is a separate and distinct function of the insurance carrier which does not concern the employer and is not part of the employer’s business operations. The alleged acts of negligence in this case were committed by the insurance carrier subsequent to and independent of the original injury and with no involvement of the employer whatsoever.</p>
