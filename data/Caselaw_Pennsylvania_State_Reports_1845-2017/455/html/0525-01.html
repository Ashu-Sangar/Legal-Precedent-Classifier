The instant case falls directly in line with these decisions. The foregoing argument exceeded the bounds of propriety and constituted an appeal to the passions and prejudices of the jury. Moreover, in testifying as if his “best witness” Mr. Sweeney, was in the courtroom, that which followed amounted to the giving of testimony by an unsworn witness. See <em>Commonwealth v. Clark, </em>supra. In referring to Lipscomb and his alleged associates by the epithets of “hoodlums” and “animals”, the assistant district attorney interjected his personal belief in the guilt of the accused. Such “expressions of personal belief . . . have no legitimate place in a district attorney’s argument.” <em>Commonwealth v. Capalla, </em><a href="/pa/322/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="322 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1167831" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0200-01">322 Pa. 200</a>, 206, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20203" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="185 A. 203">185 A. 203</a>, 206 (1936). As stated in <em>Capalla: </em>“It is no part of a district attorney’s duty, and it is not his right, to stigmatize a defendant. He has a right to <em>argue </em>that the <em>evidence </em>proves the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment but for the <em>district attorney himself to characterize </em>the defendant as ‘a coldblooded killer’ is something quite different. No man on trial for murder can be officially characterized as a murderer or as ‘a cold-blooded killer,’ until he is adjudged guilty of murder or pleads guilty to that charge.” [Emphasis supplied.] <em><a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20203" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="185 A. 203">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20203" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="185 A. 203">at 204</a>, 185 A. at 205.

Bubnis, </em><a href="/pa/197/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="197 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="918642" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0542-01">197 Pa. 542</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20A.%20748" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="47 A. 748">47 A. 748</a> (1901). Cf. <em>Hall v. United States, </em><a href="/f2d/419/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="419 F.2d 582" data-case-ids="2162628" data-case-paths="/f2d/419/0582-01">419 F. 2d 582</a>, 587 (5th Cir. 1969). Further, in conjunction with the characterization of “hoodlum” and “animal”, the prosecution’s comment that, “I think Mr. Sweeney would say, ‘The only way you couldn’t find this defendant guilty of murder of the first degree is for me to come alive again before your very eyes’ ” amounts to a statement by the prosecutor that in effect he is personally <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>convinced that the appellant is guilty, and his innocence is as unlikely as the resurrection of the deceased. Such personal assertions by a district attorney on the guilt of the accused is beyond the scope of fair play,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and is emphatically condemned. See <em>Commonwealth v. Capalla., </em>supra. See also <em>U.S. v. Schartner, </em><a href="/f2d/426/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="426 F.2d 470" data-case-ids="2246838" data-case-paths="/f2d/426/0470-01">426 F. 2d 470</a> (3d Cir. 1970). In <em>Capalla, </em>this Court discussed the district attorney’s characterization of the accused as “a cold-blooded killer.” We stated the statement “was equivalent to an expression of belief on the part of the district attorney that the defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree. There are no facts in the record warranting any such belief on the part of anyone, and even if there were, the first officials who had the right to give expression to that belief were the jurors after the case was committed to their keeping.” <em>Id. </em>at 205-206, 185 A. at 206.</p>

You ask them how long they have known the defendant. Do you know other people in the community who know the defendant?

And, by the same token, no such adverse inference may be drawn merely because the accused failed to call some particular individual as a character witness. The assistant district attorney asked the jury to do just that. His argument was much more <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>than just an attack on the quality of the character testimony offered by Lipscomb—as the Commonwealth contends.</p>
