Post-trial motions were denied, and, on July 28, 1973, concurrent sentences of life imprisonment on the conviction for murder and ten to twenty years on the robbery conviction were imposed.

He there approached a man wearing a leather jacket of the type worn by Philadelphia police and asked him whether he was a policeman. The man responded in the negative.</p>
    <p id="b181-3" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[156,682,1152,746]]]'>Appellant then left the tavern briefly and returned. He went to the bar, ordered and paid for a drink, pulled out a revolver, and demanded that one of the two bartenders then working give him the money in the cash register. The bartender complied. Hudson ordered the first bartender to serve drinks to the several patrons in the tavern. Appellant’s attention being momentarily distracted, the second bartender pushed a button on the back of the bar which activated a silent alarm summoning the police. After finishing his drink, appellant decided to leave the tavern. When Hudson, gun in hand, reached the door, he found himself face to face with a police officer. He shot the officer and fled.</p>

First, it is contended that appellant was not properly indicted for murder. The indictment returned by the grand <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>jury on July 30, 1970, reads: “The . . . Graud Jury, by this indictment presents: That . . . James R. Hudson, did feloniously, wilfully and of his malice aforethought kill and murder one Harry Davis. During the commission of the above murder the said defendant was in possession of a firearm, to wit, revolver . . . .” At the beginning of trial on January 13, 1972,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> over the objection of the defense, the court granted the Commonwealth’s motion to amend the indictment by striking the last sentence as surplusage.</p>

It is argued, however, that the original indictment returned by the grand jury does not charge murder. Rather, appellant contends that because the original indictment included the factual statement that he was in possession of a revolver, it charged only the crime of carrying a deadly weapon.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> It is as<a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>serted that the court improperly allowed the indictment allegedly charging carrying deadly weapons to be amended to charge a “different offense,” murder, and that therefore appellant was unconstitutionally convicted of a crime for which he was not indicted by the grand jury.</p>

If the grand jury in its indictment did not charge murder, then the amendment and conviction of murder would have been error. However, in our view, the original indictment charges murder.</p>

Koch, </em>supra. In the original indictment, the grand jury chose to include an unnecessary statement describing the means by which appellant caused the police officer’s death. Additional allegations of this nature do not void a proper murder indictment. Any extra information or description of the events surrounding the commission of the crime are mere surplusage, and, as such, may by amendment be stricken. See <em>Commonwealth v.

The structure of the argument as well as its emphasis is the professional mechanism by which the advocate seeks to insure that adequate attention is directed to what he deems essential to his mission of persuasion. Here, counsel sought to divert the jury’s attention from the apparently proven elements of the offense by centering his argument on the defense’s position that death was caused by intervening and superseding circumstances. The objective of this technique was the creation of a reasonable doubt as to the Commonwealth’s theory of criminal causation, and thereby a reasonable doubt as to appellant’s guilt.</p>

Neither did the court direct that the jury find legal causation. To the contrary, the court prefaced its summary of the testimony by stating, “Since you [the jurors] are the sole judges of the facts, if your recollection of the evidence differs from mine you will be guided by your own recollection,” and gave the jury a complete and correct charge on the issue of causation as presented by the record. It must be concluded that the court’s charge was free of error. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Counsel’s recital in argument that appellant was at the scene of an alleged robbery, however, cannot be equated with the entry of a plea of either nolo contendere or guilty to the crime of robbery. Furthermore, this conjectural contention appears to be predicated on the abstract and isolated assumption that but for counsel’s recital the jury would have completely ignored the strong and compelling evidence of appellant’s guilt of; robbery. The realities of the Commonwealth’s trial proof virtually foreclosed the chance that, even absent counsel’s statement, the jury would find appellant not guilty of robbery. Moreover, counsel’s challenged statement, when viewed as a component of his overall trial strategy, was calculated to achieve for his client the important objective of a verdict of not guilty of the more serious crime of murder in the first degree.</p>
