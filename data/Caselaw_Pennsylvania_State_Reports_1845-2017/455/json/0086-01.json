        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMe. Justice Mandeeino :\nI dissent. The majority affirms the trial court\u2019s decree dismissing the appellant\u2019s (plaintiff below) complaint. The appellant filed a complaint requesting injunctive relief to enjoin, inter alia, the appellees from constructing apartments or condominiums on certain parcels of land in violation of deed restrictions. The appellees filed preliminary objections demurring to the complaint. The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint as premature. I disagree.\nThe appellant alleged that written or oral agreements exist among the appellees concerning a plan to build apartments in violation of deed restrictions permitting only single dwellings.\n\u201cWhere a doubt exists as to whether a demurrer should be sustained, this should be resolved in favor of overruling it.\u201d Clevenstein v. Rizzuto, 439 Pa. 397, 401, 266 A. 2d 623, 625 (1970). The appellant should have the opportunity to prove that the agreements exist. Such agreements would constitute overt acts sufficient to justify injunctive relief. If the allegations in appellant\u2019s complaint are true, this action is not premature. Bennett v. Lane Homes, 369 Pa. 509, 87 A. 2d 273 (1952) (injunctive relief granted where proposed plan would be violative of restrictive covenant in deed). The trial court\u2019s dismissal of the appellant\u2019s complaint should be reversed.\nMr. Justice Pomeroy joins in this dissenting opinion.",
