At the time the court delivered the charge to the jury these points were not answered, for the reason that the court, having reserved the question as to the right of the plaintiff to recover under the facts and the law, understood the defendant to waive the answers to the points. On the trial the legal questions were not argued to the court. On the rendering of the verdict the defendant made two motions: First, to enter judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto; second, for a new trial in case the first motion should not prevail. On hearing of these two motions it was strenuously contended by the defendant that, under the decision of Metzger v. Beaver Falls Borough, <a href="/pa/178/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="178 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="885518" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0001-01">178 Pa. 1</a>, the plaintiff could not recover.

Had the plaintiff before he entered into the alleged contract employed the most eminent counsel in the state he would have been informed that under the statute, as then expounded by our Supreme Court, the defendant could make the contract <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>with him, which he alleges it was about to make and did make. In Metzger v. Beaver Falls Borough our Supreme Court felt constrained to change their other rulings, as made in Le-high Water Company’s Appeal and Howard’s Appeal. As is said in Ray v. Gas Company, <a href="/pa/138/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="138 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="11252411" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0576-01">138 Pa. 576</a>, “in so doing the doctrine is not that the law is changed, but that the court was mistaken in its former decision, and that the law is, and really always was, as it is expounded in the latest decision upon the subject.” Under the general borough act of 1851, as construed by our Supreme Court prior to and at the time plaintiff made the contract with the defendant, and on which he claims to recover, the defendant had the power to enter into such a contract. The contract was valid by the statute as then expounded and administered by our courts of justice, and its validity and obligation should not be impaired by any subsequent decision of the courts altering the construction of the statute law: Ray v. Natural Gas Company, <a href="/pa/138/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="138 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="11252411" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0576-01">supra,</a> and cases cited on page 591. We are, therefore, of the opinion that at the time the borough of Beaver Falls entered into the contract, with the plaintiff, employing him to act as consulting engineer in and about the erection and construction of the waterworks, it had power, under the statute as expounded by our Supreme-Court, so to do.</p>

We do not take this view of the case. The plaintiff claimed upon a special contract. He entered upon the performance of the duties for which he claims compensation, under such special contract. He was prevented by plaintiff from fulfilling it. His action, therefore, was on the contract itself: Algeo v. Algeo, 10 S. &amp;. R. 235; Eckel v. Murphy, <a href="/pa/15/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="15 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="408762" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0488-01">15 Pa. 488</a>. The undisputed evidence of the case shows that the defendant notified the plaintiff to cease performance before the Supreme Court had decided the ease of Metzger v. Beaver Falls Borough, <a href="/pa/178/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="178 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="885518" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0001-01">supra.</a> No doubt the appeal taken by Metzger had much to do with the defendant so notifying the plaintiff to cease work under the contract; but if they had the contract with the plain<a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>tiff which they claim they had, under no circumstances could he have recovered to exceed the sum of $500. If we are correct in holding at the time the defendant made the contract it had the power to make it, and was bound thereby, no subsequent action of the borough or decision of the Supreme Court could so far modify the contract as to change the plaintiff’s action from one on the contract itself to an action of indebitatus assumpsit.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[170,745,1175,613]]]'>It is true, as said by Agnkw, J., in McManus v.

If in a case like the one at bar the plaintiff could recover on a quantum meruit he might recover more than the contract price. He might have taken the contract at such a price that the value of the work performed for the part would exceed the sum for which he had agreed to perform the whole. We held at the trial that the true measure of damages was the contract price, less what it would have reasonably cost the plaintiff to have completed it. In this we still hold there was no error.</p>

There was sufficient evidence to warrant a jury in finding that there was a contract between the parties whereby plaintiff was to receive the sum of $500 only for his services in case the borough was enjoined against completing the waterworks. If the jury had so found we would not have disturbed the verdict. On the other hand, there was clear and definite affirmative evidence in support of the plaintiff’s theory of the case. There was his own testimony, the testimony of the clerk of the committee who kept the inmutes, and the positive declaration of the resolution employing him. Even if we would have come to a different conclusion than that arrived at by the jury, this in itself would be no reason for setting aside the verdict: Deysher v. Hilsinger, 2 Woodward, 153; Brown v.

He also testified what services he had rendered up to the time that he was notified to cease work, and also as to what work he would still have been required to perforin had he completed the entire work. The jury, therefore, was not bound absolutely by his opinion. Having heard the evidence of the plaintiff on the subject it was their duty, if they believed from all the evidence that it would have cost the plaintiff more than $1,000 to have performed the uncompleted part of the work, to so find. Evidently they believed it would have cost him considerably more than $1,000 to have completed the work, and hence the verdict rendered by them.</p>
