A person standing in the center of the highway at a point twenty feet westerly from the center of the railway track and looking northward, could see a train approaching at a distance of about 968 feet, and could also see it at a point about a quarter of a mile further north. Looking southward from this point a train could be seen over 2,000 feet, or at the southern end of the Ellis switch.</p>

As requested in plaintiff’s eighth, ninth and tenth propositions, I find that the public highway at the point of the proposed crossing is fifty feet wide; that for the construction of an overhead crossing or bridge by the defendant it would be necessary to occupy about twelve feet in width of the said highway; and that such a crossing could be constructed with a reasonable grade, and, if constructed according to the plans submitted by the plaintiff, at a cost not exceeding $2,500. But I am of opinion that the plan so submitted is not practicable in any event, as it terminates at the bridge over the Jackson run and would render that bridge useless for public travel. In my opinion any crossing constructed over the railroad, would necessarily have to extend far enough north to cross the run, which would involve additional cost, the amount of which I am unable to determine.</p>

    <p id="b109-7" data-blocks='[["BL_109.8",109,[197,659,1175,1482]]]'>This is a bill for an injunction to restrain the defendant •company -from crossing the tracks of the plaintiff’s railroad at grade with their electric railway tracks. The bill was dismissed by the learned court below upon the ground that it was not reasonably practicable to erect an overhead crossing, and therefore a grade crossing was allowed. In an opinion we have just filed in the case of The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, Lessee, v. The Warren Street Railway Co., the present defendant, ante, p. 74, we have expressed fully our views upon ■all the contentions which arise in the present case. There is no kind of physical obstacle to the erection of an overhead crossing. The cost of its erection was proved to be not more than $2,500. There are no adjoining owners whose property will be interfered with. There are special reasons why there should not be a grade crossing at this place in consequence of the •grades of the plaintiff’s railroad on each side of the crossing, and we are quite unable to agree with the learned court below ,as to the sufficiency of the reasons assigned for granting the grade crossing. There is much less force in the contentions for a grade crossing in the present case than there was in the •case referred to. We think them to be quite without merit, and in clear hostility with all our recent decisions upon this subject. We are clearly of opinion that a grade crossing should have been refused. Without considering the numerous assignments of error in detail it is only necessary to say that we are of opinion on all the testimony that it is reasonably practicable to erect an overhead crossing at the place in question and that it was error in the court below to hold the contrary and to allow a grade crossing.</p>
