He said: “ When the money was not used in thatway (i. e. in effecting the settlement with creditors) and no bid above the mortgage could be secured on the farm, I sent for my brother, W.

Mr. Donovan’s testimony, given before the auditor on May 20,1895, at which time he was a most unwilling witness, was to the effect that “ Bailey owed me because I was an individual indorser on these notes, and Lowe, he was a stockholder at that time. The company was responsible for the payment of these notes, and got me to go on as individual indorser and obtained money from me at different times to,make partial payments on these notes.” The indebtedness of the tin plate company upon these notes was treated by Donovan as that of Bailey, because Bailey was indorser upon the notes; and Donovan explicitly testified that the entire indebtedness of the tin plate company and of Bailey <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>together due him ou August 10, 1893, was “ the amount I had the judgment for; ” and that the tin plate company and Bailey together did not owe him more than $2,900.

    <p class="summary" id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[323,570,1127,41]]]'>On June 16, 1896, Mr. Donovan testified as follows, viz:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[276,622,1181,454]]]'>“ Q.

Now, if Mr. Bailey was indebted to you $2,736, how much protection did that leave you for indorsements for the Alliquippa Tin Plate Company? A. My answer is this, that it would not be very much protection between the $2,700 and the $2,900, but I looked on the tin plate stock as being worth something and some protection to me.”</p>

This is too great a discrepancy. These facts are rendered the more peculiar from the fact that after the auditor completed his original report, counsel representing Donovan made an oral application to the auditor to open the case and allow Donovan to prove a claim of about $300 against the estate of Bailey, which was an alleged balance due on account of all the transactions between Bailey and Donovan, covering a number of years; and that upon subsequent hearing, ordered by this court, nothing was said about such balance, and the figures proved before the auditor do not show such a balance. To reach such balance it would have been necessary to investigate all the transactions between Bailey and Donovan, which was done. The most that Donovan claimed to hold against Bailey was $2,736, covered as he alleges, by the judgment, and he testified to no sum of $300, balance due upon all their transactions. It was a questionable act for Donovan to give back to Bailey the $2,300, on May 23,1894, the very day that the judgment against Bailey was paid and satisfied. What difference <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>does it make that Bailey shortly afterwards gave his notes for |2,000 of that money ? Donovan had been secured by preference by Bailey before the appointment of an assignee for the benefit of creditors. It is surprising that he should, upon being paid in full, hand that money back to Bailey and take merely the notes of an insolvent to secure the loan again. Such things are unusual, however close the ties of business or of friendship.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b615-3" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[187,745,1169,389]]]'>In this connection, it is worth while to recall the fact that Donovan has testified that Bailey prepared the judgment note and handed it to him (Donovan) and that he (Donovan) did not then know how much was owing from Bailey; and that Bailey testified that of the various items of indebtedness testified to by Donovan he could recall but three (designated by the auditor elsewhere), but that he had no doubt the others were correct if Donovan said so.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[189,1153,1167,453]]]'>On May 23,1894, when the judgment was paid, the transaction was effected in this way: B. A. Frank, the purchaser of the lot at Sewicldey, paid thereof the sum of $7,800. He drew three checks as follows: (1) A check to <em>W. </em>J. Shaw, assignee, for $3,076.75 (which was immediately indorsed to B. Donovan), the supposed amount of interest and principal due on the judgment against Bailey; (2) a check for the amount of street liens and municipal assessments upon the lot; (3) a check to W. J. Shaw, assignee, for the balance.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.6",615,[184,1614,1170,813]]]'>Mr. Shaw testified that “in their figuring a mistake was made in Mr. Donovan’s check: I told them I was $40.00 short; discovered that they had paid Mr. Donovan $40.00 too much. Then Mr. Donovan gave me check marked exhibit 8, which balanced the whole transaction, and I deposited the check in bank.” This check was offered in evidence. It is true that the assignee in his account claims credit for the sum of $3,036.78, as the amount paid on the judgment. The auditor in verifying the calculation, when preparing his original report discovered the error of $40.00 over-payment to Donovan. The fact that there was such over-payment, and that the total amount agreed to the very cent with the calculation submitted by counsel, necessarily weighed heavily against Donovan and Bailey. Mr. Shaw testified that Mr. Frank, Mr. Donaldson, Mr. Slack and Mr. Donovan figured out the amount of principal and interest due on the judgment, when the error of $40.00 was made.</p>

      <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>It will be remembered that on August 10, 1893, when the judgment was entered, the indebtedness of the tin plate company to the First National Bank of Allegheny was evidenced by two notes; the one for $1,700 and the other for $1,200; which together, amount to $2,900. The circumstance that this sum was the same as the amount of the judgment, had add&gt; tional weight with the auditor in concluding that the judgment was security for the notes. It has been suggested that in surcharging the accountant in the sum of $2,950, loss in sale of tin plate stock, and in the sum 'of $2,300, on account of payment of the judgment given by Bailey to Donovan, the auditor has made a double surcharge. It will be remembered that the assignee in making sale of the stock gave none of the creditors except Donovan personal notice of the intended sale. Donovan received such notice from Bailey and attended the sale. Notice was published three times in the “ Chronicle Telegraph.” Counsel for the assignee strongly contend that the stock was worthless. A committee of the creditors examined the tin plate plant and concluded that the sum of $13,000 would be required to replace it and that at a public sale the plant would sell for at least three or four thousand dollars. Even after the stock of Bailey was sold to Donovan for $50.00, a proposition was made by Bailey and Shaw to Bailey’s creditors to have the Alliquippa Tin Plate Company give the creditors a mortgage upon the tin plate plant in the sum of $15,000 to secure their claims against Bailey and to allow the money in the hands of the assignee to go to operating the plant. The plant, therefore, they considered had value with money to run it. If this was not their honest conviction, why make such proposition to creditors ? The stock was sold during a period of the greatest business depression — on August 10, 1894 — exactly one year after the date of the assignment to Shaw. Nothing then could be sold for anything like its full value. Under the circumstances it seems to the auditor that if Shaw was unable then to effect a more advantageous sale of the stock than he did, it was his duty to hold it as an asset of the estate, in the hope of securing a better price at a future time, in place of sacrificing then, to effect a sale. Nothing was gained by the sale; and undoubtedly the sale was made under suspicious circumstances. Delay would not have been to the disadvantage of the assigned <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>estate, because tbe bank would have brought suit against the indorsers (Bailey, Lowe and Donovan) to recover against them, and their judgment would have received a dividend upon this distribution. No evidence has been introduced to show whether the note was protested in order to fix the liability of the indorsers, but it is a reasonable supposition that it was. Donovan, however, did not pay the note. It was paid by Bailey’s brothers.</p>

S. B., tbe auditor has. found that this judgment was collusive between the parties, of which collusion tbe assignee bad sufficient notice to put bim upon inquiry. Tbe testimony taken upon tbe original bearing, as well as that taken upon the reference of the matter back to him, is quite sufficient to sustain tbe conclusion of tbe auditor that tbe assignee must be surcharged with tbe amount of tbe judgment, and we can find no reason for reversing him as sustaining this exception.</p>

A short time prior to tbe sale, Bailey and tbe assignee made an offer to tbe creditors of seventy-five per cent upon their respective claims, accompanying which offer was a statement showing that they bad in cash $2,300, which bad been banded back by Donovan, after its reception by bim, on bis judgment found to be collusive, and this stock in tbe tin plate company estimated in the statement at $3,000 along with other assets, as security for or means of carrying out tbe offer. This offer was rejected and shortly thereafter tbe stock was <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>sold at public auction, it is true, but there does not seem to have been reasonably proper notice of the sale; nor was there any conference with creditors with regard thereto, and the same was knocked down to Donovan on a bid, which he at the time considered a joke.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[172,597,1166,658]]]'>Not long after the sale Bailey made another proposition to his creditors, viz: to give them a mortgage upon the property of the tin plate company in the sum of $15,000 to secure their claims, and to this offer the assignee was also a party. Moreover, this stock was, at the time of the assignment, duly appraised at the sum of $3,000 and the assignee in his account filed charged commissions on that amount as the value of proceeds of the stock, which commissions he received. Under the circumstances the assignee cannot now say the stock was worthless, and we think the auditor was right in surcharging therefor. This surcharge is modified and reduced by the auditor in his supplemental report, which modification and reduction we think correctly made. The exception is not sustained.</p>
