Defendants further testified that the agents alleged that they were in a great hurry to get away in order to catch a train, and that if defendants would sign the proposition as prepared and presented to them they would return within a few days and enter into a written contract, in detail, and therein set forth that said sum of $10,000 referred to in the proposition was not to be paid until the plant was erected and in successful operation, and that the said sum of $10,000 was to be used only as working capital and not to be paid until it was necessary to be used for the purpose aforesaid, and that they desired to have the proposition signed on that particular day, in the manner in which it was already prepared, in order that they might show it to others as evidence of the good faith of the defendants in giving the land therein set forth; that relying upon these representations, the defendants signed the proposition above referred to, and, in accordance with the agreement, executed and delivered a deed for the land, worth at least $5,000, but refused to pay the stock subscription, since the representations which induced them to subscribe the stock were never fulfilled; the plant was never put in successful operation and the company entirely failed to manufacture axles under the process referred to.</p>

    <p id="b344-8" data-blocks='[["BL_344.8",344,[309,1242,1173,966]]]'>The instructions of the court below to the jury as to the kind, of testimony necessary to alter or overthrow a written agreement were strictly correct and in accord with our decisions. The jury were told several times over that the testimony must be clear, precise and indubitable, and that “it requires a higher and greater degree of evidence than to qualify or contradict or change a parol agreement.” The defense consisted also in part of alleged fraudulent misrepresentations on the part of the persons who induced the defendants to sign the written agreement. There were five defendants, and all of them testified as to both branches of the defense, and these counted not as one, but as five independent witnesses. This was a sufficient compliance with the rule that requires more than one witness to impeach the terms of a written contract: Pyroleum Appliance Co. v. Williamsport Hardware and Stove Co., Limited, <a href="/pa/169/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="169 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="870689" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0440-01">169 Pa. 440</a>. The objections to the testimony of these witnesses go to their credibility and not to their competency. There was no error in the answer of the court to the plaintiff’s points, and the assignments of error must be dismissed.</p>
