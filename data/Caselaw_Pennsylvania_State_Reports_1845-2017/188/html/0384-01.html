Can it be said that the lien tlius fixed on the land of Lewis became merged in whole or in part in the title which vested in Lewis, because he, as a legatee, was to receive a share of the fund of which the money charged on his own land was a constituent part ? That the lien as a whole could not merge seems clear, because the widow and the other legatees were interested in it, and their interests could not be destroyed by mere operation of law. Equity does not favor mergers; and in law mergers are said to bo odious. Equity will not permit the rights of creditors, legatees, etc., to be defeated by mere act of law, without any act done by them: Penington v.

If so, what part or to what extent ? Let it be kept in mind that Lewis was not given a portion of the money charged on his own land, so that it could be said he owed himself a fixed and determinate sum. On the contrary, he was given a share in a fund the exact amount of which could not be determined when his rights vested, and cannot be determined now. True, if each devisee paid in the amount charged in the will, the gross amount of the fund could be known. Even then the net amount of the fund could not be ascertained. But how could it be told until payments were actually made that the devisees would pay the amount charged ? And in case of their failure what certainty is there that the lands charged would sell for enough to realize the amounts charged ? Although the original petition filed by the executor averred that the remaining devisees had paid into his hands the amounts charged on their devises, when the court decided that he had no standing to* receive the money and release the land the money may have been withdrawn from his hands; or it may be withdrawn at the pleasure of the devisees, as the executor is but their agent in this respect.</p>

Moreover it was not to the interest of the devisee that the two should merge. His interest in the fund was personal property. It could not be bound by the lien of a judgment against him. It would not pass by a sheriff’s sale of his land. He could sell and assign it at pleasure like any other chose in action. Under such circumstances there is a presumption that no merger took place. As a merger is for the benefit of him in whom the two interests unite, it will never take place when it is against his interest, or when it is most for his advantage to keep the charge alive: Wallace v. Blair, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Grant%2081" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Grant 81">1 Grant, 81</a>; Moore v.

There is also some evidence, the only evidence on either side of this question, that as early as 1898, Lewis Hartzell did not consider there was any merger, because on September 22 of that year, he specifically assigned his interest in the fund to John Long. Finally the case of Hart v. Homiller, Ex’r, supra, seems to expressly decide this question and about every other important question in this case: “If after this (a sheriff’s sale of the land of the devisee charged with the payment of a legacy) there should be funds in the hands of the executor of the estate, and the said devisee’s share thereof should be sufficient to pay the charge on the land thus devised, this would not of itself operate as an extinguishment of the charge; for that would be the application of the devisee’s funds in order to discharge the duty of the sheriff’s vendee.” As this case is so much like the one in hand, and rules nearly every phase of it, it may be well to recall that it was carefully reviewed by Mitchell, J., in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court when the present case was recently before that body: Hartzell’s Estate, <a href="/pa/178/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="178 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="885492" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0286-01">178 Pa. 286</a>. While they overrule the case cited, in so far as it decides that an executor may maintain a proceeding in the orphans’ court to recover a legacy charged on land, the learned justice says: “ These cases are all subsequent to Hart v. Homiller, and while not disturbing the principle of that decision, must be accepted as establishing a different practice.”</p>

This was personal property, and was not bound by any attachment or other legal impediment to its assignment. On the date named he assigned this share for a valuable consideration to John Long, and there is no reason apparent in the evidence before the auditor why this assignment did not pass a good title to the assignee. The subsequent sale by the sheriff did not convey anything but the interest of Hartzell in the land. It did not disturb the assignment to Long. The purchaser had express notice of the fact that the lien would be preserved, and that the land would cost him the amount of the lien in addition to his bid. Presumably by reason of this, the respondent bought for $2,505, land devised to Lewis Hartzell by his father at $7,680.</p>
