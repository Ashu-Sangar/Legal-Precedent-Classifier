Brandon was not employed by either Wacherlie or Johnston, and neither he nor McCain ever notified John.ston that the money was collected, and never paid or offered to. pay it over to him, to whom it rightfully belonged, but the same was paid over to the estate of John Gilpin, deceased, by the said J.

Wacherlie, but does not refer to the judgment of Wacherlie v. Stepp. On the trial of this case before Judge Wickham, specially presiding on April 15,1891, it was proposed to prove by Mr. Shuer, a witness, that McCain had collected money on the Wacherlie agreement since the death of Gilpin, but the offer was overruled because the money had been received subsequent to his death, but there was no offer to prove that McCain had collected the money now in dispute — the judgment of Wacherlie v. Stepp in Butler county — or that it had been assigned to Johnston. At this time none of the parties had personal knowledge of the assignment, or the title being in Johnston. When the auditor, Mr. Fullerton, was hearing the case, the assignment of the judgment became known to all the parties for the first time, and Johnston claimed the money and attempted to recover it, but the auditor, believing he was not entitled to it in that proceeding, decided against him, and on exceptions to his ruling he was sustained by the court, but no appeal was taken to the Supreme Court. At this hearing the Wacherlie deed with receipt for full amount of consideration, the judgments of Johnston v. Wacherlie, and Wacherlie v. Stepp, the exemplification to Butler county, and the agreement between Gilpin and Wacherlie were all put in evidence and considered by the auditor.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b538-9" data-blocks='[["BL_538.8",538,[276,1326,1173,597]]]'>3. John Gilpin was acting throughout as attorney at law and attorney in fact for Johnston. As attorney at law he entered a judgment against Wm. F. Johnston and in favor of J. W.

Johnston, authorizing him to take possession of the lands, to sell them or rent them, to collect the rents, purchase money and moneys due on contracts, to pay all costs, charges, expense and taxes out of the proceeds, and to make distribution as expressed in the letter of attorney and this relation continued up until the time of his death.</p>

The question is not, what did Johnston know of the condition of his matters in the hands of his attorney and the assignment of this judgment ? but what might he have known by the use of the means of information within his reach with the vigilance the law requires of him?</p>

Johnston or pay the money to him, especially when he had no knowledge that Johnston was the owner of the Wacherlie judgment, does not constitute a fraudulent concealment. It was the duty of the plaintiff to ask for information and, upon his failure to do so, the period of limitation began to run when the right of action accrued, that is, when the defendant received the money from Mr. Brandon.</p>

He had no knowledge of Johnston’s ownership of the Wacherlie judgment, and was entitled to suppose that the judgment belonged to Gilpin. The right of action of Johnston to recover the money from McCain commenced in October, 1886, when McCain received it from Mr. Brandon. As McCain was guilty of no fraud there is no question in the case as to the postponement of the running of the statute until after the fraud was discovered, and hence at the end of six years from the time the money was received the statute became a bar to the plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiff was himself to blame for not inquiring for his money long before 1886 and continually thereafter. Had he done so the true facts of the situation would have been discovered, and he would have recovered his money. It certainly would not be just to hold McCain responsible for a result which flowed from the plaintiff’s neglect in this regard. We sustain the findings and conclusions of the learned court below which relate to this subject, and in doing so the case is disposed of on the plea of the statute of limitations.</p>
