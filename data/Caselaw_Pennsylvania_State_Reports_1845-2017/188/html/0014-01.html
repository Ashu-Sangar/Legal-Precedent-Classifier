      <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>The suggestion contains, in substance, the following averments :</p>
    <p id="b37-4" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[155,456,1171,596]]]'>That the relator had been a member of the Palestine Royal Arch Chapter, No. 240, Royai Arch Masons, since December 22, 1873, and a life member since December, 1892; and said chapter had been a contributor to the support and maintenance of the Masonic Home of Pennsylvania from the time of its organization under the act of May 6, 1871, which act of incorporation is made part of the suggestion. That by section four of the by-laws of said Home it is provided that, “ Masonic bodies desiring to contribute to the support and maintenance of the Home may select one of their members to represent such contributions in this corporation, who shall act until his successor is chosen.”</p>
    <p id="b37-5" data-blocks='[["BL_37.5",37,[153,1071,1171,1324]]]'>That at a meeting held January 10, 1896, at 7 o’clock p. M. (one hour before the annual meeting of the home on that day) the relator was reappointed as representative of Palestine Chapter in the Masonic Home. Section fourteen of the by-laws of said Home requires that nominations for the board of managers shall be made at a stated meeting of the corporation in October, and relator was then nominated with six others to fill seven vacancies about to occur by the expiration of the respective terms of seven managers. The next section of said by-laws provides that the election shall be at the annual meeting, by ballot, and a majority of the votes cast shall be necessary to a choice. At the annual meeting on January 10, 1896, at 8 o’clock P. M., the six others nominated in October, 1895, were balloted for and elected. The relator was the “only other qualified nominee, and he received at least one vote, and that being the whole number of votes cast he was duly elected also.” Notwithstanding the foregoing facts, the president of the Home illegally declared that the relator was not qualified for election, and directed the tellers not to receive votes cast for him, and permitted defendant to be nominated and balloted for and declared elected, and since January 10, 1896, defendant has illegally exercised the office. Section five of the Home’s act of incorporation provides that, in case of a failure by the corporation to hold such election at the specified time, the old members shall hold over until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified.</p>

    <p id="b38-6" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[313,1366,1174,557]]]'>That, while defendant is informed that relator was reappointed as representative of Palestine Chapter on January 10, 1896, between 7 and 7:30 o’clock P. m., yet during that evening at the regular stated monthly meeting of said chapter, the suspension of the relator from Excelsior Mark Lodge was announced, either before or after his said reappointment; that no certificate of said reappointment was produced at the meeting of said Masonic Home, nor was there information, oral or written, given to said corporation of said relator’s reappointment; nor did the relator make any claim-at said meeting that he had been reappointed by said chapter as its representative.</p>
    <p id="b38-7" data-blocks='[["BL_38.6",38,[313,1929,1173,451]],["BL_39.1",39,[163,366,1167,299]]]'>That under the laws of the grand chapter, the decision of the grand high priest is final; and, at a meeting of the chapter, said official rendered his decision “that suspension from a Mark Lodge worked a suspension in the Chapter; and that such suspension in the Chapter was deprivation of and a destruction of all- rights, privileges and emoluments ( i. e. office ) pertaining to membership. Vacancies in office may thereby be created and, if so, can be and are presumably filled, so that although a subsequent restoration in his lodge of Mark Master Masons, <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>either to good masonic standing or membership, is as immediate and forceful in restoring to membership in the Chapter as suspension in the mark lodge was in destroying, yet such restoration is to membership only, and not to official relations that may have theretofore existed.

    <p id="b39-6" data-blocks='[["BL_39.6",39,[162,1032,1166,402]]]'>The. defendant’s contention is that averments of fact, well pleaded in his answer and admitted by the demurrer, conclusively show that, at the time of the annual election on January 10, 1896, the relator, by reason of the suspension averred in the answer, was a disqualified nominee for election as a manager of the Masonic Home, ineligible to that office, and also disqualified to act as a member holding over in the event of a failure to elect at the appointed time.</p>
    <p id="b39-7" data-blocks='[["BL_39.7",39,[162,1444,1167,290]]]'>This position appears to be well taken and fully sustained by the facts admitted by the pleadings and the laws of the order applicable thereto. That being so, the president of the Home was fully justified in declaring the fact of relator’s ineligibility and disqualification, and in taking such other action at the annual election as he is said to have done at that time.</p>
    <p id="b39-8" data-blocks='[["BL_39.8",39,[162,1750,1168,402]]]'>The relator having become disqualified and ineligible after his nomination for election, and so continuing at the time of the annual election, it was entirely proper, as well as necessary, to assume that his disqualification created a vacancy in the nominees and required the nomination of a qualified person to fill said vacancy. The defendant was accordingly nominated, balloted for and declared duly elected a member of the board of managers of the Home.</p>
    <p id="b39-9" data-blocks='[["BL_39.9",39,[161,2161,1166,248]],["BL_40.1",40,[271,349,1175,341]]]'>The fact of relator’s suspension on December 15, 1895, and the disqualifying effect thereof are clearly established.

    <p id="b40-5" data-blocks='[["BL_40.4",40,[271,709,1172,94]]]'>This latter qualification, of course, means free masons in good standing, — not suspended members of the order.</p>
    <p id="b40-6" data-blocks='[["BL_40.5",40,[270,812,1174,657]]]'>While masonic bodies, contributing to the maintenance of the Home, may select one of their members to represent such contributions in the management of the Home, it is the right as well as the duty of the latter not to recognize or elect any such representative unless he is a free mason in good and regular standing. When therefore the relator was suspended on December 15, 1895, from Excelsior Mark Lodge, No. 216, he was by the constitution of the grand chapter suspended ipso facto from Palestine Royal Arch Chapter, No. 240, which body he had theretofore represented in the board of managers of the Masonic Home. He was thenceforth ineligible to nomination to that position, and, so far as appears, he continued ineligible until after the election of the defendant in January, 1896.</p>
