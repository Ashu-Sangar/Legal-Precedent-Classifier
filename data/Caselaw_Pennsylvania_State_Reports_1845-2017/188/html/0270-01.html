This aphorism, we may say, was declared by a most eminent judge and lawyer, and is the natural inclination of a cultured legal mind to accept a reasonable cause for a legal conclusion. This doubt may, then, be said to arise among those dealing with the law about the divinity of the family relation, when they meet so often the unseemly wrangles and disputes among members of the same family, among those, indeed, who come from the loins of the same parents, who were nursed in infancy and nourished by the care, labor, attention and love, we may say, of common parents. It would be well if, when the grave covers all that is mortal of the parents, the disputes and wrangles among the children for the pittance of the material estate the parent leaves behind, were ended; we say, it would <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>be well if, when the grave covers the parent, the wrangles and disputes of children over his or her accumulations would be forgotten in the common distress that a dear parent has been lost. That this is not so is discouraging, indeed, to the parent when he is thinking and laboring and saving his accumulations and the results of his industry so that when he is gone Iris children may have a fair start in life and not be dependent upon the cold charity of the world. We say it is discouraging for a parent to labor and accumulate and make efforts to do good so that his children may have profit when he is gone from them, to think that they will so soon forget the reciprocal duties of the great relation of parent and child and get into unseemly wrangles in our courts. Such thoughts are suggested from this class of cases, when we think of the .young parents, their tender love and affection for their children, by industry and prudence accumulating property, passing through the morning and the vigor of life to dependent old age, the hand of affliction comes to the parents and they are helpless, and these little children that have been the subject of their care grown to be men and women are the natural dependence of the parents who are thus afflicted. Oh, it is a solemn and unpleasant thing to think, after you are dead or in your affliction, these children that you have so tenderly raised will begrudge you those attentions which the afflictions of age bring upon you. We say, it weakens our confidence in the divinity of human nature when we see-these things, and we deprecate them. We could only wish they could be kept out of our courts. Higher authority than we has said this, and, hence, the law says that no child shall recover for services rendered to the father unless a special contract to pay for such services has been made and proved. Now, that is the law. You have heard it discussed, and we have made these general remarks to indicate briefly the reason of it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.4",294,[273,1987,1172,402]],["BL_295.1",295,[179,337,1169,1172]]]'>A learned judge, away back, says: “ Unless an express contract can be shown there can be no precedent more dangerous than to permit a son to succeed in an attempt to avail himself of an account trumped up for the purpose of getting an undue share of the estate at the expense of the other heirs. When a son continues with a father after age, and it is usually done with a view to provision by will, if disappointed in, perhaps, his reasonable expectations, we cannot permit him to turn around and <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>attempt to retrieve Ms fortunes by resorting to an account on a quantum meruit for services rendered the father in his lifetime.” That has been reiterated again and again. Judge Ag-nkw says, in Leidig v. Coover, <a href="/pa/47/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="47 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="485530" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0534-01">47 Pa. 534</a>, that “the declarations of a parent to compensate a child may admit the filial devotion and real work of the child and the profit he derives from the services. They may reach further and disclose his own sense of obligation and his settled purpose to compensate. But all this is insufficient to raise a promise. Without a contract expressly made for wages, proved by clear, distinct and satisfactory evidence, there cannot be a recovery.” The law, in that respect, is predicated upon that natural feeling that is presumed to exist between father and son, son and father, or children and parents. Hence, to allow services rendered by one to the other to be recovered for in cold dollars and cents, an express contract must be proved. Now, it is different between strangers, because when one stranger renders service to another the law implies a contract and the person rendering the service is to be paid what the services are shown to be reasonably worth. But with a parent and child, we say, there must be an express contract. We have made this plain to you so that you will understand the reason why we were so exacting about a written contract in the matter.] [1]</p>

That is the only question; and it is well for you to recall, when you are considering what shall be the rate of compensation, what were the relations between these parties, that it was not between strangers, but it was between a son and a father. A son is entitled to just such compensation as comes within the purview of the expressions of the written contract. [But in computing that, reference should be had to the relative position of the parties, the fact that they were parent and child. In arriving at this compensation, we think that should be borne in mind, not as a matter of charity alone, but as an element entering into the quantity and the nature of the services which are claimed for here. <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>Look at this as a fair business proposition; recalling the fact, also, that this was father and son.] [2]</p>

    <p id="b298-6" data-blocks='[["BL_298.6",298,[268,805,1174,761]]]'>The contract between the plaintiff and his father being in writing, it was obligatory upon the father, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover on it. But the contract not having fixed upon the rate of compensation to be paid to the plaintiff for his services but, on the contrary, expressly provided that it should be a reasonable recompense, it necessarily devolved upon the jury exclusively to say how much it should be. The court properly left this question to the jury with correct instructions as to their duty. While it must be conceded that the remarks of the trial judge complained of in the first assignment were more redundant than the occasion required we cannot say there was positive error in them which we could regard as ground for reversal. The natural repugnance of most persons to contracts of this nature was some excuse for the comments of the court, but they were not erroneous in law.</p>
