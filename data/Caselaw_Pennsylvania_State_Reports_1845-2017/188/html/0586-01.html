    <p class="summary" id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[262,711,1175,1373]]]'>Under this act the Supreme Court held in In re Wilson, Commonwealth’s App., <a href="/pa/4/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="401925" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0164-01">4 Pa. 164</a>, that in default of the filing of a certified statement in pursuance of the provisions of the act of 1827, the commonwealth’s claim was entitled to no preference over other lien creditors. This was a contest between rival liens in the distribution of the proceeds arising from the sale of real estate by the sheriff. This case was followed by Arnold’s Estate, <a href="/pa/46/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="46 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="420639" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0277-01">46 Pa. 277</a>, which was also a contest between lien claimants, and the commonwealth was postponed to lien creditors because no certificate had been filed as required by the act of 1827. Next came the Act of 1879, P. L. 119, section 14, viz: “ That all taxes imposed by this' act shall be a lien upon the franchises and property, both real and personal, of corporations and limited partnerships, from the time the said taxes are due and payable; and whenever the franchises or property of a corporation or limited partnership shall be sold at a judicial sale all taxes due the commonwealth shall first be allowed and paid out of the proceeds of such sale, before any judgments, mortgages or other claims which shall be entered of record or become a lien after the passage of this act.” When this act came before the Supreme Court for interpretation it was held that the act of 1827 requiring a certified copy to be filed in the prothonotaiy’s office is not inconsistent with the act of 1879, nor is it repealed by it; and that to enable the commonwealth to obtain a lien as against other lien creditors, a certified copy must be filed as required by the act of 1827: Win.

But this section is a transcript of section 14 of the act of 1879, except that it adds to corporations and limited partnerships the words “companies, associations and joint-stock associations,” thereby extending- the scope of its subjects. But it is contended that the next section of the act of 1889 (section 32), <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>sustains the contention that no certificate need be filed. It reads as follows: “ That no corporation, company, joint-stock association, association or limited partnership made taxable by this act shall hereafter be dissolved by the decree of any court of common pleas, nor shall any judicial sale be valid or a distribution of tbe proceeds thereof be made until all taxes due the commonwealth have been fully paid into tbe state treasury and the certificate of tbe auditor general, state treasurer and attorney general to this effect filed in tbe proper court with the proceedings for dissolution or sale.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[174,874,1173,1119]]]'>This section is similiar to section 15 of the act of 1879, relative to dissolution proceedings, except the words “nor shall any judicial sale be valid or a distribution of the proceeds thereof be made.” The language of the section is no stronger than that of the preceding section and that of section 14 of the act of 1879. Both expressly provide that when property of a corporation is sold at a judicial sale “ all taxes due the commonwealth shall first be allowed and paid out of the proceeds of sucb sale before any judgment, mortgage or other claim.” And yet the Supremo Court held that tbe act of 1827 was not repealed, and that to obtain priority over other lien creditors the commonwealth must file a certified statement of the taxes due. In Goodwin Gas Stove &amp; Meter Co.’s Assigned Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20Pa.%20297" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="166 Pa. 297">166 Pa. 297</a>, it was held that under tbe fourteenth section of tbe act of 1879 and tbe thirty-first section of the act of 1889, the commonwealth’s lien for taxes took priority over the claims of general creditors (the fund being tbe proceeds of personal property), and that in such case the commonwealth need not file a certified statement of taxes due; and in that case there were no lien creditors. The authorities are in that case fully examined and we think they fully sustain the views we have expressed.</p>
