Such charters authorize the corporation to take, receive, hold and dispense with all kinds of personal and real property, and to employ the same according to its will or the will of the donors. The act of 1855 required all such charters to contain a clause that the property shall not be otherwise taken and held or inure than subject to the control and disposition of the lay members of such church, or such constituted officers or representatives thereof as shall be composed of a majority of lay members, citizens of Pennsylvania.

It is incorporated as an Episcopal church. The ecclesiastical authorities attend to the spiritual necessities of the church, who are represented by the rector. The church wardens and vestry represent the laity. The principal object is the worship of God according to the doctrines and canons of the Protestant Episcopal church of America. It has no authority to erect or perpetuate memorials or monuments, or tó apply its property for any such purposes, if that is the primary object. It has no power to divert its revenues or to expend its property for any other purpose than the worship of God, as a church, and to maintain the building as a place of worship. Monuments and memorials are intended to perpetuate the memory of great and good men. That was not the object of the incorporation of this church. In this case the incorporation expresses its object in its name; it is chartered as the Church of the Good Shepherd. The complainants contend that it should have been chartered as a memorial or monument to two of the good shepherds, faithful leaders. If it was intended as a memorial to these two deceased bishops, its name conveys no such idea. There can be no objection to the erection of such <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>memorials, but, when erected by a corporation, the charter, if that is the sole object, should contain the power. It clearly was not the object of this society, as expressed by its articles of association and its charter, to be merely a monument or memorial to these two deceased bishops. Unless, therefore, this corporation has done some official act, authorized by its charter, that will render it a trustee ex maleficio, or, by some authorized instrument in writing, it has made itself in law a trustee for the perpetual preservation of this church as a memorial to these two deceased bishops; it has, by its charter, full and complete dominion over all its property, so far as the objects of the corporation are concerned. The appropriation of its property for the erection and perpetuation of monuments to men would be ultra vires. Such erections may be permitted as mere sentimental religious expressions, but they cannot be enforced, unless, as before stated, the church has done some act which would render it a trustee either in fact or in law. It must have done some act in violation of some other person’s civil right to give the court jurisdiction. The referee holds that the resolution of the vestry of 1870, before the church was incorporated, and the resolution of 1871, after the date of the charter, are in the nature of a written declaration of a trust, and, as subscriptions were made upon the faith of these resolutions, it would be bad faith in the corporation to now remove the memorial. True, the resolution of 1870, made about the time the church was moving for its incorporation, expresses a desire that the Church of the Good Shepherd be erected as a memorial to the late Bishop Kemper, Wisconsin, and that the committee on charter be directed to have the charter altered to that effect. This resolution was either rejected by the committee, by the attorney general, or by the Supreme Court, for we find that the charter was not altered, but nine months after the date of this resolution its charter was granted in its present form. Wo are, therefore, at a loss to comprehend upon what the referee bases his conclusion that this resolution was a written declaration of trust. It is true that after the date of the charter, July 7,1871, anothei resolution was adopted, declaring that the Church of the Good Shepherd be erected as a memorial to two deceased bishops (the first resolution only named one); but no amendment was made to the charter, nor is it <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>proved that any subscriptions were made upon the direct faith of this resolution. It is admitted that the vestry has acted throughout in strict conformity with the canons of the church, and has the assent and approval of the ecclesiastical authorities; it also seems that there is now no rector or church services held in the building proposed to be "sold, and cannot be without favorable action by the ecclesiastical authorities of the church. While, therefore, the complainants charge that they are able and willing to maintain church worship at that place, it is beyond their power to do so without the consent of the ecclesiastical powers of the church. The referee has no other instrument or fact than the resolution aforesaid to base his conclusion upon that there was an actual trust to apply the property of the church or corporation to the maintenance of these monuments. The parol evidence upon the subject is of the most vague and unsatisfactory character. It appears, from the report of the referee, that at least one half of the subscriptions were made without condition. The evidence shows and the referee finds that the heading of the subscription list made no such reference; they were in the usual form for subscriptions for a church. Even Mrs. Cushman does not say that she gave her $500 on the representation of the corporation that this church was to be a memorial, etc. She says that she gave her subscription of $500 after the church had been built, knowing and believing that it was a memorial church, and that she obtained from her father a subscription of $500 after telling him that it was to be a memorial church. There is not a word here tending to show that the corporation authorized her to make such a representation to her father, or that she or he gave upon the faith of any such authorized representation by her. James C. Haydon says he contributed $200 in lumber, and was largely induced to do so because of the church being a memorial. The referee finds as a fact: “The vestry undoubtedly had in mind the construction of a Protestant Episcopal church as a place of worship merely.” He says: “ How far the memorial character of the church entered as a factor in such contract of subscription it would have been extremely difficult to determine in 1871; it is practically impossible now.” All the windows of the church except two are memorial windows. The two largest ones were undoubtedly memorials to the two deceased bishops, <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>and it is highly probable that these windows were the only memorials ever contemplated by the corporation when the church was constructed, or by the contributors when they made tlieir subscription.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b463-3" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[189,547,1171,1576]]]'>One of the complaints in the bill was that waste was about being committed by the removal of these windows. The referee finds as a fact that this charge is not sustained. The referee finds the value of the old church property to be from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars. So far as we are able to see, the above are about all the essential facts in the case, and from them the referee concludes that this church was intended to be a memorial to these two deceased bishops, and that it would be bad faith to permit its demolition. To come to such a conclusion, the referee must either find a trust ex maleficio, and that the corporation are such trustees, or he must find a written declaration of trust. He seems to have construed the resolution of July 7,1871, into such a declaration. The church charter and deeds raise no such trust, and if the charier and deed are to be reformed it will hardly be held that the testimony in the case is sufficiently clear and explicit. It will be admitted without the citation of authorities that the evidence to create a trust ex maleficio must be as explicit as the evidence necessary to reform a deed; in other words, “clear, explicit, and unequivocal.” Trusts other than those that result from operations of law, since the act of 1856, must be in writing. The resolution of July cannot, without being reformed by parol testimony, be construed into a written declaration of trust, and the evidence of the reformation of the instrument is clearly insufficient. The resolution does not say a word about the subscriptions, or how they are to be applied, and was not seen, used, or exhibited to any of the subscribers as an inducement for subscriptions. Upon the question of the sufficiency of the evidence see Huffnagle v. Blackburn, <a href="/pa/137/0633-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="137 Pa. 633" data-case-ids="821470" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0633-01">137 Pa. 633</a>; Kraft v.

The oral testimony refers to conversations made twenty-five or six years ago, and relies upon such conversation to reform this resolution and convert it into a <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>declaration of trust. The probability is that the preacher did refer to the two memorial windows, and might have spoken of the church as the memorial, having reference alone to the memorial windows that it contained. It is also quite probable that all the subscriptions that were intended as memorials related wholly to these two windows. Every one familiar with the efforts to raise funds for a religious purpose knows how solicitous the collectors are to touch the charitable sentiments of the persons solicited for the subscriptions. Memorial windows are proposed to dead relatives and friends, and they are sold at fixed prices, scaled according to the size of the windows and their place in the church. Some will give a memorial altar; others a font in which the name of the giver appears in letters of gold. They all have their reward by being permitted to look upon their contributions whenever they visit the church, but no such contributors ever supposed that they have the right to insist upon their memorials being preserved forever and to prohibit the church from selling the property, if the effect would be to destroy their gift. The referee finds that because the vestry adopted the resolution above recited it thereby gave authority to all the collectors for contributions to hold out as an inducement that the church was to be a memorial, and that he presumed that such inducements were made, and now finds that it would be bad faith upon the part of the corporation to sell the church, notwithstanding the day of its use-fullness as a church may have forever passed away: I can find</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.4",464,[243,1671,1178,442]]]'>no sufficient evidence that this resolution was ever in any manner referred to in making contributions, and if it had been it would not have the effect of creating the trust contended for. It may be that a court of equity, under proper circumstances, would restrain the destruction of these memorial windows, but, as I understand the testimony, this is not proposed, and it is proposed to remove them and set them up in the new church. I gather this from the fact reported by the referee that there is no evidence of an intended devastavit.</p>

Tbe Supreme Court were of opinion that if the facts set out in the bill should be sufficiently proved tbe action of the vestry in attempting to sell the church and destroy tbe memorials would be illegal. In tbe same opinion tbe Court says there is no doubt of tbe power of this corporation to sell tlie church, free from all trust, by proper proceedings, evidently referring to a proceeding under tbe Price Act. Tbe referee admits that there is much in tbe case to indicate that the administration of the work of the church would be facilitated if he could arrive at a different determination. If the several allegations of the hill had been sufficiently proved, the plaintiffs would be entitled to the relief prayed for: but, in our opinion, tbe evidence is too vague and uncertain to sustain any of tbe material allegations in the bill.

In that ease, a demurrer to the bill had been sustained in the court below, and the bill dismissed. We held, speaking by our Brother Wileiams : “We see no reason disclosed by the bill for doubting the power of the corporation to change the place at which its services shall be conducted. It may be that, upon a proper application to the courts, leave to sell the Radnor property migjht be given, and the trust imposed upon the fund, if any, might be provided for elsewhere; but if, as the demurrer admits, subscriptions were secured towards the erection of the house at Radnor for the purpose of building at that place a memorial to Bishops Bowman and Kemper, or for any other distinct purpose apart from the mere erection of a place of worship, and if with the money so obtained the memorial was built, the question whether the corporation may raze it to the ground, transport the material taken from it to some other place, and use it in the erection of á building for a wholly different purpose is not a question of church polity or ecclesiastical power. It is a question of fair dealing between the church authorities and those who furnished them the money with which to build, over which a court of equity has jurisdiction.” Therefore, the decree dismissing the bill was reversed, the demurrer overruled, <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>the bill reinstated and defendants directed to answer to tbe averments of fact. On tlie record being remitted to the court below, defendants filed answer, denying all the material averments of fact. By agreement, the issue was sent to Lewis Lawrence Smith, Esq., as referee, whose findings of fact and conclusions of law, in the main, sustain the plaintiffs’ contention. On exceptions being filed and heard in the court below the findings of the referee were overruled. We have, then, the conflict between the referee and the court to settle by our decree.</p>
    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[167,856,1167,557]]]'>The act of 1855 requires that all charters, such as that held by this church, shall contain a clause subjecting ail the church property to the control of the lay members of the corporation or church, through constituted officers, a majority of whom shall be citizens of Pennsylvania. The vestry of Protestant Episcopal churches or congregations represent the laity, and this act must be road into this charter. It follows that the vestry can dispose of this property under ecclesiastical rules, in the interests of the church, unless they attempt to violate a condition subject to which the property was granted or money to purchase and build it was contributed.</p>
    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[164,1423,1168,968]],["BL_470.1",470,[287,325,1175,607]]]'>The court below finds from the evidence that the church was erected as a place of worship merely; that while the two largest windows in it were memorials to the two deceased bishops, yet that it is b ighly probable these windows were the only memorials contemplated by the corporation when the church was erected and the contributors made their subscriptions. The learned judge of the court below further finds that there is no intention on the part of the corporation to destroy these windows, but that it is the intention to remove them, and place them in the new church. We cannot discover in the testimony, any evidence of unfair dealing by the majority with the minority. Undoubtedly, quite a number of persons subscribed and paid their money towards the erection of the old church, because it was represented to them that it was to be a memorial church to the one" or other or both of tbe deceased bishops ; and in pursuance of this promise the two memorial windows were placed in the church. Palpably, tbe condition was then fulfilled, because no complaint is heard that it liad been broken, in all the years following. But what is the reasonable interpretation of <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>such a condition ? Certainly, not that the corporation will, through all the mutations of time, perpetually maintain the church at that particular spot, with those particular windows. We must assume that both corporation and contributors made the condition, subject to the law of the church, that if the congregation became depleted in numbers and substance by reason of death and removals, or shifting of population, this particular church might be disposed of, and all the associations connected with it should, as nearly as possible, be transferred to a successor, wisely located in a new field. That it was to forever remain in that place, even though not a single worshiper entered its doors, is an unreasonable interpretation.</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[282,941,1176,1214]]]'>After a careful examination of the testimony, the findings and conclusions of the referee and the court, we are of opinion that the decree sustaining the exceptions was fully warranted. There certainly is no evidence to sustain the charge of unfair dealing on the part of the corporation with those who paid their money to construct the old building. While this is our opinion, we do not concur in the remarks of the learned judge on the subject of memorials to perpetuate the names of those deceased members of the congregation whose lives and works have rendered them objects of affection and veneration. It in no degree antagonizes the primary objects of a church to have connected with it, in whatever way suits the taste or wish of the members, the names of such persons; in fact, it is the conviction of many Christians that they are aids to religious sentiment, and such has been the belief of multitudes in all ages, especially in the Roman Catholic and Episcopal churches. It is one of the natural and indefeasible rights guaranteed by our constitution that every one shall have the right to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience. If the pious persons of this denomination choose, as an incident of their house of worship, to so construct or decorate it as to continually call to mind deceased persons noted for piety or devotion, it in no way transgresses their franchise, and is none of our business either as courts or individuals.</p>
