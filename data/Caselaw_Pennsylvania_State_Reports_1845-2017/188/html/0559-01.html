    <p class="summary" id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[156,401,1175,195]]]'>The plaintiff is the assignee of F. W. Hughey, Esq., who, for himself and others, was the owner of judgments Nos. 601 and 602 of June term, 1890, against Charles F. Klopfer, aggregating on June 29, 1892, about $3,700.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b581-6" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[156,608,1176,556]]]'>The defendants were the executors of John Kaiser, deceased, but in this proceeding are personally responsible for their contract and acts. At that time, it seems that Charles F. Klopfer was the owner of the tract of land in the Twelfth ward of the city of Allegheny, described in the second section of plaintiff’s bill, as containing four acres, three rods and seven perches. On this tract of land was a mortgage, owned by D. Z. Brickel, amounting to about $10,000, which was the first lien. The judgments held by Mr. Hughey were the second lien, and following those liens were judgments obtained by John Kaiser, in his lifetime, amounting to about $16,000.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b581-7" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[155,1173,1175,702]]]'>It appears that Charles F. Klopfer was insolvent. Mr. Kaiser’s executors and their attorney conceived the plan of saving the amount of their judgments, by getting control of the preceding liens, selling the property as a whole, and then reselling it at a profit, and they entered into negotiations with Mr. Brickel and Mr. Hughey for the control of their judgments. The result was the agreement, which is exhibit “A” of plaintiff’s bill, made June, 1892, between Frank W. Hughey, for himself, and Magnus Pflaum, who signs as “attorney and trustee.” The evidence shows, and the agreement itself shows, that he was acting for these defendants, as executors of John Kaiser. The evidence in this case shows that he had power and authority from them to so act, and it is conceded that they are responsible for his acts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b581-8" data-blocks='[["BL_581.7",581,[153,1895,1173,508]],["BL_582.1",582,[273,361,1180,909]]]'>In pursuance of this arrangement, and with the assent of Mr. Brickel, the owner of the mortgage, a judgment having been obtained on the mortgage and an execution issued thereon, the property was sold in September, 1892, for $14,100, the bid being made by Mr. Pflaum, acting as attorney for the executors of John Kaiser. The title, however, was taken in the name of D. Z. Brickel, the owner of the mortgage and execution creditor. The purchase money was applied by the sheriff, first, to the payment of costs; second, to the payment of the mortgage; and third, to the judgments held by Mr. Hughey. To these judg<a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>ments, the sum of $3,200 was distributed, Mr. Hughey having assigned the judgments to Mr. Brickel, in order to have the proposition carried out. Mr. Brickel took the title in order to permit the arrangement, set out in exhibit “A,” of plaintiff’s bill, to be consummated, conveyed to William T. Howe, and William T. Howe conveyed to the defendants in this case. All of these conveyances were under this arrangement. A new mortgage was given by the defendants to William T. Howe, who assigned to the Safe Deposit Company to raise the money to pay Mr. Brickel his mortgage, which was done, and the defendants held the property under this arrangement. This is both admitted and proved. It constitutes the defendants’ trustees, and trustees to pay first, after paying the necessary expenses, the money borrowed to pay this mortgage to Mr. Brickel, and to pay the $3,000, which, under the agreement, was to be paid to Mr. Hughey, and, for the purposes of this case, the plaintiff, Mr. Hughey, the corporation stands in his shoes.</p>

The other lots v?ere mostly comparatively small lots.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b582-6" data-blocks='[["BL_582.5",582,[274,1596,1176,702]]]'>The defendants, in their amended answer, allege that the written agreement of June 29, 1892, did not correctly state the agreement: first, in this, that the residence lot was not included in this agreement, or that Hughey was not to share in the proceeds of that lot until the amount of the mortgage debt had been paid, and it was to be security therefor; and also, allege other mistakes in, and modifications of, the agreement. The testimony on that point is squarely contradicted by Mr. Hughey. It is Mr. Pflaum on one side and Mr. Hughey on the other, and even if there was no evidence on the part of the plaintiff, the evidence of the defendants entirely fails to make such a case as to modify the written agreement on either point. The written agreement, then, is the contract between them.</p>

She ma3r, therefore, be dismissed from further consideration in this case, although possibly she would be liable if there was money that had been squandered, or for the portion that was conveyed in which she joined in the deeds.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[165,727,1165,1478]]]'>The defendants, having gotten possession of tbe property, in the latter part of 1892, proceeded to make some arrangement for sale, and, on inquiry, were advised that the plan of Mr. Klopfer was not a judicious division of the property, and, none of it having been sold, they employed a surveyor and had a new plan made, changing slightly tbe location of tbe streets, and also changing the lots, enlarging the residence lot, and making in all fifty-four lots in their plan. After this was done, and perhaps after one sale bad been made, they came to tbe conclusion that it was necessary to grade the leading street, the name of which had been changed from Klopfer street to Kaiser street, and they proceeded to grade it. The testimony indicates that the land was steep and a rather rough piece of ground on which to lay out a plan of lots. Having graded this street, they met another difficulty: the earth thrown out on the lower side of the street slipped down, or caused a slip, onto the property of the adjoining owner, and he threatened them with suits. They first undertook with a weak wall to sustain their ground and cleaned off the property on which the ground had slipped down; but that soon gave way, and they were again threatened with suits, and they again proceeded to erect very substantial walls, seventy-two feet In length; and on further advice and consultation with their architect and attorney, they built those walls so that they would be not only walls to sustain tbeir lots and protect that below, but would answer for the foundations of two houses, and in part for a third. They then, on the advice of the architect and of others proceeded to build two houses, to aid in the sale of the property, and to utilize the walls which they had thus built.</p>

The result has been a very slow sale of lots, at any price, and the houses built on these lots have been unsalable at what the defendants claim is cost, and perhaps unsalable at any price that would not be very considerably below cost.</p>

He admits that he was informed of these things, but says that the grading had been partly done before he was informed of it, and it was after the work was in progress that he was informed of the other matters, and that he neither assented nor dissented, deeming it the business of the defendants. It would have been a very safe thing for the defendants to have had an agreement in writing with Mr. Hughey, so that there would be no question about his assent to their spending money in this way. He might have known of their doing this work, and, assuming that it was their own lookout, and that they were responsible, have decided to stand on his agreement.</p>

The sheriff’s cost and list of liens are a part of the necessary expense, as also the court costs and the attorney^ fee of $75.00 and the insurance ; and it would seem to us that the reasonable cost of grading the street to make it accessible so as to sell the lots in a new plan, would be a .clear exercise of discretion, as lots were hardly salable if inaccessible.

It meant, of course, that they were to sell off the property, and not only pay the mortgage indebtedness, but pay the $8,000 to Mr. Hughey within a reasonable time. That $3,000 was not to bear interest, and that, of itself would require prompt action and prompt sales on the part of the trustees. Good faith.to Mr. Hughey required that. They agreed to take care of the. mortgage debt, and we interpret the agreement to mean that after payment of the reasonable and proper expenses, the money was to be divided from time to time, so that Mr. Hughey would get the proportion which his $3,000 bore to the $10,253.80 of the mortgage.

They have paid the mortgage indebtedness, to the amount of $4,815. Substantially they have advanced most of the money to make these improvements on the property and build these houses. We will not order, at present, that the defendants pay any part of this money to Mr. Hughey or his representatives; but, under the circumstances, this agreement having been made looking towards a speedy sale of the property in subdivisions, and Mr. Hughey having agreed that no interest should be paid, we think that his representative is, in equity, entitled to interest on the $3,000, after one year from the date of the sheriff’s sale. The items of $1,777.88, $3,829.17, paid to Mr. Feller, the plumbing bills of $211, and the architect’s bill of $283.85, should be paid hereafter only after the payment of the amount coming to the plaintiff.
