The Marshall Oil Company then proceeded to drill a well, which was completed on May 8,1888, the only well ever drilled on the Grimes farm. It was drilled down to the oil rock, but produced no oil. It was a strong gas well. The Marshall Oil Company did not attempt to utilize the gas, but, for a month or so, endeavored to sell the well. ’After some delay and negotiations, they sold it to the Washington Oil Company, in connection with a lease for fifteen acres, for $4,000.</p>

While these negotiations were going on, and while the well was being gauged, to ascertain the pressure of the gas, the Marshall Oil Company obtained a lease of John Grimes for the whole farm, dated June 19, 1888. This lease was nearly indentical with the lease from Grimes to Akin, except that #600, instead of $700 per annum should be paid for every gas well, when the gas should be conducted and used off the premises, and for the gas well then completed $700 per annum <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>should be paid, and there was no requirement in this lease to put down any additional well. This lease was acknowledged by Grimes on July 4, 1888. Grimes, by a separate agreement, agreed to reduce the annual rental of the gas well to $500. The Marshall Oil Company, then, by sale and lease dated July 5, 1888, sold the well and leased fifteen acres to the Washington Oil Company, in consideration of $4,000 cash paid, and subject to all the terms and conditions of the lease of June 19, 1888.</p>

The Taylorstown Natural Gas Company was simply a device of the Washington Oil Company to get certain privileges and advantages which it could not get under its charter. It wanted the power to secure the right of way for laying pipes and conducting gas to distant points and selling it, which it could not do under its charter as an oil company. ' The large majority of the stock of the Taylorstown Natural Gas Company is owned by the Washington Oil Company, the officers of the two companies are nearly the same, the Washington Oil Company has the entire management and control of the business and receives all, or nearly aE the profits.

Several tests were made to ascertain the pressure, and each test showed an increased pressure and indicated a very strong gas well. By July 4, when the Marshall Oil Company sold to the Washington Oil Company, it was known to be a remarkably strong gas well — a wonderful gas well, as some of the witnesses described it. It has produced an immense volume of gas, sufficient to supply the boilers for drilling forty or fifty wells at the same time, and still continues, after nine years, to produce gas, with little or no diminution of force or volume.</p>

After the gas well was completed, May 8, 1888, by the Marshall Oil Company, the plaintiffs did nothing under the Grimes lease to Akin, and, although they knew of the Grimes lease to the Marshall Oil Company, of June 19,1888, they took no legal steps to test that lease, and made no demand of any of the defendant companies for a share of the profits of the gas, until about the time this bill was filed, July 25,1898, five years after the Marshall Oil Company had sold to the Washington Oil Company.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b627-8" data-blocks='[["BL_627.7",627,[182,1692,1168,347]]]'>1. Is this a proper case for a court of equity ? The bill was filed for discovery, to ascertain the facts as to the relations of the different defendants to the question at issue; as to the disposal of the gas from the well, and for an account for plaintiffs’ share of the profits from the sale of the gas. These matters bring the case properly within the jurisdiction of a court of equity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b627-9" data-blocks='[["BL_627.8",627,[184,2049,1166,350]],["BL_628.1",628,[256,353,1180,710]]]'>2. It is claimed that the plaintiffs were guilty of such laches that they cannot maintain this bill. The statute of limitations cannot apply, for the delay in bringing suit is less than six years from the time the well was completed. It was only five years from the sale by the Marshall Oil Company to the Washington Oil Company, and less than four years from the sale to the Taylorstown Natural Gas Company. In the mean time, the <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>plaintiffs said or did nothing to mislead the defendant companies. They all had actual, as well as constructive, notice of the lease from plaintiffs to the Marshall Oil Company. None of them inquired of the plaintiffs whether they had abandoned their lease or contended that it was still binding. The Marshall Oil Company had a right to make a sale or lease to the Washington Oil Company, and that company to the Taylorstown Natural Gas Company, without the consent of plaintiffs, subject, of course, to the terms of the lease of plaintiffs to the Marshall Oil Company, if that lease was still valid. The silence of the plaintiffs, therefore, was immaterial. If that lease was still valid, they would have to account for a share of the profits from the sale of gas. Besides, there was a continuous liability, from year to year.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.4",628,[253,1072,1175,1323]],["BL_629.1",629,[165,345,1168,199]]]'>3. The main ground of defense is that the lease from Grimes to Akin was forfeited. If that is true, the plaintiffs have no case. Grimes.had a right to forfeit the lease for nonpayment of the quarterly instalment of rent, but it is admitted that the rent was paid until February 13,1888, and the next quarter would not be due until May 13, 1888. The well was completed May 8, 1888. After the lease from plaintiffs, the Marshall Oil Company was liable to pay the rent. Of course, if neither party paid Grimes he could forfeit the lease. Did he do so? Mr. Hart, a member of the Marshall Oil Company, testified that when Grimes visited the well, on May 7 or 8, while they were finishing the drilling, and discovered it was a gas well, Grimes said to him, “ The lease is forfeited for nonpayment of rent.” Grimes denies this, but Grimes could not forfeit the lease then as no rent was due or would be due until May 13. But it is contended that the lease of Grimes to the Marshall Oil Company of June 19, 1888, was a declaration of forfeiture. That would be true if the lease was made for that purpose, and, ordinarily, there would be that presumption. A clause in that lease, inserted at the request of Grimes before he would sign it, proves that he did not intend that lease as a forfeiture of the prior lease to Akin. It was expressly provided that the Marshall Oil Company should stand between him and “all who may have claims to this lease.” That means, all who might have claims to the leased premises under a former lease. This clause proves two things : first, it was not an act on the <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>part of Grimes intended to declare a forfeiture, and second, that the Marshall Oil Company knew that fact and took that lease with full knowledge that there might be a contest, and voluntarily assumed the risk.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b629-4" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[166,552,1169,651]]]'>4. It is very evident that the Marshall Oil Company in procuring the lease from Grimes of June 19 acted in bad faith, and was guilty of a legal fraud upon the plaintiffs. They were bound under the plaintiffs’ lease to drill another well and pay one fourth of the profits from the sale of gas. They were negotiating with the Washington Oil Company to buy the property. They procured this lease from Grimes for two purposes; first, to get clear of drilling another well, which they were bound to do under the lease from the plaintiffs, and there is nothing in their lease from Grimes requiring them to drill another well; and second, to get clear of paying the one fourth of the profits of the sale of the gas, as there is nothing of that kind in their Grimes lease.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[165,1222,1173,863]]]'>5. The Washington Oil Company is not an innocent purchaser or lessee. They knew that the Marshall Oil Company had drilled the well under a contract and lease from the plaintiffs ; that it was completed more than a month before the Grimes lease of June 19; they knew, or they were bound to know, because that lease was on record, all the terms and conditions of that lease. The clause in the Marshall Oil Comp*any’s Grimes lease that that company should stand between Grimes and all persons claiming an interest in the lease, was plain warning that the lease might be contested, alid yet, notwithstanding that knowledge and that plain warning, they did not inquire of Grimes or the plaintiffs whether their lease was forfeited, or claimed to be valid. With their eyes open they bought this well and took a lease of fifteen acres from the Marshall Oil Company, knowing, as they must have known, that, in procuring that lease from Grimes, the Marshall Oil Company was guilty of bad faith, if not manifest fraud, towards the plaintiffs.</p>

If the Grimes lease to the Marshall Oil Company was a fraud upon plaintiffs’ rights under the Grimes lease to Akin it has no validity. The Marshall Oil Company could convey by-virtue of it no title or rights to the Washington Oil Company. The title and rights conveyed to the Washington Oil Company must, therefore, be under the lease from the plaintiffs; and the <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>Washington Oil Company would be a sublessee under the plaintiffs’ lease.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.4",630,[284,450,1174,815]]]'>7. The sale of the gas by the Washington Oil Company to the Taylorstown Natural Gas Company is virtually a sale of the well and a part of the leasehold realty. The Taylorstown Natural Gas Company took possession of the well, and has retained possession ever since. The Washington Oil Company had nothing whatever to do about the well or delivering the gas. The parties cannot change or disguise the real transaction by calling it a bill of sale. Courts, especially courts of equity, will always look through and underneath technical terms to get at the real transaction, and call it by its proper name. The Taylorstown Natural Gas Company is a purchaser or lessee of the well, which, of course, includes the gas flowing from it, and this company is in exclusive possession and enjoyment of the part of the leasehold realty, in the lease from the plaintiffs to the Marshall Oil Company. It is a sub-sublease, and as such subject to all the covenants in the original lease.</p>

If the foregoing views are correct, there can be but little difficulty on the question whether the covenants in the plaintiffs’ lease to the Marshall Oil Company run with the land. In general terms it may be said that when a covenant is for the performance of some duty in connection with the possession, and relating to the land, or in the nature of rent or royalty for the use and enjoyment of the premises, it is a covenant running with the land: Kerr on Real Property, secs. 1218 to 1222; 1 Washburn on Real Property (5th ed.), 528; 2 Wash-burn on Real Property, 298; 1 Smith’s Leading Cases, 230, 231.</p>

The expenses include $700 rental to Grimes under the original lease, costs of pipe and other materials in keeping up the lines, payments for right of way, payments to all employees engaged in attending to the well, pipes, etc., and the business generally of saving, transporting and selling the gas. Although Grimes reduced the annual rental to $500, that was a special favor to defendants, of which the plaintiffs cannot claim any benefit. Their lease with Grimes required them to pay $700 annually.</p>
