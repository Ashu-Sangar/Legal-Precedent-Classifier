    <p class="summary" id="b577-9" data-blocks='[["BL_577.15",577,[144,1457,1174,765]]]'>At the trial it appeared that at about five o’clock in the afternoon on September 6, 1896, Cornelius Moran, a boy about eight years old, was injured while alighting from one of defendant’s electric cars. The boy was in charge of his sister, about thirteen years old, and his cousin, a girl about fourteen years old. When the car reached the Twelfth street crossing in the city of McKeesport it stopped, and the two little girls succeeded in getting off. There was evidence that the little boy followed the girls to the platform, and before he could get off, and about the time he got on the step, the car started, and the boy was jolted or fell off the car. There was also evidence that he jumped off. The evidence tended to show that the conductor was negligent in starting the car before the boy had alighted, and that the motorman had not taken proper precautions to prevent the accident.</p>
