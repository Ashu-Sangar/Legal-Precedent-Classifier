I am unable to find from the evidence when the Cemetery switch was built. Formerly there was a switch opposite the Starr farm, which was superseded by the Ball switch in 1892. These switches appear to have been built from time to time as the work progressed and as found necessary. I am unable to find, as requested by plaintiff, that the defendants ever supposed or decided that the switches as originally located were the necessary and sufficient turn-outs for the completed road. The evidence shows they were not so intended.</p>

This railway west of the citynlimits is largely a summer line, and the traffic thereon from May until October is at times very heavy. It is usually very heavy on Sundays, and on all days when there are picnics or other attractions in the day or evening at the “Head.” And the “Head” being a popular resort there are held there a large number of picnics, dances and other gatherings every summer. This was so before the railroad was built, and is more largely so now.</p>

There is a vast amount of travel over this Lake road from the city to Trinity cemetery in wagons, carriages, on bicycles, etc., and also a large amount of travel on foot.

To the south of this path is a row of telegraph poles, and at some places shade trees, next to which comes the ditch or gutter; south of the gutter is the driveway or roadbed proper. The driveway opposite these switches is from 22 to 24 feet in width. This driveway is not only largely used, both day and evening, by wagons, carriages, etc., but also is largely used by people on bicycles. South of the driveway is the street car track, which was built as near as practicable to the south line of the road. The cars running on this line, and especially those on the switches next to the driveway, have a tendency to frighten horses passing along the south side of the driveway, and cause them to shy off to the north, to the possible collision of wagons, etc., on that part of the driveway.</p>

A double track street railway in this road from the city limits to Trinity cemetery would be of great advantage to defendants and of great convenience to the public using the street cars; and a double track railway practically for one half of the distance, caused by making each one of the switches from 1,000 to 1,200 feet in length would be of some advantage to defendants, as it would enable them to run their cars with less care <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>and make faster time and to that extent would be of some convenience to the public traveling upon the street cars. But with the said road, its present width, and used as it is, a double track street railway therein in whole, or in part as above stated, would be a serious inconvenience and detriment to the public using said road by the other modes of travel. But to equalize the distance between said switches would be a decided benefit to defendants and to the passengers upon their cars, and would not be of any additional inconvenience or detriment to the public otherwise using the street. And also to make said switches each of sufficient length to safely admit of the passage on either side of four or five cars at one time would be a manifest advantage to defendants and their passengers. And the collection of cars and their delays and the sawing back and forth that would thus be avoided would in my opinion fully compensate the public otherwise using said street for any inconvenience that might be occasioned by this increased length of the switches.</p>

In my opinion no such length of switches was or is necessary for defendants’ use upon said line as a single track railway or was in contemplation of any of the parties at the time leave was given to the defendants to construct their railway in said public road, and I believe from all the evidence, and so find that five switches each of the length, including the leaders (that is from point to point from the place where the tracks first diverge), of 360 feet would be all that is necessary for defendants use upon said road between the city limits and Trinity cemetery and would be as much switching facilities as was within the meaning of the parties as “ necessary turn-outs,” when leave was granted defendants to occupy this street.] [1] And I do find that the switches now upon the lake road are insufficient in length, and not at proper distances from each other to accommodate the traffic upon the said line.</p>

I do not see very well how the township authorities could disapprove of a street railway more than twenty years before it seems to have been thought of. Several of defendants’ witnesses give their opinions that these switches should each be 1,000 feet or more in length, but several of the same witnesses say there should be a double track the entire length of the road. And as to both matters, I regard this evidence as referring to convenience and not reasonable necessity. The evidence shows that 32 cars was the largest number ever had on this whole line in one day, and also that these cars can be run safely on a siding to within 25 or 30 feet of each other, so placed that the two sides of a switch 1,000 feet in length will hold at one time the entire 32 cars; to say that five such switches are necessary on about one half of this line is not sustained by the facts. Of course long sidings on which cars might bo run as on a double track would enable defendants to make better time and to use less cars, but are not necessary to a single track road. - The switches which I have suggested, 360 feet long, would provide for leaders at each end 65 feet long, and 230 feet of parallel track on which four, and when trailers are used, five cars, can safely pass on each side, are ample in my opinion to meet the necessities of the defendants. I do not pass upon the question suggested by defendants, which I regard as a remote possibility, that, future change in machinery may make longer sidings necessary. It is urged on behalf of plaintiffs that the switches constructed on this line <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>prior to 1892 were all that defendants regarded as necessary, and were intended as permanent, and that snch switches exhausted defendants’ right in the matter. If these were found to have been intended as the permanent switches for the line, there would be great force in this contention. But when it is considered that said switches were biiilt at different times, that they are of insufficient length, and that there is great inequality of the distance between them, I do not think the court would be justified in finding that they were intended as the permanent switches for this line.</p>
