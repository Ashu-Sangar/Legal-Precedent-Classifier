The action is for injury done to the house by the water of a rain storm by which a part of the cellar wall was thrown down and other damage done to the house and contents. The negligence alleged in the borough is the inadequacy of the sewer to carry off the water flowing to that point, and that the sewer rvas negligently allowed to be filled and obstructed.</p>

      <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>Tbe town of Verona is situated on the bank of tbe Allegheny river. When the Allegheny Valley Railroad was constructed parallel with the river, and near to it, the road at this point was constructed on a fill which prevented the surface water from flowing to the river and thereby caused the pond along the south side of the railroad between the railroad and the river hill. When East Railroad avenue was graded, running along the railroad it was filled to the level of the railroad, and South avenue was graded to conform to it, thereby reducing the size of the pond. The plaintiff’s house at the corner of these streets is-built in the pond; the whole of the cellar wall being above ground on the sides not adjoining the streets. By the grading and improvement of the streets of the borough water was made to flow along these two streets and to the corner in question along the gutters of these streets, which before found its way into the pond at other points. Before the grading of these streets the railroad company had constructed a sewer under the railroad at this point for the purpose of draining the pond, and when the streets were graded the borough constructed its sewer into and connected ifc with the sewer so built by the railroad. There was no evidence that the sewer was improperly constructed or that it was out of repair or had been suffered to be clogged up and remain so. The complaint practically is that the sewer was not adequate in size. There was evidence that notice had been given to several borough officers that the sewer was not taking all the water in heavy rains.</p>

We are not satisfied however that this is not a case for the application of the general rule and, therefore, re-, fuse the motion.</p>
