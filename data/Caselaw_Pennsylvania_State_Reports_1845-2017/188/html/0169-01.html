And when the dividend was less than six per cent, under some of the acts, the tax was assessed on the basis of the rate per cent of the dividend, and under others, on the assessed value of the capital stock. That case decides that when the tax is measured by the rate per cent of the dividend that is the only test; and some of the cases there cited illustrate this very forcibly, and show that the value indicated by the rate per cent is sometimes very different from the actual value. Thus in Atlantic and Ohio Telegraph Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/66/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="66 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="432337" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0057-01">66 Pa. 57</a>, where the report of the officers of the corporation stated that a dividend of ten per cent had been made, it was held that the dividend reported furnished the measure of the tax, although the corporation proved that it had in reality been paid upon a part only of the stock. And in Columbia Conduit Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/90/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="90 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="1065660" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0307-01">90 Pa. 307</a>, where, after declaring dividends amounting to $200,000, a loss by fire occurred to which nearly one half of the amount divided was applied, instead of being paid to the stockholders, the whole dividend was nevertheless held to furnish the measure of the tax. And in Mat-son’s Ford Bridge Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/117/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="117 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="555837" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0265-01">117 Pa. 265</a>, where all the property of a corporation with a capital of the par value of $45,000 was converted into money and amounted to $75,000, the excess of $30,000 above the par value of the capital stock was held to be a dividend, and the company was assessed thereon with a tax of one half mill on each one per cent amounting to $1,500, which would be a three mill tax upon $500,000. And in Commonwealth v. Fall Brook Coal Company, <a href="/pa/156/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="156 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="844952" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0488-01">156 Pa. 488</a>, it was decided that a tax on the capital stock of the Fall Brook Railway Company was a tax on $3,500,000, which the Fall Brook Coal Company held invested in the shares of the railway company, and that to tax that amount of the capital stock of the coal company after the railway company had paid the tax on its capital stock would be double taxation.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="Aqu" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[257,486,1177,1482]]]'>When the dividends did not amount to the rate which by the taxing acts was made the measure of the tax, the capital stock of the company was required to be appraised, and a tax at the rate of originally three' mills, afterwards five, was assessed upon its appraised value. This appraisement, it is true, was formally of the capital stock, and not of the property of the corporation, and the data required to be furnished to the auditor, general, by the terms of the acts, to enable him to judge of the correctness of the appraisement, related to the operations of the company during the year, the amount of its capital stock, and the value of its shares, more directly than to the quantity, quality and value of its assets and property. The inference sought to be drawn from this by the learned counsel for defendant is, that as the value of the shares would be affected by the amount of indebtedness and incumbrances upon the property of the corporation, the practical result was that the tax, so far as it was a tax upon the property of the company, was a tax only on the value of its property less the amount of its indebtedness and incumbrances; but it must be remembered that this basis of assessment was adopted in 1844, when the corporations to which it applied were mainly banks and other moneyed institutions which did not have incumbrances, and whose indebtedness was mainly for deposits, that were a source of profit to the corporar tions. The subjects of the tax are said in the Act of April 29, 1844, P. L. 486, to be “all banks, institutions and companies.” An appraisement of the shares of such corporations at not less than the price at which they sold in the market would furnish a fairly accurate measure of the value of the assets and property of the company.</p>

The court below decided that under the circumstances the value of the capital stock “ must be as measured and indicated by the amount of dividends made and declared.

Thus, the capital stock of manufacturing corporations has been since 1885 exempt from taxation; but as this exemption was held to apply only to the proportion of the capital stock that represented property actually used in the business of manufacturing, while property not so used was held taxable, it became necessary to ascertain the value of the property in order to determine the proportion of the capital stock taxable and exempt.

This case was elaborately argued and considered in the court below, where it was conceded that if the corporation was taxable at all — which was denied — the tax was upon its property and assets; and that the value and nature, and situs, of these must be ascertained in order to determine the amount of the tax; and the data from which these could be ascertained was furnished by the defendant. The court below decided that the defendant was taxable on the amount of its capital stock represented by investments in real estate in Pennsylvania, personal property in Pennsylvania, stocks of foreign corporations, bonds of foreign corporations, and bonds of domestic corporations, and on the proportion.of its capital stock represented by investments in equipment or rolling stock which was found to be within the state, by apportioning the whole amount invested <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>in equipment on the basis of its mileage within and without the state, as shown by the facts and exhibits.

Such inspection showed at the time this case was tried, and would now show, that there had never been any settlement made against the Pennsylvania Company for the years from 1874 to 1887, inclusive, for tax on capital stock, and the court below found this as one of the facts in the case.

The result is, that we are without a decision of the court of last resort on the questions decided in the court below, and discussed in the Supreme Court. The ease is, however, valuable as it shows that it was conceded and understood, both by the counsel and the court, that the tax in question was a tax upon the property of the corporation, the value of which it was necessary to appraise, and that the only controversy, — if the corporation was taxable, — was as to the method of apportionment; and that it was not even suggested by the learned counsel, that the indebtedness o£ the corporation should be deducted in order to ascertain the value.</p>

We think this question is affirmatively answered by the act of June 8,1891, under which the valuation was made. The capital stock represents the franchises as well as other property of the company.

This is implied when it is said that a tax on the capital stock is a tax on the property and assets of the company; and when it is enacted that the tax shall be “ at a fixed rate of five mills upon each dollar of the actual value of their whole capital stock, including as well their bonds, mortgages and moneys at interest, as their franchises and property of other kinds; ” and more definitely still when it is declared in the act of 1891, “ that for the purpose of this act interests in limited partnerships or joint stock associations shall be deemed to be capital stock and taxable accordingly.”</p>

This illustrates the truth of the remark made by Mr. Justice Paxson already quoted, that <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>“ the capital stock is nothing; a myth; a mere name, excepting in so far as it is represented by investments made with the money* paid into the treasury of the corporation on account of such capital stock.” In a limited partnership it is literally nothing but a name apart from the assets, and in a corporation proper it is really nothing more, although we are accustomed to conceive of it as a separate entity.</p>

It is there decided that the capital stock of the corporation, and the shares into which the capital is divided are, at least for the purpose of taxation, identical, and that the shareholders are the real owners of the property and assets, which both the capital stock and the shares represent, and that they are the persons who are taxed when a tax is imposed upon either the capital stock or the shares. A corporation is, on page 494, said to be, “ An artificial person created by law for the purpose of becoming the business representative, agent or trustee of so many persons as may join to furnish the money with which the business to be done by the corporation may be carried on. . . . The money furnished by those whose representative it is to be, is its capital stock. The amount that each person contributes to this fund is his share in the venture, and is called his share or shares in the stock. The legal title to the whole sum so contributed is in the corporation, and so the legal title to all the property, real or personal, in which it may be invested. The equitable title, that is, the right to the profits from the business <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>done, and to a return of the capital when the corporation is dissolved, is in the stockholders. ...

The farm is taxable as land, against whoever may be the owner, without regard to the incumbrances upon it. The sum secured by the mortgage is taxable as money at interest, regardless of the use the borrower may make of it. If the owner of the land is compelled to incumber it, it may be his misfortune, but the man who lends money to him has no connection with him in title. There is in such case no double taxation.” The land is taxed once to its owner. The money at interest is taxed once to its owner.

The corporation is simply a trustee for its stockholders, and they are the real owners of the property, or, as expressed by the learned justice, it is “ the ordinary case of trustee and cestui que trust.” The beneficiaries are the real owners. And whether the property is taxed in the name of the corporation or in the name of the shareholders, the ultimate burden falls on the same persons. The fact that the tax is called a tax on capital stock is therefore not of the essence of the matter. Whatever called, it is a tax on the property and assets of the shareholders for whom the corporation is simply trustee. Neither is it vital that it is taxed in the name of the trustee. The shareholders are the real owners of the property taxed, and the tax is therefore a tax on their property. But when the property of individuals is taxed, no reduction is made because the property is incumbered. It is therefore not easy to see why there should be any specific reduction made for individuals simply because their trustee is a <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>corporation. As was said by Mr. Justice Miller in State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. at page 605: “ Individuals do not escape taxation on their real and personal property because they are insolvent. ... No state has ventured to establish the principle of permitting its visible tangible property to escape taxation relying solely on a tax imposed on the individual on the basis of his estimated wealth in excess of his debts.” The consequence of establishing such a principle in Pennsylvania would be so serious that we cannot believe the legislature has ventured so to do. There are, as is well known, many railroad corporations in the state which, like the one in question in this case, built at an extravagant cost, met chiefly by borrowed money, are now insolvent, and whose net earnings are not sufficient to pay the interest on -their sometimes enormous funded debt, yet have valuable franchises which have been granted by the state, as well as tangible property which for the uses to which it is applied is worth in many cases millions of dollars. All these under the construction of the act of 1891 contended for on behalf of defendant would entirely escape taxation by the state and are not subject to local taxation, while the property of individuals who have no franchise from the state is taxed without regard to their insolvency. And the injustice and impolicy of such a construction is presented in a yet stronger light when we remember that in many oases — and notably in the one now before us — nearly all the funded debt secured by the incumbrances on the insolvent corporation’s property is held by residents of other states or foreign countries, so that if it is not taxable against the insolvent corporation, neither can it be reached, in theory even, by taxing the evidences of indebtedness. The result would be that property within the borders of the state worth many millions of dollars would be entirely exempted from taxation.</p>

The finding of a fact determines the amount of the judgment; the accounting officers of the commonwealth and the court adopt a like construction of the statute, but differing in their views of the evidence, differ in results. The officers of the defendant corporation, putting a wholly different construction on the statute, largely differ from both as to the fact. The defendant appraises its capital stock as of no value whatever; the commonwealth appraises it at 134,480,577.70, the court below appraises it at less than half that amount. The main dispute between the commonwealth and defendant is as to the construction of the act of 1891. It may be conceded at once, that the legislative intent to levy the higher amount must be express or result from necessary implication, for if in a tax law the intent be doubtful it does not exist. The title of the act declares the purpose to be to tax “all the property of corporations, limited partnerships and joint stock associations having capital stock, at the rate of five mills on each dollar of its actual value.” Could legislative language be plainer ? All the property of corporations is to be taxed at the rate of five mills on each dollar of its actual value. The words “ having capital stock ” are used to distinguish such corporations from beneficial, <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>religious and other corporations having membership, but not capital stock representing the respective interests of members in the corporate property. Then, preamble six of the act further declares it to be the purpose to tax “ All corporations, limited partnerships and joint stock associations having capital stock, at a fixed rate of five mills on each dollar of the actual value of their whole capital stock, including as well their bonds, mortgages and moneys at interest as their franchises and property of other kinds.”</p>

Delaware, Susquehanna &amp; Schuylkill R. R.

We think this question is affirmatively answered by the act of June 8, 1891, under which the valuation was made. The capital stock represents the franchises as well as other property of the company. In the sixth preamble of the act there appears a plain legislative purpose to include the franchises in fixing the value of the stock, and tliis is in harmony with the title and the provisions in respect to the taxation of it.” There are other cases to the same effect. The statute having thus, in express terms, declared the sxibject of taxation to be all the property of corporations having capital stock, and the settled interpretation by this Court of a tax on capital stock of a corporation being, that it is'a tax upon all the property of the corporation, it is clear that the learned judge of the court below committed no error in the first sentence of his conclusion of law, thus: “A tax on the capital stock of a corporation is a tax on its property and assets, including its franchises.” °</p>

      <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>The main contention, however, is over the last part of the conclusions, as follows: “ The question of the actual value in cash of the capital stock is a question of fact which must be determined by considering the value of defendant’s tangible property and assets of every kind, including its bonds, mortgages and moneys at interest, and its franchises and privileges, and the amount of the incumbrances on its property and franchises is also a relevant fact to be considered, but it is not to' be specifically deducted from the valuation so ascertained and determined.” The contention of appellant’s counsel, in substance is, that to ascertain the actual value, there should be deducted the amount of the corporation indebtedness from the aggregate fairly appraised value of the corporate property; the remainder would then represent the actual value of the capital stock. This would, in many cases, hide the tangible property and turn the commonwealth over to the assessment and collection of its revenues from nothing; in the, face, too, of what we have repeatedly decided, that a tax upon the capital stock of a company is a tax upon its property and assets. The legislature might have so worded the statute that such result as that contended for would follow; namely, that solvent corporations should pay taxes and insolvent ones not; but, with our decisions in 1882 and 1886, and the declared law long preceding them, that capital stock in taxing statutes meant the property and assets of the corporation before them, they declared, in the act of 1891, precisely to the contrary. In fact, from the wording of preamble six of the act of 1891, we do not doubt, that at least the framer of the act was familiar with the opinion of this court in Com. v. Oil Co., supra.</p>

The declared purpose is to tax the capital stock by ascertaining its value in view of the tangible assets of corporations, what was owing to them, the value of their franchises and the rights and privileges they possessed under their grants. The commonwealth no more sought by the act of 1891 to ascertain and tax the net assets of these artificial beings, than, by the usual tais; laws, she seeks to tax the net assets of natural ones ; <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>in tlie latter case she rarely inquires as to what the taxpayer owes; she does ask what he is possessed of; it is only when the attempt is made to tax his creditor that, incidentally, what is owing by the debtor becomes of interest to the taxing power. We have no hesitation in holding that it would be manifest error to adopt the amount of the debt as a part of the value of the corporate properly; and it would be just as erroneous to hold that it should be deducted from the aggregate value of the property, and thereby withdraw tangible property to that extent from taxation; in either case it would be dragging in a fact of but slight consequence, and making it the prominent and controlling one in the issue, in the face of the declared purpose of the statute to tax the actual value of the capital stock, as indicated by the franchises and property. In the case of Commonwealth v. Standard Oil Co., supra, Paxson, J., in referring to the fact that the certificates of stock were in possession of the owner in Ohio, where the corporation was domiciled, says : 4‘It follows, necessarily, that shares of stock in a Pennsylvania corporation, hold by a corporation or individual domiciled, in another state, cannot be taxed here. One sufficient reason is that there is nothing here to tax. The capital stock, that is, the property and assets, are here and are taxed.” In other words, the shares themselves, which represent the owner’s interest, less debts, have so little to do with the subject of taxation, the capital stock, that it is immaterial where they are held or who holds them; the property and assets, the capital stock, being in this state, that alone is within reach of the taxing power. Now, what change is worked in this tangible property by subjecting it to a debt of the owner ? In the case cited, the certificates and owner were both in a foreign jurisdiction, yet the property and franchise being within the jurisdiction, the authority of the commonwealth to tax the capital stock, on ascertaining its value from what was within the jurisdiction, was upheld. If he cannot withdraw his tangible property from taxation by taking his title to it, and person, outside state boundaries, how can he do so by voluntarily pledging it for a debt? That the owner subjects it to a debt in no way changes the relation of the commonwealth to it as a subject of taxation. It constitutes precisely the same capital stock as before; his relation to his own property has been somewhat <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>changed, for by the mortgage debt he has admitted others to a share of the income, and has given them a lien for their debt;. his title, however, remains just the same, as if the owner of the legal title to land had placed a mortgage upon it. All the indications of ownership, the possession of the deed and dominion over the property, continue as if no debt had been created. As is said by our Brother Williams, in Commonwealth v. Fall Brook Coal Co., 156 Fa. 488, speaking of the power of the commonwealth to tax the land as well as the mortgage upon it: “ In that case, there are two distinct subjects of taxation, each of which is made taxable by an express provision of the law. The farm is taxable as land, against whoever may be the owner, without regard to the incumbrances upon it. . . . The land is taxed once to the owner. The money is taxed'once to its owner. They are distinctly different taxpayers, and pay taxes upon distinctly different subjects of taxation.” The debt, as an item of evidence, may have bearing in fixing the value of the franchise, but from the nature of the property and the character of the debt, its affirmative weight in establishing value is insignificant;.for of all forms of debt, as an indication of actual value of the thing pledged, the ordinary railroad mortgage is the most unreliable, and especially is this the case when the mortgage is executed to carry out a reorganization plan of security holders in a bankrupt road. Without adverting further to the history of this road, it is sufficient to say that its mortgage debt was always far in excess of any possible value of the property. We do not know just what prominence was given by the learned judge of the court below to the amount of indebtedness, in reducing the actual value of the capital stock. He says, in the conclusion of law already quoted, that the question of actual value in cash of the capital stock is one of fact, to be determined by considering the value of defendant’s tangible property, etc. “ And the amount of incumbrances on its property and franchises is also a relevant fact to be considered, but it is not to be specifically deducted from the valuation so ascertained and determined.” That he gave no weight whatever to it, even as affirmative evidence tending to establish the value of the stock, as claimed by the commonwealth, is clear; that he treated it as a relevant fact favoring defendant, and tending to reduce the actual value, although not to be specifically deducted, is <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>also clear. And in this, he was correct. That a large debt, one largely out of proportion to the value of the property, secured by mortgage, with interest payable semiannually, constituting what is. called a fixed charge, seriousfy depreciates the actual value of the property, cannot be questioned. Default in any payment of interest puts the property in peril of seizure and sale to satisfy, not only the overdue interest, but the whole debt. A property heavily incumbered, as is this one, is liable to pass into the hands of the mortgage creditors at any time. But counsel for defendant planted himself on a demand for an absolute deduction of the whole amount from the appraised value, and made no request for a specific finding of fact in this particular. It was not, therefore, incumbent on the court to specify in the finding exactly what weight was given a particular fact; and we assume that it had all the effect it was entitled to.</p>
    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[174,1197,1178,1231]],["BL_214.1",214,[299,368,1177,1376]]]'>The argument that different methods were adopted by the commonwealth’s officers in ascertaining the actual value of the capital stock of corporations and, therefore, there has been want of uniformity and a discrimination, is not well founded. As the learned judge of the court below shows, prior to the act of 1891, the basis of taxation value, by the taxing' acts, was the net earnings, but the latter act declares that the capital stock shall be appraised “ at its actual value in cash, not less, however, than the average price which said stock sold for during said year, and not less than the price or value indicated or measured by net earnings, or by the amount of profit made, and either declared in dividends or carried into surplus ox sinking fund.” A minimum appraisement is here fixed for solvent corporations; in most cases, doubtless, the corporation officers and the commonwealth, in estimating the actual value of a solvent, well managed road, would adopt it, and properly, too, as a fair basis in estimating the actual value of the capital stock. But the act of 1891. was intended to reach also the bankrupt road, which may have the same mileage, the same traffic, and the same privileges as the solvent one. The state conferred upon it the right of eminent domain for location and extension of branches or feeders, as well as for necessary improvements; being constructed, it now has the right, under the protection of the laws, to operate it in carrying freight and passengers. <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>As the same rule for a fair estimate of the actual value of the capital stock cannot be adopted as in case of the solvent roads, and the commonwealth’s officers, being dissatisfied with the corporate officer’s appraisement, they proceed under the authority expressly given to make an appraisement, upon the facts in the report and other information within their possession. Upon appeal, the court differs from them in their inferences, and reduces largely the amount subject to tax. On the number of miles of road in Pennsylvania, about 127 out of a total of 430, with a capital stock of the actual value as a whole of $15,000,000, the court fixes the actual value of the capital stock of the 127 miles in this state, at only a little over $3,500,000. The method of determining the proportion of stock taxable in Pennsylvania has been repeatedly decided to be the correct one. The figures, certainly, do not indicate an excessive valuation of the capital stock of 127 miles of railroad. As between the defendant and solvent roads of the same physical character-, there is no discrimination as concerns results in favor of the solvent ones, for the latter are rated as high as $40.00 to $52.00 per share, while this one is less than one third that amount. The actual value being a pure question of fact, appellant has no standing to complain of discrimination in methods, so long as its stock is not assessed in excess of that value. It may be that the Reading and some other corporations are taxed on less than the actual value of their capital stock; if so, the commonwealth is not here appealing, and consequently it is not our business to inquire into the matter.</p>

It is to be taxed at its <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>“ actual value in cash, not less however than the average price which said stock sold for during said year,” etc. The officers of the corporation concerned are required to make sworn returns under seventeen specific heads, all of which tend to show the value of the stock as such, and not a single one of which refers directly or indirectly to the value of the property which such stock represents. The value of the capital stock in the hands of the shareholders is the value of their resulting interest in the property of the corporation, subject to its debts and incumbrances, in view of the uses to which it may be put under its corporate franchises, etc., and the value of such resulting interest is the true subject of tax under the statute. As construed by this decision the tax is put on the value of the property of the corporation, without regard to the value of the capital stock in the hands of the shareholders. This is a total change in the subject of taxation without any warrant in the statute, and against its plain language and intent.</p>
