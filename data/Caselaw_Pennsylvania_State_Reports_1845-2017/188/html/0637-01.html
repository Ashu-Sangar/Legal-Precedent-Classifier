They had no written articles of partnership, so far as appears, until. January 14, 1881, when a written agreement, with a supplement or explanation, dated February 17, 1881, was signed by the parties. At that time they were the owners by conveyances, either to one or the other of the partners individually, or to them jointly, and otherwise, of the numerous tracts of coal and rights of way set forth in plaintiff’s bill. This written agreement was probably made in contemplation of the early death of George Gray. It provided that all the coal and coal lands now owned and held by said parties, whether purchased by them as tenants in common, as copartners, or in the individual names of either of them, including the Long, the Crummie and the Chess mines, together with all tunnels, etc., and all coal, all engines, all cars, tracks, switches, mules, and so on, in and about the coal mines or the property used to carry on the business, and also the stock in their store at Banksville, and the debts owing to the firm, shares in the <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>capital stock of the Point Bridge Company and the Pittsburg &amp; Lake Erie Railroad, lield and owned by tbe parties, eitliei jointly or in their individual names, “ shall be held, used and enjoyed bjr them, the said parties hereto, during the continuance of said copartnership, as personal property and assets, share and share alike, subject, however, to the payment by them, the said parties in equal shares and proportions, of all debts owing by them, or either of them for purchase money for said coal or coal lands and other property above mentioned, and of all debts now owing by the firm or hereafter may be contracted by them, in the carrying on of the said copartnership business.” A clause in this agreement excepted certain property of Miss Bell from this agreement as not being included in the partnership property. The agreement also provided for the continuance of the partnership for a period of five years from the date of the death of either of the parties, or until such time as the survivor and executors should, in their discretion, close up the business and dispose of the assets; and the supplement explained and provided that the business, in case of the death of one, should be carried on by the survivor and controlled by the survivor alone, who was to account to the representatives of the deceased co-partner, and the representatives of the deceased copartner should have free access to the books and accounts of the business.</p>

The administrator of George Gray had access to the books, and it would seem that the debts of the firm existing at the time of the decease of George Gray had been paid off. The larger portion of the business of the firm was supplying coal to the local trade in and around. Pittsburg, and, perhaps, in part, the river trade. What was known as the Chess mine had a tunnel through coal hill by which they supplied the rolling mills known as the Painter Mills and the Singer, Nimick &amp; Co. Mills, which took together, it is said, about 80,000 bushels a day. The coal in the Chess mine was substantially exhausted when, along about 1885, natural gas was introduced into those <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>mills and took the place of the coal and cut off the market for it, and there does not appear to have been any considerable business done in the mine since, and it has been abandoned. The Crummie mine, also, is said to be exhausted and abandoned. Beginning with January 28, 1886, before the expiration of the five years, a disastrous fire occurred in the other mine, known as “the Long mine,” which continued for some eight or ten months before it was extinguished, and the testimony in the case is that serious and irreparable damage was done to the mine, and that operations for a long time ceased.</p>

The parties were all represented by counsel, and were all present except George Gray, who was represented by his attorney in fact, Avho was also an attorney at law. By that agreement it was provided that Isabella Bell should proceed to operate the works of the partnership for the benefit of all concerned, and subject to the demands of the trade, changes in the market and avails of the partnership, should continue to operate the same until some other organization was made, the right being reserved to the administrator of the decedent’s estate to examine the property by himself'or his agents, inspect the management of the business, and so on, and for dividing any surplus that might arise.</p>

Gray, one of the four children of George Gray, who was also manager and engineer in the mine, entered into a contract with the Hon. Thomas Mellon to purchase from him about 190 acres of coal adjoining the workings of the Gray &amp; Bell coal in the Long mine, at the price of $460 an acre, to be paid in ten annual instalments, with interest from date, afterwards reduced to three per cent. As said, this adjoined the coal which <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>Gray &amp; Bell were then mining, and the evidence, is, also, that Gray <em>&amp; </em>Bell had trespassed on this coal, how much and to what extent does not appear, but to the extent of several acres.</p>

After the fire, and after the agreement of November 4, 1886, almost the entire output of coal was from this Mellon tract and it was, at the time of that agreement, known to all the parties to it, and understood that the coal would be so mined from the Mellon tract. There had been, in all, paid to Mellon some $21,500, including interest, and this appeared on the books of the firm.</p>

Some repairs had to be made, and certain of these repairs were to come out of the four cents per ton. Mr. Mon tooth, administrator of George Gray, knew of this lease and approved it, as did the heirs of George Gray. Gregg &amp; Wildman operated the mines under this agreement, and the coal mined by them was wholly mined from the Mellon purchase, and it was understood and known that it would be so mined. This lease did not prove profitable to any of the parties. The testimony is that the mine was run at a loss, and that Gray &amp; Bell realized not more than would pay the rentals that they were under.</p>

In 1884 the coal business was fairly prosperous, especially the local trade. The introduction of natural gas, in 1885 and 1886, and its general use in the factories and dwelling houses of Pittsburg, destroyed the local trade in coal. It depreciated the value of coal property and the price of coal mining, and the price of coal. In addition to that, later, by a combination of the railroads, they made what is known as the f orty-mile limit, giving the same rate of transportation to all points within forty miles of Pittsburg, which lias depreciated the value of coal in the immediate vicinity of Pittsburg, and largely so. The testimony shows clearly that the plant of Gray &amp; Bell was old, was dilapidated, was in very bad order, and, with the small profits in mining coal, was in such a condition that even tire owner, without any royalty to pay, would be likely to lose money in running his coal, where a plant in good order might make a small profit. According to the testimony, there was at that time, to wit: 1890, in all these pits, probably eighty to ninety acres of coal, possibly a hundred, including the different ribs, stumps, and all the coal remaining in the pit, the larger portion of which, to wit: the pillars and stumps, the testimony shows, would not pay for taking out. There was, in what was known as the O’Brien tract, about fifty-six acres of solid coal unmined. It had been completely cut off from access to the entries by the fire, and it would require, to reach it, an expenditure of several thousand dollars. When reached, owing to its situation and the dip of the coal, it could not be mined without expensive drainage and a pumping engine to pump out <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>the water. The remaining part drains back on to other coal. It is also about a mile and three quarters from the pit mouth, and it would be an expensive haul at best. The testimony shows that this coal would not pay for the expenses of getting access to it and of drainage, to be taken out by the entries of the Long mine. Its value is simply that of so much coal in place adjoining other coal which, in time, may be mined by other owners, and then it will become valuable. There is about twelve acres of coal lying in another place. All the balance is stumps and pillars. Standing alone, at that time, without what is known as the Mellon coal, the Gray &amp; Bell plant had but little value, except that of old scrap. On one of the tunnels, or one part of the passageway, they were paying $1,200 a year rent; the lease had only thirty days to run, and if it was allowed to expire, with the property remaining on it, that became forfeited to the owner. They were paying $300 a year for another leasehold, for a place to run a fanning machine for the mine. How much of the other property was leasehold, or an entry on mere sufferance, does not appear. It is testified to by Mr. Bird, who was concerned at that time for one of the heirs, and who knew of this sale, that he had been trying to get a purchaser, and he says that he had an offer of $35,000 for the Gray &amp; Bell plant. He says that-he gave that offer to Mr. Pier, who represented Miss Bell, or to Miss Bell, and that about the time that they sold to Mellon for $8,000. The purchasers are not produced. The paper is not produced. What the conditions of it were do not appear. I very gravely doubt whether any solvent party made any such offer for the Gray &amp; Bell plant alone. I cannot conceive that so careful a man as Mr. Pier was known to be should ignore such an offer, if it were made. The weight of the evidence, and the large weight of evidence is, that at the time this purchase was made, throwing out of view altogether the Mellon coal, the price paid by A. W. Mellon, in cash, was the value of the plant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[170,2121,1168,302]],["BL_664.1",664,[286,379,1179,1789]]]'>There is another feature in this case. When the purchase of coal was made by Isabella Bell and Martin C. Gray, who were operating this mine for„the firm, as has been stated, it had been trespassed on by the firm, whether knowingly or unknowingly does not appear, and they were liable for it. The coal accessible to or owned by Gray &amp; Bell was rapidly approach<a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>ing exhaustion. If this plant was to be made valuable, and available to sell in the future, either at the expiration of the five years or thereafter, or before, it was very important that the firm should have more coal adjoining, and the Mellon coal adjoined, and was readily worked from the Gray &amp; Bell mines. If the purchase had been made by Gray &amp; Bell before Gray’s death, or under the same circumstances, of the then price of coal — the then condition of the coal business — it would have been considered a very judicious and desirable purchase. There is no doubt, I think, that they, having purchased from Mellon under the circumstances, and in the position which they occupied, could be held as trustees for the representative of George Gray and the firm. The representative might have repudiated or affirmed it. That they knew of the purchase is certain; that the heirs of George Gray, who were men of middle age, knew of it, is also certain; that the firm of Gray &amp; Bell had mined from this, after the purchase and before the fire was known to both the administrator and these heirs. When the lease was made to Gregg &amp; Wildman, that it was intended that the coal mined by them should be taken from this Mellon property is also certain, and all the parties knew it. It may be questionable whether or not the heirs of Gray are bound by their apparent acquiescence in the purchase. By 1890 coal lands had largely depreciated, and it was not worth the amount of the balance of the purchase money. The interest had not been paid and the indebtedness of $15,000 could not be paid by either Miss Bell, or any of the Grays, or the administrator. They got rid of the obligation. If the indebtedness to Thomas Mellon and the $8,000 is paid, and you take the whole Gray &amp; Bell plant, including as a part of it the Mellon property, much more was paid for it than its market value, and much more than it is worth to-day with some $10,000 worth of improvements. The administrator of George Gray knew of this sale, as did also the heirs of George Gray — knew at the time, or immediately thereafter, and probably before.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b668-8" data-blocks='[["BL_668.7",668,[244,1189,1178,1175]]]'>The views taken by the court in this case have withdrawn from the consideration of the master substantially all the legal questions involved, and he has endeavored to keep strictly within the suggestions of the court in respect to his conduct of the case. The plaintiff’s counsel sought to introduce testimony bearing upon questions which the master, considered had been passed upon by the court, and in such instances objections to such testimony were, for the most part, sustained. If this was error, plaintiff can correct the same on exceptions. In the view I have taken of this case, there seems to be but one question that requires consideration, and that is the claim of Isabella Bell for salary. It is not denied that she was entitled to a salary from November 4, 1886, but it is urged that prior to that time she was not entitled to any compensation, and that her estate should account to the plaintiff for the money she withdrew from the firm on that account during the years from July 10, 1881, to July 10, 1886. I am of the opinion, however, that under the agreement of January and February, 1881, referred to, although the matter of salary or compensation was not specifically provided for, if she carried on and managed the business, giving it her time and attention, as against the estate of her deceased partner, which rendered no services to the business, she would in equitj' be entitled to some compensation beyond</p>

That she was doing so was known to and acquiesced in by the administrator of George Gray, and probably to some of his heirs at the time, and was certainly made known to all the parties interested on November 4,1886. There is no testimony to show that any objection or protest was made to this claim by any one, and it was not until after her death, and the lapse of more than ten years, that the question is first raised. In view of the circumstances, as shown by the testimony, the master is firmly and clearly of the opinion that it is now too late to go into that question, and that the present plaintiff is concluded by the acts of its predecessor, acquiesced in as they were by all the parties in interest. So far as the testimony in this case shows, Isabella Bell, on May 6, 1889, ceased to actively conduct this business, having leased the plant to Gregg &amp; Wildman, who operated it until July 25, 1890, when it was sold to A. W. Mellon. Mr. Montooth, the administrator of George Gray, deceased, survived until July, 1893, and it must be assumed that lie had full knowledge of the business from the date of his appointment down to the date of his death, and there is no evidence that he at any time raised any question as to the claim of Isabella Bell, or any other question affecting the business or its management. In view of these facts it would seem to be inequitable to impose the costs of this proceeding upon the defendant, especially when it has been found that there is a balance due her estate.</p>
