Although the action by a parent for the seduction of his daughter has its technical foundation in the loss of his daughter’s services, it is' well settled that proof of the relation of master and servant, and of the loss of service by means of the wrongful act of the defendant, has relation only to the form of the remedy, and that the action being sustained, in point of form, by the introduction of these technical elements, the damages may be given as a compensation to the plaintiff, not only for the loss of service, but also for all the plaintiff can feel from the nature of the injury. In the case now trying, the plaintiff has failed in point of form to sustain his case by the introduc-. tion of these technical elements, to wit: That he has suffered any actual loss whatever by reason of his daughter becoming pregnant and being delivered of a bastard child begotten on her body by the defendant. That in the absence of such proof he cannot recover. <em>Answer: </em>That point is refused. [9]</p>

A woman that is virtuous and chaste will not be talked about; we never hear that question mentioned ; and a woman living in a neighborhood where that question is not raised by any one, why certainly, it is evidence that her reputation for chastity is good.
