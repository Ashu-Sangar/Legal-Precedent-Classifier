    <p class="summary" id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[222,1009,1178,812]]]'>Under the school law of 1854, the courts of this commonwealth have invariably refused to interfere with the discretion of school directors in all matters, especially in the building and location of schoolhouses, for the reason that matters of discretion are not reviewable in law or equity. It is only in cases of bad faith equivalent to fraud that these courts would interfere, suggesting that the remedy for the abuse of discretion was in the votes of the taxpayers at the polls. The act of 1893, however, has expressly given to courts enlarged powers. Justice Dean, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court on an interpretation of this act of assembly in In re Rule upon G. S. Walker, Ross’s App., <a href="/pa/179/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="179 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="887025" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0024-01">179 Pa. 24</a>, says, among other things: “ There is no doubt, however vaguely expressed, that the legislature intended by the act of 1893, to confer a certain power of supervision of the discretion of school boards on the state courts, which, under the law of 1854, they did not theretofore have.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AEi" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[220,1830,1176,558]],["BL_145.1",145,[196,344,1168,559]]]'>And further on in commenting upon the wording of section 1, viz: “ If the directors ‘ shall wilfully neglect or refuse ’ to provide houses, rooms or buildings, then on petition of ten or more taxable citizens, the court shall act.” “ This imposes upon the court the duty,” says Justice Dean, “through its own appointees of investigation and putting upon record the facts and testimony. If the inspector then finds that ‘ without valid cause ’ the directors have neglected or refused to perform their duty, he shall report. It will be noticed, the words, ‘ wilfully neglected and refused,’ are here dropped, and the words, ‘ without valid cause,.’ substituted; words not by any means <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>importing the same thing. If a duty be enjoined on an officer, his refusal to perform it is wilful. He has no discretion as to its performance. But, if he be commanded to do a certain act, unless he have a valid cause for not doing it, and he then refuses for cause, the question is at once raised between him and his superior, whether the cause is sufficient to excuse him in his disobedience; it brings the judgment and discretion of the subordinate at once under the supervision of his superior. And further reading of section 2, bears out this view. It says, tiie court is empowered to grant a rule on those directors who ‘have-failed without justifiable excuse ’ to perform the duty enjoined.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[199,909,1167,457]]]'>This decision also settles another question raised in the same case; that is, that the finding of fact by the inspector is not conclusive, like that of an auditor, on the court below. His reported conclusions are subject to a careful review on the rule to show cause on school directors, which the act of assembly authorizes, in case the inspector finds that the directors have refused, neglected or failed to provide adequate accommodations, as required, “ without valid cause for such refusal, neglect or failure.”</p>

The facts in this case, as we gather them from the testimony taken by the inspector, are plain, and clearly show that there is an absolute necessity for a new schoolhouse at the village at Kirkwood. [The testimony shows, as the inspector says, that there are thirty-eight children of school age in the village of Kirkwood, within a radius of half a mile from the center, and the nearest schools to the said village, which these pupils now attend, are each a mile and a half distant, and that the seating capacity for all the school children residing within the district, who desire to attend these schools is insufficient to accommodate them. These facts are uneontroverted. The testimony also shows, and the inspector so reports as the fact, that there has been no change in schoolhouse sites or locations during the past sixty years, and no additional schoolhouse facilities were furnished in that time, and the school tax rate in said district in 1895 was but two and a half mills on the dollar, which was reduced to two mills in 1896, and that. <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>the board of school directors had reduced the salaries of their teachers $2.00 a month; while the school law authorizes an amount of tax to be levied annually equal in amount to the county and state taxes, which is thirteen mills on the dollar for school purposes and an equal amount for building purposes, making in all twenty-six mills on the dollar.</p>

The court appointed an inspector as provided by the act, who took much testimony on both sides, and in a very careful report finds that the averments of the petition are true. On the report being presented to the court additional testimony was taken in the shape of depositions; the court again carefully considered the whole subject, and in an unanswerable opinion filed concurred with the inspector. Then, an order of removal was made, a new board appointed, which was recognized by the state department, a tax laid and a new sehoolhouse built. From the decree of removal we have this appeal by the old board. The principal assignment of error is an attack on the power of the court under the act of 1898. We shall not repeat what we said in Ross’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20Pa.%2025" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="179 Pa. 25">179 Pa. 25</a>, and in Kittanning School District’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/179/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="179 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="887002" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0060-01">179 Pa. 60</a>. After a careful consideration we adopted the construction of the act announced in those cases, and we adhere to it now. Evidently when the legislature adopted the policy of largely increased state appropriations, it also adopted the policy of conferring on the state courts enlarged powers of supervision. The millions of additional money appropriated were not intended to lessen local taxation, but to increase the efficiency of the schools.</p>
