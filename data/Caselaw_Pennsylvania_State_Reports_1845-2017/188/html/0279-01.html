In 1891 John R., James, William C., Thomas and Guy-Hart, five brothers, were engaged in different ways in the oil business. They owned, together, leases on nine adjoining farms near the borough of Washington, containing in the aggregate about 500 acres. John R. Hart and James Hart were partners under the firm name of “ Hart Brothers,” and were in the business of mining and producing oil, and were the principal owners of these leaseholds. Guy and Thomas Hart were in the business of drilling oil wells by contract, and Wm. C. Hart was a superintendent or field boss. On October 5, 1891, there had been drilled on these nine farms twenty-one wells, all of which produced oil. John R. Hart and James Hart, doing business under the firm name of “Hart Brothers,” as producers, had caused these wells to be drilled, and Guy Hart and Thomas Hart, as contractors with “ Hart Brothers,” had drilled all or most of them for them.

At the sheriff’s sale Jonathan Allison became the purchaser of the nine leasehold estates, aggregating about 500 acres, at the following prices (the sale discharging all liens except that of the first mortgage, on which was then due the sum of $44,271.73, — Frank Gabby lease (No. ) $5.00; Wm. <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>Gabby lease (No. ) $5.00; J.

Sayer lease (No. ) $100; and A. McDaniel lease (No. ) $100; or $391 for all. Jonathan Allison bought these leasehold estates for himself and John W. Donnan, and they immediately after the purchase took possession, and the oil produced from that time until the present has been controlled by them. From November 14, 1891, when they took possession, up until January 24, 1894, the immediate management of the leases was intrusted by Jonathan Allison and John W. Donnan to Guy Hart and Thomas Hart under an arrangement which we will hereafter fully set out. W. C. Hart, who had worked on the leases for the Hart Brothers, was employed under Guy Hart and Thomas Hart to do work similar to what he had done before the sale. The money necessary to pay the expenses of running the leases was paid by Jonathan Allison to Guy Hart, who paid it out to the employees and those furnishing material used on the leases. From January 24, 1894, up to the date of the filing of the plaintiff's’ bill, the defendants, John W. Don-nan and Jonathan Allison, were ip possession of said leaseholds and claimed to be the absolute owners thereof, and still maintain that claim. On November 18, 1891, Geo. E. Lockhart, Esq., high sheriff of Washington county, acknowledged, in open court his deed poll to Jonathan Allison for the leasehold estates in dispute, which was duly recorded and delivered to the vendee therein named. The record of this sheriff’s sale which precedes the acknowledgment and delivery of the sheriff’s deed is regular and in due form, and the validity of the sale is in no way called in question. Upon November 14, 1891, immediately after the sheriff’s sale, John R. Hart, for himself and Hart Brothers, at the instance of John W. Donnan and James C. Boyce, executed and delivered a deed of assignment to Jonathan Allison of all the right, title and interest of the Hart Brothers in the leasehold estate bought by Allison from the sheriff, and in a few days thereafter James Hart signed said deed of assignment. No consideration passed from Allison to the “ Hart Brothers ” at the time this deed was delivered, and no reason appears why it was executed and delivered except <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>that assigned by John W. Donnan, who says that the purpose was to have the title at once pass to Allison so that the contract could be concluded with Guy and Thomas Hart, and their mortgage secured to protect the Oil Well Supply Company’s claim as had been agreed upon, the contract with Guy and Thomas referred to being the one hereinafter set out. On May 18, 1895, an alias execution was issued on the judgment of M. V. Taylor’s Executor v. ITart Brothers, John R. Hart and James Hart, and the interest of the defendants in the leaseholds in question was levied upon and sold to A. W. Pollock, and A. W. Pollock, on June 19, 1896, assigned to John W. Donnan and Jonathan Allison the interest which he took under the sheriff’s sale in said leaseholds. This sheriff’s sale was instigated by John W. Donnan after Lee and Chapman, attorneys for the plaintiffs, had made their demand for an account, and at the sale he gave public notice that the defendants in the writ had no interest whatsoever in said leaseholds, but that they were owned absolutely by himself and Jonathan Allison.</p>

Hart learned that executions had been issued against him by McLain and Campsejr on October 5,1891, he was exceedingly anxious to make some arrangement by which a sale of his property could be avoided. He endeavored to have them stay their executions until he could make some arrangement to have them paid, and might have succeeded had not other creditors issued other executions on October 9, 1891. John W. Donnan was president of the Citizens National Bank, the owner of the two $10,000 mortgages, and was an unsecured individual creditor of the Hart Brothers. Jonathan Allison was a director of the Citizens National Bank, and was also an unsecured individual creditor. The debt due Donnan and Allison by Hart Brothers was a debt which grew out of a transaction in which Donnan and Allison were jointly interested. After the McLain and Campsey executions issued it became the duty of John W. Donnan to look after the interest of the bank and the interest of himself and Jonathan Allison. On October 5 or 6 he sent for John R. Hart and ■ inquired of him in regard to his indebtedness and the probability of his being able to get through. At the time of this conversation John W. Donnan had in his possession and control the two $10,000 judgment notes to secure the payment of which the two mortgages <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>were given to the Citizens National Bank, and two other judgment notes given for the Hart Brothers’ indebtedness to himself and Jonathan Allison on which judgment had not been entered, and one purpose of the requested interview was to find out if Hart Brothers had any other judgment notes outstanding on which judgment could be entered and executions issued. John R. Hart at this interview assured Donnan that they had no other judgment notes out and that there was no other person who could issue an execution against them and that he thought they could make an arrangement with McLain and Campsey to withdraw their executions. Mr. Hart-was anxious to make some arrangement with his creditors that would prevent the sale of his property by the sheriff. On October 9, 1891, two or three days after this interview, other creditors entered judgments and issued executions, and John W. Donnan learning this fact entered judgment on the four judgment notes he held and issued executions on three of them. On that evening or the evening of the next day, John W. Donnan, John R. Hart, James Hart and Guy Hart had a meeting, and at that meeting the situation of the “Hart Brothers” and how far their property would go toward paying their debts, was discussed, and the conclusion was reached that they were hopelessly insolvent. James and John then stated to Donnan that they owed Guy and Tom about $17,000, and they hoped some arrangement could be made that would secure something for them; that they did not care for themselves; that they intended to leave for some other field. Donnan then proposed that if Guy Hart and Thomas Hart would give a mortgage on their individual interests in the leaseholds levied upon to the bank, as collateral, to protect the payment of its two mortgages of $10,000 each, that he would bid up the property, if necessary, to a price sufficiently large to cover these two mortgages, and in the event he or some one else in his behalf became the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale, he would place the management of the leaseholds under the care of Guy and Tom for a term of two years, with the understanding that the production of the wells thereon should be run in the name of Jonathan Allison, and the money realized therefrom, after payment of running expenses, including pumper’s wages to Guy and Thomas, should be applied to the payment of the indebtedness owing the Citi<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>zens National Bank and the indebtedness owing John W. Donnan and Jonathan Allison and on the Seep mortgage, and upon the expiration of the said two years, or at any time before, if payment in full of said indebtedness had been made or satisfactorily arranged for, the said leasehold properties should be assigned and conveyed by the defendants absolutely to the said Guy and Thomas Hart, Donnan and Allison in the mean time to look after the Seep mortgage that was overdue. As Thomas Hart was not present at this interview the proposition was taken under advisement until he could be seen. On October 24, 1891, the proposition was accepted by Guy and Thomas Hart and they, on October 26, 1891, executed and delivered to the Citizens National Bank the mortgage provided for in the contract, and immediately after the sheriff’s sale they' were intrusted with the management of the leases as herein before set out. When the sheriff’s sale was made the price of oil was low and the market for oil property very dull, but a hope was being indulged that it would soon rise. Guy and Thomas Hart continued in the management of the leaseholds under Jonathan Allison until the winter of 1893-1894. The price of off did not advance as was expected and the market continued dull. Under these circumstances Guy and Thomas Hart concluded they could do better elsewhere, and on January 22, 1894, they released and quitclaimed all interest they had in these leaseholds to Jonathan Allison and John W. Donnan and surrendered possession. John Hart, during the pendency of this proposition by Donnan to Guy and Thomas Hart, and before its acceptance, asked if the Hart Brothers would get anything if Guy and Tom should eventually sell this property, after they would get it, for more than their claim and was told that that was a matter that would lie wholly with Guy and Tom.</p>

Boyce, the principal attorney of the company, some days afterwards, at least two weeks before the day of the sheriff’s sale, came to Washington to look after the company’s interest and took charge of the company’s claim against the Hart Brothers, which was only partly represented by the judgments entered by McKee. Before coming to Washington Mr. Boyce had made some inquiry of John Hart as to the value of the property in question and had endeavored to get what information he could from other sources as to the situation. From what he thus learned he concluded that his company would be safe in buying the property at $70,000, and thought they might bid it to that amount. After he came to Washington and received further information, and had a talk with Mr. Donnan, he changed his mind. He learned from Mr. Donnan that he would not bid the property higher than was necessary to cover the two mortgages of the Citizens National Bank, and that he proposed to lose the claims of himself and. Allison rather than put any more money in it which would go to creditors who, in order of liens, intervened between the bank’s mortgages and his and Allison’s executions, — the intervening executions amounting in all to over $20,000. Mr. Donnan told Mr. Boyce that he would or intended to bid a sum sufficient to cover the two bank mortgages if necessary, but suggested that if Boyce <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>would bid beyond that sum for tbe Oil Well Supply Company lie might have the property so far as he was concerned.

He concluded that it would be better for his company to make an arrangement with Guy Hart and Thomas Plart, if it could be done, rather than bid a sum greater than Donnan proposed to bid, if necessary, to protect the bank’s mortgages. An interview was had between Mr. Boyce and Guy Hart and Thomas Hart, in which it was agreed by Guy Hart and Thomas Hart that if they got title to the property under the arrangement they had with Donnan, they would give a second mortgage on the leasehold conveyed to them by the sheriff’s vendee to secure the payment of the Oil Well Supply Company’s claim. This arrangement was made with Mr. Donnan’s consent and in his presence, and was made after the agreement between Dorman and Guy and Thomas Plart had been consummated and the mortgage of Guy and Thomas, hereinbefore referred to, delivered. Mr. Boyce communicated the arrangement that he had effected with Guy and Thomas Hart to Mr. Eaton, the president of his company, and it was suggested that negotiable notes that could be discounted in bank should be gotten from Guy and Thomas Hart for the Oil Well Supply Company’s debt, as well as the mortgage on the leaseholds that would bo conveyed to them. With this in view Mr. Boyce on November 12, 1891, prepared a written agreement “between Guy Hart and Thomas Hart of the first part and Oil Well Supply Company of the second part,” in which Guy Hart and Thomas Hart were made to agree to give notes as well as a mortgage on “ all such property of the Hart Brothers ” that Guy and Thomas agreed “to purchase from Jonathan Allison.” This paper was left with Mr. Donnan with the request that he ask the Harts to sign it. Pie did. They refused to do so, on the ground that they had not agreed and would not agree to become personally liable for the debt of the Oil Well Supply Company, but expressed a willingness to give the mortgage which they had agreed to give. On the morning of the sheriff’s sale, November, 14, 1891, Mr. Donnan informed Mr. Boyce of the re<a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>fusal of Guy and Thomas Hart to sign the agreement he had prepared, but that they were willing to give the mortgage as they had agreed to do. Mr. Boyce remarked that this would leave him without security. Mr. Dounan then proposed that Boyce bid up the property to cover the bank’s mortgages and he would make the terms of payment so it could easily be met and he could take title. He also proposed that if Allison got the property that he Avould not convey to Guy and Thomas Hart until they would give the mortgage they agreed to give. Donnan, Allison and Boyce shortly after this conversation attended the sheriff’s sale, and the property in question was bought by Allison as hereinbefore stated. Boyce made no bid on the property. After the sheriff’s sale there was some further effort made by Boyce to get Guy Hart and Thomas Hart to sign the notes, but he never succeeded, and on January 22, 1894, Guy Hart and Thomas Hart voluntarily surrendered all claim they had in these leaseholds to Allison and Donnan, as hereinbefore found.</p>

Before Guy and Thomas Hart executed the release of date January 22, 1894, and surrendered possession, John W. Don-nan notified James C. Boyce of their purpose to do so, and offered to sell or turn over the leasehold estates to the Oil Well Supply Company if they would pay what was due him and Allison under the arrangement they had to convey to Guy and Thomas Hart, placing the sum necessary to reimburse and pay them at $51,000, and offered to make the terms of payment easy. The matter was taken under advisement by the Oil Well Supply Company and they sent an expert representative out to examine the leases and property thereon; and after an examination the company, on April 23,1894, declined to take the property at the price named. After this date the defendants, under the belief that the property was now their own absolutely and without condition, expended large sums of money in drilling new wells and improving the property.</p>

The parol agreement set up, being denied in the answer of the defendants, and being of a character to vary and modify the written conveyance in question, there can hardly be any question of the measure of proof required at the hands of the plaintiffs. It must be clear, precise and indubitable, and come from the mouth of at least two witnesses, or from sources that would be the equivalent of the testimony of two credible witnesses.</p>

John R. Hart is the only witness, of those who would know, that testifies that there was such a contract, and he is flatly contradicted by the testimony of John <em>W. </em>Donnan, James C. Boyce and Guy Hart. That there was an agreement is not controverted; and therefore, in looking for corroborations of John R. Hart in the testimony of the witnesses other than those three witnesses who had a knowledge of the contract and its terms and who contradict him, we must keep in mind that fact. It is claimed that the testimony of Joseph Seep and H. McSweeney corroborates John R. Hart. It does, but not at the point where he needs corroboration. The terms of the contract could be what John W. Donnan, James C. Boyce and Guy Hart say they were, — that is, that the property was to be conveyed to Guy Hart and Thomas Hart absolutely and without condition if they paid certain debts, and still Mr. Seep and Mr. McSweeney. testify as they did. It must be remembered, first, that the question discussed at the Oil City interview was not the terms of the arrangement. The amount due on the mortgage and the extension of the time of its payment, and its assignment, were the questions under consideration. Second, Mr. Seep and <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>Mr. McSweeney knew that all five of the Hart brothers had executed the mortgage concerning which they* were talking and which it was proposed to assign. They did not want to do anything that was not satisfactory to the Hart Brothers,— that is, the five Hart brothers, and their recollection is that the arrangement talked of was to be beneficial to the Hart brothers, and that they were to have the property back when their mortgage and the bank’s were paid. Mr. Seep in his testimony says, “the Hart brothers included John R. Hart, James Hart, Thomas Hart, ffm. Hart and Guy Hart.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[157,878,1173,966]]]'>It cannot, we think, be seriously contended that, upon the testimony of John W. Donnan, James O. Boyce and Guy Hart on the one side and John R. Hart, Joseph Seep and H. McSweeney on the other, the court could find that such an arrangement or agreement as is set up in the ninth paragraph of the plaintiffs’ bill was ever entered into and consummated. But it is contended that the “ attendant circumstances ” in the case go to show “ that the parties designed that Allison and Donnan should hold the leaseholds in mortgage with a reversionary interest in Hart Brothers.” It is true that the attendant circumstances must be considered, and where there is no express contract they may be of such a character as to justify the court in finding that there was a contract, and they may be considered by way of corroboration where the question of contract is affirmed on one side and denied on the other. That is, circumstantial evidence, as well as direct, can be considered in determining whether the agreement averred to exist was entered into or not. But this does not change the measure o± proof.</p>

(2) The Oil Well Supply Company refrained from bidding. (3) W. C. Hart was continued on the leases after the sale where he had worked before for the Hart Brothers. (4) The mortgage held by Seep, when paid, was assigned to Allison, and has never been satisfied. (5) Hart Brothers, after the sale, transferred to Allison certain articles <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>óf personal property not levied upon by the sheriff on account of their indebtedness, etc.</p>

Hart says was made with him. And so it is with the other circumstances that are relied upon to corroborate John R. Hart. They do corroborate him when he says that an arrangement was entered into by John W. Don-nan which contemplated the payment of the Seep mortgage, the <em>mortgage </em>of the bank and the indebtedness to himself and Allison, and a conveyance of the title by Allison, but they do not, in view of the other testimony in the case, corroborate him when he says that the reconveyance was to be made to himself and James Hart as Hart Brothers.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b326-6" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[296,1239,1178,1172]]]'>It may be, and we believe, that John R. Hart indulged the hope that a large increase in the price of oil might bring this valuable properly back into his hands, but the only way that it could get there, under the testimony in this case, would have been through the generosity of his brothers, Guy and Thomas, and judging by their testimony they were inclined to favor John and James, had fortune favored them and they been able to secure a reconveyance from Jonathan Allison. This hope to thus repossess himself of the property would naturally take on the hue of a claim of right after Guy and Thomas gave up their right to purchase, and especially after oil had risen from sixty cents a barrel to $2.50. But whatever may have been the grounds of his belief that there was an agreement such as is set up in the plaintiffs’ bill and such as would convert the conveyances under which Jonathan Allison took title into a mortgage, the plaintiffs have not by clear, precise and indubitable proof established the fact that there was such an agreement and, therefore, are not entitled to the decree they ask for. In so holding we do not, however, decide that they are not entitled, under proper pleadings, to have the liens enumerated in the agreement set up by the defendants satisfied so far as paid. But as we understood the counsel of the defendants at the argument, the right to this satisfaction is not denied.</p>

Boyce, as representative of the Oil Well Supply Company, had an understanding when the property in question was purchased at the sheriff’s sale that gave the Oil Well Supply Company certain equitable rights against the defendants as purchasers at that sale. At the time of the sale these parties were acting together for their mutual benefit. They both had contracts completed, or in process of completion, with Guy Hart and Thomas Hart which might secure to them through these Hart brothers as purchasers of the leaseholds from Allison, their respective claims. These contracts did not make Allison and Donnan responsible for the debt of the Oil Well Supply Company, yet they were both made on the assumed fact that Guj'Hart and Thomas Hart would become the owners of the leaseholds by assignment from the sheriff’s vendee. The Harts never became the purchasers of the leaseholds, and voluntarily surrendered their right to do so. This surrender made it necessary to readjust the rights of the defendants and the Oil Well Supply Company, and this could only be done on an equitable basis. The Oil Well Supply Company could not ask the defendants to assume the place of Guy and Thomas Hart and give it a mortgage and manage and operate the lease as they had done, neither could the defendants claim that the surrender of Guy and Thomas Hart cut up by the roots all claims of the Oil Well Supply Company. An equitable adjustment of their respective rights, therefore, must be found, and that, in our opinion, would be to allow the Oil Well Supply Company to take the place of Guy Hart and Thomas Hart and become the <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>purchasers of the leaseholds from Allison on the same terms on which the Harts were to get title to them. Thi§ would give the defendants all that they were to get from Guy and Thomas Hart, and it would place the Oil Well Supply Company in as favorable a position as if it had obtained the second mortgage which Guy and Thomas Hart agreed to give it, and which the defendants agreed to assist the company to get by not making an assignment of the title to them until it was given. This adjustment was evidently one that was recognized as equitable by the parties, for Mr. Donnan, when he learned that Guy and Thomas Hart were about to surrender, offered to sell or transfer to the company the leaseholds on their paying what was necessary to discharge the debts that were to be paid by Guy and Thomas Hart less the amount realized from oil after the expenses were paid. When this offer was made Mr. Boyce'said that Allison and Donnan had done everything they had promised and that the company could not expect them to carry or operate the lease for it and that the proposition to turn the leaseholds over to them would be considered. It was considered and the company declined to take the property at the price.</p>

But we think it is when we consider the attendant circumstances. Boyce knew (for he so expressed himself) that the company could not expect Allison to carry the leases for its benefit; he knew further that the company could not expect Allison to turn over the leases to the company on better terms than those on which Guy Hart and Thomas Hart were to purchase them. There was no room to dicker as to price. Mr. Donnan gave him in writing the amount that would pay the liens ahead of the Oil Well Supply Company under the agreement. He also gave him the amount of the sales of oil, and the proportion of this amount that was applied to expenses, and the amount applied to the payment of debts, and he gave him the then net monthly production. No question was raised as to the accuracy of these figures and, their accuracy being conceded, it fixed the only price at which the company could take the property. The matter was taken under advisement and the offer <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>declined. This declination, under the circumstances, was a surrender of any equity that the company had in the property.</p>

John R. and James Hart, hopelessly insolvent. Twelve oil properties in the aggregate worth, at forced sale, perhaps $60,000, — but worth very much more if the price of oil should increase, — about to be sold by the sheriff. John W. Donnan, president of the Citizens National Bank, fearful that the property will not sell for enough to pay the bank’s claim of $20,000 and a fixed lien of $44,000. Guy and Thomas Hart, creditors of their brothers John and James to the extent of $17,000, with no security for the payment of their claim. James C. Boyce, as representative of the Oil Well Supply Company, who has an execution out for about $2,000, and has an additional claim against John and James Hart, for which it has no judgment, of about $7,000. Beside the bank and the Oil Well Supply people there are many other execution creditors. John and James, after making all possible effort to arrange matters so that a sheriff’s sale of their property would not be necessary, finally conclude that nothing could be done to save anything for themselves, but express a desire that something, if possible, be done for their brothers, Guy and Thomas. Guy and Thomas have an interest in the leaseholds that are to be sold that are not covered by the executions. Donnan is anxious to secure the claim of the bank; he also has an individual claim in which he and Jonathan Allison are interested, away down on the list of liens. He proposes that if Guy and Thomas will give a mortgage on their interest to the bank as a collateral to secure its claim and will pay the individual claim of Allison and himself, that he will have Allison buy the property at sheriff’s sale, if it can be done on a bid that would not exceed an amount that would cover the claim of the bank; and if Allison gets the property that he will convey it to Guy and Thomas if they will pay the Seep mortgage, the bank’s claim and the claim of Allison and Donnan within two years or satisfactorily secure the payment thereof, — Guy and Thomas to manage the property and to receive pumpers’ wages, and the oil to be run to the credit of Allison, the proceeds <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>thereof, after paying running expenses, to be applied to the payment of these claims, Donnan to carry the Seep mortgage or see that it is not foreclosed. This proposition is made in the presence of John and James Plart and in pursuance of their suggestion. The proposition is, after consideration, accepted and Guy and Thomas execute a mortgage on their interest in the leaseholds, as collateral security for the bank’s claim. After this had been done Mr. Boyce, for the Oil Well Supply Company, concludes that his company would not, in the protection of its interest, be safe in bidding in the property at a figure higher than Donnan had agreed to bid in order to get it for Guy and Thomas. He, therefore, gets John Hart to see his brothers, and sees them himself, and proposes to them that he will not bid against Donnan or interfere with their plans, a thing he had already concluded he would not do, if they will also agree to pay the Oil Well Supply Company’s claim out of the proceeds of the oil before they pay themselves, but after Seep, the bank and Donnan and Allison are paid. They agreed with Boyce in the presence, and with the approval, of Donnan to do this, and further to give a mortgage on the leaseholds that Allison would convey them under Donnan’s contract to secure the payment of tins claim of the Oil Well Supply Company, after the other claims are paid. On the day before the sale Boyce prepared a written agreement between the Oil Well Supply Company and Guy and Thomas Hart, which not only provided for the giving of a mortgage but of their individual notes. The Harts refused to sign this agreement, but offered to give the mortgage, claiming that they had-not agreed to give notes but only to pledge the property they were to get from Allison. Donnan agrees with Boyce just before the sale .that if Allison gets the property he will not convey it to Guy and Thomas Hart unless they give the mortgage to the Oil Well Supply Company. Boyce attends the sale but does not bid, and Allison becomes the purchaser. Either before or after sale John B. Hart assisted Don-nan to make satisfactory arrangements with Seep, the holder of the first mortgage. After more than two years Guy and Thomas Hart refused to take the property, and surrendered all their claim to it. At the time of the surrender the mortgage to the Oil Well Supply Company had not been given by Guy and Thomas Hart, and of the indebtedness to Seep, the bank and <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>Donnan and Allison (then amounting, principal and interest, to near $85,000) $51,000 remained unpaid. Donnan and Allison upon the surrender of Guy and Thomas Hart offered to convey or turn over the leaseholds to the Oil Well Supply Company if they would pay this balance of $51,000, which Guy and Thomas Hart were bound under their contract to pay before the Oil Well Supply Company’s mortgage on their interest should be paid. This the company refused to do.</p>

The plaintiffs allege that there was a parol agreement between Donnan, John Hart and the Oil Well Supply Company that makes Allison’s deeds of conveyance a mortgage, with the equity of redemption in John It. Hart and James Hart, doing business as Hart Brothers. The Oil Well Supply Company say that Allison and Donnan hold the property in trust to pay the claims of Seep, the bank, Donnan, Allison and the Oil Well Supply Company in the order named. Neither claim, in our opinion, has been established. The parol agreement set up by the plaintiffs has not been proved, and the facts established do not warrant the court in finding that the defendants hold the property in trust.</p>

There has not been a particle of evidence introduced to show that the defendants at the time of the sale, or prior thereto, were guilty of any fraud upon John R. and James Hart, or upon the Oil Well Supply Company, so that we could say they were trustees ex maleficio. The Oil Well Supply Company and the defendants were acting together in this sale under agreements which they each had with Guy and' Thomas Hart, and of which the Hart Brothers had full knowledge, and the making of which they, suggested. Neither did the purchase of the property in dispute by Allison and Donnan put them in a position of advantage which they have abused to</p>

Donnan and Allison did everything they promised for the Oil Well Supply Company, and when Guy and Thomas Hart surrendered or refused to take the property according to their agreement and to give the mortgage they had promised, Allison and Donnan offered the property to the Oil Well Supply Company on the same terms that it was to go to Guy and Thomas Hart, and they refused to take it.

It seems to us that the learned judge in his exhaustive and elaborate treatment of the case has so fully vindicated his findings of fact and conclusions of law that nothing that we could say would add any force to his reasoning. We affirm the decree upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the opinion.</p>
