Further along in the same book was an account, the last entry of which was of a date ten years before decedent’s death. The latter account did not exhibit the sale and delivery of any goods or property, but merely lump charges, and it showed a balance due the claimant of over $1,200. There was no evidence to explain the entries, nor to explain the delay in payment. The deceased was of ample means, while the claimant was in need; yet he had been paying the deceased cash for goods sold and delivered to himself. <em>Reid, </em>that the claim should be disallowed.</p>

He says this account was kept separate to know the amount of timber hauled in. He says that when the timber was delivered ■ at the several collieries for Miller, entry was made of the quantity and character of the timber, in small books and from them, the lumping charges were made out and entered in this account.</p>

On page 172 of the same account, during 1874, numerous items of timber delivered at the Gilberton colliery were charged up to Miller. On page 312 during 1878,1879 and 1882 various items of lumber were charged against Elias Miller. The evidence shows that on January 9, 1890, Breisch settled an account which Miller had against him by a cash payment of 144.57. The books of original entries of Elias Miller having every indication of being the record of his daily transactions with other persons, as well as the record of the mutual account between himself and Breisch, show no entry of the two items of credit entered by Breisch in his book to the credit of Miller, on December 7, 1895.</p>

In Mueller’s Estate, <a href="/pa/159/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="159 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="850174" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0590-01">159 Pa. 590</a>, it is said that “claims against decedents which might have been made against himself while living are always subject to just suspicion.” The evidence offered in support of this claim discloses very just grounds for suspicion. It is a very stale claim. There appears no reason whatever for such delay. The decedent was of ample means, and Henry Breisch was in need of every cent due him, and while so in need, instead of insisting on payments on account, or credits on account, he was paying Miller in cash for goods sold and delivered to him by Mil<a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>ler. In the case of Wilson v. Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20N.J.L.%2095" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 N.J.L. 95">6 N. J. Law, 95</a>, cited with approval by Mr. Justice Mitchell, in Fulton’s Est., 178 .Pa. 86, it is said, “ A book of daily entries containing accounts with different people touching matters in which a man is known to deal or be employed, and which according to the custom of the country are usually made matter of account, has been admitted as evidence for the jury under all the circumstances of the case, while a detached paper, which might have been made up for the occasion, has been wholly rejected. ... Now these last entries appear to me to be no part of the book, properly speaking, but to stand precisely in the situation of a detached paper, and to derive no credit at all from their being written ■within the cover of the book, seeing they are written upon pages wholly detached from the daily entries and accounts.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[245,1059,1172,453]]]'>It is contended on behalf of claimant that Henry Breisch being a farmer, unacquainted with any better method for keeping his accounts, should not suffer because they were kept in this unusual way. But it is plain he must have known better how to keep such accounts, for during 1872, 1878, 1874, 1878, 1879 and 1882, numerous items of lumber charges were entered by him against Miller, in the usual and proper way, — not in lump charges as these are in a separate part from the regular entries of their mutual dealings.</p>
