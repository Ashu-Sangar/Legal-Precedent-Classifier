A part of his business was raising or buying cattle, and fattening them for the New York market.

As to the care of the cattle intended for the market as above stated when in pasturage, the facts, as nearly as I can ascertain therein from the evidence, statements and admissions of the counsel on each side, are that the cattle were pastured on his lands on both sides of French creek, as was most convenient.</p>

The cars were on the siding when he died; and were loaded and sent to New York-before he was buried. The cattle so sent were sold in New York and the proceeds thereof turned over to the executors or to Miss Jarvis, one of them. The remainder of these cattle or most of them, three more cars, were sent to market soon after, and the balance were retained until the following winter, prepared for market and marketed in the same way as the former two carloads.</p>

This creek divided <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>his lands into two nearly equal parts, and he made it a division line in disposing of his estate. His purpose to devote his property which was on the east side of the creek to the payment of debts and pecuniary legacies, and to give that on the west side to his adopted daughter and sister-in-law clear of all claims, he made very plain. After making a number of pecuniary legacies he directed that they should be paid from the proceeds of the sale of his real and personal property situate on the east side of the creek, and he provided that in the event of a deficiency of assets after the payment of debts the legacies should abate proportionately,. and that if there should be a surplus it should be divided equally among his nephews and nieces. He then came to the second branch of his will. Having exempted his property on the west side of the creek from the payment of debts and legacies he disposed of it, first by giving a farm to his adopted daughter, and then by giving all other lands and the personal property thereon to his sister-in-law.</p>
    <p id="b70-4" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[274,1217,1182,1168]],["BL_71.1",71,[147,353,1170,505]]]'>The last clause of the will is in effect a residuary clause. He had before disposed of all his property real and personal on the east side of French creek, and of one farm on the west side, and had provided plans for distribution in case there should be either a deficiency or a surplus. He commenced the clause with the words, “ I now give and bequeath,” which in their connection indicate an intention to make a final disposition of the remainder of his property, and he proceeded to dispose of all other lands which he owned and all personal property thereon. His enumeration of the kinds of personal property, “such as cows, horses, hogs, household furniture, all farm tools, wagons, etc., that may be on the farm,” raises the only doubt as to his intention. If this had been omitted his mean-' ing would have been very clear. But this enumeration, following general words which include everything, and in a clause which is in its character residuary, does not, we think, exclude the cattle in question. These cattle had been pastured on the testator’s farms on both sides of the creek, and four months before his death they had been taken to his barns on the west side to be fattened for market. This had been done in the regular course of his business. For several years he had bought cattle which he pastured, on all of his farms during the summer and fattened in his barns on the west side during the winter. <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>He was engaged in this business when the will was written, and continued in it without interruption until his death. The cattle in question constituted a large part of his personal estate, and it cannot be supposed that he either overlooked them in making his will or that he intentionally omitted them from the disposition he made. He was an uneducated man, entirely unskilled in the use of language, and his intention can be better reached by considering the general plan and purpose of his will, which he succeeded in making clear, than by a critical examination of the words and phrases which he used.</p>
