On a careful re-examination of this case, I am not able to find anything in the will of the testator to show intent on his part to take the case out of the ruling that when a devise be made to a person absolute in the first instance, and it is provided that in the event of death without issue another legatee, or legatees, shall be substituted to the shares or legacy there given, it shall be construed to mean death or death without issue before the testator, and that the first taker is always the first object of the testator’s bounty, and the absolute estate is not to be cut down to an estate for <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>life without clear evidence of such intent. It has been argued to the court on part of the plaintiffs that at the time the testator made his will he was so far advanced in years that he could not have reasonably expected Henry and Mary Ann to marry and have children in his lifetime, but no proof was offered as to his age, neither was there evidence that he was suffering from any accident or disease which would necessarily take his life before it was possible for them or either of them to marry and have issue. In Ralston v. Truesdell the will of Joseph Alexander itself showed an intent on his part that Nancy Ramsey, his granddaughter, should have no interest in the land in dispute until after the termination of the life estate given to his widow. The Court says: “No immediate gift was made to Nancy Ramsey. She must wait, not only until after the death of the testator, but until after the death of his widow, the life tenant, before she receives anything. The testator, in making the devise to Nancy Ramsey, referred to an event that would take place subsequent to his death, to wit: the death of his wife, who was made a life tenant of the very property devised.”' The court in deciding the case refers to Jessup v. Smuek, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Pa.%20339" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="16 Pa. 339">16 Pa. 339</a>, and the words of Mr. Justice Chambebs, to wit: “ In the cases which limit the death to the testator’s lifetime, it is admitted that it is adopted from necessity, in aid of what was considered the general intent of the testator, and was not applied where the first taker is referred to or treated as living at a period subsequent to the death of the testator.”</p>
