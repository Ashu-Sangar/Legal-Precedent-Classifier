Poor District of the Borough of Strattanville.\nPoor law \u2014 Settlement\u2014Order for removal \u2014 Laches.\nOn an appeal from an order for the removal of a pauper, it appeared that at the time the order was made the pauper had for sixteen years been an inhabitant of the district, and for twelve years had been the undisputed owner in fee simple of unincumbered real estate and household goods of the value of $300 in the district. At the suggestion of the burgess of the borough who was a personal friend, she accepted assistance from the poor fund. Without her knowledge or consent her name was entered on the poor books as a pauper. After this entry was made she paid taxes for two successive years. Held, that the order of removal could not be sustained.\nArgued Oct. 24, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 1, Oct. T., 1898, by plaintiff, from judgment of Superior Court, April T., 1897, No. 153, from order of Q.
