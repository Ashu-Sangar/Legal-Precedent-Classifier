Gloth and Isaac Wolf, Road Commissioners of Mill Creek Township, Appellants, v. the Erie City Passenger Railway Company and the Erie Electric Motor Company.\nStreet railways \u2014 \u25a0Switches and turn-outsSevocation of license.\nWhere a street railway company is authorized, not only to construct a railway, but also \u201cnecessary turn-outs,\u201d such power is not exhausted until both the railway and necessary turn-outs are built, and is not affected by an attempt upon the part of the road commissioners and land owners to withdraw their consent as to unconstructed switches and turn-outs.\nArgued April 26, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 48, Jan. T., 1898, by plaintiffs, from decree of C. P. Erie Co., Sept. T., 1893, No. 3, on bill in equity.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for an injunction.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of Walling, P. J., in Willis v. Ry. Co., ante, p. 56.\nErrors assigned among others were (1) in modifying the preliminary injunction; (5-9) in second, fourth, fifth and seventh conclusions of law, and fourth finding of fact.\nG. A. Allen and Frank Gunnison, with them John S. Rilling, and L. Rosenzweig, for appellants.\nThe road, over which defendants constructed their line of railway, is a country road. They had no statutory right to occupy any part of it. They could occupy it only upon obtaining the consent of the road commissioners of the township, and of the owners of property abutting on the road: Penna. R. R. v. Montgomery Co. Pass. Ry., 167 Pa. 62; Heilman v. Lebanon, etc., Ry., 175 Pa. 188; Heilman v. Lebanon, etc., Ry., 180 Pa. 627; Fidelity Ins., etc., Co. v. Philadelphia, etc., Ry., 6 Dist. Rep. 737.\nThat the owner of land abutting on a public road is the owner of the land to the center of the road, subject only to the right of the public to use it for traveling upon it, is well established in Pennsylvania by Lewis v. Jones, 1 Pa. 336; Woodring v. Forks Township, 28 Pa. 355; Ball v. Ball, 1 Phila. 36; Paul v. Carver, 24 Pa. 424, and many other cases; and in the case of Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Montgomery County Pass. Ry., 167 Pa. 62, the principle was applied to the case of the attempted occupation of a public road by an electric railway company.\nA license may be granted by parol, or by writing: Veghte v. Raritan Water Power Co., 4 C. E. Green (N. J.), 142, quoted from 13 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 549, note. Mallott v. Price, 109 Ind. 22, and Dodge v. McClintock, 8 Am. Law Reg. (N. S.) 62, are cases where the license was conferred by written instruments.\nAt common law a license might be revoked at pleasure: Washburn on Easements, 26; Rerick v. Kern, 14 S. & R. 267; Huff v. McCauley, 53 Pa. 206; Pierce v. McCleland, 133 Pa. 189; Dodge v. McClintock, 8 Am. Law Reg. 62; Blaisdell v. R. R., 51 N. H. 483; Bostock v. Sidebottom, 16 Jur. 1013; Evangelical Lutheran Home v. Buffalo Hydraulic Assn., 64 N. Y. 561; Roberts v. Roberts, 55 N. Y. 275; Allen v. San Jos\u00e9 Land & Water Co., 15 Lawyer\u2019s Rep. Annotated, 93; Darlington v. Painter, 7 Pa. 475; Chestnut Hill, etc., Turnpike Co. v. Piper, 77 Pa. 432; Messinger\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 285.\nOctober 17, 1898 :\nJ. M. Sheewin and S. A. Davenport, with them T. A. Lamb, for appellees.\nDefendants submit that the principle of law contended for by the plaintiffs, to wit: That the plaintiffs had the right to revoke all rights of the defendants, except as to such track and switches laid at the time of the issuing of the injunction, is not the law of the state of Pennsylvania and never has been: Borough of Pottsville v. People\u2019s Ry. Co., 148 Pa. 176 ; Borough of Wyoming v. Railway Co., 8 Kulp, 113; Reeves v. Phila. Traction Co., 152 Pa. 163; Millvale Borough v. Evergreen Ry.

Co. v. Baldwin, 37 Leg. Int. 424; Electric Ry. Co. v. City of Grand Rapids, 47 N. W. Rep. 567.\nCourts will not interfere with the change of track from single to double when the public needs warrant it: Hestonville, Mantua, etc., R. R. v. Philadelphia, 89 Pa. 210."
