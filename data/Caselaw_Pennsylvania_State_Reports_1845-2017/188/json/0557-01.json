The Versailles Traction Company, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Street railways \u2014 Alighting from car \u2014 Child of tender age.\nIn an action against a street railway company to recover damages for personal injuries to a boy eight years old, incurred while alighting from a car, the case is for the jury where there was evidence that the boy intended and attempted to get off the car at a crossing, but was prevented from doing so by the fact that the car did not stop long enough for him to do so, and where there was also conflicting .evidence as to whether he was jolted from the car, or fell off or jumped off.\nArgued Oct. 81, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 41, Oct. T., 1898, by\ndefendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co.,\nDec. T., 1896, No. 289, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Green,Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Collier, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that at about five o\u2019clock in the afternoon on September 6, 1896, Cornelius Moran, a boy about eight years old, was injured while alighting from one of defendant\u2019s electric cars. The boy was in charge of his sister, about thirteen years old, and his cousin, a girl about fourteen years old. When the car reached the Twelfth street crossing in the city of McKeesport it stopped, and the two little girls succeeded in getting off. There was evidence that the little boy followed the girls to the platform, and before he could get off, and about the time he got on the step, the car started, and the boy was jolted or fell off the car. There was also evidence that he jumped off. The evidence tended to show that the conductor was negligent in starting the car before the boy had alighted, and that the motorman had not taken proper precautions to prevent the accident.\nThe trial court refused defendant\u2019s request for binding instructions. [4]\nVerdict for Cornelius Moran for $2,500. Verdict for John Moran for $500.\nNovember 14, 1898:\nTwo actions were brought, one by the father and one by the son.\nAfter judgment was entered upon the verdicts, the two actions by order of court were consolidated as provided by act of assembly.\nError assigned among others was (4) refusal of binding instructions.\nW.
