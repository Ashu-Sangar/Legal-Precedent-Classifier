        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Dean,\nThe defendant company on June 11,1894, issued to plaintiff a policy of insurance against loss by fire in the sum of $3,400 on his farm buildings, dwelling house, barn, household and kitchen furniture, produce in barn, horses and mules; the term of the policy was three years. On February 7,1897, the buildings and part of the property contained therein were destroyed by fire; the plaintiff claimed his loss was $3,099. He gave immediate notice of the fire to the company; as the policy required that within sixty days thereafter he should under oath furnish the company with a full and detailed schedule of the property destroyed, he, on March 25, following, transmitted to the company such statement or schedule as was deemed by him a compliance with this requirement; from communications of defendant\u2019s adjuster to plaintiff\u2019s attorney it appeared that these proofs were not satisfactory, so on June 7 following, he sent to the company verified plans of the buildings and other particulars ; these were acknowledged by the president the next day, in a letter stating they had been referred to Mr. Allewalt, their adjuster; he, by letter of June 21, to plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, objected to the specifications as defective. \u2022 Before this letter was received the plaintiff had brought suit. At the trial the defendant alleged that plaintiff had not complied with the requirement of the policy in furnishing a full and complete statement of the loss within sixty days. The court held, that the preliminary proofs having been transmitted to the company on March 29, and received by it the next day, and no reply thereto having been made, or any special defects therein pointed out until May 18, fifty days thereafter, this delay was equivalent to a waiver of any objections to the form of the proofs or defects therein. We concur with the court below in this opinion. There was no specification of any defects in the proofs which would have enabled plaintiff to cure them; that Allewalt, the adjuster, said to plaintiff\u2019s attorneys either verbally or in writing, that they were defective was not the information plaintiff had a right to demand; he and his counsel had made an apparently honest effort to specify with particularity the loss, as required by the policy; it was the duty of defendant to particularize wherein they had failed to meet the condition, and to do this with reasonable promptness: Gould v. Ins. Co., 134 Pa. 586; Shoe Co. v. Kittanning Ins. Co., 138 Pa. 73; Whitmore v. Ins. Co., 148 Pa. 405.\nThe trial, therefore, after the ruling of the ceurt, proceeded and plaintiff offered in evidence to the jury, the proofs of loss furnished to the company, March 25,1897. No purpose in this offer was disclosed; none requested by either defendant\u2019s counsel or the court; as the sole burden on plaintiff, at that juncture, was, to establish the extent of his loss to the jury, the offer of the preliminary proof could have been for no other purpose. Clearly they were neither competent nor relevant to such purpose ; when they had been transmitted to and received by the company they had performed their office; that is, fulfilled a condition precedent to the right to sue; and if they had been objected to for that reason by defendant\u2019s counsel the court would have been bound to exclude them. The objection, however, was not to their relevancy or competency, but because \u201cthey are not in compliance with the requirements of the policy in respect to proofs of loss in several respects, and particularly in that they do not contain a statement of the original cost of the personal property alleged to have been lost, and the present value thereof.\u201d This question had been settled by the court\u2019s decision; that these defects had been waived, and the plaintiff was not barred from the jury by a noncompliance with a condition precedent; and while tins did not render the preliminary proofs of loss competent to establish plaintiff\u2019s claim before the jury, still, they could only be excluded by a well-founded objection, and not by one ill-founded, and which by implication admitted their competency. The defendant might still have saved his case by a request for instruction to disregard the incompetent evidence, but having neglected to do this he must submit to a verdict founded on evidence which at the trial he impliedly admitted was proper evidence.\nThe remaining assignments of error are without merit.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

If it fails to do so, and makes no request to the court for an instruction that the jury shall not consider them, a verdict and judgment in favor of the assured will not be reversed by the Supreme Court.\nArgued Oct. 24, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 99, Oct. T., 1898, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Venango Co., Aug. T., 1897, No. 44, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Gbeen, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on a policy of fire insurance. Before Cjriswell, P. J.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nThe proofs of loss were offered in evidence by the plaintiff.\nThey were objected to by counsel for the defendant on the ground that they were not in compliance with the requirements of the policy in several respects, and particularly in that they did not contain a statement of the original cost of the personal property alleged to have been lost and the present value thereof.\nThe plaintiff offered to prove that the next day after the fire the agent of the defendant company, Mr. C. S. Marks, came to the place of the fire and made an examination of the loss; that within a few days after, the adjuster, Mr. Allewalt, came there in company with Mr. Marks, interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Sutton, secured all the information he desired, and in going away made the remark to them that that was all that was necessary for them to do; this to be followed by evidence that Mr. Sutton did everything that was required of him by the terms and conditions of the policy.\nTo which offer the defendant objected on the ground that it was an attempt to dispense with the proofs of loss under the policy and to substitute oral testimony therefor in violation of the express conditions of the policy.\nThe Court: It appearing that the paper purporting to be a proof of loss made by the plaintiff under this policy and the letter offered in connection with that were, on or about the dato of the letter, received by the defendant company and now produced by the company, upon request, at the trial, the same are received in evidence and the objection thereto overruled.\nTo which ruling counsel for the defendant did then and there except, and at their request a bill of exceptions was sealed. [1]\nDefendant asked for instructions that, the plans and specifications not having been furnished by the plaintiff to defendant company until June 7 or 8, 1897, the action is prematurely brought, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action.\nThe court charged as follows :\n[Under the evidence in this case we think we will answer the defendant\u2019s point in the negative and instruct you to find a verdict for the plaintiff. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount claimed here as shown by the proofs, with interest from and after sixty days after the delivery of the proofs of loss. The amount claimed, with interest, at this date, amounts to $3,258.95.] [4]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $3,253.95. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned among others were (1) ruling on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions; (4) above instruction, quoting it.\nJ. H Osmer, with him A. R. Osmer and N. F. Osmer, for appellant.\nWaiver is essentially a matter of intention, and to establish it there must be some declaration or act from which the insured may reasonably infer that the insurer does not mean to insist upon a right which, because of a change of position induced thereby, would be inequitable to enforce: Freedman v. Providence Washington Ins. Co., 175 Pa. 350; National Ins. Co. v. Brown, 128 Pa. 386; Beatty v. Lycoming Co. Mut. Ins. Co., 66 Pa. 9; Carpenter v. Allemannia F. Ins. Co., 156 Pa. 37; Diehl v. Adams Co. Mut. Ins. Co., 58 Pa. 443.\nNovember 7, 1898:\nA statement of loss may be waived by the company, and if there be evidence from which a waiver may be inferred it is for the jury: Farmers\u2019 Mut. Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 73 Pa. 342; Welsh v. London Assurance Corp., 151 Pa. 607.\nWilliam H. Forbes, with him Edward E. Hughes, for appellee.\n\u2014If the proofs were deemed insufficient it was the plain duty of the company to give immediate notice of its objections, pointing out the supposed defects, etc.: .Gould v. Ins. Co., 134 Pa. 586; Davis Shoe Co. v. Kittanning Ins. Co., 138 Pa. 73; Whit-more v. Ins. Co., 148 Pa. 405.\nIn case of a total loss of the building insured .where the insurance company has been notified immediately, no further notice or technical proof of loss is necessary: Ins. Co. v. Dougherty, 102 Pa. 568; Roe v. Ins. Co., 149 Pa. 94."
