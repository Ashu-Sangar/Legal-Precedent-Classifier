        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Gbeen,\nThe chief contention in this case was upon the question whether Catharine Dusenberry, a married woman, had legal capacity to assign a policy of life, insurance of which she was the beneficial owner, as security for the debt of her husband. The policy was made in 1886, and the assignment in September, 1894. As a matter of fact the assignment was made to the use plaintiff, as a collateral security- for the debt of her husband, contracted prior to the assignment. It is contended for Mrs. Dusenberry that she, being a married woman, could not make a valid assignment of the policy as security for the debt of her husband on account of the prohibition contained in the second section of the Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344, which declares that a married woman cannot become accommodation indorsor, maker, security or guarantor for another. We have held many times over that this prohibition excluded a married woman from making the technical contract of indorsement, suretyship or guaranty, but did not disable her from transferring her property as security for the debt of another. In Kulp v. Brant, 162 Pa. 222, we said, \u201cIt has so often been decided that a married woman may assign her personal property, as security for her husband\u2019s debts, and that if the creditor acts on the faith of the assignment, she will not be allowed to repudiate it, that it is useless to again cite the authorities.\u201d\nIn that case it was, as here, a policy of life insurance that was the subject of the assignment. In the case of Kuhn v. Ogilvie, 178 Pa. 303, the subject was fully considered in an opinion by our Brother Mitchell, and it was there held that, while the wife could not enter into the technical contract of surety for her husband\u2019s debts, she could convey or assign her property, real or personal, to secure the debt of her husband. It was held that she could do this at any time before the act of 1893 was passed, and that there was nothing in the act which restrained or limited her capacity in that respect. There is an abundance of authorities to the same effect, but there is no occasion to review them. It is plain, therefore, that, in the present case, the wife had capacity to make the assignment of the policy in question, and that she is bound by her act.\nThe other contentions for the appellees are not tenable. No party to a written contract can invalidate it by saying that he or she understood it in a sense different from that which its plain words import. Nor can it be said there was either no consideration or that there was a failure of consideration for this assignment. The collateral agreement recited that Mrs. Dusenberry\u2019s husband was indebted to the church in the sum of $2,000, for moneys which he as treasurer of the church had'collected, for which he had confessed a judgment to the church. The agreement further recites that in order to- secure the payment of this debt the policy was assigned to the church. And the church thereupon agreed to reassign the policy upon the payment of the indebtedness, the church reserving the right to surrender the policy and collect its surrender value from the insurance company, after giving ninety days\u2019 notice of its intention to surrender, and a demand for the payment of the debt and interest. There is no need of any other consideration than this to support the assignment of the policy. To relieve her husband from the responsibilities and liabilities, civil and criminal, for his default as an officer of the church, and to secure the payment of his debt, and also to obtain a reassignment of the policy upon payment of the debt, constitute an ample consideration for the assignment. Long before the act of 1898 was passed, which so greatly enlarged the contractual capacity of married women, this Court held, in Lytle\u2019s Appeal, 36 Pa. 131, that an assignment by husband and wife, acknowledged by the wife in the mode prescribed by the act of April 11,1848, of the wife\u2019s interest in her deceased'father\u2019s residuary estate, consisting of real and personal property, to secure the debts of the husband, is valid and binding on the wife.\nNor can the allegation in the wife\u2019s affidavit of defense that she is informed and believes, and expects to be able to prove on the trial, that the church congregation promised and agreed to pay the premiums on the policy when they became due, and made default in s.o doing, help the wife\u2019s case; Such an averment to be of any efficacy would have to be positive and direct, and accompanied by a further averment that it was omitted from the assignment by mistake, fraud or accident. There is no such averment in the affidavit, nor anything approaching it. The language of the assignment is perfectly plain and easily understood, and of course must be read by the courts according to its olear meaning. We are of opinion that the affidavit of defense contains nothing to prevent the entry of judgment.\nJudgment reversed, and it is ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff for the surrender value of the policy, together with interest and costs, against the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York.",

Walpack Reformed Church Congregation of Sussex Co., New Jersey.\nCatharine Dusenberry having intervened as a party defendant filed the following affidavit of defense:\n\u201c Catharine Dusenberry the above named party defendant by leave and order of court, in the above case, being duly sworn, according to law, deposes and says that she has a just, true, full and legal defense to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim of the following nature and character, to wit:\n\u201c It is true, as contained in the plaintiff\u2019s statement, that a policy of life insurance \u2014 No. 284,400 A \u2014 was issued by the defendant company, the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, upon the life of Edwin A. Dusenberry, and that in the said xjolicy the said defendant company, agreed to pay to the affiant, the wife of the said insured, at the death of her said husband, the sum of #6,000, in consideration of the payment to the said company of the annual premiums provided for in the said policy, but the date of the said policy is not correctly given in the plaintiff\u2019s statement, said policy being dated July 1, A. D. 1886, and not on July 1, A. D. 1896, but it is not true, as insinuated in said statement, that the value of said policy if the stated annual premiums had been regularly paid, would have yielded to the affiant, as beneficiary, at the death of the insured, only #6,000.\n\u201c While it is true that the said policy stipulated for the surrender of it, at the option of the insured, to the insurer at the end of ten years from the date of its issue, which occurred on July 1, 1896, and the full reserve value.of it might then have been received, it is denied that the said policy at the end of the said ten year period was worth no more than $1,667.64, or that the above named use plaintiff, also styling itself the assignee of the insured and beneficiary, then had the right to surrender the said policy of insurance and to receive the surrender value of it, or that it had the right to surrender the same at any time since. It is also denied that the plaintiff has exhibited a full and correct copy of the contract of insurance.\n\u201cWhile it is also true that the affiant on or about September 7, 1894, signed a paper which she understood to relate to the said policy of life insurance, and was in some way to secure the plaintiff for her husband\u2019s debt to it, she did not know, until the discovery of the fact of the proceedings in this case and by explanations to her of the import of it, that that paper implied an absolute assignment and transfer of the policy to the plaintiff ; nor did she understand the collateral agreement referred to in the plaintiff\u2019s statement to imply a right in the plaintiff to surrender the said policy at any time during the lifetime of her said husband, but on the contrary asserts it. that her understanding of the whole agreement, written and verbal, related to time after the insured\u2019s death, if she survived him.\n\u201c The service of the notice of August 5,1896, is admitted, but she denies every insinuation of a promise by her to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $2,000 or any other sum of money, or her indebtedness to it of any amount, or its right to demand payment from her.\n\u201c And in further denial of the right of the said, the ministers, elders and deacons of the Walpack Reformed Church Congregation of Sussex county, New Jersey, plaintiff, to bring and maintain the said suit, the affiant says that she has been informed, verily believes, and expects to be able to prove upon the trial of this cause, that the said plaintiff promised and agreed to pay the premiums on the said policy of life insurance as and when the same became payable, but has neglected to do so, by reason of which default, the said policy has lapsed and become inoperative as a provision for her in the case of the insured\u2019s death, and was nonsurrenderable, for a cash consideration, at the time of the offer of surrender of it by the said plaintiff to the said defendant insurance company. That the said alleged assignment by her of the said policy was void, first, because it was without consideration, and second because it was not given for her own debt or about the conduct of her separate business, but was given as collateral security to insure the payment of her husband, Edwin A. Dusenberry\u2019s debt to the plaintiff, she being at the time of the assignment a married woman, wife of the said Edwin A. Dusenberry.\n\u201c Sworn and subscribed' \u2022\nbefore me this 6th day of February, 1897. v\n\u201cWm. F. Decker, J \u201c Prothonotary.\u201d J\nCatharine Dusenberry.\nThe court discharged a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nError assigned was the order of the court.\nCharles B. Staples, for appellant.\nA married woman under the laws of Pennsylvania always had the right to dispose of her property, real and personal, by conveyance or assignment to secure the debt of her husband, and such conveyance or assignment was valid and binding upon her: Lytle\u2019s Appeal, 36 Pa. 131; Selden v. Merchants\u2019 Nat. Bank, 69 Pa. 424; Kuhn v. Ogilvie, 178 Pa. 303; Corcoran v. Ins. Co., 179 Pa. 132; Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344; Kulp v. Brant, 162 Pa. 225.\nIt is error to permit a party to a written contract to certify as to what was the motive or the inducing circumstances which had led him to execute the contract: Thomas & Sons v. Loose, Seaman & Co., 114 Pa. 35; Cullmans v. Lindsay, 114 Pa. 167 ; Spencer v. Colt, 89 Pa. 314.\nConceding the correctness of the principle that in passing upon the sufficiency of an affidavit of defense the material averments of fact contained therein must be accepted as true, it has no application to immaterial, irrelevant, obscure or evasive averments: Bank v. Miller, 179 Pa. 412; Killen v. Brown, 6 Pa. Superior Ct. 15; Bakes v. Reese, 150 Pa. 44.\nThe affidavit of defense must be responsive: Ashman v. Weigley, 148 Pa. 61.\nHenry J. Kotz, with him Eilenlerger & Hoffman, for appellee.\n\u2014Conceding that there is an acknowledgment of the receipt of the consideration stipulated to be paid in the assignment, yet, notwithstanding that acknowledgment, may not the defendant be allowed to prove, in the proper forum, if she can, that in fact there was a total failure of consideration moving to her: Hamilton v. McGuire, 3 S. & R. 355; 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 305.\nThere was no consideration for the assignment: Petrie v. Clark, 11 S. & R. 377; Royer v. Keystone Nat. Bank, 83 Pa. 248 ; Altoona Second Nat. Bank v. Dunn, 151 Pa. 228; Bayler v. Com., 40 Pa. 37; Anderson v. Best, 176 Pa. 500.\nIn Selden v. Merchants\u2019 National Bank, 69 Pa. 424, Mrs. Selden did not resist the bank\u2019s claim to the amount she had pledged the bond for as security for money lent to her husband, but only for the difference between the loan and the proceeds of the bond, and in this she was sustained.\nKuhn v. Ogilvie, 178 Pa. 303, is a case of the mortgaging of the wife\u2019s estate for the husband\u2019s debt, and it was held that she might do this, and for future advances to him.\nThe case of Corcoran v. Ins. Co., 179 Pa. 132, was not contested by a married woman-; the question of coverture came up only incidentally.\nIn Kulp v. Brant, 162 Pa. 225, .the question appears to have been decided against the wife on the ground of the credit her husband secured by reason of the assignment, and because the husband\u2019s creditor acted upon the faith of the wife\u2019s act.\nA judgment confessed by a married woman to secure the repayment of money by her to aid her husband in his business, being unauthorized by the act of June, 1887, is void as to her, and that fact being made to appear by testimony, the judgment as to her will be stricken from the record: Real Est. Inv. Co. v. Roop, 132 Pa. 496.\nIn determining whether a decree for specific performance shall be made against a married woman, the court will consider her state and condition as being a married woman, even if the contract in question was within her power to make: Friend v. Lamb, 152 Pa. 530; Patrick & Co. v. Smith, 165 Pa. 526: Weigle v. Mercer, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 490.\nNovember 15, 1898:"
