Tenan, Exr., and the levari facias and sheriff\u2019s deed in that case. We have just reversed that judgment as unauthorized and void. It was incapable of supporting an execution, and as the defect was one apparent on the face of the record, the sheriff\u2019s vendee would have taken no title, even if a purchaser without notice of the terre-tenant\u2019s rights. It is clear therefore that appellant showed no title, and the learned judge below might properly have directed a verdict for the defendant. It is not therefore worth while to discuss the assignments of error. Whether correct or not the rulings did appellant no injury.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Stevenson.\nOctober 31, 1898:\nEjectment \u2014 Mortgage\u2014Scire facias \u2014 Terre-tenant\u2014Executors and administrators \u2014 Void judgment \u2014Purchaser under defective judgment.\nA judgment on a scire facias sur mortgage against an executor for want of an affidavit of defense is defective on the face of the record, and a person who purchases the mortgaged premises at a sheriff\u2019s sale under such a judgment takes no title, even if he is without notice of the rights of the terre-tenant who has not been served. If the sheriff\u2019s vendee brings an action of ejectment for the land, and the trial court instead of directing a verdict for the defendant submits the case to the jury, and a verdict and judgment is rendered in favor of the defendant, the Supreme Court will not consider the rulings covered by the assignments of error, since the rulings, whether correct or not, did the plaintiff no injury.\nArgued Oct. 18, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 94, Oct. T., 1898, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Washington Co., Feb T., 1898, No. 42, on verdict for defendant.\nBefore Gbeen, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nEjectment for a tract of land in Hanover township.
