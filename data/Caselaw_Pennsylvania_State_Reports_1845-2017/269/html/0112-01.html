      <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>Appellee raises three preliminary questions: (1st) Assuming a certiorari is permissible, should it not have been issued by and made returnable to the Superior Court? The jurisdiction of that court is purely statutory, however, and since it has not been vested with power to review the judgments of the county court in this class of cases, appeals therefrom must be taken to the Supreme Court: Pittsburgh v. Pierce, <a href="/pa-super/69/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="69 Pa. Super. 520" data-case-ids="632434" data-case-paths="/pa-super/69/0520-01">69 Pa.

Appellee has not argued that the writ should not have been issued unless specially allowed, and hence we do not decide this point. (2d) Is an appeal allowable? Assuming it is not provided for by statute, this court nevertheless has always had and still has the right to review on certiorari all questions regarding the jurisdiction of the lower courts, and all issues as to the constitutional rights of the parties litigant: Com. v. Balph, <a href="/pa/111/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="111 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="545298" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0365-01">111 Pa. 365</a>; Com. v.

(3d) Can the court look further than to see if the proceedings below are regular? It is not necessary to consider how far, if at all, the Act of April 18, 1919, P. L. 72, is applicable; for the decision of the matters at issue here does not depend on the testimony taken in the court below, and, the case not being one arising in the course of the common law, we may examine the opinion filed in order to ascertain the reasons for the court’s action: McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., <a href="/pa/261/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="261 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1042265" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0312-01">261 Pa. 312</a>, 322.</p>

This was a mistake of the mayor, for there is necessarily implied, in the power thus vested in him, a corresponding duty to grant or refuse a permit whenever an application therefor is made. His failure to act is especially <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>to be regretted in the present instance, for it gave appearance of truth to the probably unwarranted complaints of those who averred the applicant and those who associated with him were ignored because the mayor did not like them or the cause they represented, and who alleged that, if the applications had come from more influential persons, they would have been acted upon and probably granted. In all other respects the mayor was well within his rights in what he did; a strike was on which divided even the workingmen into opposing factions, and thus gave to those agitators, who are the enemies of all government, the opportunity, which they eagerly seized, to stir up strife and disorder, by distributing anonymous and seditious pamphlets throughout the city; and hence, as the mayor was responsible for the maintenance of peace and good order, he was justified — if he believed the public good required it, as he says he did — in refusing a permit for an open air meeting at this particular time. This being so, a courteous reply so stating would have removed all just cause of complaint, for it would have sent the applicant to the courts for redress, if he still thought he was being discriminated against. Though not so designed, the failure to reply tended to bring the administration of the law in the City of Duquesne, and through it our entire system of government by law, into disfavor. Our public officials, from the highest to the lowest, but especially the executives of our municipalities, with whom the citizens most frequently come in contact, should in all matters carefully avoid even the appearance of favoritism, lest a semblance of-justification should be given to the untrue statement, now too often heard in the centres of population, that our government (as well as those of the old world), is being administered for the advantage of the few and not for the benefit of all.</p>

    <p id="b143-5" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[158,1242,1153,1247]]]'>So far as the 14th amendment is concerned, the Supreme Court of the United States — whose judgments are final in the interpretation of the federal Constitution — has expressly ruled against the claim now made by appellant, in Davis v. Massachusetts, <a href="/us/167/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="167 U.S. 43" data-case-ids="3595080" data-case-paths="/us/167/0043-01">167 U. S. 43</a>. In that case Davis claimed the right to preach the gospel on Boston Common, in accordance with a long-established custom, despite the fact he had no permit so to do from the mayor of the city, as required by one of its ordinances. He was tried, convicted and fined, and therefrom appealed on the ground that under the 14th amendment he had a constitutional right to address an assembly at that place. The court said: “The 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States does not destroy the power of the states to enact police regulations as to the subjects within their control......and does not have the effect of creating a particular and personal right in the citizen to use public property in defiance of the Constitution and laws of the State,” and for this reason decided the requirement of a permit was only a reasonable regulation by the city. To the same effect are Wilson v. Eureka City, <a href="/us/173/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="173 U.S. 32" data-case-ids="8297611" data-case-paths="/us/173/0032-01">173 U.

His contention founded thereon, however, overlooks the fact that they do not give to him the right to assemble with others and to speak wherever he and they choose to go. He would hardly admit that others would have the right so to do in his house, without his consent; and doubtless would concede the same to all other citizens. If he wishes to address an assemblage he must gather his audience together in places where he and they have the right to be for this purpose; and the streets are not such places, since they are intended for passage and not for assemblage. As was said in Barker v. Com., <a href="/pa/19/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="19 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="970686" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0412-01">19 Pa. 412</a>, 413: “The streets are common highways, designed for the use of the public in passing and repassing, and in such temporary occupancy as are incidental to the exercise of these rights, or necessarily connected with them. No one has a right to obstruct a public street by collecting therein a large assemblage of men and boys, for the purpose of addressing them......The common highways were designed for no such purpose. If the purposes of the meeting be lawful, a suitable place can be obtained for it, without obstructing the public in their undoubted right of passing along their own highway. The liberty of speech does not require that the clear legal rights of the whole community shall be violated.”</p>

That it is not inherent is covered by what has already been said, and is made clear by the following quotation from Davis v. Massachusetts, <a href="/us/167/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="167 U.S. 43" data-case-ids="3595080" data-case-paths="/us/167/0043-01">supra:</a> “The legislature as representative of the public may and does exercise control over the use which the public may make of such places, and it may and does delegate more or less of such control to the city or town immediately concerned. For the legislature absolutely or conditionally to forbid public speaking in a highway or public park is no more an infringement of the rights of a member of the public, than for the owner of a private house to forbid it in his house.” If this were not so, then any and every citizen would have an equal right with defendant and might call such meetings without let or hindrance, some, like him and his associates, to discuss the important subject of “the cause of organized labor” (with which the writer has been in full accord for over half a century, during nearly seven years of which he was himself a mechanic, and for a generation more represented many others as their counsel); and many to discuss all sorts of wise or foolish subjects which find lodgment in the mind of man. This would make “confusion worse confounded,” and the streets which, as stated, are “designed for the use of the public in passing and repassing,” would at times become nearly or quite impassable; and the citizens who wish to so use them, wpuld have to give way to those who occupied them for purposes for which they were never intended. It may be this would not often happen, but it would surely do so in times of stress, when the peace and quietness which lead to thoughtful consideration are most needed; and this possibility warns us that unless regulation is vested <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>somewhere we may renew in onr large cities the disorders which have recently appeared in those of the old world.

All the cases concede this; and indeed the power to regulate, where she may forbid, is a necessary result of the maxim omne majus continet in se minus: Phila. v.
