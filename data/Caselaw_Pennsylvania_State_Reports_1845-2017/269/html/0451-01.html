    <p id="b478-12" data-blocks='[["BL_478.20",478,[294,2187,1151,212]],["BL_479.1",479,[132,354,1156,529]]]'>It is not the usual case of a contest between an outside creditor and one claiming as a prior purchaser from the debtor of the former; on the contrary, both of the parties to this controversy are stockholders, and were <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>officers, of the corporation, which plaintiff claims sold certain of its property to him and against which defendant holds a judgment. In other words, it is a contest between two individuals, holding internal relations to the corporation, each of whom seeks to gain a preference over the other, and it is a fair question where the equities lie; but with this we have naught to do — the only point we have to solve is whether, under the relevant rules of law, there is sufficient evidence on the record to sustain the verdict.</p>

C. Lyndall (who was then president of the truck company, and appears to have had general charge of its business) to move the property to No. 232 N. 22d street, a building which Lyndall informed plaintiff was under lease to him (Lyndall) personally, and which did not contain anything belonging to the truck company; the articles purchased by plaintiff were removed to the last-stated premises, and his name was written on many of them in chalk; the key to <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>the building was put in charge of a nephew of plaintiff, who worked for the truck company, but who testified that, in the custody of the key, he represented his uncle, and that no one could get into the property without applying to him, as the agent of plaintiff; in pursuance of an agreement to that effect, some of the articles purchased by plaintiff were sold by Lyndall, from time to time, — the latter, on each occasion, taking a written order from the former before delivering the articles to the purchasers; when these sales were made, a sum representing a price previously agreed upon (when Rucker concluded his purchase) was handed to plaintiff, and all above that amount was retained by Lyndall; plaintiff testified that the amounts so retained were paid to Lyndall as a commission for making the sales.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[287,1167,1155,588]]]'>In submitting the case, the trial judge said there was nothing fraudulent about plaintiff’s purchase from the truck company, so far as “an actual intent to do wrong is concerned,” but, at the same time, he charged that “the law construes certain facts to be fraud,” even when no qvil intent is present; and he left it to the jury to determine whether there had been a bona fide delivery of the property in question to plaintiff, also whether the latter had taken such possession thereof as the relation of the parties and the nature, use and situation of the property required, to indicate a change of ownership.</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[285,1764,1150,206]]]'>Since the jury determined the issues submitted to it in plaintiff’s favor and the evidence justifies the findings of fact as above recited, we see no warrant for the final judgment entered by the trial court in this case.</p>

    <p id="b481-5" data-blocks='[["BL_481.5",481,[151,845,1153,1025]]]'>Plaintiff testified that, when he acquired the articles purchased by him, it was with the understanding that Lyndall would, from time to time, as he could, make sales thereof on the former’s account, and that in this way there was to be repaid to him, plaintiff, the amount he had expended, with six per cent interest; he was also given a certain amount of stock in the truck company, as a bonus — no doubt to induce his original purchase, although he says he was then told the stock had no value, which appears to have been the case. To facilitate the carrying out of the transaction between the parties (all details of which, it is fair to believe from the testimony, were known to defendant), it was necessary to keep the property close to Lyndall’s office, which was also the headquarters of the truck company; but, according to the evidence, — which the jury plainly credited, — such possession was taken by plaintiff as the character and situation of the articles in litigation and the relation of the parties demanded.</p>
