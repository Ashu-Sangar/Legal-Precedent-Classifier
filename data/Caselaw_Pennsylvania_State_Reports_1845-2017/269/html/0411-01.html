    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[269,683,1169,1349]]]'>The action was assumpsit on a bond for the faithful performance of a contract for the building of a church; the appellant, surety on the bond, is a corporation of the state of Missouri. The bond was given, not to the • church corporation, the corporate title of which is “The Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the County of Yenango,” but to the building committee of the church, with whom the contract for the erection of the church was made. The appellant asserts that the only persons entitled to bring suit on the bond, are the members of the building committee, the bond providing “That no right of action shall accrue upon or by reason hereof to or for the use or benefit of any one other than the obligee named herein.” This contention might be dismissed with the statement that counsel for appellant on the oral argument admitted that, when suit was brought by the building committee, a demurrer was filed by appellant, raising the question of their right to sue, and the demurrer was sustained; but there is full authority, under the facts as disclosed at the trial, for the maintenance of the suit, as now brought, in the name of the corporation. It is undisputed in the case that the corporation owned the ground on which the building was built, that it paid for the building, and that .the building committee was a mere agency of the corporation.</p>

The surety will be relieved only if the variance in the terms of the contract is material and worked to its damage; but where, as here, the payment of the retained percentage was not to the injury of the surety, but really to its advantage, — because if the payment had not been made, work on the building would have stopped, to its greater loss, it being responsible for completion, — it cannot escape liability because of such payment. True, this bond contains the provision that it “shall be construed strictly as one of suretyship only”; but in this Commonwealth, as part of its declared public policy, bonds of the character of that <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>here sued upon, which are given for a consideration, are to be so construed as to protect the obligee, and the language above quoted does not prevent our treating it as a “suretyship” for profit, in accordance with the fact, even if this surety company of another state, coming into Pennsylvania to.do business under our law, were permitted, which of course it would not be, to stipulate that its obligation here shall mean other than our law determines it shall mean.</p>
    <p id="b442-4" data-blocks='[["BL_442.5",442,[298,828,1153,747]]]'>It is also urged upon our consideration that,, as some of the items going to make up plaintiff’s claim were not paid by plaintiff until after this suit was brought, the proceedings on the bond should have been under the Act of June 14, 1836, P.
