A demurrer was filed by one of the defendants, admitting all facts and inferences well pleaded; and from the bill we find the following: The defendants, some years ago, issued to themselves three hundred and forty (340) shares of the stock of this company, without any consideration therefor, which stock (of the value of $34,000, upon which dividends were paid amounting to $51,000) had been appropriated to their own use. It was apparently issued for past services, which was illegal, void and a fraud on other stockholders: Grafner v.

These facts were concealed from the complaining stockholder, who is one of the minority of the company.

It is not always necessary for the complaining shareholder to appeal to stockholders at a meeting, but he is in duty bound to make every reasonable effort to prevail on the corporate management to bring action: Wolf v.

    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[276,1047,1156,1231]]]'>The court below dismissed the bill because no. proper effort had been made to get the directors to act. There is a distinct and positive averment of fraud in the appropriation of three hundred and forty shares of stock by the directors and others; and, while this would not be sufficient to open the door for further investigation unless it appeared there had been a demand and refusal, with circumstances of the essence of fraudulent conduct accompanying the refusal, appellant attempts to meet this situation by showing defendants controlled the majority stock and the board of directors, and it would be useless to ask them to proceed. Appellees admit this inference to be true.' Such inference may be possible from other circumstances but it is none the less an inference of fact within appellees’ right to admit it to be true. It is just as conclusive on us as if the record was weighted with necessary averments of fraudulent conduct. It is admitted that if this complainant went before the board of directors, they would refuse to act. What advantage would be gained by dismissing the bill and inferentially directing the stockholder to ask the directors to proceed, when they have already indicated they will not do so? For such is the effect of the demurrer.</p>
