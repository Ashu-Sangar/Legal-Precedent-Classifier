Within two years after the signing of this <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>contract the company became financially embarrassed, and entered into an agreement with a committee of its creditors, whereby seventy-two per cent of its outstanding stock was transferred to this committee. The agreement provided, inter alia, that: “Said new stockholders shall have full power to sell and dispose of said stock for the benefit of the creditors......, to vote and otherwise deal with the same......and to cause the company to take such action, either in continuance of [its] business......or in......liquidation, as the committee may think best.”</p>
    <p id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[294,947,1151,250]]]'>There was nothing in the creditors’ agreement which particularly concerned the contract with Buehler; and no evidence was produced to show that, when such agreement was made, the creditors’ committee had knowledge of this contract.</p>
    <p id="b462-7" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[294,1218,1151,1133]]]'>A meeting of the company’s creditors was held, April 9, 1919, to take action on a proposition contained in a letter which the committee had received from Ladner &amp; Ladner, a Philadelphia law firm; this letter, dated April 5, 1919, made an offer of $50,000 for “all the right, title and interest which......the committee......had in the......Company” and its property, “including,” inter alia, “all contracts,” together with the capital stock then held by the committee, the latter to pay all liabilities theretofore contracted or incurred. The bid was raised to $60,000 by one Frank C. Somers, who was present, representing certain of the company’s creditors; and this latter offer was accepted. The business continued as usual, with plaintiff acting as superintendent, at the salary fixed in his contract. A new corporation was formed called the United States Fashion Plate Company (defendant in this suit), by a number of individuals, who were connected with certain financial institutions which had been creditors of the Sample Book Company, and for whom, as well as others, Somers acted at the meeting in April, 1919.</p>

      <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>This new corporation submitted a “written bid” (was not produced in evidence), to the old concern for certain of that company’s tangible property which was accepted by a stockholders’ vote. A bill of sale (also not produced in evidence) was delivered, whereby the new corporation acquired from the old one,which was then still in existence, the property in question; the new company continued to carry on the business, without interruption, Buehler remaining in his position of superintendent until July, 1919, when he was discharged.</p>
    <p id="b463-3" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[147,944,1151,319]]]'>Upon the happening of thé last mentioned event, plaintiff tendered his stock to the old corporation for repurchase, in accordance with the terms of his contract with it; when that company neglected to act, a like tender was made to the new one, which refused to buy; whereupon this suit was commenced.</p>
    <p id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[147,1274,1154,1137]],["BL_464.1",464,[284,340,1152,689]]]'>So far as the evidence shows, plaintiff’s contract with the old company was in no manner mentioned when the new company took over the property of the former; but there is evidence on the record that, at the creditors’ meeting in April, 1919, someone, acting for the committee, gave some sort of notice to bidders that there were “certain contracts which went with the sale of the business,” and that “Mr. Buehler’s contract was one of those mentioned.” There are also assertions in the testimony, by plaintiff and one of his witnesses, to the effect that “the nature of those contracts was briefly recited”; but there is not a word of testimony detailing what was said in this alleged brief recitation, and it appears that plaintiff’s contract was at no time produced. Finally, there is no evidence to warrant a finding that either Somers or any of the persons associated with him were notified that plaintiff’s contract contained the provision, as to the repurchase of stock, sought to be enforced in this case; and, while the proofs depended on by plaintiff, hereinbefore referred to, mention “the abovS named promoters of the defendant company,” there is <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>no evidence upon the record to show in any adequate way precisely who those so-called promoters were, their exact relation to the corporation in question, or that they, or any one for whom they acted, or who acted with them, ever gave Somers authority to assume for them or defendant company the contract now in suit, — in fact the proofs depended on by plaintiff indicate (if anything) rather to the contrary. Furthermore, the record is bare of particulars — such as are essential to charge the United States Fashion Plate Company, on the theory of promoters’ obligations undertaken on its behalf — to show when or how that corporation was either promoted or formed.</p>
    <p id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[282,1050,1152,1350]],["BL_465.1",465,[159,333,1151,98]]]'>Plaintiff, evidently recognizing the weakness of his case from the standpoints we have been discussing, insists that defendant, having acquired the property of the old corporation, is for that reason obliged in law to fulfill its contract with him. By a stretch of the imagination, one might possibly get enough out of the averments in the statement of claim to support this theory; but we think the learned president judge of the court below correctly disposed of it in the following excerpt from his opinion refusing to remove the nonsuit: “If Somers received property, upon the trust that it should be applied to the carrying out of Buehler’s contract, and if the defendant acquired that property from him as a volunteer, or with notice of the trust, it would be bound to apply the property as stipulated; such, however, is not the theory on which the statement of claim is framed, nor was there any evidence produced that supported it. Moreover, it must be noted that what Somers bought at the creditors’ meeting was not what passed to defendant under the bill of sale, to which reference has been made. [By the bill of sale] defendant acquired a portion of the effects of the......Sample Book Company, [while] Somers purchased from the.......committee only its right, title and interest in that corporation and its property”; and the opinion from which we quote well adds <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>that the creditors’ committee in no aspect could be considered the direct owner of the corporation’s property.</p>
    <p id="b465-3" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[159,444,1153,208]]]'>While plaintiff proved his contract and, perhaps, a breach thereof, he failed, for the reasons already stated, with others which might be noted, to establish facts that fix the present defendant with liability.</p>
