    <p class="summary" id="b73-12" data-blocks='[["BL_73.17",73,[122,1664,1154,428]]]'>Judgment in this case was entered on a warrant of attorney, contained in a contract of bailment embracing a privilege of purchase. The petition to open is predicated upon certain alleged fraudulent representations which induced the execution of the contract and being directed to the equitable power of the court the burden of course rests on the defendant to show a case that would warrant the granting of the relief prayed for.</p>

On May 28, 1919, he selected a Duplex style “U” piano player No. 26068. <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>The price agreed upon was twenty-eight hundred and fifty dollars. He paid three hundred dollars down and executed the contract of bailment for the balance. The plaintiff agreed to set the instrument aside and keep it until such time as the defendant’s theatre had been completed. Within a day or so of the date of purchase, the defendant met one Woodruff, a salesman in the employ of a rival instrument house, and told him of the transaction. Woodruff ventured the opinion that taking into consideration the type and price, the instrument must have been secondhand and not new, as the defendant claimed had been represented to him. At the defendant’s request, Woodruff accompanied him to the plaintiff’s store and inspected the instrument. He pronounced it secondhand and considerably worn, whereupon the defendant informed the plaintiff that he would not carry out the contract and demanded a return of the money paid. The plaintiff refused to either cancel the contract or to return the money and when the first of some twenty-eight monthly installments stipulated for by the terms of the contract fell due and was not paid, entered the judgment complained of. In the meantime the defendant had purchased another piano-player from the rival house.</p>

The defendant made no effort to substantiate the averments of his petition that the particular instrument he had purchased had previously been sold to and used by two operators of moving picture theatres, but relied on. the inspection and testimony of Woodruff, which, to say the least, was superficial and much biased. The evidence clearly shows the instrument to have been new and one which at no time after its receipt from the factory had been out of the plaintiff’s possession. The imputation that the plaintiff had set aside a different instru<a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>ment than that which the defendant had inspected and purchased, is not borne out by the evidence.</p>

There was a delivery. But even could it be said that there had been no delivery, as between the parties themselves, this would not have been fatal to the plaintiff’s right to proceed. There were no intervening rights of creditors or other parties. The contract was an executed contract: Collins’s App., <a href="/pa/107/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="107 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="8858925" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0590-01">107 Pa. 590</a>.</p>
