Defendant admitted its inten<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>tion to make the loan, and averred, as authority therefor, article IX, section 15, of the Constitution, adopted November 4, 1913, and the consent of more than three-fifths of the electors of the school district duly obtained at a public election held for the purpose of determining whether they would agree to the increase of indebtedness.

Where municipalities or counties shall issue obligations to provide for the construction of property, as herein provided, said municipalities or counties may also issue obligations to provide for the interest and sinking-fund charges accruing thereon until said properties shall have been completed and in operation for a period of one year; and said municipalities and counties shall not be required to levy a tax to pay said interest and sinking-fund charges, as required by section 10 of article IX of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, until after said properties shall have been <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>operated by said counties or municipalities during said period of one year. Any of tbe said municipalities or counties may incur indebtedness in excess of seven per centum of the assessed valuation of the taxable property therein, if said increase of indebtedness shall have been assented to by three-fifths of the electors voting at a public election, in such manner as shall be provided by law.”</p>
    <p id="b501-3" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[144,775,1154,689]]]'>It is practically conceded that a school district is not usually considered a “municipality” (Ayars’ App., <a href="/pa/122/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="122 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1948405" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0266-01">122 Pa. 266</a>, 283; Briegel v. Phila., <a href="/pa/135/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="135 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="817399" data-case-paths="/pa/135/0451-01">135 Pa. 451</a>, 458); but it is claimed that in article IX, sections 8 and 10, referred to in the foregoing amendment, and elsewhere in the Constitution and statutes, the word is used in a sense broad enough to include a school district; and hence, in interpreting section 15, it should receive the same enlarged construction. We cannot agree with this contention. If it was correct, the word “county,” so frequently used in the section, would be wholly superfluous, for it is as much a “municipality,” under this construction, as is a school district.</p>
    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[143,1483,1155,699]]]'>Moreover, the entire section must be construed together in order to ascertain its meaning. Admittedly “municipality,” in the preceding sentences of the section, does not include a school district, but only municipalities proper; for the former has no right to construct or acquire “waterworks, subways, underground railways or street railways.” Eepeatedly in those earlier sentences the words “said municipalities and counties” are used, and hence the “said municipalities and counties” referred to in the final sentence — ex antecedentibus ex consequentibus fit optima interpretatio — can only be the same “municipalities and counties” which are designated so frequently theretofore.</p>
    <p id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.6",501,[143,2188,1153,211]],["BL_502.1",502,[285,339,1152,480]]]'>Furthermore, where ordinary words are used in the Constitution, they must be construed in their popular and general sense, as the people who voted for it would understand them (Keller v. Scranton, <a href="/pa/200/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="200 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="924409" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0130-01">200 Pa. 130</a>; Com. <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>ex rel. v.
