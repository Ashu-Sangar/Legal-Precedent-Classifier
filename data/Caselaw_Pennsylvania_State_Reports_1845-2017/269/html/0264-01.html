The lease required monthly payments of $164.51 each, until the amount of $2,665.04 had been paid, at which time the truck would become the property of defendants. Plaintiff alleged default in these payments and issued a writ of replevin to recover the property. In answer to the statement of claim the affidavit of defense denied default and set up irregular payments, on account of the agreement, of various amounts aggregating a greater sum than was due under the lease at the time the writ of replevin was issued and averred these sums were paid to plaintiff’s agent who was authorized to receive them.
