At that time, two of the lots, numbers 6 and 8, were subject to a mortgage, which had been held formerly by Townsend Herbert, but assigned, in 1893, to one Ringe. On August 31,1897, Kunzmann conveyed, by deed of general warranty, the three tracts to Townsend Herbert, the present plaintiff. He later conveyed lot number 8 to Julia Herbert, who in turn conveyed to Charles F. Wahl, who sold to Harper B. Smith. Subsequently, in 1912, a decree of foreclosure of the mortgage assigned to Ringe was entered, after due proceedings in <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>the Court of Chancery of New Jersey, and the same was adjudged a first lien on the two lots which had been included in the conveyance from Kunzmann to Herbert.</p>
    <p id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[288,501,1152,526]]]'>One of the tracts, number 8, which, through various conveyances, had passed to Smith, was sold by the sheriff to the administrator of Hinge, who, however, assigned his bid to one Margaret T. Sharp, to whom the land was confirmed and deed made. She took possession of the property, and has lived in it since that time. In the foreclosure proceeding, Kunzmann was named as a party and appeared, filing an answer. Subsequently, his counsel joined in an agreement consenting to the decree of foreclosure entered.</p>

Wahl then brought suit for like amount against his grantor, Julia Herbert, who, in turn, recovered from Townsend Herbert, the present plaintiff. The latter then instituted this action against the estate of Kunzmann to recover the amount which he had been compelled to pay. In addition, he asked reimbursement for the sum required to satisfy the balance of the mortgage, which was, by decree of the court, a lien against lot number 6, included in his deed, which mortgage was a claim at the time of the conveyance to him. The various questions involved were submitted to the jury, and a verdict rendered for the plaintiff. The appeal from the judgment entered thereon brings the matter here for consideration.</p>

Such proof was receivable for the warrantee, though it furnished only prima facie evidence, which would not be conclusive unless the warrantor was called in to defend: Paul v.

Nesbitt, <a href="/pa/267/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="267 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="1057678" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0294-01">267 Pa. 294</a>; Williams v.

There was evidence in the present case that Harper B. Smith was ousted from number 8, Rhode Island avenue. A tenant was in possession under his predecessors in title, and this lessee attorned to him at the time of his purchase. This holding was followed by that of Margaret Sharp, the sheriff’s grantee in the foreclosure proceeding. Smith presumably continued in possession, to which he had the right as owner of the fee until the sale, and Margaret Sharp entered as the result of the title which she received. The presumption is that possession accompanied the title: Yost v. Brown, <a href="/pa/126/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="126 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="968851" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0092-01">126 Pa. 92</a>; Page v.

This change, as a result of the foreclosure proceeding, constituted an eviction, which fixed the right to recover from the warrantor.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.6",338,[276,1850,1151,425]]]'>Assignments six and fifteen refer to evidence offered and instructions of the court concerning an alleged voluntary payment made by Herbert to secure the release of the balance of the mortgage found by the Chancery Court of New Jersey to be a lien upon one of the tracts of ground conveyed by Kunzmann, known as number 6, and which had not been continued in the line of grants to Smith, as in the case of number 8.</p>

This implied that the grantor had not done any <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>act, or created any encumbrance, whereby the estate granted by him could be defeated: Knepper v. Kurtz, <a href="/pa/58/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="58 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="1013192" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0480-01">58 Pa. 480</a>. It differs from a covenant against encumbrances, which does not run with the land, and which is broken at once if encumbrances exist when the deed is made. In case of covenant of warranty the right of action commences when eviction, actual or constructive, takes place, and such covenant protects when this event occurs, though the lien was in existence when the conveyance was made: Williams v. O’Donnell, <a href="/pa/225/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="225 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="965364" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0321-01">225 Pa. 321</a>. The mere existence of a judgment or mortgage gives no right of action to the grantee (7 R. C. L. 1152), but, if a foreclosure follows, the contrary is true; and, if a judgment in foreclosure is recovered, the covenantee, for his protection, may pay the amount due and recover under the warranty within the limits prescribed in such actions: 7 R. C. L. 1152. This principle has clear recognition in Pennsylvania. In Knepper v. Kurtz, <a href="/pa/58/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="58 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="1013192" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0480-01">58 Pa. 480</a>, it was distinctly stated, in the opinion of the court below, that there was a right to pay where suit was not only threatened, but was further proceeded with to the point of judgment. In such case, an action under the covenant could be maintained, for the warrantor could be called in, and have an opportunity to defend against the entry of such judgment; if he was not called in, the judgment would not be conclusive, and he would still have an opportunity to show why he should not pay in the suit brought against him. As was said by the court below in that case, the covenantee would not be compelled to submit, after judgment recovered, to the “ceremony of actual dispossession,” before bringing his suit.</p>

The exact sum due was found, and execution issued against one of the tracts. The return of the sheriff, approved by the court, showed the balance remaining to be paid, which continued a lien on the second tract; <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>and the payment of such balance was made to prevent a sheriff’s sale, according to the plaintiff’s amended statement — which, however, was not offered in evidence to show this fact, notwithstanding the failure of the defendant to make proper denial: Eberbach v. Clyde Steamship Co., <a href="/pa-super/74/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="74 Pa. Super. 79" data-case-ids="645709" data-case-paths="/pa-super/74/0079-01">74 Pa. Superior Ct. 79</a>. But there is sufficient to establish this in the docket entries of the Chancery Court of New Jersey; they show execution issued after the sale of the first property, which writ was outstanding at the time payment was made by Herbert. Under these circumstances, the action of the covenantee was justified, a constructive eviction being shown, and the court below properly permitted the jury to consider, as an item of damage, the sum so paid.</p>

The warrantee can recover, in case of eviction, actual or constructive, what he himself has lost, so long as this sum is not more than the purchase price paid by himself to the warrantor. In the present case, the evidence shows the total consideration for the three lots was $5,600, and that they were approximately of the same value. The damages could not exceed in each case the relative value which that part bears to the whole, to be estimated with regard to the total price fixed by the parties: Mengel v. Williamson, <a href="/pa-super/50/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="50 Pa. Super. 100" data-case-ids="428441" data-case-paths="/pa-super/50/0100-01">50 Pa. Superior Ct. 100</a>. The consideration paid for the properties, 6 and 8, was for each, presumptively, one-third of the whole consideration, or $1,866.66, and the amount of recovery permitted was less than the amount of consideration paid.</p>
