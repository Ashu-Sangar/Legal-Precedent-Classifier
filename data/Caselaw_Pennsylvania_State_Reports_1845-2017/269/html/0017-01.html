    <p id="b44-12" data-blocks='[["BL_44.23",44,[292,1758,1153,480]]]'>On April 27, 1916, it was agreed between defendant coal company and plaintiff dealer, that the former would furnish the latter his “entire requirements” of coal, “from date to April 1st, 1917,” other terms of sale, with which we are not now concerned, being set forth in the written contract. Plaintiff, alleging that defendant had refused to perform, brought an action for damages; the court below entered a nonsuit, which it declined to remove, and this appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b45-3" data-blocks='[["BL_45.4",45,[120,854,1152,370]]]'>Plaintiff offered no evidence of waiver, nor did he show that defendant had any knowledge of these purchases from others.
