Fisher, deceased, who was killed by the fall of a telephone pole, which, though standing on land of defendant railroad company, belonged to another corporation. Plaintiff claimed that defendant’s negligence, in failing to inspect the pole and discover an alleged rotten condition at its base, was responsible for the death of her husband. A verdict was directed for defendant, judgment was entered thereon, and this appeal followed.</p>

Without discussing the question of defendant’s obligation to inspect and discover defects in the pole, which is questionable, it is sufficient to say that, since plaintiff entirely omitted to show when the pole was planted, she failed to fix defendant with negligence in the premises.</p>
