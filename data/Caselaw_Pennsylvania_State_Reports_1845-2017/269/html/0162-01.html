G. Wasson, Trustee, his successors, heirs and assigns”; this deed, which is made part of the case-stated, shows through its various parts, the designation of the grantee just quoted, and recites that the conveyance is made in fulfillment of a judicial sale, pursuant to a decree entered in certain equity proceedings against the grantor partnership; on April 24, 1899, “H. G. Wasson, Trustee, party of the first part,” by deed duly recorded; conveyed the property to George J. Gorman, this deed reciting that it is “made in pursuance of a request of the cestui que trustent of the first party”; “there is nothing contained in either of the above mentioned deeds, or on the records of Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, to show for whom, or for what purpose, the said H. G. Wasson was trustee, nor is there anything on the records of Armstrong County, or any other of said deeds, to show the right and power of said H. G. Wasson, Trustee, to convey said property.” Gorman, by deed dated June 1, 1899, duly recorded, conveyed the property to Joseph G. Beale, who, on March 9, 1900, by a like deed, conveyed it to D. Wiley McCaughey, who, on April 11, 1900, by a like deed, conveyed it to the American Sheet &amp; Tin Plate Co.; the last mentioned grantee, on March 13, 1915, by deed duly recorded, conveyed the property to the Fort Pitt Stamping and Enameling Company, plaintiff in the case-stated, who, on July 13,1920, entered into an agreement with the American Natural Gas Company, defendant in the case-stated, to sell and convey the premises in question to the latter corporation, “in fee simple, clear of all encumbrances”; in pursuance of this agreement, plaintiff tendered a deed to defendant, which the latter refused to accept, “for the reason that the deed from H. G. Wasson, Trustee, to George J. Gorman...... did not pass a good record title in fee simple to the said property.”</p>

The case-stated does not give any facts, as to inquiries by the grantee from Wasson or by others dealing with the title, nor does it ask the court to decide anything as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of inquiries made; all the court is asked to decide is whether or not the deed from Wasson, trustee, “passes a good record title.”</p>
    <p id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.6",192,[283,941,1151,417]]]'>Since the deed from Wasson was executed^ delivered and recorded more than a quarter of a century before the agreement of sale between plaintiff and defendant, in view of the recital contained in the former — that the grantor makes the conveyance pursuant to a request of his “cestui que trustent” — we must take it that the instrument “passes a good record title,” after this lapse of time.</p>
    <p id="b192-6" data-blocks='[["BL_192.7",192,[282,1378,1152,960]]]'>There is nothing in the case-stated to show who has been in possession of the premises during the period therein dealt with. If the property was held in trust, by Wasson, for one then in possession, and that possession still continues, how far, under such circumstances, if the trustee wronged his cestuis que trust, the actual title of the latter would be affected by the former’s deed, is a point not now before us, and we leave it undecided. As previously suggested, confining our consideration to the facts contained in the case-stated (as we must, since “whatever is not distinctly and expressly agreed upon and set forth as admitted must be taken not to exist”: Berks County v. Pile, <a href="/pa/18/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="18 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="969105" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0493-01">18 Pa. 493</a>; Loux v.

To this extent we concur with the court below.</p>
