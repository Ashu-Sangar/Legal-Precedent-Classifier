Their affidavit, however, alleges that they have a set-off which would be available against the claim upon their check, if the action ..upon it were brought in the name of Danser &amp; Co., the payees, that set-off being their counterclaim against Danser &amp; Co., upon dishonored checks of the latter amounting to $73,535. While this may not be a valid defense as against an ordinary endorsee even when he has acquired the instrument sued upon after payment thereof, was refused and he had notice of its dishonor, such a defense is good against one who holds it merely as agent or trustee for the payee. This is the character imputed to the plaintiff by the defendants. The affidavit of defense plainly alleges that the Mutual Trust Company gave no credits or other valuable consideration to Danser &amp; Co. for the defendants’ check, and that the check was received and is held by it merely for collection for the account of that firm. While the affidavit contains much that is irrelevant, and that could not be admitted in evidence at trial, it raises material questions of fact that must be settled by a jury before a final disposition of the case can be made.</p>
