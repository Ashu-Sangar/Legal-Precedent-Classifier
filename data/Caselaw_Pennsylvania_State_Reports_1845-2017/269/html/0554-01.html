    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.6",582,[283,396,1155,804]]]'>The plaintiff* a miner, employed by the defendant company, was injured by a fall of coal oii August 8, 1914, and brought an action to recover damages. In his statement, he asserted liability on several grounds, one of which was the failure to supply supports for the roof of the chamber in which he was working. At the trial it was proposed to prove that the duty of furnishing props had been placed, by the rules of the mine, in the exclusive charge of the witness Langan; an unfulfilled promise made by him to supply the timber requested by the plaintiff ; and, as a result, the falling of the coal, and the injury complained of. The court below sustained objection made; no further testimony was presented, and a verdict for the defendant was directed. After the entry of judgment, the plaintiff took this appeal.</p>

This renders necessary an inquiry into the duties cast, under that legislation (Act June 2, 1891, P. L. 195), upon those having control. “The term superintendent means the person who shall have, on behalf of the owner, general supervision of one or more mines or collieries” (art. 18, P. L. 207); the mine foreman has charge of the underground workings (art. 12, P. L. 195), is a person whose competency is certified to by the State, and to whom broad powers have been delegated. When the work has been committed to his charge, as permitted by the act, the owner is not ordinarily responsible for injuries which occur from negligent performance of his duties: Golden v. Mount Jessup Coal Co., <a href="/pa/225/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="225 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="965273" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0164-01">225 Pa. 164</a>; Watkins v.

There are instances in which the owner remains liable, notwithstanding such employment. For example, where there has been a failure to properly instruct employees (Bogdanovicz v.

The same rule of liability is applied where the work is without the scope of the duties of the mine foreman. “The owner can claim the protection of the law so far as he complies with its provisions. If the mine owner elect to take certain parts of the machinery and appliances out of the charge of the mine foreman and exercise direct supervision through the superintendent over the same, the law will not give him the protection he would otherwise be entitled to if all of the underground workings had been committed to the care and supervision of a properly certified mine foreman”: Reeder v.

Pryor Coal Co., <a href="/pa-super/68/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="68 Pa. Super. 88" data-case-ids="630944" data-case-paths="/pa-super/68/0088-01">68 Pa.

In the present case, the offer was not only to show such notice, but a rule of the company by which all matters relating to the props were placed in the hands of a designated person, named and controlled by the superintendent. The testimony proposed was sufficiently broad to establish liability, if proven, unless some other legal obstacle to a recovery appears.</p>
    <p id="b584-4" data-blocks='[["BL_584.5",584,[297,724,1153,1078]]]'>It is further urged that the evidence offered was insufficient because it appeared that the negligence was that of Langan. The learned court below was of the opinion that the facts indicated he was a fellow-servant, for whose wrongful act, resulting in harm to a coemployee, the owner would not be liable. Many cases are to be found, under somewhat similar facts, where the relationship of the parties was held to be such, and the rule suggested was applied (Lehigh Valley Coal Co. v. Jones, <a href="/pa/86/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="86 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1056627" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0432-01">86 Pa. 432</a>; Bradbury v.

Where one, though not a vice-principal, is entrusted with the carrying out of some imperative or absolute obligation, the employer is not relieved of liability though the person injured was a fellow-servant: Furman v. Broscious, <a href="/pa/268/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="268 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="1061618" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0119-01">268 Pa. 119</a>; Prevost v.
