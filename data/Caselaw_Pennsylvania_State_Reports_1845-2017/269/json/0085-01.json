        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nG. B. Hurt, Incorporated, sued the Fuller Canneries Company, a corporation, to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract; the jury rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff, upon which judgment was entered, and defendant has appealed.\nThe contract in question was for the sale by defendant to plaintiff of certain canned goods, to be delivered in instalments, and the latter therein agreed to pay for each instalment \u201c10 days from date of shipment.\u201d The contract also had a provision that \u201cNo agreement expressed or implied not stated on each copy of this order shall govern.\u201d\nPlaintiff, in the presentation of its case, showed the contract, containing, inter alia, the above stated provisions, and admitted it had failed to comply with the terms of payment, in that a certain shipment of goods, amounting to more than $1,400 in value, made by defendant on November 4, 1916, had remained unpaid for 130 days prior to March 26, 1917, when plaintiffs received notice from defendant of the latter\u2019s cancellation of the contract, because of such nonpayment.\nThere was no controversy whatever as to the facts thus far stated; but plaintiff contended that the long delay in payment of the shipment in question was not a breach of contract on its part, since the written agreement had been \u201clater modified by parol.\u201d It contended that \u201cthe time of payment term, to wit: \u201810 days from date of shipment,\u2019 was modified [by an express oral agreement between the parties] so as to allow [plaintiff] to pay for merchandise shipped in 1916 in instalments at its convenience, the whole amount to be paid April 1st, 1917\u2014 the end of [defendant\u2019s] fiscal year.\u201d\nThe trial judge submitted to the jury the evidence of this alleged parol modification, together with other issues in the case. Defendant, in its assignments of error, criticises the manner in which this was done; it also contends, on several grounds, that, in the first instance, it was entitled to binding instructions, and, these having been refused, to judgment n. o. v.\nFor present purposes the case may be reduced to this question: Was there sufficient evidence to warrant the trial judge in submitting to the jury the issue as to the alleged parol modification of the written contract; or was it his duty to rule that the evidence adduced to prove such modification was legally inadequate?\nThe evidence was as follows: (1) An oral statement by G. B. Hurt, president of plaintiff company, that, when he started to purchase from defendant corporation, the president of that concern said to him \u201cif you pay for this stuff by the end of the fiscal year it will be all right\u201d; this was accompanied, however, by an admission that immediately after the conversation in which the above quoted declaration was made, a written contract was signed containing the terms of payment, as hereinbefore recited. (2) A'statement by Hurt that it was his \u201cunderstanding\u201d that his concern was to pay by the end of defendant\u2019s fiscal year. (3) Another statement by Hurt that he \u201cunderstood everything was to be cleaned up by the end of the fiscal year\u201d; and, when asked why, if this was so, he signed a contract containing contrary terms, he answered that \u201csuch course was often pursued.\u201d (4) Finally, a statement by Hurt that, in the summer of 1916, he had a conversation with J. D. Fuller, president of defendant company, in which he, Hurt, asked leave to cancel part of his contract of purchase; that, in this conversation, Fuller asked Hurt \u201cWhy are you cancelling?\u201d and the latter replied \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think I can pay for them by the end of the fiscal year in March,\u201d whereupon Fuller said there was no necessity for cancelling on account of \u201cnot having the money to pay all at one time......as long as it was paid at the end of the fiscal year\u201d (but the cancellation in question did in fact take place).\nThe above is a brief, but sufficiently full, statement of all the proofs on the point under discussion, except- the written correspondence between the parties, which does not help plaintiff, and the fact of certain delays in past payments; both of which latter items of evidence will be considered after further discussion of the testimony.\nIt is apparent that the first item of testimony is no evidence at all of the alleged parol modification of the contract in suit, since all that is there related occurred before any written contract was signed. The next two items simply represent declarations relative to Hurt\u2019s understanding of what occurred, not statements of what actually took place, from which a judicial conclusion might be made. As to the fourth item, plaintiff\u2019s own evidence proves that the cancellation, which Hurt and Fuller were then discussing, was in fact made; hence the alleged inducement of extended credit to prevent such cancellation, not having been accepted, could not be subsequently called into effect for plaintiff\u2019s benefit. The testimony on'the side of defendant did no-t help plaintiff in this regard, for Fuller denied ever having agreed to any change in the stipulated terms of payment, so far as the contract in suit is concerned..\nThe correspondence shows constant dunning on the part of defendant and, in reply, a series of broken promises to pay on behalf of plaintiff, with the final cancellation of the contract by the former because of default of the latter; as before said, it does not help plain-, tiff, but rather the contrary.\nIn Shilanski v. Farrell, 57 Pa. Superior Ct. 137, 143, President Judge Rice said: \u201cThe mere act of receiving payment, or several payments, after the dates when the purchaser was bound to make them,\u201d would not operate as an abrogation of a written contract, nor would it be \u201ca waiver of strict compliance with its terms as to amounts falling due thereafter\u201d; this statement fits the present case, for, aside from the testimony to which we have called attention, circumstances of such indulgence are all that plaintiff has to rely on. It may be that, after a long course of this sort of indulgence, a seller could not suddenly cancel for nonperformance of the contract according to its strict letter; but that is not this case.\nA careful reading of the pleadings and the stenographer\u2019s notes of the trial, shows plainly that plaintiff\u2019s position \u2014 as to the alleged parol modification of the contract in suit \u2014 was precisely as we have stated it. Moreover, this is borne out by plaintiff\u2019s own statement of its position, contained in its paper-book, not only as we quote it in the beginning of this opinion, but where counsel say, \u201cThe court submitted to the jury the question of whether or not the written contract was modified with respect to the time of payment,\u201d and, again, where they say, \u201cAppellant overlooks the plain position of the appellee to the effect that this written contract was modified and varied by parol after its execution.\u201d\nWe are of opinion that the evidence submitted, for the purpose of showing parol modification, was entirely inadequate, as not up to the required legal standard; and the trial judge should have so instructed the jury. Plaintiff itself first breached the contract, and defendant had the right to cancel (see Bartoe v. Bixler Coal & Coke Co., 269 Pa. 17); hence the latter was entitled to binding instructions in its favor.\nThe first and second assignments of error, which go to the declination of binding instructions and the refusal to enter judgment n. o. v., are sustained; the others are dismissed, because it is unnecessary to consider them.\nThe judgment for plaintiff is reversed and judgment is here entered for defendant.",
