        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Moschzisker,\nRobert Barnwell, the sole next of kin to testator and the only issue of his brother, Will E. Barnwell, claimed the residuary estate of decedent, on the ground that the bequest which we are about to set forth failed in law; the court below decided to the contrary, and this appeal followed.\nTestator provided: \u201cWhatever reputation and success I have attained, however moderate, being the result, under Providence, of two causes, first, the training of a good mother who always inculcated and practiced the highest principles of honor and especially of moral courage regardless of immediate or apparent results, and, secondly, to the education which I received in the public schools of Philadelphia and especially in the Central High school, I wish to honor the memory of that mother by practically encouraging and rewarding the practice of the same high principles by the students and graduates of the school. Accordingly, I expect hereafter, by one or more codicils to this my last will, to make devises, bequests or endowments by the creation of trusts or otherwise to carry out this purpose, the details of which I have not fully matured, but, knowing the uncertainty of human life, I have made this will without waiting to complete such plans; and in the event of decease before duly executing such codicil or codicils, then I authorize and direct my executor, hereinafter named, at his discretion, to sell or dispose of any or all of my residuary estate and invest the proceeds thereof in lawful securities and expend the net income arising therefrom in such way as in his judgment will best carry out the foregoing purpose, and, in .such case, I further authorize and empower my executor aforesaid to make in his discretion permanent provision for the endowment and support of such purpose by deed of trust, by will or otherwise and I further authorize him to execute any and all legal instruments necessary or proper to carry into effect this purpose and any or all of the other provisions of this my will. In case the foregoing provision relating to the subject-matter of an intended codicil or codicils should be by competent judicial authority decided to be invalid by reason of being vague or indefinite or for any other legal or technical reason, then and in that case, I give, devise and bequeath all the rest residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal or mixed and wheresoever situate to my brother Will E. Barnwell.\u201d\nA charitable use \u201cmay be applied to almost anything that tends to promote the well-doing and well-being of social man\u201d: Memorial Assn. of Valley Forge, 235 Pa. 206, 211, and authorities there cited. Surely a trust to \u201cinculcate\u201d the \u201chighest principles of honor and moral courage\u201d among the \u201cstudents\u201d and \u201cgraduates!\u201d of a well-known public high school for young men, in a great city, and to \u201cpractically\u201d encourage and reward \u201cthe practice\u201d of such \u201chigh principles,\u201d will have a tendency \u201cto promote the well-doing and well-being\u201d of an indefinite number of persons, thus materially adding to the good of the community as a whole; and, in these respects, the present bequest creates a charitable trust.\nIn Kimberly\u2019s Est. (No. 3), 249 Pa. 483, 489, we defined charities as \u201cinstitutions established and carried on by gifts from benevolent persons, not for the financial gain or profit of any person, but for the physical, mental or moral betterment of an indefinite number of persons.\u201d In John\u2019s Est., 265 Pa. 311, the trust, recently sustained by us, was to \u201cimprove and elevate to a higher level the standard of practical education\u201d in a certain school district; and in Board of Home Missions v. Phila., 266 Pa. 405, 410, we still more recently held that the work of a board engaged in \u201cthe spread of the Christian religion for the benefit of mankind, throughout the United States and territories, by establishing and extending the Christian influence of one of the great and recognized mediums to that end, \u2014 the Methodist Episcopal Church, \u2014 and, more specifically, by aiding, wherever necessary, in the purchase and erection of suitable houses of public worship and other church property, and the prosecution of the home mission work of the Methodist Episcopal Church,\u201d was a public charity. The question here, at the present time, however, is not whether the testator created a technical public charity, but whether he set up a charitable trust: Dulles\u2019s Est., 218 Pa. 162, 164, 167, 168; Kimberly\u2019s Est. (No. 1), 249 Pa. 469, 472.\nThe fact that testator in the present instance did not formulate practical plans for carrying his broadly conceived charitable idea into effect, is of no moment, so long as his \u201cgeneral intent\u201d is \u201cascertainable\u201d and he has vested others with authority to work out and put in operation the details necessary to make his idea of practical use to those he intended to benefit: Dulles\u2019s Est., 218 Pa. 162, 168.\nTestator, after stating that he \u201cexpected,\u201d in codicils (which he never executed), \u201cto make devises, bequests or endowments, by the creation of trusts or otherwise,\u201d so as to carry out his general design (the \u201cdetails of which,\u201d he says, he had \u201cnot fully matured\u201d), expressly authorizes and directs his executor (in the event of his death before executing such codicils) to \u201cexpend the net income\u201d from the fund here in question \u201cin such way as in his judgment will best carry out\u201d testator\u2019s general \u201cpurpose\u201d; and he further empowers the executor \u201cto make in his discretion permanent provision for the endowment and support of such purpose......and...... to execute any and all legal instruments necessary or proper to carry into effect this purpose.\u201d\nOf course the administration of the fund will always be limited to the charitable purposes intended; but, within such bounds, the trustees have unlimited discretion to work out the broad idea indicated by testator and to administer the fund along these lines: Kimberly\u2019s Est. (No. 1), 249 Pa. 469, 472; Kimberly\u2019s Est. (No. 3), 249 Pa. 483, 489.\nAs very properly said by counsel for appellant, none of the cited decisions from outside jurisdictions \u201ccan be regarded as controlling\u201d the present case; and the applicable general principles have been so recently and fully discussed by us, not only in the Pennsylvania authorities before mentioned, but in others, that it would serve no useful purpose to review them again at this time.\nThe broad idea intended by testator being within the purview of a charitable trust, and he having provided means for its practical realization, we cannot pronounce it illegal for indefiniteness.\nThe assignments of error which are in conflict with the views here expressed, we overrule; and those which go to matters not covered by this opinion, we dismiss, as irrelevant to the legal point of view on which the case is determined.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed at cost of appellant.",
