The jury returned a verdict for defendant. The court granted a new trial, because in its opinion there had been \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice\u201d, due in large extent to the introduction of irrelevant and prejudicial issues into the trial by defendant\u2019s attorney. No abuse of discretion is shown. This being so, we ivill not interfere with the new trial order: Weinfeld v. Funk, 342 Pa. 160, 20 A. 2d 206; Murphy v. McGinnis, 343 Pa. 255, 22 A. 2d 649.\nOrder affirmed.",
