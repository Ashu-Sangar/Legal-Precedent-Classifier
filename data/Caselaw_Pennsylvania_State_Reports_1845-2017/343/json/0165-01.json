        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal by the Empire Trust Company of New York and the National City Bank of New York, Trustees, from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Somerset County sustaining certain exceptions to the report of the auditor in distributing a balance shown by the first and partial account of the executors of the last will and testament of John Lochrie, deceased.\nThe testator, John Lochrie, had been married twice and died as a resident of Somerset County on September 30,1937. His will was dated May 17,1933, and the codicil thereto November 7, 1935. He was survived by his widow, Kathleen Lochrie, and by eleven of his fifteen children, three sons and eight daughters, and by the children of two sons, William Lochrie and John Lochrie III, who predeceased him.\nThe testator on May 19,1922, created two inter vivos trusts (1) with the National City Bank of New York as trustee, by the terms and conditions of which the five surviving children by his second marriage were each the beneficiaries of the income during their lifetime, with a power of disposition by his or her will of one-third of the principal thereof to the wife or husband of such beneficiary; and (2) with the Empire Trust Company of New York City for the benefit of the widow, Kathleen Lochrie, with directions that upon her death, the trustee should divide the principal of said trust into as many parts or shares as would make one equal share for each of seven of his children naming them.\nIn Article IV of the will, the testator provides: \u201cI authorize and direct that my executors shall, from the assets of my estate, purchase and acquire Bonds of the United States of America bearing the higher rate of interest in the amount of Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000) par value, which Bonds shall be distributed, delivered and paid over by my Executors to Trustees and Legatees.\u201d\nThe auditor, who was appointed by the court to settle exceptions and make distribution of the moneys remaining in the hands of the executors for distribution as shown by the first and partial account, construed in his 28th finding of fact and 6th conclusion of law Article IV of the will as requiring the executors to purchase United States Treasury Bonds of 1947-52, bearing 4%% interest, these being those bonds of the United States which bear the highest rate of interest. The auditor\u2019s reasoning is as follows: \u201cClearly this [provision in the will as to the purchase of bonds] could mean only United States Treasury Bonds 4%% of 1947-52, because they are the only bonds that are higher in their interest rate than any other bond.\u201d The market price of these bonds was, on January 8, 1940, $120.00 per one hundred dollar bond.\nThe Trustee, the National City Bank of New York, filed a number of exceptions to the report of the auditor, but none of them are relevant in the present appeals, as such matters were decided by this court in Lochrie\u2019s Estate, 340 Pa. 145, 16 A. 2d 133.\nThe executors and others of the heirs filed exceptions to the auditor\u2019s findings, claiming that he erred in his interpretation of Clause IV of the will and that the bonds which the auditor designated are not bonds bearing the \u201chigher\u201d rate of interest as required by that clause but bonds bearing the \u201chighest\u201d rate of interest.\nThe auditor overruled the exceptions but the court below sustained them, saying: \u201cIt appears that United States Treasury Bonds of 1947-52 4%% are commanding a premium of $20.00 or more on the par value per $100.00; and to carry out the testator\u2019s directions that $350,000.00 be invested in the purchase of United States Bonds bearing the highest rate of interest, as concluded by the auditor, would require an additional investment of $70,000.00 to pay the premium on said bonds. Considering the probable value of the unconverted assets of the estate, it is doubtful if the executors can carry into effect the testamentary provisions of the testator, if they are required to purchase United States Bonds bearing the highest rate of interest. It is our considerate conclusion, that it is the duty of the executors, in carrying out the mandatory direction of the testator\u2019s will, to purchase Bonds of the United States, bearing the \u2018higher\u2019 but not the \u2018highest\u2019 rate of interest; and that said executors have authority, in the exercise of sound discretion, to determine which of the bonds bearing the higher rate of interest shall be purchased and delivered to the Trustees.\u201d The court thereupon redistributed the funds allocating the balance to the purchase by the executors of bonds of the United States bearing the \u201chigher\u201d rate of interest, and when purchased to deliver the same to the trustees to be held in trust for the named beneficiaries. This appeal followed.\nWe find that the trustees have no standing to take an appeal in this case. Section 22(a) of the Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 363,20 PS section 2601, provides, inter alia: \u201cAny party aggrieved by the definitive sentence or decree of any orphans\u2019 court or his legal representatives, may appeal therefrom to the proper appellate court within six months from the time of pronouncing such final sentence or decree.\u201d The trustees are not aggrieved parties within the meaning of this act. See Stineman\u2019s Appeal, 34 Pa. 394; Bower\u2019s Est., 48 Pa. Superior Ct. 394; and Wick\u2019s Est., 50 Pa. Superior Ct. 614; Levan\u2019s Est., 314 Pa. 274, 171 A. 617; and Kennedy\u2019s Est., 328 Pa. 193, 194 A. 901. In Mellon\u2019s Appeal, $2 Pa. 121, this court held that an assignee or trustee, having no beneficial interest in the trust, cannot appeal from a decree distributing the trust funds in his hands.\nNovember 24, 1941:\nLacking a beneficial interest in the trusts (see Lochrie\u2019s Est., supra), the trustees cannot be aggrieved by the decree they have appealed from. Therefore, they are not qualified to appeal.\nThe appeals are quashed at the cost of the appellants.\nPer Curiam,\nAfter re-argument, we find no reasons to change the opinion and decree heretofore filed in this case.",
