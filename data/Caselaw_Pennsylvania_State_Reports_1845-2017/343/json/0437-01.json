The court stated as its reason for doing so that the damages awarded by the jury were grossly in excess of the damage done to the property. As an additional reason, the statement is made that one of the jurors was the wife of an expert witness called by plaintiffs. In view of these statements of the court, we will not interfere with its discretion in granting the new trial: Dzaack v. Bell Telephone Co., 296 Pa. 385, 145 A. 916; Edwards v. Crawford, 328 Pa. 449, 196 A. 58; Bingler v. Hopper, 336 Pa. 58, 7 A. 2d 351.\nOrder affirmed.",
