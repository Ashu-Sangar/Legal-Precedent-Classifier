    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[184,468,1152,971]]]'>Crow became mayor on the first Monday of January, 1940, his salary being $200 a month. On May 27, 1941, the President proclaimed a national emergency, and all members of the Officers’ Reserve Corps were ordered to active duty. Crow, who had been a commissioned officer in the Reserve Corps since 1925, was appointed a major in the United States Army, his compensation, with perquisites, being approximately $430 per month. On June 4, 1941, he reported for duty at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen, Maryland, where he is still stationed, or at least was stationed at the time this case was argued. On July 8, 1941, the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County appointed respondent, George B. Smith, as mayor in place of Crow. The latter thereupon filed a suggestion for a writ of quo warranto and, the writ having been granted, respondent moved to quash it. From an order of the court quashing the writ relator appeals.</p>

On the one hand it might be urged that if public office had to be surrendered upon accepting a commission in the army it would unjustly penalize those who are patriotically giving their services to the Republic in this critical hour. On the other hand there must be borne in mind the fact that practically all who are leaving their civilian occupations for military service — whether professional or business men, artisans or unskilled laborers — are <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>thereby surrendering the profits, salaries and wages pertaining to their ordinary vocations, and the question would naturally arise why those holding public office should be exempt from making the same sacrifice that falls to the lot of others who join the armed forces. Furthermore, paramount as is the importance of the military service, the administration of municipal government must go on during the emergency, and a city cannot be properly managed by an executive who, having been commissioned in the army, will presumably, under existing legislation, serve therein for the uncertain duration of the war, and, during all the years of his term of office as mayor, may be stationed in a remote part of the country or even of the world.</p>

The question before us is purely a legal one, and arises by virtue of Article Nil, section 2, of our Constitution, which provides that: “No . . . person holding or exercising any office or appointment of trust or profit under the United States shall at the same time hold or exercise any office in this State to which a salary, fees or perquisites shall be attached.” This constitutional provision is self-executing: <em>DeTurk v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/129/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="129 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="568043" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0151-01">129 Pa. 151</a>, 160, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.%20757" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="18 A. 757">18 A. 757</a>, 758. It leaves open for determination only whether a major in the United States Army holds and exercises , an office of trust or profit under the United States. As to this there can be no debatable question. In dignity, responsibility, executive requirements, indefinite but prolonged tenure, compensation, and all other controlling features, the position constitutes an office — confirmed by the very designation “officer” — and one not only of profit but of the highest possible trust. Nearly all the other states of the Union have similar provisions in their constitutions, and practically all of them hold that the acceptance of a commission as an officer in the army amounts to an automatic vacation of a salaried office under the State: <em>State v.

If the incapacity of relator to hold the office of mayor after entering into active military service resulted merely from the provisions of the Act of May 15,1874, P. L. 186, it would be necessary to consider the effect of the Act of July 2, 1941, P. L. 231, amending that statute so as to make it inapplicable to a person called into the active military or naval service of the United States during a war or emergency. But relator’s disability arises not from any legislation but from the Constitution of the Commonwealth; moreover, the Act of 1941 became effective only on the date of its enactment, July 2, 1941, whereas it was on June 4,1941, that relator, by entering upon active duty in the army, vacated his office as mayor of Uniontown.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
