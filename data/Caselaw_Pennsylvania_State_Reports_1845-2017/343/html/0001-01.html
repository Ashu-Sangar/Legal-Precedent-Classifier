In obedience to the prescriptions of the Act of March 7, 1939, P. L. 7 (53 P.

The court below was asked in a taxpayer’s bill to enjoin the County Commissioners from holding a Mayoralty election this November. The court refused to do so, deciding that an election for Mayor can legally be held on the ensuing 4th of November. This appeal followed.</p>

Even the Act of 1891 just referred to only “regulated” in slight degree nominations to public office. Its chief concern with nominations was to safeguard the official ballot provided for in the Act so that persons with no proper claim to a nomination should not have their names thereon. Under that act candidates for public office could be chosen by committees of delegates or by a caucus held under the rules of a political party and the nomination for State offices could be certified by an authorized party board to the Secretary of the Commonwealth and the nomination for other offices could be certified to the commissioners of the proper county. The act also provided for nominations to be made by nomination papers. For offices other than state offices and other than borough and township offices certificates of nomination could be filed with the county commissioners 42 days before, and nomination papers for such offices could be filed 35 days before, election day. For township and borough offices nomination papers could be filed with the auditors seven days before election day. Under the simple procedure thus prevailing before the Uniform Primary Act was adopted when vacancies in city or county offices arose even as late as five weeks before the November election, timely nominations to fill those vacancies at that election could be made.</p>

Furthermore, in a city as large as Philadelphia with the great duplication in names of residents, how would it be possible to determine <em>for whom </em>an elector voted if the person whose name he “wrote in” might mean one of two or of two hundred persons. For example, the city directory of Philadelphia discloses the fact that in that city there are 326 “William Smiths”, 239 “John Smiths”, 242 “William Browns”, 145 “Harry Cohens”, 107 “James Gallaghers”, 167 “John Kellys”, 127 “William Wilsons”, 124 “John Murphys”, 136 “William Jacksons”, 160 “William Millers”, 132 “John Williams” to say nothing of the “John Browns” and the “John Thomases” and the “John Joneses” and hundreds of other names which are duplicated to multiple degrees.</p>

It is probable that only a small minority of the voters would take <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>the pains to vote for any person for Mayor and to properly identify that person by his address. It might easily happen that an utterly incompetent individual who received a vote which would represent only a small per cent of the city’s electorate would receive a plurality of the “write in” vote for Mayor and so be elected. Even counsel for the appellees say in their paper book: “It would be an unfortunate result if the mayor had to be elected by such undirected and chaotic voting to which this [i. e. voting by “writing in” names] might lead because of the absence of the names of any nominated candidates of political parties on the ballot”. Since there is <em>absolutely no warrant in law </em>for making a substituted nomination by political committees where <em>no original nomination </em>has been made, (as an inspection of the Code clearly reveals to either a professional or lay mind) and since it is conceded by all that to elect a Mayor by means of “write ins” would be “chaotic” and “unfortunate”, our duty is so to interpret the statute as to prevent this. As Judge Cardozo said in <em>In re Rouss, </em><a href="/ny/221/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="221 N.Y. 81" data-case-ids="1958543" data-case-paths="/ny/221/0081-01">221 N.

This is an argument which should be addressed to the legislature and not to the courts, for the duty of courts is to interpret laws, not to make them. However, we cannot agree that to permit individuals who have not been elected to a high office to succeed to that office on the death of the office’s elected incumbent, is contrary to the genius of American institutions. Within the past decade, the cities of New York and Chicago had as their respective Mayors for substantial periods men who had <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>not been elected to that office by the city electorate but who succeeded to the office by virtue of a statute, when the office became vacant by reason of the Mayor’s resignation, in the New York case, and the Mayor’s death, in the Chicago case. For the second time within a few years, the Mayor of Philadelphia died and the President of Council succeeded to the office for a substantial period. If Mayor Lamberton had died seventy five days later, no one could question the fact that the President of Council would succeed him and remain in office until the first Monday of January 1944. We think this is conceded in appellees’ brief of argument, to which we will later make further reference.</p>

Southard, and he would have served as President nearly four years. If one more adverse vote had been cast against Andrew Johnson on May 26, 1868, in the impeachment proceedings in the United States Senate, the then President pro tern of the Senate, Ben Wade, would have become President.

Since public officials, like all other men, are mortal the orderly processes of government require that statutory provision be made for the immediate succession of Mayors and other important public servants. In the Act of March 7, 1939 (supra), the State through its legislature declared that the President of the City Council of Philadelphia was the proper official to succeed to the powers and responsibilities of the Chief Magistracy of Philadelphia. It follows that he must remain in that office until his elected successor can be chosen in the manner the law provides.</p>

Article 2, section 2, clause (a) of the Philadelphia City Charter (Act of June 25, 1919, P. L. 581, 53 P. S. 2922) provides: “The Mayor shall be chosen at the municipal election, and shall hold office for the term of four years”. Section 4, clause (a) of the Charter Act, quoted in the earlier part of this opinion, refers to “the next election occurring more than thirty days after the commencement of a vacancy in the office of Mayor” as the time for electing “a successor for the unexpired term”. We have demon<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>strated that <em>this </em>“next election” cannot be the Municipal Election to be held on November 4th of <em>this </em>year.

Since a Mayor under the charter must be chosen at a <em>Municipal </em>Election, and not at .a <em>General </em>election, it follows that a Mayor of Philadelphia cannot be elected until the next Municipal Election <em>after </em>the 1941 Municipal Election, unless there is some statutory provision for a special election for Mayor to be held at the time of the General Election in 1942. There is no such provision in the Election Code of 1937 or elsewhere. This Code provides for special elections to fill vacancies in the following offices only: (1) United States Senator, (2) Representative in Congress, (3) Member of the General Assembly. Special elections are also provided for “on a proposed constitutional amendment or other question, to be voted on by the electors of the state at large, or by the electors of any political district”.
