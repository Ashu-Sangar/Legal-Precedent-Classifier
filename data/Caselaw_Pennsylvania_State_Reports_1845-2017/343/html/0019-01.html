Under this construction, the court below held that upon the death of Frank R. Brown his son was properly paid an eighth of the income while the Diefenderfer and Warner issue, if they had asserted their rights, would have been entitled to share another eighth between them, and since the death of Robert S. Brown an additional eighth of the income should be divided between the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>Diefenderfer and Warner issue and another eighth should go to the “surviving residuary legatees, by representation.”</p>

After this provision for the life tenants the quarters were to vest in enjoyment at least, but other grandnephews or nieces, children of Dr. Diefenderfer and Mrs. Warner, were to be admitted as participants in two of the quarters, the shares of Robert and Frank, so as to eventually treat the issue of those four the same.</p>
    <p id="b52-5" data-blocks='[["BL_52.5",52,[228,1122,1151,846]]]'>It must be admitted that the eleventh clause of the will presents some difficulties in construction. This is largely due to the use of the words “after their death, or the death of either of them.” When such ambiguities appear, we are justified in considering the circumstances at the time of the execution of the will so as to give the testatrix’s words the meaning which will most probably conform to her actual intention. It is an established canon for use in interpreting wills which do not unmistakably reveal the maker’s intention that the law will impute to a testator’s words such a meaning as under all the circumstances will conform to his probable intention and be most agreeable to reason and justice: <em>Jackson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/337/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="337 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1197261" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0561-01">337 Pa. 561</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.2d%20338" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="12 A.2d 338">12 A. 2d 338</a>; <em>Prime’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/335/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="335 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1193012" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0218-01">335 Pa. 218</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20530" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 A.2d 530">6 A. 2d 530</a>; <em>McGlathery’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/311/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="311 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1146311" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0351-01">311 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20886" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="166 A. 886">166 A. 886</a>.</p>

Egbert was thirteen, Robert S. Brown was twenty-four, and Frank R. Brown must have been at least that age or more as he died in 1916 leaving a minor son. At the same time, Dr. Diefenderfer had two children, ten and eight years of age, Estelle Warner had three children, fifteen, twelve, <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>and seven. It is significant that some of the remainder-men were older than the two favored life tenants. It would seem clear that testatrix did not intend, as argued by appellees, that the life estate should ali be cut off and the remainders should vest in enjoyment upon the death of any of the life tenants. This would have actually operated to cut short the life estates in 1916 upon the death of Frank R. Brown, and the remainders to the issue of the favored life tenants would have failed because of the lack of any member of that class to take.</p>
    <p id="b53-5" data-blocks='[["BL_53.4",53,[200,840,1151,361]]]'>The fact that some of the remaindermen were about the same age or older than the favored life tenants also indicates that by the phrase, “after their death, or the death of either of them”, testatrix did not intend, as the life tenants argue, to postpone the vesting in enjoyment of all the remainders until either or both of the youngest life tenants had died.</p>

Elizabeth Brown is the first life tenant in the will we are construing and was a sister of this testatrix. The wills were drawn on the same day and on the same plan. We there held that the provision with relation to the disposition of the slate properties did not violate the rule against perpetuities. In construing this provision, we held (p. 115) that it meant that “the estates of the ultimate residuary devisees vest ‘in interest’ either at the death of testatrix or at the end of the life estates created by her; but that such devisees shall not come into enjoyment of the property and securities ... in the sense of actually gaining full possession and control of such property and investments, until the testamentary trustees alienate or sell the slate holdings therein referred to.” In construing the particular clause in question, “after their death, or the death of either of them”, we assumed that “either” was used in the sense of “any”.</p>

      <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>The word “either” is often used loosely in the sense of “any” and upon consideration of the circumstances it seems that the testatrix used it in that sense here. Upon the death of any one of the life tenants, the class composing his or her issue would be determined and at that time the interests of the remaindermen vested. As we construe the will, the group of remainder interests stemming from a particular deceased life tenant also vests in enjoyment upon his decease. The reasonable construction is that testatrix intended the remaindermen to immediately benefit. Of course, as long as the slate properties were undisposed of, the principal could not be paid over to the remaindermen and they would be entitled only to the income. As we expressed it in <em>Brown’s Estate, </em>supra, “such devisees [the remaindermen] shall not come into enjoyment of the property and securities . . . <em>in the sense of actually gaining full possession and control </em>. . . until the testamentary trustees alienate or sell the slate holdings therein referred to.” (Italics supplied.)</p>

Also, see <em>Neafie’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/325/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="325 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1172244" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0561-01">325 Pa. 561</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.%2056" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="191 A. 56">191 A. 56</a>; <em>Elkins’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/325/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="325 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="1172288" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0373-01">325 Pa. 373</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.%20650" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="190 A. 650">190 A. 650</a>. We are assuming, of course, that the life tenants had sufficient knowledge of the facts that their inaction can justly be considered acquiescence: <em>Bard’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/339/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="339 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1201226" data-case-paths="/pa/339/0433-01">339 Pa. 433</a>, 436, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.2d%20711" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="13 A.2d 711">13 A. 2d 711</a>. Proof of this knowledge is here supplied by the facts with reference to the fourth account.</p>

These assignments must be dismissed for the simple reason that the exceptants failed to furnish affirmative evidence to sustain their contention. “Those who seek to surcharge a fiduciary for a <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>breach of trust must bear the burden of proving the particulars of his wrongful conduct”: <em>Bard’s </em>Estate, supra, p. 437.</p>
    <p id="b58-5" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[197,470,1148,748]]]'>The remaining assignments of error deal with commissions and attorney fees. The argument as to commissions is predicated on the success of the appellants in the matters already considered. In view of our decision it is not necessary to give them further consideration except to say that since the stock dividend is sealed in the corpus there can be no commission on it as income. The trustee is entitled to a commission on the cash dividends. As for the attorney fees, this was a matter that rested in the sound discretion of the court below and we see no reason for interfering. In our opinion the fees were reasonable. The court below directed that they be paid out of the principal, the remaindermen have not objected, and the life tenants are only remotely affected.</p>
    <p id="b58-6" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[200,1230,1144,96]]]'>The decree of the court below is affirmed at the costs of the appellant.</p>
