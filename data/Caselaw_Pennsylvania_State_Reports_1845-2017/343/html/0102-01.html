The burglar alarm then sounded and the bandits fled through a rear door with the Currency. The cashier, James Miller, then grabbed a bank gun and went around the building to intercept them. There bandits Fertak and Wozniak exchanged shots with the cashier, both bandits being hit. Relator was then in the woods. A fourth bandit, Lucian, who had been waiting with an automobile then abandoned his confederates. Relator was apprehended several weeks later in Buffalo, N. Y.</p>

The true test of whether one criminal offense has mérged in another is <em>not </em>(as is sometimes stated) whether the two criminal acts are “successive steps in the same transaction” but it is whether one crime <em>necessarily involves </em>another, as, for example, rape involves fornication, and robbery involves both assault and larceny. The “same transaction” test is valid only when “transaction” means a <em>single act. </em>When the “transaction” consists of two or more criminal acts, the fact that the two acts are “successive” does not <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>require the conclusion that they have merged. Two crimes <em>may be </em>successive steps in <em>one </em>crime and therefore merge, as, e. g., larceny is merged in robbery, and assault and battery is merged in murder, or they may be two distinct crimes which do not merge. If a defendant commits a burglary and while in the burglarized dwelling he commits the crimes of rape or kidnapping, his crimes do not merge, for neither of them is necessarily involved in the other. When one of two criminal acts committed successively is not a necessary ingredient of the other, there may be a conviction and sentence for <em>both. </em>In the case before us, any one of the three crimes named might have been committed without any of the others being committed and consequently there was no merger of the crimes.</p>

Secundum, p. 424, sec. 283, it is stated: “The rule that the doctrine of double jeopardy applies only where the two prosecutions are for the same crime must be taken with this qualification, that where one crime is included in, and forms a necessary part of another and is but a different degree of the same offense, and where on a prosecution for the higher crime a con<a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>viction may be had for the lower, then a conviction or an acquittal of the higher will bar a prosecution for the lower, or for any crime of which the lower is an essential ingredient or element.” 22 C.

Secundum, p. 59, sec. 9, says: “The same act or group of acts may constitute two or more distinct offenses, different in kind as well as in degree, and each separate step in a transaction may be made a crime. Under such circumstances the state may elect to prosecute for either offense, or, where separate and distinct offenses are committed, the offender may be indicted for each separately. Whether a single act or series of acts constitutes two or more separate offenses is determined by whether each offense requires proof of facts additional to those involved in the other. Two or more crimes are the result of a single act or transaction when the commission of the act or the execution of the transaction brings each into existence. Separate and different acts of the same nature performed at different times generally constitute separate offenses. . . .
