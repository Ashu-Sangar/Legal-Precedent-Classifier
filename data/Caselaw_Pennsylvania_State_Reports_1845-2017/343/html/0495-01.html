On September 27 defendants obtained a rule to show cause why execution should not be stayed pending hearing on a petition to open the judgment, “all proceedings and executions to be stayed in the meantime.” On October 7 the sale of the mortgaged property was adjourned by the sheriff to October 11. On October 10 the court made an order adjourning the sale to December 2, without the necessity of readvertisement, upon defendants paying to plaintiffs sixty days’ interest on the judgment, amounting to $81.65. The sale was held on the latter date, plaintiffs becoming the purchasers. Defendants filed exceptions to the sale; these were dismissed and the sale was confirmed in an order from which defendants now appeal.</p>

    <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[218,1370,1150,637]]]'>Under the Act of April 16, 1845, P. L. 538, section 2, a sheriff’s sale of real estate can be made only on or before the return day of the writ or within six days thereafter (see <em>Rhodes v. Barnett, </em><a href="/pa/196/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="196 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="916811" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0429-01">196 Pa. 429</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.%20438" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="46 A. 438">46 A. 438</a>); defendants therefore might have had ground to assert that the sale was invalid, because made nearly two months after the return day of the writ on which it was had, were it not for the fact that the order of October 10, if not actually made at their instance, was at least consented to by them and their acquiescence therein manifested — as was stated at bar — by their payment of the $31.65 on which the order was conditioned.</p>
