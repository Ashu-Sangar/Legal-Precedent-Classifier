It further provided that if the right of revocation or amendment thus reserved was exercised by settlor at any time, any of the policies then forming a part of the trust and designated by settlor shall be released from the terms of the deed and shall be assigned to the settlor or his nominee absolutely for such uses and purposes as the settlor might designate. The settlor also provided that any and all payments, dividends, surrender values, disability payments and benefits of any kind which may accrue on account thereof during the lifetime of the settlor shall be payable to him direct, and the settlor shall have the right at any time to use any of the said policies for the purpose of borrowing from the respective insurance companies any sums which he may desire. The Act of June 28, 1923, P. L. 884, provides: That the net amount payable under any policy of life insurance . . . upon the life of any person heretofore or hereafter made for the benefit of or assigned to the <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>wife or children or dependent relative of such person shall be exempt from all claims of the creditors of such person arising out of or based upon any obligation created after the passage of this Act, whether or not the right to change the named beneficiary is reserved by or permitted to such person.’ The first inquiry is whether or not that which Nucom Benin did on April 12, 1929, brings these policies within the provisions of the Act of 1923. That Act exempts from claims of creditors of the assured proceeds of policies ‘made for the benefit of or assigned to the wife or children or dependent relative’ of the assured. The policies, immediately prior to the creation of the deed of trust, were for the benefit of the Executors and Administrators of Nucom Benin. It is true that four of the policies had previously in 1926 been placed in the insurance trust with the Union National Bank as Trustee, and the beneficiary therein had been changed from ‘executors or administrators’ to ‘Union National Bank, Trustee’. But this deed of trust was revoked by the settlor on April 3, 1929, prior to the execution and delivery of the deed presently under discussion. Upon the revocation of the earlier deed, the Union National Bank, Trustee, ceased to have any right or interest in the four policies; and had Nucom Benin died in the interval between the revocation of the earlier deed and the creation of the present one, the proceeds of the policies would have been payable to ‘his executors or administrators’. The fifth insurance policy, namely, that of the Penn Mutual in the amount of f40,000, had been the subject matter of many changes and assignments. Prior to April 12, 1929, it had never, however, been the subject matter of a deed of trust. The last assignee of the policy prior to that date was the Land Title and Trust Company in Philadelphia; and that Company (The Real Estate-Land Title and Trust Company) on April 3, 1929, assigned the policy ‘unto the insured’s Executors, Administrators or Assigns.’ So that had Nucom Benin died between April 8, 1929, and April <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>12th, tlie proceeds of such, policy would have been payable to his Executors or Administrators. On April 12, 1929, therefore, as has hereinbefore been found, the beneficiaries of each of the five policies were the Executors or Administrators or Assigns of the assured. On that day he executed and delivered a deed of trust to the Pennsylvania Company as Trustee, listing the five policies and directing the Trustee to hold the policies and, on maturity, to collect the proceeds and to pay the proceeds over to the Trustees named in the settlor’s will to be held by them under the same uses and purposes as set forth in the settlor’s will. Did that act constitute an assignment of the policies To the wife or children or dependent relative’ of Nucom Kenin? In the opinion of the Auditor, it did not.”</p>
    <p id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[202,1112,1154,1302]]]'>The reasoning of the Auditor is sound and the conclusion he came to must be accepted. All wills are ambulatory and become effective only when the will’s maker dies. Between the date of the will and the maker’s death, fifty days later, it was within the power of Kenin to change the beneficiaries of the insurance policies by changing his will. It was also possible for him to revoke or physically destroy that will, without making another, and so die intestate. In the latter event, the trustee could have collected the proceeds of the policies only for the Administrator of Kenin’s estate. It follows that what Kenin did on April 12, 1929, in respect to his insurance policies did not bring “the net amounts payable under those policies within the exemption against the claims of creditors and in favor of the wife or children or dependent relative of” the insured provided for in the Act of June 28,1923, P. L. 884. The Auditor pertinently points out that “the only duty which the Trustee named in the deed of April 12th had was to collect the proceeds of the insurance policies and pay them over “to the Trustees named in the last will and testament of the settlor”. The administration qf the fund thereafter was to be by the testamentary Trustees — unascertainable until his death — and not by the Trustee named in the deed.</p>

      <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>The Auditor correctly held that the principles enunciated by this court in <em>Myers’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/309/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="309 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="1141528" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0581-01">309 Pa. 581</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.%20611" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="164 A. 611">164 A. 611</a>, are determinative of the first question raised in this case. In that case the question was whether the state could collect an inheritance tax on the proceeds of certain life insurance policies in the face of the exemption provided for in the Act of March 28, 1929, P. L. 118, amending the Transfer Inheritance Tax Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521, and which provides as follows: “The proceeds of policies of life insurance payable otherwise than to the estate of the insured, and whether paid directly by the insured to beneficiaries designated in the policies or to a trustee designated therein and held, managed and distributed by such trustee to or for the benefit of such persons or classes of persons under such plan and in such estates as may have been prescribed by the insured under agreement with such trustee shall not be included in imposing any tax under this section” (i. e., subsection (d)). The facts in that case were that Max Myers, the insured, executed on September 16, 1930, a trust agreement whose subject was six insurance policies on his life, totaling $22,021.21. He made his will on the same day, and died six days later. The deed of trust on the policies named no beneficiaries of the trust but provided that the principal should be distributed in accordance with the terms of the settlor’s will, and reserved to the settlor the right to revoke or alter the trust, to withdraw property from it and add to it, and to receive all dividends and other cash distributions on account of the policies named in the trust. This court, in an opinion by the present Chief Justice, said: “The settlor retained complete title and control. No other interest than his, vested or contingent, arose until his death. . . . The deed named no beneficiaries. ...”</p>
    <p id="b584-4" data-blocks='[["BL_584.4",584,[219,2141,1152,201]],["BL_585.1",585,[207,302,1158,1796]]]'>The appellant trustee contends that the Myers case is distinguishable factually from the instant case in that it involved only the right to levy a transfer inheritance tax. This factual distinction between the two cases does <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>not make the principles laid down in the Myers case inapplicable here. In both the Act of 1923 (supra) and the Act of 1929 (supra) for the purpose is to exempt the proceeds of life insurance policies made for the benefit of certain designated persons and not payable to the estate of the insured from (in the one case) “all claims of the creditors of such person” and from (in the other case) the Transfer Inheritance Tax of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521. This court’s decision in the Myers case is that “the designation of the actual beneficiaries who are to receive the proceeds of the policies <em>must be made in the lifetime of the insured and in the trust instrument </em>in order to bring the transaction within the terms of the Act of 1929. . . . <em>Only where the trust instrument is complete in itself </em>by naming the beneficiaries of the proceeds of the policies is the fund realized from the policies free of tax” (italics suplied). The Myers case holds that when a settlor of a trust shows by the trust agreement that he intends to control <em>by his will </em>the disposition of the proceeds of his life insurance policies, those proceeds must be treated for transfer tax purposes as though they were made payable to his estate. No insured person can exercise <em>post-mortem control </em>over the proceeds of his life insurance policies and still keep those proceeds within the exemption provided for in the above cited Transfer Inheritance Tax Act of 1929. The same reasoning leads to the decision that no insured person can exercise <em>post-mortem control </em>over the proceeds of his life insurance policies and still keep those proceeds -within the exemption provided for in the above cited insurance proceeds exemption Act of 1923. In neither case can the statutory exemption and testamentary control of the thing exempted coexist.</p>

Section 56 of the Restatement declares: “Where the owner of property purports to create a trust inter vivos but no interest passes to the beneficiary be<a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>fore the death of the settlor, the intended trust is a testamentary trust and is invalid unless the requirements of the statutes relating to the validity of wills are complied with.” Under comment (e) is the following: “If the owner of property transfers it to another person in trust for such person as the transferor may designate by an act which is testamentary, the intended trust is testamentary . . .”. Comment (c) to Section 26 of the Restatement of the Law of Trusts, p. 81, reads as follows: “. . . If the owner of property transfers it to another in trust for such person as he may designate thereafter, no trust arises unless and until he designates the beneficiary”. In the instant case the “owner of property” did not designate the beneficiaries of his insurance policies trust until his will spoke at the instant of his death and it was then too late to exclude his creditors from making successful claims against these assets.</p>

This proposition has often received judicial recognition when no rights of creditors were affected by such recognition. In the instant case Kenin had the right to direct by will how the proceeds of his insurance policies held in trust should be distributed provided that before his will became effective by his death no rights of creditors attached to his property right in those insurance policies.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Such false pretences support the inference of actual intent” to defraud. We also found that when the insured changed the beneficiaries in the policies in question totaling $255,-456.19 from his estate to his trustee for the benefit of his wife and three children, he “could not, with reason, have considered that he had not provided adequate insurance for his wife and children, because they were then, under the trust agreement, the beneficiaries of insurance greatly in excess of $500,000 and his own affairs were in very precarious condition.

Instead of doing its duty as prescribed in the deed of trust, the trustee invested these proceeds and distributed the income of the investment to the residuary beneficiaries under the will. Prudence required that it file its account as trustee un<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>der the deed of trust and ask the court to award the fund. It was nearly six years before it filed an account. The Auditor concluded that “interest on the fund at the legal rate of 6% from the date the trustee breached the provision of the trust by investing a part of the fund, to wit, August 3, 1929 . . . down to the date of the filing of the Trustee’s account, to wit, January 30, 1935, should be added to the principal fund to be- paid over” by this Trustee. The Auditor later refused to accept the view of the exceptant to his report that the Trustee pay interest after the date of filing its report as well as for the period preceding the report’s filing. The court in banc, after considering exceptions to the Auditor’s report held that the Auditor properly ruled that all investments should be replaced with cash and then said: “We agree with the exceptant creditor that interest should be charged for the improper withholding of this fund. Equitably we feel that the accountant should have a reasonable time within which to prepare its account, file the same, and have it audited. One year, in our opinion, would have afforded ample opportunity for this purpose. We therefore direct that interest at the rate of 6% shall be charged upon the amount which the accountant collected, beginning one year from such period until actual payment of the award. There would seem to be no legal justification for the trustee to deviate from the clear terms of the trust, and it must therefore pay interest as damages for detention: 33 C. J. 178; <em>McCornack v.

It fixed the rate at 4% (the legal rate of interest in New Jersey is 6%). In Vice-Chancellor Stevenson's opinion appears the following: “The questions relating to the charge and allowance of interest in this case are difficult. It is well said in 16 Am. &amp; Eng.

I do not think that there is any case in New Jersey which controls any of the points relating to interest, to be adjudicated in this case. ... It should be borne in mind that the whole tendency of courts of law and courts of equity for a considerable period of time has been to break away from hard and fast rules and charge and allow interest in accordance with principles of equity, in order to accomplish justice in each particular case. ... I do not think that it would be just to compel the City of Paterson to pay 6 percent interest when it has been able at all times to borrow at 4 per cent. Nor do I think that the claimants are entitled to greater interest than that which is charged against the city. . . . It is notorious that money has been worth only 4 or 5 per cent in the way of interest.”</p>

The Lord Chancellor (Lord Cairns) in announcing the decision said: “Any claim, in the nature of a claim for interest after the day up to which interest was stipulated for, would be a claim really not for a stipulated sum and interest but for damages, and then it would be for the tribunal before which that claim was asserted to consider the position of the claimant, and the sum which properly and under all the circumstances should be awarded for damages.” Lord <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>Hatherly, concurring, said that the case had been well put “by my noble and learned friend on the woolsack; namely, to treat the case ... as a claim to damages in consequence of the default of payment, and ... to allow interest at the rate of four per cent”.</p>

We do not regard $5,000 a proper counsel fee for supervising the collection of approximately $100,000 cash, and for preparing an account and attending the audit. $1,000 is more than ample compensation for such a service.

This court in <em>Elliott’s Executors </em>distinctly declared, however, that that case was “not meant to extend to policies effected without fraud directly and on their face for the benefit of the wife, and payable to her; such policies are not fraudulent as to creditors, and are not touched by this decision”. The Act of 1923 as to the proceeds of policies of life insurance “made for the benefit of or assigned to the wife or children or dependent relative of such [insured] person” is in harmony with the last-quoted excerpt from <em>Elliott’s Executors.</em>
