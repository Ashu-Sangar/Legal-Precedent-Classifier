Her death required that an account be filed; there is evidence that within a year or a year and a half after her death a final account was prepared but that counsel for the children “thought it should be deferred, pending liquidation of the mortgage investments.” The exceptions to the account raised a number of surcharge questions which appear to have been very carefully considered by the learned auditing judge; in several minor respects the accountant was ordered to substitute cash for items in the account.

If, for example, after providing for his wife and children in the first sentence, he had concluded his will by appointing the executors, the measure of their duty to convert nonlegals would have been that fixed by the law applicable in such circumstances.

She was an active party to the retention of the trust company and national bank stocks and to their merger, and to the subsequent increase in the trust investment in the merged company and, while participating in such acts, she was doing what she was authorized to do by her husband’s will. There is no evidence of want of care in looking after these investments; as the executors had authority to retain investments, the burden of proof Avas on appellants <em>(Clabby’s Estate, </em>supra, at p. 314). The trust company closed with the bank holiday of March, 1933. The last sale of its stock given in the record, is that referred to in the quotation from the learned judge’s opinion, at which time the stock, par 20, was selling at 90.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> There is no evidence to support a finding of want of care with respect to this stock after that date, and as there has been no market for it since the bank holiday, the record shows nothing that the accountant could have done to save the investment; in such circumstances there can be no surcharge: <em>Quinn’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/342/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="342 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1206936" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0509-01">342 Pa. 509</a>.

The trust company did not act alone in dealing Avith this invest<a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>ment; both executors joined in what was done and both must bear the responsibility. Mrs. Greenawalt was doubtless glad to receive the large dividends paid; the last price, 90, in 1931, for shares of 20 par, was at a higher rate than any prior sale given in the record. But the controlling fact now is that the loss resulted from the nationwide depression which closed the bank and not from the considerations generally and properly condemning investment by an accountant in its own stock.</p>

This stock, Avhich has been held in the estate for forty years, has long since become valueless, although there were times during that period in which it could have been sold for as much as $350 per share. Aside from the duty on the part of the trustee to convert the stock within a reasonable time, it is clear that it had no right to hold stock of its own company among the assets of the estate. In Scott on Trusts, volume 2, pp. 883, 884, section 170.15, it is said: “Where the trustee is a corporation, the question arises whether it is proper for it to hold in trust shares of the corporation itself. The question is whether it is a breach of trust to invest trust funds in the purchase of such shares, or to retain such shares where they were owned by the settlor and were received by the trustee as part of the original trust estate. . . . The question is Avhether there is such a divided loyalty, such a conflict of personal interest and interest as trustee, that it is improper to make such an investment or to retain it. A trust company or bank is, of course, subject to liability if it is negligent in making or retaining an investment in its own shares. . . . The question of the duty of the trustee Avith respect to the holding in trust of its own shares, however, goes beyond the question of negligence. The trustee, particularly in times of stress, cannot take an entirely disinterested attitude on the question whether it should sell or retain the shares. It has an interest in the maintenance of the market value of its shares, and is therefore subject to a temptation to retain the shares which it holds in trust, although it <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>may be to the interest of tbe beneficiaries that the shares should be sold. The trustee ought not to put itself in a situation where its own interests may conflict with those of the beneficiaries. For this reason it seems clear that it is improper for a corporate trustee to make an investment in the purchase of its own shares, even though the purchase is not made from itself, and that it is improper for the trustee to retain such shares although it received them as original investments, unless it is authorized to do so by the terms of the trust or by statute.” The wisdom of these principles is well illustrated in the present case, because, not only was there a sharp reduction in the value of the Commonwealth Trust Company stock in 1927 owing to an extensive defalcation by one of the company’s employees, but there then followed a more or less steady decline in the price of the stock until, from 1933 on, it lost all value whatever. Nevertheless the trust company never sold it, thus, whether deliberately or otherwise, serving its own interest instead of the interest of the estate of which it was a trustee. Whatever construction may be put upon the will as to investments in general, it certainly did not contemplate or authorize the retention of a stock which the trustee, according to all accepted principles of equity and morals, could not properly hold in that capacity.</p>
    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[211,1657,1154,417]]]'>The Western Union Telegraph Company stock also was acquired by the executors from the estate of the testator’s brother. It was inventoried at $75 per share, and after the death of the widow, at which time the trust according to the terms of the will came to an end, it could have been sold at the same price. It is stated by appellants that it now has a value of about one-third that amount.</p>

The system pursued by the company was to purchase mortgages Avith its own funds and on its own account; at later periods participating interests Avere sold to in<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>dividual investors and to estates of which, it was a trustee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> In other words, the company, after holding these mortgages as absolute owner in its commercial department, sold participations therein to itself as trustee of this and other estates. It is true that where mortgages are originally acquired by a trust company as investments for trust funds, and the allotments of interests therein are promptly made to its trust estates, the transaction will be regarded from the standpoint of substance rather than form and therefore as if the purchase of the mortgages, or the rights therein, had been made with the funds of the trust estates in the first instance (see <em>Guthrie’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/320/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="320 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="1163656" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0530-01">320 Pa. 530</a>, 532, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20248" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="182 A. 248">182 A. 248</a>, 249, 250). In the present case, however, the original purchases were made by the trust company for resale at any time thereafter either to individual investors (with the company’s guaranty), trust estates, or both, and in several instances participating interests were not allotted or sold by the trust company to the Greenawalt estate <em>until two, three, four, seven, or even eight years </em>after the trust company had originally purchased them.
