He averred that he delivered to John D. Johnston, one of the defendants, the sum of $25,000 to be paid in purchase of a certain house and lot and directed that title be taken in the name of defendant Johnston and his wife as tenants by the entireties; that, following the purchase, the plaintiff and the defendants entered into joint occupancy of the property and so remained until sometime in 1930, when he moved out; that the defendants furnished no part of the consideration and, without his knowledge, in 1933, encumbered the property with two mortgages aggregating $5,500. Defendants answered, denying that plaintiff furnished the consideration and averring that, on the contrary, the plaintiff loaned to John D. Johnston <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>the sum of $25,000 to enable the defendants to purchase the property for themselves. After replication, the case was heard; the facts were found in accord with plaintiff’s contention; argument was heard by the court in banc on defendants’ exceptions which were dismissed and the final decree entered. Hughes, J., dissented, though agreeing with the majority that the chancellor’s findings of fact supported the decree; his difference with the majority appears in this sentence: “In reviewing the facts, I am drawn to the conclusion that the weight of the evidence would be contrary to' the findings of the Trial Judge.” That statement squarely presents the point now for review on defendants’ appeal.</p>

Finfrock, </em><a href="/pa/340/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="340 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1203321" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0458-01">340 Pa. 458</a>, 464, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20348" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="17 A.2d 348">17 A. 2d 348</a>. They are supported by evidence Avhich it is unnecessary now to recite at length. It is sufficient to say that there were close business and personal relations between the plaintiff and Mr. Johnston; plaintiff was a stockbroker and had employed Johnston from 1922 to 1930. Plaintiff took over a margin account of Johnston’s at a time when the debt was much in excess of the collateral; when the account was closed, there was still owing to the plaintiff about $20,000; this indebtedness is referred to in the 31st finding of fact quoted later in this opinion. He also made gifts to Johnston. Defendants, in 1930, lived in a comparatively small apartment and desired a house. Plaintiff Avas living Avith an aged relative and wished to change. Their conversations reached a stage in which the plaintiff directed defendants to find a house. They found one Avith respect to which Mrs. Johnston telegraphed to plaintiff as follows: “Have found the home. Price high. Would you come and look it over? Would make ideal home for all of us, kitties too.” Plaintiff approved the purchase, advanced to Johnston $5,000 as a <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>down payment on March 21, 1930, and the balance of $20,000 on April 3, 1930; this money was used by the defendants to pay for the house. Repairs and improvements amounting to over $400, and $456.64 insurance premiums for 3 years’ fire insurance, were paid by plaintiff. By conveyance through a straw man, the title is now held in Mrs. Johnston’s name.</p>

Purman was frequently there and on several occasions, designated as ten to twelve, he stayed there over night and occupied the ‘guest room’, in which room a telephone had been placed at the instance of Thomas R. Purman, listed in his name, having a communication wire separate from that of the house. This telephone remained in the house at least until September 1,1930.
