Heaney, plaintiff, gave his bond to Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, Trustee, in the principal sum of $15,000, payable at the expiration of five years, secured by a mortgage on premises 219 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, of which he was then the owner. In 1919 he conveyed the premises to The Riddle Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, under and subject to the mortgage. In 1928 The Riddle Company filed in the <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County a petition for dissolution, giving notice of the application by advertisement in two Philadelphia newspapers.

Riddle, and sworn to by the secretary, Tracey, and contained the statement that “The said The Riddle Company has no debts or liabilities whatsoever.” The four directors of the company, Riddle, Tracey, William H.

The premises were sold at sheriff’s sale for $7,000, of which $5,329.21 was credited on account of the judgment, the difference consisting of payments for back taxes and water rents and the costs of the judgment and execution. Plaintiff being thereupon compelled to pay to the mortgagee in satisfaction of the judgment the sum of $12,059.85, which included certain additional interest and costs, he brought this suit against defendants individually and as liquidating trustees of The Riddle Company to recover that amount with interest. An affidavit of defense containing New Matter was filed. Defendants did not deny therein that the corporate assets they had distributed to themselves were amply sufficient to take care of plaintiff’s claim. Plaintiff filed a reply to the New Matter raising questions of law, and also took a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The court sustained plaintiff’s reply and made <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>tlxe rule absolute.'

At the same time, therefore, when The Riddle Company dissolved, there was outstanding against it a potential or contingent liability on this obligation of indemnity, and the statement in the petition for dissolution that the company had “no debts or liabilities whatsoever” was not in accord with the fact.

The assets of a dissolved corporation constitute a trust fund for creditors and stockholders (16 Fletcher, Cycl. Corp. 1081, §8217), and when defendants, as liquidating trustees, distributed the assets among themselves as stockholders they made themselves personally liable, by reason of such breach of their trust, to a creditor whose right to priority could not be thus destroyed.</p>

      <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>Defendants would have been protected had they followed the statutory law then applicable. The Act of April 9,1856, P. L. 293, provided the method for dissolving corporations. The petition for that purpose was to be presented to the Court of Common Pleas, which, if satisfied that the prayer might be granted without prejudice to the public welfare or the interests of the corporators, might enter a decree of dissolution. But there was a proviso <em>“that the accounts of the managers, directors, or trustees of any dissolved company shall he settled in such court and he approved thereby; </em>and dividends of the effects shall be made among any corporators entitled thereto, as in the case of the accounts of assignees and trustees.” If a corporation had no outstanding debts or liabilities there would be no need to file an account, but where claims of creditors existed an account would obviously be necessary so as to afford such creditors the opportunity to prove their claims and establish their right to share in the distribution of the assets; therefore the act provided for the settling in court of the accounts of the directors or trustees and required the approval of the court. Unfortunately, defendants ignored the statute and never filed an account, so that plaintiff was precluded from presenting his claim at an audit and obtaining protective relief against the event which ultimately happened when he was obliged to pay. the deficiency due on his bond. Fiduciaries who distribute funds in their hands without an accounting and an audit of their accounts do so at their own risk, and when they assume that risk they must be held responsible for payments made without the approval of the court which turn out to have been improper: <em>White’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/322/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="322 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1167918" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0085-01">322 Pa. 85</a>, 90, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20589" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="185 A. 589">185 A. 589</a>, 591; <em>Free’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/327/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="327 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1176735" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0362-01">327 Pa. 362</a>, 368, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.%20492" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="194 A. 492">194 A. 492</a>, 495; <em>Estate of J.

While they may not have been advised as to the principle of law which gave rise to an obligation on their part, they were conversant with the facts, because they knew of the existence of the mortgage and of the deed by which they had taken title under and subject.to it; at the very time when the dissolution proceedings were pending the company conveyed the property to Tracey under and subject to the mortgage, and it had paid the interest on the mortgage until that time. “Although no actual fraud is alleged here, the result is the same, since the distribution of a corporation’s assets, leaving it incapable of discharging its debts, is fraudulent in the eyes of the law”: <em>Bankers Trust Co. v.

Nor does it come with good grace from defendants to assert that by publishing notice of the petition for dissolution they had done all that was required under the Act of April 4,1872, P. L. 40, supplementing the Act of 1856, and that plaintiff should have opposed the granting, of the petition. While plaintiff had such notice, he was not bound to appear and object to the proposed dissolution; his only interest was to obtain protection of his potential claim, and he had a right to presume that, in accordance with the statutory requirement, defendants would file an account, upon receiving proper notice of which he might appear at the audit and present his claim in accordance with the ordinary practice governing such proceedings. It will be noted that the Act of 1856 provided for the settling of accounts of directors or trustees of a <em>dissolved </em>company, thus, apparently, not requiring that the dissolution wait upon the distribution of the assets according to law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In the absence of an accounting by defendants and notice thereof, plaintiff was not in default.
