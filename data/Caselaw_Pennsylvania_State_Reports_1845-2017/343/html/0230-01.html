Leo Brown, as administrator, on August 19,1940, filed a petition for a citation, directed to the Monaca Federal Savings and Loan Association and two of his brothers, Albert E. Brown and Robert R. Brown, appellees, for a rule to show cause why two investment share certificates and a savings share book or certificate, issued to “Sarah Brown, in case of death to Robert Brown and Albert <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>Brown, only” and representing accounts, aggregating $14,046.09, with the Monaca Federal Savings and Loan Association, formerly the Phillipsburg Building and Loan Association, should not be turned over to him or, in the event that the certificates could not be delivered, to show cause why their value at decedent’s death, with interest and dividends, should not be paid to him as administrator. In addition to the securities, appellant also sought to recover, for the estate, a Dodge sedan automobile, now in possession of Albert E. Brown, the certificate of title to which was in decedent’s name at the time of her death.</p>

Subsequent to the issuance of the new shares and up until her death, all dividends were paid to decedent, as before, and from time to time during this period she made withdrawals which, as the court below found, totalled $1,500. The securities and certificates of title- to the automobile were found, after decedent’s death, in the box where she kept her valuable papers, by the son Albert, who had obtained possession of the key to the box about six weeks before decedent’s death, from a granddaughter to whom decedent gave the key, before leaving for a hospital in- Cleveland, Ohio, <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>where she underwent an operation and remained until shortly before her death, with instructions to give the key to him. In the interim between decedent’s death and the grant of letters to appellant, the Association canceled the old certificates, upon their presentation to it by Robert R. Brown, and, after deducting inheritance tax payments, opened two new savings share accounts, one for Albert E. Brown and one for Robert R. Brown, in the sum of $6,995.79 each.</p>

Brown and Robert R. Brown, by virtue of the terms of the endorsements thereon. After hearing and argument before the court en banc, at which time appellees questioned the jurisdiction of the orphans’ court to grant the relief prayed for, the court below held that it did have jurisdiction, but discharged the rule, holding, as to the securities, that “the writing on the certificates and book was not testamentary; nor did it create a trust; but evidenced a gift inter vivos, reserving to the donor the income, with a possible right of consumption of the principal, but whatever was left at the time of her death belonged to the two boys”, and as to the automobile, that under the' evidence title to it had passed to Albert E.

But surely they could not cite the debtor and enter a decree or judgment against him.

Guided by these principles, we conclude that the orphans’ court had jurisdiction to entertain the petition with respect to appellees Albert E. Brown and Robert R.

On this appeal, appellees take the position that “it is more right to say that the right of the two sons is fixed as third party beneficiaries to a contract between the decedent and the Association, than it is to test the transaction on the theory of a gift of personal property”, or that “what was given by these instruments was an estate in remainder to the two sons, just as much so as if the mother had drawn a deed to real estate in their favor”, or that “in effect the Association was a trustee under an express trust, and obliged to pay the residue to the two sons”, relying largely upon <em>Smith’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/141/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="141 Pa.

All that the evidence shows is that the decedent, just prior to leaving for the hospital, handed the key to a third party with instructions to give it to the son, without any words of explanation whatever as to her purpose in so doing. It does not appear that decedent was aware of the imminency of death at the time and, under the circumstances, it is almost inconceivable that she could have intended by this mere direction to strip herself of practically all of her available property. It may be, and probably was, decedent’s intention to bestow mere custody of the key upon the son, during her absence at the hospital, and this possibility not being negatived by the evidence, no constructive or symbolical delivery has been sufficiently shown. See <em>Elliott’s Estate, </em>supra, 500. Moreover, even if a delivery, actual or constructive, of the securities had been shown, this would not, of itself, have been sufficient to make a completed gift of the funds, under the circumstances of this case, since possession by the sons would be entirely consistent with the form of the endorsements, under which no part of the funds could be withdrawn by them, or either of them, until after the decedent’s death. See <em>Jones v. Crisp, </em>supra, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20A.%20515" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="71 A. 515">71 A. 515</a>, 517.</p>

Brown to obtain a certificate of title, issued in his own name, would subject him to the penalty imposed by section 201 of the Vehicle Code of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, but such omission would not, of itself, defeat an otherwise valid gift to him of the Dodge sedan automobile by the mother, during her lifetime. See <em>Braham &amp; Co. v.

However, we are of opinion that the evidence relied upon by the son, in support of his averment of a gift inter vivos of the automobile, is insufficient to overcome the presumption of ownership in the decedent, arising by reason <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>of the taking of title in her name and her retention of possession thereof, among her valuable papers, down to the time of her death. The evidence of statements by decedent of an intention to make a gift to the son at some future time is clearly insufficient, as is also the evidence that she executed the assignment on the back of the certificate of title, apparently in blank, in the absence of an unequivocal delivery to him of the certificate, during her lifetime. “To make a valid gift there must have been not only an intention to make it but to do so at the time and not in the future, and it must be accompanied by an actual or constructive delivery to the donee by which the donor released all dominion over the property, and invested the donee with full title to and control over the same. Without a complete delivery there can be no valid gift inter vivos, though every step be taken that is essential to the validity of the gift; if there is no delivery the gift must fail. Intention cannot supply it; words cannot supply it; actions cannot supply it; it is an indispensable requisite without which the gift fails, regardless of consequences, and the test of delivery is the change of property, the immediate right to the entire dominion over the subject of the gift, a perfect title which is as good against the donor as anyone else”: <em>Hafer v.

That the son was permitted to possess and use the automobile for his own purposes is likewise of no significance as showing an executed gift inter vivos, particularly since he lived with, and was supported by the decedent, up to the time of her death. “The mere possession of the property is not sufficient evidence of a gift, for this may be consistent with a mere custody or agency. The evidence must show that the donor intended to divest himself of the property, and should be inconsistent with any other purpose”: <em>Reading Trust Co. v.
