Roehm, obtained judgment in the sum of $5,878.73 against John B. Stetson, Jr., in Montgomery County. A transcript of the judgment was duly filed in Philadelphia County on July 12,1940, and on the same date plaintiff caused a writ of attachment sur judgment to issue, in which John B. Stetson Company, a corporation, was named as garnishee. Interrogatories were filed and served upon the garnishee to which it filed answers, admitting certain matters but denying liability. A rule was thereupon entered by plaintiff for judgment against the garnishee <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>on the answers, which rule was discharged by the court below, and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[229,382,1153,372]]]'>The appeal will have to be quashed. The order of the court below discharging the rule for judgment against the garnishee on its answers to the interrogatories is a purely interlocutory order from which an independent appeal will not lie.
