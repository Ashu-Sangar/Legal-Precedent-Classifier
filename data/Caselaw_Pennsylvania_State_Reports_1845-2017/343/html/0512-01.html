    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[257,515,1153,1238]]]'>The controversy grows out of a contract between the parties for the building of 1,000 houses. While the Construction Company was the general contractor, the matter in dispute concerns only that part of the undertaking covering the painting of the interior of the houses. As to this, the contract says: “Paint for Interior Concrete and Interior Masonry Surfaces: (a) Cement-water Paint shall be a hydraulic base paint, delivered in powder form, ready for use, with the addition of water only. The powder shall consist of not less than <em>85% </em>Portland cement, hydrated lime, hygroscopic salt, a small amount of water repellant metallic soap and small amounts of other agents or chemicals to impart workability. Small percentage of titanium oxide may be included. Limeproof pigment colors shall be added at the factory to provide the desired color tone, but the amount of color used shall not be in excess of 4 percent by weight. The paint shall be suitable for brush application to clean unpainted porous surfaces (such as concrete or masonry) and when applied shall flow evenly and cover solidly. When hardened and cured, the paint shall form a dampproof film that will not powder, chip or rub off, and may be washed repeatedly without damage to the surface film.”</p>

It then proceeds: “By submitting a bid the bidder agrees that he has examined the site and the specification and drawings and, where the specification requires in any part of the work a given result to be produced, that the specification and drawings are adequate and the required result can be produced under the specification and drawings. No claim for any extra <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>work will be allowed because of alleged impossibilities in the production of the results specified or because of inadequate or improper plans and specifications and wherever a result is required, the successful bidder shall furnish any and all extras and make any changes needed to produce, to the satisfaction of the Local Authority, the required result.”</p>
    <p id="b543-4" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[184,671,1153,479]]]'>After some of the surfaces had been painted with the designated kind of paint, it was found that it powdered, chipped and rubbed off. Both sides concur that this could not be prevented, if cement water paint was used, due to the fact that the walls were not porous but smooth. When this situation developed, oil paint was used instead of cement water paint and it ivas agreed that the question of liability should be submitted to arbitration under the general arbitration clause of the contract.</p>
    <p id="b543-5" data-blocks='[["BL_543.5",543,[188,1163,1158,914]]]'>There can be no question that under the language of the contract, as a matter of law, the contractor should not be permitted to maintain a claim against the Authority for the extra cost the contractor was put to by the necessity of using another kind of paint than that mentioned in the specifications. The contractor covenanted that the specifications were adequate, that the result required by them could be produced, that no claim for any extra cost would be allowed because of impossibilities in the production of the result or because of inadequate specifications and that wherever a result was required, it should furnish any and all extras and make any changes needed to produce to the satisfaction of the Authority the required result. Had claim been made for the extra cost by the contractor in the ordinary way by suit in assumpsit, the court would have been required to give binding instructions against it.</p>

    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[239,406,1153,1228]]]'>What part does section 16 of the Act of 1927, 5 PS §176, play in reaching a, decision as to whether the arbitration was under the Act? That section reads: “State and Municipal Contracts. — The provisions of this act shall apply to any written contract to which the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or any agency or subdivision thereof, or any municipal corporation or political division of the Commonwealth shall be a party.” By the 10th section of the Housing Authorities Law (Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 955, 35 PS §1550) the Authority is declared to be an agency of the Commonwealth. With this legislative declaration in view, it is impossible to conclude that the law-making body did not intend that all arbitrations provided for in contracts with the Commonwealth or its agencies should be under the act. It is argued by counsel for the contractor that all that section 16 does is to extend the machinery of the act to state and municipal bodies which desire to make use of that machinery. In this connection, it is suggested there was doubt whether government officials would be justified in using arbitration in connection with public contracts and that section 16 was inserted in the act to settle that doubt.</p>

L. 715, 5 PS §1 et seq., and it is suggested that section 16 of the Act of 1927 is but confirmatory of this provision. The two enactments differ entirely in language and in scope and we are unable to accept the suggestion. Section 16 is mandatory and applies the provisions of the act of which it is a part to any written contract to which <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>the Commonwealth or any agency thereof is a party.

The action was tried in court. It was based upon a finding of the Director of Public Works'of the City, whose decision under the contract “on any questions arising in connection with the performance of the contract shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties.” This presents a different situation from a contract provision to arbitrate. Provisions in contracts which give engineers or architects or heads of municipal or state departments power to decide questions are not arbitration provisions in the sense that the Arbitration Act provides. Boards of arbitration under that act are judicial bodies. Individuals given the right to decide in their own favor or in favor of the person who employs them cannot be said to he exercising a judicial function at all. They exercise a power given them by the contract to decide, not to judicially hear and determine.</p>
