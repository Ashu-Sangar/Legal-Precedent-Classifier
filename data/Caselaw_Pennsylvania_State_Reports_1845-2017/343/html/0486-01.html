The suit was brought November 10, 1938, and is governed by the sci. fa. acts in effect at that time and not by the Buies of Civil Procedure (2251 to 2275), effective September 4, 1939. The plaintiff sued Sylak. <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>Sylak brought in Openhart, as additional defendant, on averments that plaintiffs injury was caused by the negligence of Openhart or by the joint negligence of Sylak and Openhart. He then amended his writ by eliminating the charge of joint negligence. The jury found for plaintiff against Sylak, original defendant, and in favor of Openhart, added defendant. The learned trial judge granted defendant Sylak’s motion for a new trial and certified that he did so because he thought he erred in his instruction to the jury that it could not render a joint verdict against the defendants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The car was moving at about 15 miles an hour in second gear up hill on a straight country road, surfaced 16 feet wide, with a narrow berm on each side, when defendant Sylak’s car was seen approaching from the opposite direction. The evidence on behalf of the plaintiff is that Openhart moved to the right as far as possible, perhaps as much as three feet from the center of the road, and that no part of plaintiff’s body was projecting beyond the fenders and running board of Openhart’s car. The ears sideswiped and the plaintiff was seriously injured. If the evidence on behalf of the defendant Sylak had been believed, the jury might have found that Sylak’s car remained on its own half of the road and did <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>not get over on Openhart’s side; but as the verdict was against Sylak, it must be treated, for tbe purpose of this review, as a rejection of Sylak’s evidence and the adoption of the case made by the plaintiff.</p>

In considering this point, it is necessary to keep in mind that plaintiff’s contributory negligence made it impossible for him to recover on a verdict against Openhart. It must also be remembered that plaintiff is not complaining of the instruction; the question is, Can the defendant complain of it on the present record? Sylak’s praecipe for the sci. fa. was his statement of claim<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> against Openhart; <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>it contained, no averments of the transaction resulting in plaintiff’s injury but pleaded conclusions of law with respect to the transaction set forth in plaintiff’s statement of claim. When Sylak amended his praecipe by eliminating the averment of join liability, the issue between him and Openhart was whether Openhart alone was liable; it would of course have been a defense to plaintiff’s suit against Sylak that somebody else caused the damage and, on proof of it, Sylak would have been entitled to a verdict. If he had not amended and had proved his joint liability averment the jury would have had the power to determine in the same verdict that Openhart was liable to contribute to Sylak.

If, for reasons which he considered sufficient, he eliminated the averment of joint liability, there remained no issue between him and Openhart. While the case is to be determined under the statutes in effect prior to the adoption of the new Rules, it may be noted that even under the Rules, which are more specific than the statutes were, we have held that if a defendant avers the sole liability of an added defendant and the plaintiff does not file a supplementary statement against the added defendant as permitted by Rule 2258, the court may dismiss the added defendant because no issue between him and the defendant remains to be tried: <em>Davidson v.

In that case, it appeared that a defendant had been added on averment of sole liability but that the jury found the defendants jointly liable to the plaintiff. This was sustained as within the sci. fa. acts as amended June 22, 1931, P. L. 663, 12 PS section 141, providing, inter alia, “Where it shall appear that an added defendant is liable to the plaintiff, either alone or jointly with any other defendant, the plaintiff may have verdict and judgment or other relief against such additional defendant to the same extent as if such defendant had been duly summoned by the plaintiff and the statement of claim had been amended to include such defendant, and as if he had replied thereto denying all liability.” The evidence brought the <em>plaintiff </em>into the same relationship with the additional defendant as a party on the issue of joint liability, as if he, the plaintiff, had in the first instance brought him in and had averred it. This case therefore does not help defendant appellee as the plaintiff does not ask for, and in law could not have had, the benefit of a verdict against the added defendant. But apart from the statute, .the same result would have been reached in <em>Majewslci v. LempJca </em>on a review of the record on appeal, because it is well settled that after a case has been tried on the merits to a responsive verdict without objection that an issue submitted is not included in the pleadings, the case will be reviewed as if the pleadings had been amended to conform with the trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The learned trial judge, over defendant’s objection, allowed plaintiff to read in evidence, as an admission by defendant, the praecipe originally filed by defendant to bring in Openhart as additional defendant on the averment of joint liability; to meet the effect of this, Sylak was allowed to read his amended praecipe charging the additional defendant Avith sole liability. The relevant words of the writ Avere, “And Avhereas the defendant in said suit alleges that John Openhart . . . is alone liable over to said plaintiff, or is jointly liable with said defendant, for the cause of action declared on in said suit, for the whole, or a stated part, of any amount which may be recovered therein against said defendant, by reason of the fact that he, the said John Openhart, carelessly, recklessly and negligently operated a certain Ford Sedan automobile resulting in the damage alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff, . . .” The praecipe stated: “It is therefore alleged that all of the damage claimed by the plaintiff was caused by and through the carelessness, negligence and recklessness of the said John Openhart as herein set forth or by the joint negligence of the said John Openhart and the defendant, Charles Sylak.”</p>
