Horne obtained a written option, dated April 25, 1935, to purchase a tract of land owned by John Kukurin and William J. Shatlock, in Patton Township, for the price of $48,000. A charter was obtained in June, 1935, in the name of Restland Memorial Park, Inc., and the option was thereupon assigned to the corporation, in consideration of the issuance to the promoters of all its common stock. The land, which was of a value of less than $10,000 according to the affidavit for stamp tax purposes made by the attorney for the grantee, was conveyed to the corporation by Kukurin and Shatlock, pursuant to the option agreement, by deed dated July 2,1935, reciting the consideration of one dollar. In September or October of 1935 the corporation issued 4,800 shares of .preferred stock, of a par value of $10 per share, to Kukurin and Shatlock, who were then made members of the board of directors.</p>

Houghten and his wife, Mattie L. Houghten, evidenced by a writing under seal, dated November 15, 1935, whereby the Houghtens agreed to transfer to the corporation their equity in an apartment house property and building and loan stock owned by them, of a face value of $5,240, which the corporation agreed to accept, together with $500 in cash, as a loan to it of $20,000, this being the agreed valuation, and to <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>issue in payment thereof its promissory note for such amount and for an “additional like amount”, to be paid “as a bonus.” The Houghtens paid over the $500 in cash and transferred to the corporation the real estate and building and loan stock, pursuant to the agreement, and in return they received two notes, in the amount of $20,000 each, payable November 15,1910, the one to bear no interest for three years and the other, representing the “bonus”, to pay no interest for five years. In addition, the Houghtens received ten shares of common stock and Fred C. Houghten was also made a member of the board of directors for the life of the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.4",656,[215,946,1151,857]]]'>The corporation carried on until 1939, but was always short of funds. On April 28,1939, upon petition of the Houghtens, the court below appointed the Commonwealth Trust Company of Pittsburgh liquidating receiver of the corporation and all creditors were directed to probate their claims within a fixed time. Among others, Kukurin and Shatlock filed their claim, as unpaid vendors, in the sum of $18,000 and interest, less a small credit, and the Houghtens filed claim on the two notes. On August 23,1939, upon application of the receiver for leave, the court directed a public sale of the real estate, the sole asset of the corporation, “free of all liens and encumbrances” but “subject to the rights, estate and interest” of purchasers of grave spaces. The land was subsequently sold, with approval of the court, for the sum of $15,200, which was the fund for distribution.</p>

Objections were filed by Kukurin and Shatlock to the allowance of the claim of Mr. and Mrs. Houghten, and the Houghtens objected to various claims, including that of Kukurin and Shatlock, whereupon the court appointed an auditor “for the purpose of taking testimony and of adjudicating the disputed claims and to make his report and recommenda<a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>tion to the court.” On March 1, 1940, the auditor, William S. Doty, Esq.., filed a report in which he disallowed the claim of Kukurin and Shatlock and allowed, in full, the claim of the Houghtens. Exceptions to the auditor’s report, filed by Kukurin and Shatlock, were sustained by the court, after hearing, and a decree was entered allowing their claim but disallowing the claim of the Houghtens except to the extent of $20,000, with interest. This appeal by the Houghtens followed.</p>

The appointment of the auditor was not for a purpose within Equity Eule 65, permitting appointment of an accountant or other expert, as an assessor, in cases involving complicated accounts, but solely for the exercise of exclusively judicial functions, which it was beyond the power of the court to delegate to an auditor under Equity Eule 15. The appointment of the auditor, over the objection of Kukurin and Shatlock, was, therefore, a nullity, as to them, and the subsequent proceedings before him were, as to them, without legal effect, as the court below apparently recognized, considering the case as though it were de novo.

      <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>In passing upon the merits, the contentions of appellants with respect to the two claims in question require separate consideration:</p>

    <p id="b658-5" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[203,576,1149,531]]]'>The allowance of the claim of Kukurin and Shatlock as unpaid vendors, in the amount of $58,587.38, is objected to by appellants solely on the ground that the status of this claim is res ad judicata, by reason of an earlier adjudication by the court below, from which no appeal was taken, wherein it is contended the court determined that Kukurin and Shatlock accepted the preferred stock issued to them in 1935 as payment in full, and that they were not entitled to participate as creditors, but as shareholders only.</p>
    <p id="b658-6" data-blocks='[["BL_658.6",658,[203,1120,1150,1241]],["BL_659.1",659,[204,302,1153,650]]]'>On September 13, 1939, following the order of the court directing the receiver to sell the real estate of the corporation, but prior to the sale, Kukurin and Shatlock filed a petition asking that the court declare them to be unpaid vendors of the land and for the imposition of an equitable lien in their favor for the unpaid balance of the purchase price, the sale to be stayed meanwhile. They set forth the circumstances of the conveyance to the corporation, and admitted the receipt of the preferred stock, but averred it had been given, and was accepted, as collateral security only, for the purchase price of $18,000, to be paid by creation of a sinking fund for that purpose, as provided in the option agreement. The receiver filed an answer, alleging merger of the option agreement in the deed and that Kukurin and Shatlock had accepted the preferred stock in full payment for the land, as shown by the books and records of the corporation. The Houghtens also filed an answer to this same effect. On the issues thus raised a hearing was had, lasting four days, after which the chancellor entered an adjudication, concluding that there was no warrant in law for the imposition of a lien such as was sought and, accordingly, dismissed the petition. Kukurin and Shatlock thereupon <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>filed a petition, asking the court to adjudicate the unpaid balance of the purchase price due them and, in lieu of imposing a lien, to direct that such unpaid balance be recognized as a claim payable out of the proceeds of sale. The chancellor refused the petition “without prejudice to the petitioners”, and they thereafter filed exceptions to the adjudication of the chancellor, as made, and to his failure “to fully adjudicate the entire subject matter before him on the record.” After hearing on the exceptions, the court en banc filed an opinion and entered a final decree, dismissing the exceptions “in the light of the foregoing opinion.”</p>

The findings of the chancellor are that “the consideration for this property was the issuance of 4,800 shares of preferred stock ... <em>as shown by the boohs of the company”, “the boohs of the company show </em>that the real estate was acquired from the petitioners by the transfer of 4,800 shares of preferred stock, the stock being in <em>ostensible payment </em>thereof”, and that <em>(‘on the liability side ... it is shown </em>that 4,800 shares of preferred stock were issued to the petitioners, in payment thereof”. None of the findings are to the effect that the fact is as “shown by the books of the company”, and they were not intended to be so construed, as appears from the statements of the chancellor, under the heading “Discussion”, that “it is not denied that the petitioners have the right to sue for the unpaid consideration” and “they still have the right to present their claim before the receiver at the appropriate time and place.” Moreover, had the chancellor found the facts to be as contended by appellants, the decree entered by the court en banc could not be regarded as an approval of any such findings. The decree does not dismiss the ex<a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>ceptions without qualification, but dismisses them “in the light of the foregoing opinion”, wherein the court expressly declared the status of Kukurin and Shatlock to be that of “general creditors” for “unpaid balance due for the land conveyed pursuant to option agreement, viz: $48,000.00 with interest from August 1, 1935 (the date when deed was delivered and recorded) to April 26,1939 (the date of appointment of receiver herein), less the amount of $194.96 paid on account February 15, 1936”, whose claim <em>“shall </em>not take precedence over any other claims but <em>shall </em>participate with all general claims.”</p>
    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[217,898,1149,535]]]'>It is apparent, from an examination of the record, that if the earlier proceeding amounted to a judicial determination of anything respecting the status of Kukurin and Shatlock in the fund for distribution, it was that they are not limited to the rights of shareholders but are entitled to participate as general creditors, and the matter thus becomes res adjudicata against the position of appellants and not in their favor, as they contend. It follows that appellants’ objection to the allowance of this claim is not well taken and it will, therefore, be allowed.</p>

The second note, representing the “additional like amount” provided for by the agreement and referred to therein as a “bonus” for the making of the loan, is objected to, however, on the grounds (1) that the agreement with the Houghtens constituted a fictitious increase of indebtedness contrary to Article XVI, section 7, of the Constitution, (2) that the transaction was entered into without the consent of the shareholders at a meeting held after six days’ notice, as required by law, before incurring indebtedness other than “in the usual course <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>of corporate business” (Business Corporation Law of 1933, P.

As was stated in <em>Miller v. Hellam Distilling Co. (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa-super/57/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="57 Pa.

See <em>Big Spring Elec. Co. v.

Here there is no suggestion that the corporation, which was in urgent need of funds and was without any credit standing whatever, could have obtained the necessary funds elsewhere upon more favorable terms, and the good faith of all the parties in the execution of the agreement, pursuant to which the two notes in question were given, is conceded. In these circumstances, the disparity between the agreed value of <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>the assets transferred to the corporation and the face amount of the two notes given in payment, furnishes no basis for viewing the transaction with suspicion and, the good faith of the transaction being conceded, no fictitious increase of indebtedness, within the meaning of that phrase as used in Article XVI, section 7 of the Constitution, is involved: <em>Big Spring Elec.

Assuming that they have any standing to raise such objection, the omission to obtain the antecedent consent of the shareholders at a meeting called for the purpose, upon sixty days’ notice, as required by statute, becomes, immaterial, since it appears that the transaction was unanimously approved at the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
