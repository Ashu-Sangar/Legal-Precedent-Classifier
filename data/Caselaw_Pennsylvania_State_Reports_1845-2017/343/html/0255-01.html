He states “that fairness and justice dictate that a new tidal be had.” Plaintiff insists that he was entitled to binding instructions and that judgment should now be entered in his favor. In view of the statements of the trial judge above mentioned, and because issues of fact were raised due to conflicting testimony, we will not interfere with the order granting a new trial: <em>Weinfeld v.
