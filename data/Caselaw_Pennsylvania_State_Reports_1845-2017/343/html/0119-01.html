A jury trial resulted in a verdict for appellant in the sum of $4237.50, representing the face amount of the policy and an allowance for interest, which was set aside by the court en banc, and judgment non obstante veredicto was entered in favor of the appellee Society. This appeal followed.</p>

By its terms it insured members who so elected (1) against loss of life which should occur while insured under the group policy, and (2), in lieu of the death benefit, against total and permanent disability which should commence while thus insured and prior to attaining age 60, the amount of insurance in force on the date of the commencement of such disability to be paid to the insured in equal monthly installments, according to a certain table. Disability installments remaining unpaid upon the death of the member were made payable to the named beneficiary as they became due, with the right to commute at 3%% interest per annum. Appellant’s insured having made application for insurance under the group policy, an individual certificate was issued to him, <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>bearing the same date as the master policy, insuring him in the amount of $3000. This certificate, which recited that it was furnished in accordance with the terms of the group policy “which together with the Association’s application therefor constitutes the entire contract between the parties”, contained certain provisions of the master policy as to terms and conditions under which benefits would be paid, including the provisions relating to total and permanent disability.</p>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[205,797,1153,913]]]'>As contemplated by the insurance plan under the group policy, the proportionate amount of the total premium payable on account of the insurance coverage of each employee participating in the insurance was collected monthly by the Association from the employee, as dues, through wage deduction authorization slips or, if no pay was due the employee for a monthly period, in cash, and one sum was then turned over to the Society by the Association representing the entire monthly premium of the insured members. No part of the premium was paid by the employer, as is often the case in group insurance. The policy was originally issued for the term of one year, but contained a provision for automatic renewal by the Society upon each anniversary of the Register date and, in accordance with such annual renewal provision, was renewed on June 30, 1932, in the form originally issued, for the further period of one year.</p>

His dues were paid in full until February 28,1933, but none were paid thereafter, in consequence of which the Association, on July 13,1933, terminated his membei’ship for nonpayment of dues and notified the Society that he was no longer a member of the Association or entitled to participate in the insurance under the terms of the group policy. Poch died on <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>October 1, 1933, at tbe age of 35 years, and tbe present suit was instituted on April 30, 1937, by appellant, as named beneficiary, to recover the full amount of disability benefits provided for by the “total and permanent disability” provision contained in the master policy, as originally issued and renewed on June 30, 1932, and in the individual certificate issued thereunder, no payments having been made to the insured during his lifetime.</p>
    <p id="b151-3" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[181,748,1153,1626]],["BL_152.1",152,[252,297,1150,534]]]'>In the interim between June 30,1932, the date of renewal of the original policy for another year, and January 18,1933, the date of Poch’s disability, the Society, in accordance with a recommendation by the board of directors of the Association, attached a rider to the master policy which purported to cancel the “total and permanent disability” provision as of September 1, 1932. The rider, which was executed by an assistant registrar of the Society and by the Association’s chief clerk, provides: “It is hereby agreed that the provision appearing in said policy entitled Total and Permanent Disability Provision shall be void on and after September 1, 1932, and that said policy shall thereafter provide for payment of insurance only in the event of death of any member occurring while insured thereunder. Provided, however, that the Total and Permanent Disability Provision shall remain in effect with respeet to any insured members who may have become entitled to benefits thereunder prior to September 1, 1932”. Notice of cancellation of the provision for disability benefits was posted on a bulletin board at the Association’s office and new individual certificates were issued to the Association for delivery to the insured members, but it does not appear how long the notice remained posted or that it was seen or read by Poch, nor does it appear that a new certificate was ever delivered to him or that any demand had been made upon him to surrender the certificate held by him under the terms of the original policy. Neither the master policy nor the certificate issued to the insured employee reserved to the Society or the Association any right to <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>cancel or eliminate any of the effective provisions of the insurance contract during the policy year, and it appears that the amount of premiums paid by the insured to the Association and by it transmitted to the Society, from the renewal date of the policy to and including the premium for February, 1933, was the same as would have been payable by him under the terms of the original policy. The cancellation agreement provided for no adjustment of the premium rates by reason of the elimination of the disability clause.</p>
    <p id="b152-4" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[249,852,1151,1183]]]'>The Society here concedes that appellant’s insured ivas not consulted with reference to cancellation of the provision for disability benefits and did not consent thereto, as also that, so far as the record shows, there is no evidence to establish that he was ever advised of the change or had any knowledge or notice thereof, but contends that the mutual agreement between it and the Association, evidenced by the rider attached to the policy, that the disability provision should be void on and after September 1,1932, was nevertheless effective and binding upon the insured members and that, consequently, at the time of accrual of Poch’s disability, such provision was not in effect, as the court below held, basing its entry of judgment for the Society solely on this ground. Appellant contends, on the other hand, that upon renewal of the original policy on June 30,1932, the insured acquired a vested right to the insurance afforded by the terms of the policy, which it was beyond the power and authority of the Society and Association to impair by limiting or changing the risk, without the consent of the insured; further, that the insured was at least entitled to notice of any such change.</p>

Superior Ct. 270</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> two group policies were issued to the Lehigh Railroad Company, one of which was a group life policy covering railroad employees who joined the plan and who, <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>like the insured in the present case, authorized premium payments to he deducted from their wages, and individual certificates were issued naming the appellant in that case as beneficiary. Both of the group policies were later cancelled in their entirety by mutual agreement between the insurer and the Railroad Company, of which the insured was notified but to which he did not consent. The insured died subsequent to the effective date of cancellation, whereupon the beneficiary sued to enforce the group policies, contending that their cancellation was ineffective, since made without the insured employee’s consent. It was held that, under the circumstances there presented, the cancellation by mutual agreement of the insurer and the company was effective and binding upon the insured, despite his lack of consent. The court said (pp. 273, 274, 275) : “It has been uniformly held, in decisions dealing with group life and accident insurance policies substantially similar to those here involved, that the insurer and employer are the primary contracting parties. Whether or not a policy shall continue depends on their will. It is not within the power of the beneficiary to keep a group contract of insurance in force or to abrogate it. The insured employee or his beneficiary have no greater rights than are provided in the policy, certainly no vested right which would prevent cancellation by mutual agreement between the insurer and the employer, especially where reasonable notice of cancellation is given to the employee. . . . The life insurance policy before us is for a distinct form of insurance differing in many if not most of its aspects from the ordinary life insurance, where usually a beneficiary may acquire a vested interest. . . . Here the insured received twenty-eight days notice of the intended cancellation and in that interim took no steps to avail himself of the right to subscribe to other insurance.” The court held further (p. 276) that, in the absence of a provision in the policy to the contrary, there is no principle which requires such a policy to be cancelled only on its anniversary date and, <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>therefore, nothing which would prevent cancellation as of the end of any month when the premiums were payable.

Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra, it would follow that such provision was effectively eliminated as of September 1, 1932, as the Society contends. In the absence of notice to the insured, it does not follow, however, as the opinion in the Miller case recognizes, that the insurer can thus effectively be relieved from liability, especially where, as in the instant case, the premiums are paid by the insured employee. Thus, in <em>Butler v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., </em><a href="/mo-app/233/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="233 Mo.

(2d) 1019</a>, where, in an action, like the present, for disability benefits under a group policy, the insurer defended on the ground that the old policy had been cancelled by mutual agreement between it and the employer prior to the incurring of the insured employee’s disability and the new policy then issued did not contain a total disability provision, the court held that the employee’s consent was not a prerequisite to cancellation, but affirmed, a judgment against the insurer, made upon a finding that notice of cancellation had not been given, saying: “After a careful study of the authorities, we conclude that as to such a group policy as is involved in this case, wherein the group policy itself imposes burdens upon the insured employee and <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>provides for a consideration to be paid by the employee for the protection and benefits he secures thereunder, then and in such event, such an insured is entitled to notice of cancellation.” There, as here, the same rates of premium were payable under both the old and new policies and the employee contributed to the cost of the insurance.

Conceding that under such a provision presentation of preliminary proofs becomes a condition precedent to the right to disability benefits and that the period of one year is a reasonable and valid limitation <em>(Bahas v.

Thus, where an insurer refuses to pay a loss because of some alleged defense wholly apart from the furnishing of preliminary notice and proofs of loss, it has been repeatedly held that it thereby waives the necessity of furnishing such notice and proofs, except on the trial, upon the ground that such conduct of the insurer is tantamount to a statement <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>that preliminary proofs of loss are not desired and upon the ground, as stated in <em>Fedas v.

As is aptly stated in <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. v. Winning, </em><a href="/f/58/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="58 F. 541" data-case-ids="6734931" data-case-paths="/f/58/0541-01">58 Fed. 541</a>, 548: “It cannot well be supposed or assumed that an insurance company desires preliminary notice and proofs of loss under a given policy, except on the assumption that it is a subsisting obligation, and that such notice and proofs will be of some service in enabling it to make a timely examination of the circumstances attending the loss”; hence, in either event, the only reasonable assumption is that preliminary proofs were not desired by the insurer and that performance of the condition by the insured would have been a vain and utterly useless act, and in the one instance as in the other, therefore, the repudiation of liability should be regarded as constituting a waiver. And so it has been held. In <em>Girard Life Ins. Co. v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/97/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="97 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="444762" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0015-01">97 Pa. 15</a>, a life policy had been wrongfully forfeited for non-payment of an annual premium, some time before the death of the assured. In an action to recover the amount of the policy the insurance company resisted payment on the ground, among others, that no notice or proofs of loss had been furnished, as <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>required by tbe policy. This Court held that under such circumstances whether notice or proofs of loss had been furnished was immaterial, stating as follows (pp. 24-25) : “The proofs referred to were not essential. . . . The defendant company denied all liability under the policy. They had declared it forfeited months before the death of the assured. Their position was, that as to the assured there was no policy. It was precisely as if they had denied ever having issued one. How then could they call upon the representatives of the assured, to furnish proofs of death ‘under the policy ?’ ” See also: <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. v.
