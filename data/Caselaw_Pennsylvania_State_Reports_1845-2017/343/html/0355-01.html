The form of action is a quo warranto proceeding instituted in the name of the Commonwealth at the suggestion of the District Attorney of Beaver County, and is to determine the right of respondent, Glen W. Major, to the office of member of the Board of the Beaver Falls Municipal Authority which was formed under the provisions of the Act of June 28, 1935, P. L. 463, known as the “Municipality Authorities Act of one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five”, as amended by the Acts of.,May 20, 1937, P. L. 739 and May 17,1939, P. L. 167.' He demurred to the suggestion, and after argument, the learned President Judge of the 53rd Judicial District, specially presiding, overruled the demurrer and entered a decree nisi removing respondent from the Board of the Authority. Later, respondent’s exceptions were overruled by the court en banc and a final judgment of ouster was entered. This appeal was.,then taken.</p>

On June 14,1940, by the unanimous vote of respondent, and the three other members of'Council, L. W. Kelly, Sam Arent, and Ed. A.

Each councilman voted for Jiimself, the other members of Council, and Brooks.* Respondent and the other three members of Council served both as councilmen and as members of the Board from the time a charter for the Authority was issued by the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on July 3, 1940, until the rendition of the decision in this case by the learned court below. Thereafter, as stated at the oral argument and in the brief of appellee, Arent and Kelly resigned from the Authority Board.</p>

In defining these Authorities, it was stated, in <em>Lighton v. Abington Twp., </em><a href="/pa/336/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="336 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1195576" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0345-01">336 Pa. 345</a>, 354: “They are public corporations, being corporate agencies engaged in the administration of civil government. The state may modify the part performed by its agencies in government by creating other agencies, subject always to constitutional limitations.” That such Board members are public officers is further emphasized by the following provisions of section 15 of the “Municipality Authorities Act of one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five”, as <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>amended: “The effectuation of the authorized purposes of Authorities, created under this act, shall and will he in all respects for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the increase of their commerce and prosperity and for the improvement of their health and living conditions, and <em>since such Authorities will be performing essential governmental functions in effectuating such </em>purposes, such Authorities shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon any property acquired or used by them for such purposes, and the bonds issued by any Authority, their transfer, and the income therefrom (including any profits made on the sale thereof), shall at all times be free from taxation within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” (Italics added).- Therefore, the office challenged in the writ is a public one, and the court below, on the suggestion of the District Attorney, had jurisdiction.</p>

They took separate appeals to this Court, but that of respondent is the only one remaining, discontinuances having been entered by the other three councilmen prior to the argument of this appeal. yrN1'</p>

There must be a positive, well-defined, universal public sentiment, deeply integrated in the customs and beliefs of the people and in their conviction of what is just and right and in the interests of the public weal.” That there is “a virtual unanimity of opinion” among all reasonable men that it is against public policy for a public official to appoint himself to another public office Avithin his gift is beyond all question. Courts, not only of this CommonAvealth, but of every other jurisdiction known to us, have uniformly held that personal interest of a public officer creates disqualification. In this connection, we said, in <em>Commonwealth v.

While it cannot be questioned that the General Assembly has the inherent power to declare the public policy of the Commonwealth and may confer upon members of Council of municipalities power to appoint themselves to membership upon Boards of Authorities and to fix their own salaries, such grant of power must be strictly construed, and unless the intention is clear, the <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>power will be denied, because of its exceptional and extraordinary character.'' We sa,id, in this connection, in the recent case of <em>Reckner v. German Twp. S. D., </em>supra (p. 378) : “It necessitate/ an explicit direction on the part of the legislature to overthrow such a wholesome and salutary rule of the common law as that precluding a public servant from simultaneously representing both himself and his constituents.

Particularly is this made evident since the municipality and the Authority are definitely intended to be separate and distinct entities. That this is so, is clearly shown by the dealings set forth in the statute to be had between these two corporations. Section 4 provides, inter alia, for the making of contracts between the municipality and the <em>Authority; </em>section 7 directs that the municipal authorities shall make appointments of members to the Board of the Authority and fix their salaries; section 8 sets forth that the persons who audit the accounts of the Authority are to be “The controller, auditors or accountant designated by the municipality”; and section 9 provides for the transfer of facilities to the Authority “upon such terms and conditions as are mutually satisfactory to the Authority and the corporate authorities of . . . any such city, borough, or tOAvnship . . .” The legislature certainly did not intend that public officials could use their offices to appoint themselves to other public <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>offices, fix their own compensation, contract with themselves, and audit their own accounts. That the Board of the Authority and Council of the municipality were to be independent of each other is further made clear by the other provisions of section 7 of the statute, which direct that members of the Board may not be removed even for cause by the municipality, but this can only be done by the Court of Quarter Sessions, 1 'if A — — —-</p>
    <p id="b391-3" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[165,739,1153,1520]]]'>There is no merit in the contention that since the legislature specifically provided in the Act of June 28, 1935, P. L. 452, known as the “General State Authority Act of one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five”, and the Act of May 28,1937, P. L. 955, known as the “Housing Authorities Law”, that certain public officials could or should serve upon the Boards of those particular Authorities, it was, therefore, the implied intention of the lawmakers to permit councilmen to serve on Boards of Authorities created under the provisions of the “Municipality Authorities Act of one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five.” Obviously the legislature was cognizant of the well-settled principle of law that unless it expressly provided that public officials could or should serve upon such Authority Boards, public policy would prohibit them from doing so. Therefore, such authority was specifically conferred under the provisions of the “General State Authority Act of one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five” and the “Housing Authorities Law”, which statutes also directed that members of those Boards should receive no compensation for their services. Nor is respondent’s contention rendered any more tenable even if he be willing to forego, while a member of Council, all compensation which the “Municipality Authorities Act of one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five” directs Board members “shall” receive. If the legislature had intended that a councilman could serve by waiving his compensation, it would have specifically so provided.</p>

Section 7 of the “Municipality Authorities Act of one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five”, as amended, provides: “A member may be removed for cause by the court of quarter sessions of the county in which the Authority is located, after having been provided with a copy of the charges against him for at least ten days, and full hearing by the court.” Obviously this provision is intended only to be applicable to a situation where the Board member is charged with the commission of an act, while lawfully holding the office, which Avould warrant his removal. In the instant case, however, Glen W. Major’s right to the office is in question, since it is claimed that his appointment was illegal, and therefore quo warranto is the only proper proceeding in which to try title to this public office: <em>Driskel v.
