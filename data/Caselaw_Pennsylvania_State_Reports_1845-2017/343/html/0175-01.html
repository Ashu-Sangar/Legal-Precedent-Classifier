The effect of this was to raise the grade of the street in front of appellees’ prop<a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>erty, with the result, when heavy rains occurred, that their property was flooded and damaged. Not only did the constituted authorities of the borough voice no objection to the improvement, but supplemented the work by providing a drain along the roadside.</p>
    <p id="b205-3" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[216,568,1154,535]]]'>Plaintiffs brought this action of trespass against the borough to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by them, and, in the trial court, were nonsuited, on the ground that they had mistaken their remedy, which should have been in a proceeding before viewers. On appeal to the Superior Court, the court of first instance was reversed and the action as brought was reinstated. The municipality’s appeal from this conclusion brings before us the question: What is plaintiffs’ legal remedy?</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[220,1115,1153,800]]]'>The Superior Court’s decision is based upon the fact that no ordinance had been enacted or other action taken by the borough authorizing the work. Its opinion states: “As the borough took no official action to resurface the street, and provide for the payment of damages to abutting property owners for any injury they sustained, there existed no facts upon which to base an application for'the appointment of viewers.” But the borough did not repudiate the act of changing the grade, on the contrary, it accepted the improvement. This being so, the situation was the same as though the customary preliminary legal steps had been taken. If they had been, plaintiffs’ remedy would have been before viewers, and so we think it should be under the existing circumstances.</p>
