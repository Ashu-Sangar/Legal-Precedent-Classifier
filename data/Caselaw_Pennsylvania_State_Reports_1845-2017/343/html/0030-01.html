They depend upon the well settled principle of law that where words sufficient to vest an absolute estate are used in a will, such interest is not to be cut down by subsequent provisions, unless the testator has indicated a clear intent to take away the estate previously given: <em>Cross v.

It therefore appears that the controversy turns upon the quality of the estate originally given to Russell and the clarity of the subsequent provisions.</p>

It is a fundamental rule applied in the construction of wills that the intent of the testator shall be determined from an examination of the very words of the will taken as a part of an entire work and in the light of the circumstances under which it was written. In gathering the meaning of words and phrases and the sense in which they are used, the context and the will as a whole must be taken into account: <em>Smith’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/291/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="291 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1107273" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0129-01">291 Pa. 129</a>, 134, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20832" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="139 A. 832">139 A. 832</a>. Considering the circumstances, we find that the testatrix, in disposing of the second half of the residue, was providing for those of <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>her own blood. Her blood relations consisted of three sisters and a nephew, a son of one of those sisters. She assumed that her sisters would not have any more children and that that branch of her family would be continued only by the marriage of the nephew and the birth of a child or children to him.</p>
    <p id="b63-5" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[195,632,1153,749]]]'>Reading the will as a whole, we find a dominant intent that her estate should be used to care for the sisters for their lifetimes, with small bequests for the surviving spouses of two of the sisters, and that it should then pass to Russell and his children. She took into account the possibility that Russell might not marry and have children and in that event she desired the residue to go to certain of her church interests. While she provided for other contingencies, the dominant and conspicuous features of the will to which we have referred cannot be disregarded or ignored. A more particular examination of the various clauses of the will in the light of well settled rules of construction will confirm that general conclusion.</p>

If such were not the case the remaining clauses [2] to [7] would be meaningless. “It is a well recognized rule of construction that a limitation over after the death of the first devisee is evidence of an intention that the devisee of the prior estate in order of enjoyment was intended to have not more than a life estate”: <em>Boulevard from Second St., </em><a href="/pa/230/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="230 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="8846467" data-case-paths="/pa/230/0491-01">230 Pa. 491</a>, 494, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.%20716" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="79 A. 716">79 A. 716</a>, and see cases cited in footnote 5 of <em>Byrne’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/320/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="320 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="1163635" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0513-01">320 Pa. 513</a>, 518, <a href="/citations/?q=181%20A.%20500" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="181 A. 500">181 A. 500</a>.

What did testatrix mean by her words when she said that Catherine’s <em>share </em>shall go to Russell Lindsay? In clause [1] she had directed her estate to be divided into “equal shares to my sisters . . . and my nephew Russell Lindsay.” It was the principal that was to be divided into <em>shares, </em>but it is conceded that a sister was only to take the income from a share so that the share of a sister was a life interest and it was Catherine’s share which was given to Russell. It is reasonable to infer that testatrix, in giving Russell another <em>share, </em>intended to give him an estate of the same quality as the <em>share </em>given in the first sentence. We cannot, however, avoid the conclusion that some ambiguity arises by reason of using “share” to designate share of principal one moment and using it to denote share of income the next instant. If the testatrix, in fixing the quality or quantity of the estate which Russell was to take at the death of Catherine in the share from which the income was to be paid to her for life, had stopped with clauses [2] and [4], there would probably be little difficulty in coming to the conclusion that Russell was to take the principal at that time. But the testatrix said much more, and we are not permitted to ignore any portion of her words if they can be given a reasonable meaning, particularly so when the prior expression is ambiguous. The subsequent clauses are in clarification of what has gone before rather than <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>repugnant to it. When we seek to give the subsequent clauses some meaning, as Ave should do, it becomes even more apparent tiiat the will must be read as a whole and, in our opinion, that the interest given Russell was but a life interest.</p>

In the second place, the gift over by clause [5] of the <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>will is of the second half of the estate, or all four shares. If the nephew had predeceased Katherine or testatrix, the ultimate legatee could not have been substituted in his place. The ultimate legatee would not have a right to the second half of the estate until the death of all three sisters. A gift over of four shares cannot be substitutionary for a gift of one share. The testatrix contemplated that in the natural course of events her nephew would survive her sisters. The contingency that Russell should not be the last survivor was attempted to be met by clauses [2] and [7] rather than by clause [6]. In view of our conclusion and taking into account the consequent change in life tenants, it may be necessary to proceed under §23 of the Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447 (20 PS §635), in order to protect the fund. The record does not inform us fully as to the powers of the Dauphin Deposit Trust Company.</p>
