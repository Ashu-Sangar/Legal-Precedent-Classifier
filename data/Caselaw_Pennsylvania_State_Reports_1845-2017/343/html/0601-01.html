He described the treatment as follows: “He (the doctor) took an alcohol bottle and washed my back, then something with iodine on it, and rubbed my back and then took a bottle about <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>two inches deep, stuck a needle and pushed it in my hack. He inserted the needle through the cork.” He added: “I went home ... I felt pain in the shoulder and arm. Then I couldn’t move my arm or shoulder and I went down to the doctor and asked him what he had done to me. . . . Two days later I started to swell up; my shoulders went in an abscess”. A little later Dr. Grahn “lanced the abscess”. Treatments were continued for several days. A month later a more serious condition developed. He testified: “Back of my heart it raised up about the size of a quarter. I couldn’t walk; I was bent over and the lump back of my heart was bigger than my head.” He was taken to a hospital and was operated on. Three days later he was taken home and there confined to his bed for seven weeks, with “tubes draining from the back”. He “had pains nearly a year before they started to leave” him. He had never before had any trouble with his hack and “as a result of the abscess” he was incapacitated from work from October 5, 1937, to January 17, 1938, and also lost 16 days after January 17th. Plaintiff charges that Dr. Grahn, on or about October 5th and 7th, 1937, injected into the former’s body “two injections of liver extract” which had been “made and sold and delivered to Dr. Grahn by the original defendant, The National Drug Company, either directly or through retailers or distributors” and that “this extract was impure, unsterile and unfit for use” and caused the bodily injuries stated. It is pleaded that the Drug Company “failed to use care to see that the drug was safe and fit for the intended use”.</p>

The bottle “was bought through their representative”. Its wrapper contained the following: “This preparation should be used only by a physician, and care must be taken to make aseptic injections. We assume full responsibility and guarantee the accurate preparation, careful testing and safety of this product. We do not assume responsibility for untoward conditions that may develop since such are invariably due to sensitivity of the patient or to indiscriminate use.” The doctor described the sterilization by his technician with alcohol and iodine of the small area about the point of the injection. He described the bottle containing the liver concentrate used by him as follows: a “little metal container in which there is a small felt top which is impregnated with tr-eresol, which protects the cap — it is an excellent model with an excellent top. It sterilizes automatically as you put it in.” His testimony as to the swelling on the patient’s back and his other symptoms, after the injection, and as to the treatment in the hospital were substantially in accord with the patient’s. He incised the patient’s back and “pus came out”. The back Avas again incised at the hospital. In the doctor’s opinion the cause of the patient’s abscess was “an irritant in the ampoule”. He admitted that “it may be caused also by an unsterile hypodermic”. He testified that “prior to Mr. Henderson’s injection he had given an injection to a Mrs. Caldwell and “an abscess formed in due course at the site of the injection”. He had previously given nineteen similar injections to Mrs. Caldwell and no abscesses followed, thus proving that she was not hyper-sensitive to this substance. From the same bottle the doctor had given two injections to a Mr. Hart-net late in September 1937 and this patient “developed two abscesses at the site of the injections”. Hartnet had had “twenty-nine injections previously” of liver concentrate from other drug companies’ bottles and no ab<a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>scesses followed. After Hartnet’s two abscesses “cleared up”, he received “eleven or twelve injections of the liver concentrate of another producer of this substance and no abscesses developed”. The doctor injected a Mrs. Landen with the liver concentrate from the same National Drug Company bottle on September 27,1937, and “she developed an abscess at the site of the injection, with the same clinical course”. It was her first injection of this substance, but subsequently she received twenty-seven injections of this substance produced by other drug companies, and no ill effects followed. The doctor then testified that he had “given about three or four thousand injections of liver extract” and that “the only abscesses following” these injections were in the cases indicated. The abscesses were all sterile.</p>

Rankin, who operated on the plaintiff for the abscess on his back testified that in his opinion the cause of that abscess was “the material that was injected” by Dr. Grahan. Dr. Patrick J. Kennedy, a pathologist, testified to the same effect. Dr. Abraham Cantarow, who had specialized in internal medicine and bio-chemistry, testified in answer to a hypothetical question that plaintiff’s abscess “was due to some irritating material in the injected solution”. Dr. L. S. Carey gave similar testimony. The foregoing constituted plaintiff’s proof against <em>The National Drug Company.</em>

(3) The inference from the testimony of Dr. Grahn and his technician, Miss Purnell, in respect to the sterilization of the syringe and needle used on the plaintiff that these were thoroughly sterile.

In criminal cases they demand that when a conviction is to be based on a chain of inferences, each and every link in that chain must exclude every other reasonable hypothesis. In civil cases, involving only property rights, the rule is not so strict . . . But when an inference of the probability of the ultimate fact must be drawn from fact whose existence is itself based only on an inference or a chain of inferences ... all prior links in the chain of inferences must be shown with the same certainty as is required in criminal cases in order to support a final inference of the probability of the ultimate fact in issue. . . . <em>The prior inferences must be established to the exclusion of any other reasonable theory rather than merely by a probability, </em>[italics supplied] ...

The inference that the Drug Company failed to exercise due care in the preparation of the liver concentrate is not so compelling as to exclude the equally reasonable inference that Dr. Grahn did not exercise due care in its use. While claiming that he properly sterilized his needle before inserting it into the plaintiff, Dr. Grahn admitted that “an abscess may be caused by an unsterile hypodermic”. In answer to the question: “When you take a needle and push it through [the skin] it is perfectly possible there may be some bacteria or something lurking in the skin at the time?” He replied: “It was remotely possible.” While it is true that three other patients who received injections by the same physician from the same ampoule of liver concentrate which was used on the plaintiff developed abscesses like the plaintiff’s, even this fact is as consistent with the theory of the negligence of Dr. Grahn as it is with that of the Drug Company.</p>

It Avas declared further that “if the food is unfit for consumption and damages result there<a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>from they ought to be placed not upon one who has had no opportunity of determining its condition, but rather upon the one who has had means of informing himself of the condition of the food”. It seems to have been conceded that the food was unfit for use and caused injury. In the Campbell case, supra, the inference was obvious that ptomaine poisoning resulted from the food the defendant supplied. There was no other equally probable cause for the poisoning. Whether a case of this kind is tried on the theory of a breach of an implied warranty or on the theory of tort is immaterial. One seeking damages from a food manufacturer for injuries caused by eating unfit food is not compelled to elect between implied warranty and negligence as a ground of recovery: <em>Alfred Davis v.

In the <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>instant case, our conclusion is that the responsibility which plaintiff seeks to fasten upon the defendant Drug Company rests chiefly on conjecture. When under the evidence there is a cause other than the one plaintiff charges to which it would be <em>equally reasonable </em>to attribute the injury complained of, the jury will not be permitted to capriciously choose between them. A decision by chance can never be accepted as an act of judgment. “In admitting evidence in our law, it is always assumed to be logically probative, i. e., probative in its own nature, — according to the rules that govern the process of reasoning. . . . Bad reasoning in the law of evidence like bad reasoning in all other parts of the law is simply bad reasoning; and it is never good law”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Drug Company was entitled to the binding instructions it asked for.</p>

Gralin, a prima facie case was made out in support of the allegation that he “negligently and carelessly used and administered said liver extract to the said plaintiff”. Whether the “irritant” which caused plaintiff’s abscess was in the concentrate itself or in the dosage or in the doctor’s syringe or in the needle or was due to the doctor’s technique does not appear, but in any of these contingencies <em>this defendant would be liable if he had notice that harm to the plaintiff would be likely to follow the injection. </em>He was put on such notice by the abscesses which had developed in his three other patients. One of these injections was given seven days before Henderson’s was given and another one was given ten days before. If they developed “the same clinical course” as the Henderson injection, the symptoms of abscess must have appeared at the end of two days. These were ample cautionary signals and if in the face of them the doctor injected the same substance in the same way into the plaintiff his action could reasonably be characterized as negligent. <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>“Most liabilities in tort . . . are founded on the.infliction of harm which the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to avoid at the time of the acts or omissions which were its proximate cause”: Holmes: “The Common Law”, p. 145.</p>

These instructions ignored the alleged negligence of Dr. Grahn in injecting into the plaintiff a substance which he knew or had reason to believe had recently caused abscesses in three other patients. In the case against Dr. Grahn the binding instructions asked for were properly refused, but the court’s charge was inadequate and to the plaintiff prejudicial.</p>

In this process the material is pulled through by a vacuum, and if it contained any bacteria they would be left on the outside of the filter. The material comes through sterile, that is, not containing any organisms. The material was then divided into three bottles, and those three bottles are sent to what we call the filling room. In the filling room the bottle is set up, and the bottle is placed in a sterile filling machine. . . .
