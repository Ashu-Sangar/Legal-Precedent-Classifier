L. 117, sec. 1 (72 PS §3131), the plaintiff applied to the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue for a refund of taxes paid in the years 1935 to 1939 under an erroneous interpretation of the taxing statute. The application was made within five years of the payment of the taxes. The board refused the refund without any findings of fact or discussion. We have the bare order: “And now, to wit, August 7, A. D. 1940, After full consideration, the prayer of this petition is hereby refused.” Plaintiff then petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County for a writ of alternative mandamus commanding the board to grant the refund or show cause why they should not do so. That court, on petition of the Attorney General, quashed the writ on the grounds that the tax sought to be recovered was not a tax “to which the Commonwealth is not rightfully or equitably entitled”, and that mandamus would not lie.</p>

Certain statutes have been passed by our legislature to meet this situation. Section 503 of the Fiscal Code, Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, as amended by Act of June 6, 1939, P. L. 261 (72 PS §503), provides in part as follows: “The <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>Board of Finance and Revenue shall have the power, and its duty shall be, (a) To hear and determine any petition for the refund of taxes, license fees, penalties, fines, bonus, or other- moneys paid to the Commonwealth and to which the Commonwealth is not rightfully or equitably entitled, and, upon the allowance of any such petition, to refund such taxes, license fees, penalties, fines, bonus, or other moneys, out of any appropriation or appropriations made for the purpose, or to credit the account of the person, association, corporation, body politic, or public officer entitled to the refund. All such petitions must be filed with the board within two years of the payment of which refund is requested, except . . . (4) When any tax or other money has been paid to the Commonwealth, under a provision of an act of Assembly subsequently held by the court of final jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, or under an interpretation of such provision subsequently held by such court to be erroneous. In such case, the petition to the board shall be filed within five years of the payment of which a refund is requested. ... (e) The action of the board on all petitions filed under this section shall be final.”</p>
    <p id="b604-4" data-blocks='[["BL_604.4",604,[225,1492,1153,805]]]'>The court below based its action in quashing the petition on two grounds. It held first that since, under the doctrine stated in the cases of <em>De La Cuesta v. Insurance Co., </em>supra, and <em>Shenango Furnace Co. v. Fairfield Township, </em>supra, taxes paid voluntarily could not be recovered, therefore “the tax sought to be recovered here is not tax ‘to which the Commonwealth is not rightfully or equitably entitled’ ”, a condition to the right of refund fixed by the Code. It also held that since §503 of the Code provides that the action of the board shall be final, this action of mandamus will not lie. In support of the latter conclusion that court cited <em>Short’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/315/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="315 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1156737" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0561-01">315 Pa. 561</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20319" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="173 A. 319">173 A. 319</a>, which seemed to hold that certiorari would not lie from the action of the board on a petition for refund of taxes under §503 of the Fiscal Code.</p>
    <p id="b604-5" data-blocks='[["BL_604.5",604,[226,2311,1151,100]],["BL_605.1",605,[182,304,1155,1347]]]'>We find no merit in the first ground, for such interpretation would exclude from the operation of the act <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>all petitions for refunding of taxes paid voluntarily. Such an interpretation would defeat the evident purpose of the act when considered as a whole. The act refers to taxes which have been paid but to which the Commonwealth is not <em>rightfully </em>or <em>equitably </em>entitled. It thereby recognized a moral obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to return moneys which, under the decisions such as the Shenango Furnace Company case, supra, were not legal obligations. Clause (a) (4) of §503 conclusively shows that the legislature had in mind something more than taxes paid involuntarily, for it established a longer period of limitation for the filing of a petition for refund when any tax or other money had been paid to the Commonwealth under the provisions of an act subsequently held by the court of final jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or paid under an interpretation of a provision subsequently held by such court to be erroneous. • That is precisely the situation in the present case. It would therefore seem to be indisputable that the legislature, when it authorized refunds to be made, had in mind just such circumstances, among others, as apparently exist here. It is also significant that the Commonwealth did not, either in its brief or on the oral argument, make any attempt to support this first position of the court below.</p>
    <p id="b605-3" data-blocks='[["BL_605.4",605,[183,1671,1152,696]],["BL_606.1",606,[220,291,1154,1512]]]'>The second ground relied upon by the court below is apparently the one which the appellees attempt to support. The position taken is that the legislature delegated to the Board of Finance and Revenue complete and final authority at its discretion to determine what, if any, refunds shall be made to taxpayers, subject only to the condition that the taxes or moneys paid are those “to which the Commonwealth is not rightfully or equitably entitled.” The full extent of the claim is apparent when stated in another and equivalent form, to wit: The board has jurisdiction to pass upon and determine all claims for refunds where taxes, etc., have been paid to the Commonwealth to which moneys “the Commonwealth is not <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>rightfully or equitably entitled”, but nevertheless the board is clothed with a “complete” discretion to determine whether the refund shall in fact be made. If such are the powers of the board, not only did the legislature fail to provide any standard, or norm, for the guidance of the board, but it specifically authorized the board to act without standards. We cannot imagine a clearer example of illegal delegation of authority. The appellees, apparently anticipating such a conclusion, urged a reason why the principle was not applicable. They say: “In granting refunds the Commonwealth is not affecting any person’s rights, for there is no right to a refund.” They argue that since it is a mere gratuity to the taxpayer, property rights are not involved and the board has unlimited discretion to determine the persons who may be the recipients of their bounty. Although this argument should fall of its own weight, it is also in clear disregard of Article III, §7, of our Constitution, which provides: “The General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law . . . refunding moneys legally paid into the treasury.” Since the legislature itself cannot refund taxes voluntarily paid except by laws of general operation or laws embodying reasonable classifications, it obviously cannot delegate an unlimited discretion to one of its creatures, an administrative body, to do that very thing. It is clear that if this act is to be construed to have the meaning suggested by the appellees, we would be compelled to hold it unconstitutional. .</p>

L. 1019, §52 (46 PS §552). Section 503, while giving the board the <em>power, </em>at the same time made it its <em>duty </em>“to hear and determine any petition for the refund of taxes . . . paid to the Commonwealth and to which the Commonwealth is not rightfully or equitably entitled”, and likewise <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>made it its duty upon the allowance of such petition “to refund such taxes ... or to credit the account of the . . . [taxpayer] entitled to the refund.” It is a duty that is placed upon an agency of the state which implies more than mere permissive authority. It would seem both illogical and unreasonable to assume that, when the legislature attempted to correct a rigor of the law that caused an injustice and in so acting made it the duty of one of its fiscal agents to determine whether a tax had been collected to which the State was not rightfully or equitably entitled and made specific provision for a refund or credit in the event of such a finding, it intended only such illusory relief as would leave the granting of the refund to the unlimited discretion of the agency.</p>

Consequently, where a statute directs the doing of a thing for the sake of justice, the word “may” means the same thing as the word “shall”. The principle is thus stated in <em>Supervisors, Rock Island Co. v. U. S., </em><a href="/us/71/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="71 U.S. 435" data-case-ids="6140652" data-case-paths="/us/71/0435-01">71 U.

What they are empowered to do for a third person the law requires shall be done. The power is given, not for their benefit, but for his. It is placed with the depositary to meet the demands of right, and to prevent a failure of justice. It is given as a remedy to those entitled to invoke its aid, and who would otherwise be remediless. In all such cases it is held that the intent of the Legislature, which is the test, was not to devolve a mere discretion, but to impose ‘a positive and absolute duty.’ ” There the language used was less mandatory in <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>form than here.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Also, see <em>Galena v.

In fact, the paper books in that case will show that that argument was made. Here relief is sought upon the theory that the board has misconceived the extent of its powers and its duties.</p>

There would therefore seem to be no question but that mandamus is the proper remedy. While the facts do not appear to be in dispute, the record must be returned in order that the defendants have an opportunity to make answer. If it then appears that the tax was paid as alleged in the petition, a peremptory writ should issue. “Judicial discretion should not be exercised to withhold the writ of mandamus to enforce a clear right conferred by statute, where no other remedy is available to secure such right, for the law and the right are imperative upon the court”: 34 Amer. Juris., Mandamus, section 41. No statutory remedy was given by §503.</p>
