The company was not under obligation to submit to the enforcement of an unconstitutional law. The chancellor found as a fact that appellee enters into more than thirty contracts a year for which it would be required to secure the approval of the commission. Much of its equipment must be obtained from an affiliate, the Western Electric Company, or otherwise it would be embarrassed in exercising its franchises and in furnishing service to the public with <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>resultant injury to it and the public. It was also found that compliance by plaintiff with §702 would subject it "to expense in each case in the preparation of and the hearings on such applications, and also subject plaintiff to the expense incurred by the Commission in the investigation of and hearings on such applications. . . . These expenses plaintiff would be unable to recover back. There might be delay in the commencement and completion of projects for which such contracts and orders were made or given, due to the necessity of preparation of and hearings on said applications and decision thereon. There would also be delay in the extension, replacement, or improvement of plaintiff’s facilities for public service.” When we consider that such hearings frequently cause delay of months and even years, it is clear that the company does not have an adequate or sufficient remedy.</p>

As the conclusion of that court seems so clearly right, it will not be necessary to consider other objections to the section raised by the company. While we approach the subject with the presumption that the section is valid and constitutional, there are, nevertheless, constitutional limitations upon the power of the legislature to delegate its authority. This is firmly established by previous decisions of this court as well as by those of the Supreme Court of the United States. The constitution of this Commonwealth, in Articles II, §1, provides: "The legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.” In <em>Boro, of W. Philo., </em><a href="/watts-serg/5/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 281" data-case-ids="477900" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0281-01">5 W. &amp; S. 281</a>, 283, we said: "Under a well-balanced constitution, the legislature can no more delegate its proper function than can the judiciary.” The limits upon the power to delegate authority are set forth in the leading case of <em>Locke’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/72/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="72 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="434662" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0491-01">72 Pa. 491</a>, 498: <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>“The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a <em>law; </em>but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend. To deny this would be to stop the wheels of government. There are many things upon which wise and useful legislation must depend, which cannot be known to the lawmaking power, and must, therefore, be a subject of inquiry and determination outside of the halls of legislation.” Where the legislature establishes primary standards and then delegates to an administrative body the power to determine some fact or state of things upon which it makes or intends to make its own action depend, it is the legislature which has legislated and not the administrative body. The same thought was expressed by Chief Justice Hughes in <em>Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, </em><a href="/us/293/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="293 U.S. 388" data-case-ids="3925804" data-case-paths="/us/293/0388-01">293 U.

Goodrich Transit Co., </em><a href="/us/224/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="224 U.S. 194" data-case-ids="3668585" data-case-paths="/us/224/0194-01">224 U.

Ct. 436</a>, 441, the principle is thus stated: “The Congress may not delegate its purely legislative power to a commission, but, having laid down the general rules of action under which a commission shall proceed, it may require of that commission the application of such rules to particular situations and the investigation of facts, with a view to making orders in a particular matter within the rules laid down by the Congress.”</p>

The elementary facts found by the court or shown by the pleadings demonstrate that it is. The operating territory of the Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania is confined to Pennsylvania but it is surrounded by territory of other Bell companies owned or controlled by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, so that each has an affiliated interest with the others within the meaning of the Public Utility Law. By reason of the long distance telephone service rendered there is necessarily a close working interest among the affiliates. The lines are not only connected but the method of conducting intercommunications makes necessary the use in common of poles, ducts and other spaces with the result that there are many contractual dealings in varied forms. The appellee has no purchasing department of its own, no warehouses, no organization for disposing of equipment which is junked, no engineering force for installing central office equipment. All this service is performed by an affiliate, the Western Electric Company. It must make many contracts with that company that come within the terms of the section and it is frequently necessary to modify such contracts.</p>
    <p id="b143-3" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[190,1579,1152,426]]]'>The Western Electric Company manufactures about 23.000 items which are used by this utility and less than 3.000 of them can be obtained elsewhere. It would greatly increase the cost of equipment to the appellee if it were deprived of this source of purchase.

They seek to find such guide by reference to the Avhole act. The appellants’ argument becomes somewhat hard to follow at this point for they do not make clear whether the alleged implicit standard is merely public interest or something more <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>definite. The form of this section would seem to indicate that the legislature did not intend to set up any standard for the commission in approving contracts, for its power to approve or disapprove is untrammeled by any conditions while the right of the commission to withdraw its approval previously given is conditioned on a finding of public interest.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[254,698,1158,1509]]]'>Even if we were to consider that public interest can be implied as the standard for approval, that term would not be a proper standard unless further defined or limited in its meaning. To hold otherwise would be to reject the rule that the legislature may not delegate its authority to legislate since in any such delegation there is an implication that the power will be exercised in the public interest. Before any commission can decide whether a contract is contrary to public interest, it is necessary to find what is or what is not in the public interest. The power to make such determination rests with the legislature and without such declaration the commission would be without a standard or criterion. The phrase “public interest” as used in this connection is “a concept without ascertainable criterion.” At best the term is too vague and elastic to furnish a standard. As we have said: “In all such occasions, nevertheless, the legislative :body must surround such authority with definite standards, policies and limitations to which such administrative officers, boards or commissions, must strictly adhere and by which they are strictly governed. ... If the legislature fails, however, to prescribe with reasonable clarity the limits of the power delegated or if those limits are too broad its attempt to delegate is a nullity: <em>Schechter Poultry Corp. v.
