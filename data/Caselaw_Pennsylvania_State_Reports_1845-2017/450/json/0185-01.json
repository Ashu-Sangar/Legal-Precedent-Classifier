        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nOn December 5, 1969, Sonia Rosenbaum was robbed and assaulted while in her home in Philadelphia. The victim, who was bound and gagged by the intruders, died as a result of the assault.\nSubsequently, appellant, sixteen year old Robert Forbes, was indicted for various crimes stemming from this incident. On November 4, 1970, appellant entered pleas of guilty to murder, burglary, aggravated robbery, larceny, receiving stolen goods, and conspiracy. Prior to receiving these pleas, the trial court conducted an on-the-record colloquy, as required by Pa. R. Grim. P. 319 (a). Having concluded that the pleas were \u201cvoluntarily and understandingly made\u201d, the court then held a hearing, pursuant to Pa. R. Grim. P. 319A, to determine whether \u201cthe case may constitute murder in the first degree.\u201d Based on the evidence presented by stipulation, the trial judge determined that such a case had been made out and deferred any further action until a three judge panel was convened.\nOn December 8, 1970, a three judge court was impaneled. At that time, however, appellant expressed a desire to withdraw his guilty plea because, as he stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to plead guilty to nothing I didn\u2019t do.\u201d The court continued the matter until a hearing could be held on appellant\u2019s request to withdraw his guilty plea.\nAt that hearing, on February 18, 1971, appellant said he no longer desired to pursue his withdrawal request ; therefore, on February 25, 1971, the three judge panel reconvened to determine the degree of guilt. At that hearing, it became apparent that appellant\u2019s decision to abandon his withdrawal request was the result of defense counsel\u2019s threat to withdraw from the case. The court, nevertheless, proceeded on appellant\u2019s initial entry of the guilty plea. Appellant was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Sentence was suspended on the other charges.\nOn this direct appeal, appellant contends that the withdrawal of his guilty plea was obstructed by defense counsel\u2019s decision to withdraw from the case if appellant pursued his retraction of the original guilty plea. He urges that the trial court erred in failing to grant his withdrawal request\u2014made prior to any evidence being offered at the degree of guilt hearing and, thus, prior to adjudication and imposition of sentence. We agree and must reverse.\nThe record supports appellant\u2019s contention that he abandoned the withdrawal of his guilty plea because of defense counsel\u2019s intention to withdraw from the case. Counsel specifically stated, on the record, at the final hearing: \u201cI have indicated to him before that if he felt, that if he insisted upon withdrawing his plea and Judge Bruno thought there were circumstances under which he should be able to withdraw that, I would ask to withdraw from the case. The relationship that we have had has been hanging in the balance and I think his mother has been the one most responsible for keeping that relationship.\u201d\nThe coercive impact of this threat, coming long after counsel first entered the case, was not lessened by the court\u2019s perfunctory inquiry of appellant concerning his newly expressed desire to abandon his earlier request to withdraw his original plea of guilty. There is no indication that appellant was informed of Ms right to persist in his request for withdrawal of the plea\u2014in the face of counsel\u2019s comment\u2014and have new counsel appointed. Additionally, the court, itself, may have inadvertently intensified the coercion by denying appellant\u2019s motion to continue the final hearing for two days in order to permit the presence of appellant\u2019s mother who had been present at each of the prior hearings and who had been appellant\u2019s actual counselor throughout the proceedings. The importance of her presence was even noted as above indicated by defense counsel.\nThese circumstances rendered involuntary appellant\u2019s decision to abandon his withdrawal request and continue with his original guilty plea. What plea to enter is a decision which must be made voluntarily and intelligently, by the accused. See Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709 (1969); McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S. Ct. 1166 (1969); ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Defense Function \u00a75.2(a) (Approved Draft, 1971). Comment, Criminal Waiver: The Requirements of Personal Participation, Competence and Legitimate State Interest, 51 Cal. L. Rev. 1262, 1267-68 (1966). A guilty plea which is not the personal and voluntary decision of the accused, but rather is \u201cinduced by promises or threats which deprive it of the character of a voluntary act, is void.\u201d Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S. Ct. 510, 513 (1962).\nHere, defense counsel\u2019s statement\u2014made to a sixteen year old youth who, as the record reveals, was visibly upset and confused by the entire proceedings\u2014deprived appellant\u2019s decision to abandon his request for withdrawal of his earlier plea and continue with that plea \u201cof the character of a voluntary act.\u201d Had it not been for counsel\u2019s coercive statement, appellant would have pursued his request to withdraw his plea. On this record, it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny appellant\u2019s withdrawal request.\nAlthough there is no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea, properly received by the trial court, it is clear that a request made before sentencing\u2014here, that request was made at even an earlier stage\u2014should be liberally allowed. See United States ex rel. Culbreath v. Rundle, 466 F. 2d 730 (3d Cir. 1972) ; United States v. Young, 424 F. 2d 1276 (3d Cir. 1970); United States v. Stayton, 408 F. 2d 559 (3d Cir. 1969) ; Pa. R. Crim. P. 320; ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty \u00a72.1 (Approved Draft, 1968); Note, Pre-Sentence Withdrawal of Guilty Pleas in Federal Courts, 40 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 759 (1965). In United States ex rel. Culbreath v. Rundle, supra, the Third Circuit stated: \u201cIt has been recognized under Pennsylvania and Federal law that a trial judge has discretion to refuse a request to retract a plea of guilty since there is no absolute right to withdraw such a plea. However, a request made before sentencing has been generally construed liberally in favor of the accused.\u201d Id. at 732 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).\nThe ABA Standards are in complete harmony with this view. The standards state: \u201c(b) In the absence of a showing that withdrawal is necessary to correct a manifest injustice, a defendant may not withdraw his plea of guilty or nolo contendere as a matter of right once the plea has been accepted by the court. Before sentence, the court in its discretion may allow the defendant to withdraw his plea for any fair a/nd just reason unless the prosecution has been substantially prejudiced by relicmce upon the defendants plea.\u201d ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Eelating to Pleas of Guilty \u00a72.1 (b) (Approved Draft, 1968). See also Commonwealth v. Neely, 449 Pa. 3, 4, 295 A. 2d 75, 76 (1972) (Eobbrts, J., concurring opinion).\nThus, in determining whether to grant a pre-sentence motion for withdrawal of a guilty plea, \u201cthe test to be applied by the trial courts is fairness and justice.\u201d United States v. Stayton, supra at 561. If the trial court finds \u201cany fair and just reason\u201d, withdrawal of the plea before sentence should be freely permitted, unless the prosecution has been \u201csubstantially prejudiced.\u201d ABA Standards Eelating to Pleas of Guilty, supra. As the Third Circuit noted: \u201cThe liberal rule for withdrawal of a guilty plea before sentence is consistent with the efficient administration of criminal justice. It reduces the number of appeals contesting the \u2018knowing and voluntariness\u2019 of a guilty plea, and avoids the difficulties of disentangling such claims. It also ensures that a defendant is not denied a right by trial by jury unless he clearly waives it.\u201d United States v. Young, 424 F. 2d 1276, 1279 (3d Cir. 1970).\nApplying these standards to the facts presented, it must be concluded that the trial court should have allowed withdrawal of appellant\u2019s guilty plea. Appellant stated, as his reason for the request, made before the degree of guilt hearing and prior to adjudication and sentence, \u201cI don\u2019t want to plead guilty to nothing 1 didn\u2019t do.\u201d Obviously, appellant, by this assertion of innocence\u2014so early in the proceedings\u2014offered a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for withdrawal of his plea. Moreover, on this record there is not even the slightest suggestion that the prosecution was in any sense \u201csubstantially prejudiced by reliance upon the defendant\u2019s plea.\u201d ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty, supra.\nJudgment of sentence reversed and a new trial granted.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones concurs in the result.\nAppellant also contends that (1) the guilty plea was not intelligently entered because appellant was not made aware of the nature and elements of felony murder and (2) the trial court violated due process when it refused to continue the final hearing in order to secure the presence of appellant\u2019s mother who was appellant\u2019s actual counselor. In view of our disposition, we need not decide these issues.\nThe commentary to the ABA Standards state: \u201cThe history of the criminal process in our system and the rights vested in an accused under the Constitution mark out certain basic decisions as belonging to the client; other decisions fall within the province of the lawyer. The requirement that the defendant personally enter a guilty plea and that it be voluntary and informed carries the implication that it is the defendant who must make the choice. See Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 493 (1962) ; Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220 (1926) ; Orfield, Criminal Procedure From Arrest to Appeal 294 (1947).\u201d ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Belating to the Defense Function \u00a75.2 at 238 (Approved Draft, 1971).",
