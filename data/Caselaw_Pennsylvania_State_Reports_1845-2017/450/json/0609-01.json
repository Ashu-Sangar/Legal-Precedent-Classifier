        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellant, Andrew Goosby, was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in a jury trial. Following denial of post-trial motions, sentence of three to six years imprisonment was imposed. This direct appeal followed and we affirm.\nAppellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based upon certain remarks by Wanda Darlene Ebron, a Commonwealth witness. Wanda, the victim\u2019s twelve year old daughter, stated at the conclusion of extensive cross-examination: \u201cThe Witness: All right. Why that man [defense counsel] keep trying to get me to say something? The Court : Now, Miss Wanda\u2014The Witness : I don\u2019t like him\u2014\u201d Defense counsel immediately requested a sidebar conference and moved for a mistrial.\nWe agree with the trial court that this remark was not so conducive to prejudice as to warrant the grant of a new trial. Our Superior Court has said and we agree: \u201cEvery unwise or irrelevant remark made in the course of a trial by a judge, a witness, or counsel does not compel the granting of a new trial. A new trial is required when the remark is prejudicial; that is, when it is of such a nature or substance or delivered in such a manner that it may reasonably be said to have deprived the defendant of a fair and impartial trial. Com. v. Hales, 384 Pa. 153, 154, 119 A. 2d 520; Com. v. Stallone, supra, 281 Pa. 41, 44, 126 A. 56; Com. v. Savor, 180 Pa. Superior Ct. 469, 119 A. 2d 849, affirmed in 386 Pa. 523, 126 A. 2d 444; Com. v. Meyers, 290 Pa. 573, 581, 139 A. 374.\u201d Commonwealth v. Phillips, 183 Pa. Superior Ct. 377, 382, 132 A. 2d 733, 736 (1957) (emphasis added). Here, the statement, perhaps a natural response of a youthful witness to lengthy cross-examination, was directed at defense counsel, not appellant. Additionally, counsel admitted, at sidebar, that he was uncertain whether any juror heard the remark. In these circumstances, it cannot reasonably be said that Wanda\u2019s remark deprived appellant of a fair and impartial trial. Compare Commonwealth v. Horvath, 446 Pa. 11, 285 A. 2d 185 (1971) (improper remark severely prejudicial).\nAppellant also alleges that a comment made by the prosecutor in his summation requires a new trial. In summation, the prosecutor said \u201cwhen the defendant went over to the [victim\u2019s] house he had the gun in his pocket.\u201d Defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial arguing that there was no testimony indicating that appellant entered the home with the weapon in his possession. In our view, the trial court properly denied this motion.\nIt is clear that it is \u201cunprofessional conduct for the prosecutor intentionally to misstate the evidence or mislead the jury as to the inferences it may draw.\u201d ABA Project on Standards for .Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function, \u00a75.8 (Approved Draft, 1971). See also Commonwealth v. Revty, 448 Pa. 512, 295 A. 2d 300 (1972); Commonwealth v. Dickerson, 406 Pa. 102, 176 A. 2d 421 (1962). \u201c[T]he District Attorney must limit his statements to the facts in evidence and legitimate inferences therefrom.\u201d Commonwealth v. Revty, supra at 516, 295 A. 2d at 302. See also Commonwealth v. White, 442 Pa. 461, 275 A. 2d 75 (1971); Commonwealth v. Dickerson, supra; Commonwealth v. Crittenton, 326 Pa. 25, 191 Atl. 358 (1937); ABA Standards, supra.\nReview of the record here satisfies us that the prosecutor limited his statements to \u201cthe facts in evidence and legitimate inferences therefrom.\u201d Commonwealth v. Revty, supra. Appellant\u2019s own statement to the police\u2014not here challenged\u2014gives rise to the inference that he entered the house with the gun in his pocket. There, appellant related his version of the events: \u201c[I] \u2018went to Lucy\u2019s house to talk about her daughter and my daughter, Rayetta, fighting. I went to her door and the door was part way open. I said to her apart her daughter\u2019 . . . \u2018fighting with my daughter and said she was tired of this shit and said her daughter, Darlene, was not even home on Sunday when this was supposed to have happened. She kept hollering and. slapped me in the face. I pushed her down in a chair and she rolled onto the floor. She got up from the floor and she said, \u201cYou just wait and see.\u201d And she went into the kitchen. She was grabbing for a knife on the sink when I shot her the first time. She picked up the knife and started toward me and my wife, and I fired again. She kept coming and I emptied the gun, and she went right past me and out the door. I went out after her and she was talking to a guy who was fixing his truck, and she was saying \u201cPlease help me, he shot me.\u201d I then went into the back door of my house and out the front and kept going.\u2019 \u201d\nOne could reasonably infer from this statement that appellant had the gun when he entered the house. The challenged remark by the prosecutor was well within the permissible range of prosecutorial conduct and did not deprive appellant of a fair trial. Moreover, the trial court carefully instructed the jurors that it is their recollection of the facts\u2014not counsel\u2019s\u2014which controls, for they are the \u201csole judges of the facts.\u201d\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.",
