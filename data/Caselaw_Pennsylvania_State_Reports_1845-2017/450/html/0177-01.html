In <em>Taggart, </em>supra, the Court said: “There is no express additional authority given to the insurance commissioner, substituted simply as a liquidator for a receiver appointed by the court. No sound reason suggests itself, and none has been advanced, why his authority should be more extensive than a receiver formerly had. His duties are the same and Ms power should be subject to the same limitations.” Id. at 327-28, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%2068" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="165 A. 68">165 Atl. at 71</a>.

L. 682, art. VIII, §804 (1971), approved the very policies which he now seeks to ignore. Those policies contain a mandatory one year limitation. That specific contractual provision is sufficient to preclude the result which the trial court reached. So too, the Commissioner is estopped from denying the applicability of the one year limitation. In <em>Walsonavich v. United States, </em><a href="/f2d/335/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="335 F.2d 96" data-case-ids="150416" data-case-paths="/f2d/335/0096-01">335 F. 2d 96</a> (3d Cir. 1964), the court stated: “The <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>general rule regarding estoppel against the Government has been that the United States is not estopped by the acts of its officers and agents who without authority enter into agreements to do what the law does not sanction or permit; that those dealing with an agent of the Government must be held to have notice of limitations of his authority. . . . But as we said in Ritter (at p. 267) : ‘The acts or omissions of the officers of the government, if they be authorized to bind the United States in a particular transaction, will work estoppel against the government, if the officers have acted within the scope of their authority’. And as we have above noted the Commissioner had the authority in this instance to enter into the agreement. It seems to us it necessarily follows that the Government should not be permitted either to accord the agreement only a limited effect or to abandon it entirely.” <a href="/f2d/335/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="335 F.2d 96" data-case-ids="150416" data-case-paths="/f2d/335/0096-01">Id. at 101</a> (citations omitted).

While that reasoning has first blush appeal, further reflection requires me to reject it.</p>
    <p id="b233-3" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[140,432,1153,1250]]]'>My view that the insurance commissioner may disregard the one-year limitation on assessments contained in the policy does not mean that I am not sympathetic with the plight of appellants, who may now learn for the first time that they cannot rely on a provision contained in the policy or who may even, as is alleged, be learning for the first time that they can be assessed at all. The insurance department of the Commonwealth should not have approved the one-year restriction contained in the policy. Moreover, the department should have insured that the policy contained a clea,r explanation to all policyholders that if they purchase a policy of a mutual insurance company, they will be assessed if the company is unable to pay its claims. Nevertheless, the statutory provision for contingent assessment of premiums was designed to protect the claimants and creditors of a dissolved company. In the conflict between these innocent claimants and the policyholders who previously received the economic benefits of coverage by mutual insurance policies, the statute makes clear that it is the policyholders who must bear the cost of these claims, to the extent of amounts they previously paid in premiums.</p>

The majority distinguishes this case from <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Schnader v. Keystone Ind. Exchange, </em><a href="/pa/335/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="335 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1193013" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0333-01">335 Pa. 333</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.2d%20821" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="8 A.2d 821">8 A. 2d 821</a> (1939), because the policy language approved by the commissioner in <em>Keystone </em>forbade the imposition of assessments. The majority reasons that such policy language was contrary to the statute and was beyond the power of approval of the insurance commissioner. I believe that the instant policy language is equally <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>beyond the power of the insurance commissioner because the administrative machinery necessary to calculate and impose assessments within a one year period from the appointment of a statutory liquidator does not exist. In <em>Kelly v. Bremmerman, </em><a href="/citations/?q=260%20N.Y.S.2d%20971" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="260 N.Y.S.2d 971">260 N.Y.S. 2d 971</a> (1965), the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York was faced with a similar problem involving the very insurance commissioner who is the statutory liquidator in the case at bar. There, the defendant complained that the action for collection of the assessment had been commenced nearly eleven years after his liability for assessment would have expired under the terms of his insurance policy and twelve years after the order of liquidation. His argument was that the action had been unreasonably delayed. The court there recognized that a longer period than the one-year period allowed by the policy language might be required for the levying of assessments. In that case, six years had elapsed between the last date for filing claims against the defunct carrier and the entry of the order of assessment. The court did not hold that the claim was invalid, but instead remanded the matter to the trial court for a determination of whether the delay in securing the order of assessment was unreasonable, recognizing that the one-year limitation provided by the policy could not be strictly enforced.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[185,1742,1158,591]],["BL_235.1",235,[133,341,1152,596]]]'>In the instant case, we are not totally without a guide as to the reasonableness of the time lapse of slightly more than six years between the dissolution order and the petition for the assessment order. The General Assembly recognized the problems inherent in permitting lengthy delays in assessment processes and enacted, in 1970, §509.1 of The Insurance Department Act of 1921. That act states that no assessment may be made after five years from the expiration date of the policy. However, that section does not apply to the assessments of members of companies which were dissolved <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>before the effective date of the act. Section 509.1(f), 40 P.S. §209.1 (f). From that enactment it is readily observable that the General Assembly does not consider five years to be an unreasonable length of time to be consumed in the assessment processes. That being the case, I cannot state as a matter of law that an insurance commissioner, not faced with such a statutory deadline, was acting unreasonably in consuming six years and two months in conducting the highly technical and complex business of calculating the assessments required to be imposed in this case.</p>
