    <p id="b76-9" data-blocks='[["BL_76.15",76,[201,1518,1157,472]]]'>On January 12, 1971, Bruce Carlisle, a four-month-old infant, was found dead by members of the Philadelphia Police Department responding to an emergency call from the residence of appellant, Margaret Boykin. A police officer observed a large spot of what appeared to be “dried blood” on the appellant’s white blouse. A post-mortem examination of the infant’s body, conducted by the medical examiner, disclosed that the infant died from “suffocation”.</p>
    <p id="b76-10" data-blocks='[["BL_76.16",76,[201,2011,1157,319]],["BL_77.1",77,[183,330,1151,476]]]'>The following day, appellant, who had been caring for the baby for some weeks prior to his death, was interrogated by the Philadelphia Police Department Homicide Division, concerning the death. Appellant was given the required warnings, after which she gave a statement, which was typed by a police detective, in <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>which she admitted that she had held the baby’s head, against her chest to stop him from crying. In this statement, she conceded that she had held the baby “excessively tight” but stated that she did not realize this until she noticed blood from the baby’s nose on her blouse. In her signed statement, she admitted that earlier versions she had given the police orally concerning the incident “were lies”. This statement was signed at 3:10 a.m.</p>
    <p id="b77-3" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[184,825,1150,420]]]'>Three and one-half hours later, appellant orally admitted to a detective that when she held the infant tightly against her shoulder, she knew that “it would smother him”. She further admitted that she “deliberately smothered” the infant. Following the oral admission of her culpability for the death of Bruce Car-lisle, she orally confessed to the deliberate smotherings of two other infants.</p>
    <p id="b77-4" data-blocks='[["BL_77.5",77,[183,1265,1150,537]]]'>Appellant was indicted on charges stemming from the deaths of each of the three infants. The three cases were severed, on motion of appellant’s counsel, and having waived a jury trial, appellant was tried nonjury on October 27, 1971, on the indictments relating to the death of Bruce Carlisle. After a four-day trial, appellant was adjudged guilty of voluntary manslaughter. After denial of her post-trial motions, appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment not to exceed ten years. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b77-5" data-blocks='[["BL_77.6",77,[183,1814,1150,535]]]'>Appellant first argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict. However, the appellant’s oral admission that she knowingly smothered the infant and the medical examiner’s testimony that suffocating was, in fact, the cause of the infant’s death, amply support the court’s verdict. Consequently, the principal question in this case is whether appellant’s oral confession was properly admitted into evidence. Appellant raises two separate contentions in her challenge to the admissibility of her confession.</p>
    <p id="b78-3" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[166,331,1157,646]]]'>
      <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>She first contends that the statement should not have been admitted because her purported waiver of her rights to remain silent and to have the advice of counsel was constitutionally ineffective because she had not been informed of the nature of the crime for which she was being questioned. In support of this contention, appellant emphasizes that at the pretrial suppression hearing, the Commonwealth’s police witnesses admitted that they had never told appellant specifically that she was suspected of having murdered the Carlisle baby. Instead, she was simply told the officers “were investigating the [baby’s] death”.</p>
    <p id="b78-4" data-blocks='[["BL_78.5",78,[165,988,1157,317]]]'>Appellant relies on our opinion in <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em> </em>it is easily distinguishable from the instant case. Here, the evidence shows that the appellant was told, more than once, that the police were investigating the death of the Carlisle baby. We believe that this is sufficient to alert the appellant to the fact that she was involved in a possible criminal homicide case, since she knew that the police would not have investigated the baby’s death unless a crime were suspected. The fact that the appellant was not told that the police suspected that a specific degree of homicide, or negligent manslaughter, had been committed makes no difference. Before the appellant made her oral confession, the police could only suspect that the baby’s death was caused by some criminal conduct. They had no valid reason for specifying that they suspected an intentional rather than a negligent homicide.</p>

    <p id="b79-3" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[129,1046,1149,482]]]'>As we said in <em>Commonwealth v. Gockley, supra, </em>at 454, quoting from <em>Kravitz, supra: </em>“The corpus delicti, like other facts, may be shown by circumstantial evidence; it is sufficient if these circumstances are consistent with crime even though they are also consistent with suicide or <em>accident; </em>if it were otherwise, it would be impossible in many cases, where there were no eyewitnesses, to convict a criminal: [citing cases].” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b79-4" data-blocks='[["BL_79.5",79,[129,1541,1150,317]]]'>In this case, where the medical examiner found that the infant died from suffocation, which cause of death was consistent with both criminal homicide and accident, the Commonwealth offered sufficient proof of the corpus delicti to establish its right to offer the appellant’s extrajudicial statement into evidence.</p>

The examiner’s conclusion that the baby died from suffocation was reached independently from the police reports. The reports only led him to conclude that the suffocation was from “unnatural” means. As we have already said, evidence that the cause of death was suffocation, whether “natural” or “unnatural” is sufficient to render the appellant’s extrajudicial statements admissible.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[203,825,1157,320]]]'>Appellant makes one more allegation of error.

    <p id="b80-5" data-blocks='[["BL_80.6",80,[197,1154,1162,1198]]]'>Appellant argues that this testimony should not have been admitted under the general rule outlined in <em>Commonwealth v.

But it is also true that sometimes there exist the ‘special circumstances’ which operate as exceptions to the general rule, and bring the case within the equally well established principle that evidence of other crimes <em>is </em>admissible when it tends to prove a common scheme, plan or design embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to prove the others or to establish the identity of the person charged with the commission of the crime on trial,—in other words where there is such a logical connection between the crimes that proof of one will naturally tend to show that the accused is the person who committed the other.” (Emphasis in original.)</p>
    <p id="b81-2" data-blocks='[["BL_81.3",81,[164,332,1150,750]]]'>
      <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>In its brief, the Commonwealth argues that the evidence was not presented to show appellant’s “propensity to commit infanticides”. Bather, the Commonwealth contends that it was offered to rebut the appellant’s denial on cross-examination that she had admitted smothering the other babies. However, if evidence of the other two incidents were otherwise inadmissible, then it would be equally improper to permit cross-examination concerning these other incidents. Therefore, we must decide whether evidence of the other two occurrences, whether by cross-examination or by direct testimony concerning the appellant’s previous admissions, was properly admissible under the rule enunciated in <em>Wable.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b81-3" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[166,1104,1150,911]]]'>Evidence of previous crimes is generally inadmissible because its tendency to prejudice a jury unfairly usually outweighs its tendency to prove a material fact at issue. In this case, the real issue was whether the Carlisle infant suffocated by accident or as a result of the appellant’s deliberate conduct. The appellant’s admissions that two other infants who suffocated while in her care died as a result of her deliberate acts, in smothering the infants to keep them from crying, matches the explanation she previously gave in this case and indicates that the three infanticides are logically related by a “common motive or design”. The fact of these previous admissions is logically relevant to a determination of whether her original admission of guilt in this case is to be believed or whether, as she contends, the Carlisle baby’s death was due to an innocent accident.</p>

The person for whose death a prosecution is instituted may be alive, so evidence that he or she is in fact dead is imperative. As death may have resulted from a cause other than a felonious act, there must be evidence that it occurred under circumstances which point to the commission of a crime. In this manner the corpus delicti is shown. In some states the term corpus delicti includes only the first of the above elements, namely, an injury or loss. But in this and most of the states it covers in addition criminal agency causing the injury or loss.” (Citations omitted.)</p>

First, the Commonwealth had no affirmative obligation to exclude the possibility of accident or suicide in establishing the corpus delicti. Secondly, the Commonwealth had an affirmative duty to produce evidence that the death resulted from a criminal agency. These aspects of the rule are not mutually exclusive. The reason for the rule is set forth in <em>Puglise, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth v. Gray, </em><a href="/pa/71/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="71 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="1031223" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0495-01">71 Pa. at </a>386: “While it is familiar law that a confession is not evidence in the absence of proof of the corpus <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>delicti, yet I am not aware of any case which, holds that the corpus delicti must first be proved beyond the possibility of doubt. It is a fact to be proved like any other fact in the cause, and be found by the jury upon competent evidence. The true rule in such cases is believed to be this: When the Commonwealth has given sufficient evidence of the corpus delicti to entitle the case to go to the jury, it is competent to show a confession made by the prisoner connecting him with the crime.” <a href="/pa/276/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="276 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1077732" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0235-01">276 Pa. at 238-239</a>.

I believe that these cases do not provide support for the majority’s position. Admittedly, the three decisions referred to the portion of the rule indicating that the Commonwealth had no duty to exclude accident or suicide; however, I do not feel that there is anything in these decisions that repudiates the remainder of the rule that requires the Commonwealth to establish affirmatively the criminal agency. In <em>Kostan </em>and <em>Ooelcley, </em>it was contended that the Commonwealth had <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>failed to establish a corpus sufficient to justify the admission of a confession or admission because it had failed to eliminate the possibility of an accident. The court in these decisions properly referred to the portion of the rule that eliminated the necessity of this requirement. It is, however, significant to note that in each of these decisions there was more than sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that death had in fact resulted from a criminal agency. In <em>G-ockley </em>the decedent’s body was found buried on the defendant’s premises and his body contained shotgun discs, wadding and pellets. In <em>Kostan, </em>there was direct testimony that a co-defendant had struck the deceased over the left side of the head with a club the size of a policeman’s mace knocking the decedent to the ground. The defendant in that case was then observed striking the deceased with a beer bottle over the right side of the head causing the bottle to break. The medical testimony established that the decedent died of shock and intracranial hemorrhage following a fracture of the skull.</p>

This obviously is not the rule and was properly rejected. Here also, there was no question of the sufficiency of evidence offered to allow a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the deceased had died from a criminal agency. Equally significant is that none of the defendants in the cases relied upon by the majority raised the question as to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove criminal agency. It is my belief, after an exhaustive review of the cases in this jurisdiction on the subject, that there is absolutely no precedent for the majority’s present decision to reduce the burden of proof necessary for the Commonwealth to establish a death resulting from a criminal agency.</p>

Considering the evidence in this case, the majority admits in footnote 2 that the testimony of the medical examiner to the effect that the baby died from “unnatural means” was based on his reading of the police report which indicated that the defendant had admitted to deliberately suffocating the baby. The only competent medical evidence, therefore, is completely neutral on the issue of the presence of criminal agency. Excluding information derived from the confession, the only evidence tending to show criminal agency is the fact that the appellant had custody of the baby at the time of the death, and that the appellant was observed Avearing a blouse with what appeared to be a spot of dried blood.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>
