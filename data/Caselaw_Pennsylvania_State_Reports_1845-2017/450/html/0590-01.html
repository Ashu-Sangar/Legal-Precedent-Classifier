A timely filed pretrial motion to suppress evidence was heard and denied. In February, 1971, appellant’s first trial resulted in a mistrial, due to the jury’s inability to reach a verdict. Thereafter, at a second trial in March of 1971, appellant was found guilty of burglary and larceny and not guilty of receiving stolen goods. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to serve a 6 month to three year term of imprisonment.</p>

Upon arriving, the officers entered the building, whereupon they discovered that the rear door to a first floor apartment had been forced open. A search of the area yielded no clues. The officers then departed. While outside, however, they noticed a man, later identified as appellant, walking down an alley which runs parallel to Chestnut Street. The appellant looked towards the officers, and then began to run in the direction in which he had been walking. The officers gave chase, and approximately two blocks later, rediscovered appellant, again walking. The officers stopped their vehicle and called for appellant to come over, which appellant then did voluntarily. Officer Reid asked appellant his name, and “patted him down.” This search yielded a knife, and appellant was arrested. The officers then conducted a full search and discovered on appellant’s person a number of items which were later identified as having been taken from the burglarized <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>apartment.
