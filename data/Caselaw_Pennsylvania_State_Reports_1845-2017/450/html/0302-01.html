For example, if a testator desired to leave Ms entire taxable estate of $500,000 to B, either as a specific devise or as a residuary one, the inheritance tax due (taxed at 15%) would be $75,000. However, if that same gift to B is divided into a specific devise of $400,000 and a residuary gift of $100,000, under the method employed by the court below, the tax on the same total gift of $500,000 would be $66,000. The court below would reach that result by first determining the tax on the specific devise to be $60,000 (15% of $400,000). It would then subtract this tax from the $100,000 residuary gift, leaving a taxable residuary value of $40,000 ($100,000 gift less $60,000 tax) which produces a tax of $6,000 (15% of $40,000). Thus, the total tax liability, on the orphans’ court theory, would be $66,000, rather than $75,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Inheritance and <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>Estate Tax Act neither authorizes nor permits such an unrealistic tax result.</p>

    <p id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.14",358,[171,787,1159,859]]]'>I dissent. The Constitution of the Commonwealth, Article 8, Section 1, requires that taxes shall be uniform on the same class of subjects. The inheritance tax is a tax on the transfer of a decedent’s property. It is the act of transferring that is the subject of taxation. Act of June 15, 1961, P. L. 373, art. II, §201, 72 P.S. 2485-201. The state has a right to full taxes on the total property being transferred. The state does not have a right to determine that a specific devisee or legatee will pay <em>no taxes </em>and the devisee or legatee of the residuary estate will pay <em>double taxes. </em>This result is what the majority approves. A law which taxed only residuary <em>transfers </em>and not specific <em>transfers </em>would involve classifications as to subjects of taxation which would be completely unreasonable. The same result cannot be allowed indirectly.</p>
    <p id="b358-7" data-blocks='[["BL_358.15",358,[177,1658,1155,208]],["BL_359.1",359,[170,352,1150,253]]]'>As the majority states, prior to the amendment of Section 718(a) each person paid a proportionate share of the inheritance transfer tax according to one’s proportionate share in the property transferred—whether <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>by specific devise or bequest or by residuary devise or bequest. The amendment to Section 718(a) is an unconstitutional provision violating the uniformity clause unless it is interpreted so that the residuary legatee or devisee does not suffer double taxation.</p>
    <p id="b359-4" data-blocks='[["BL_359.5",359,[168,626,1151,1120]]]'>The majority speaks of anomalous tax consequences and mathematically attempts to show unfairness to the state. Nothing is said of the unfairness to the residuary legatee or devisee. Using the logic and mathematics of the majority we can illustrate another unfair result. If the transfer of a $500,000 estate, referred to by the majority, is by a specific bequest to “A” of $250,000 and a residuary bequest to “B” of $250,000, “A” would pay no taxes and “B” would pay (at 15%) $75,000. If the transfer of the same estate was to be in equal shares to “A” and “B”, each would pay $37,500. The majority is saying that in two identical estates, each involving $500,000, the state is entitled (at 15%) to a tax of $75,000. I agree. I cannot agree, however, that in one estate the $75,000 is to be paid by “B” with no tax to “A” and in the other estate “A” and “B” share the tax. Such a result in tax matters must always be pursuant to reasonable classifications which do not exist in this case. The uniformity article of the Constitution is clearly violated under the majority’s interpretation.</p>

It has no right to <em>arbitrarily </em>decide by statute or otherwise <em>who </em>will pay the tax.
