At a properly called meeting on January 3, 1972, the borough council undertook to fill that vacancy.

However, neither objection prevailed and council proceeded to vote on the nominees. Appellant voted for Burke, the non-council member. Bennett abstained from voting. Three council members voted for Romanus. Romanus voted for Bracken and Bracken voted for Romanus, giving Romanus a total of four votes out of seven.

Appellant contends that such a trade of votes is illegal, and thus invalidates council’s election of Romanus as mayor. Appellee, Romanus, filed preliminary objections in which, inter alia, he demurred to the complaint on the grounds that it failed to state a cause of action. The court below sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed. The main issue thus presented is whether, accepting as true all of appellant’s factual allegations, he has stated a cause of action which would <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>invalidate the election of John T.

Our Legislature has not spoken on this issue and thus absent any voting illegality or other impropriety there is no impediment to the authority of council to select a fellow council member to fill a vacancy in the office of mayor. The only statutory restriction placed upon council in filling such vacancies is that the new mayor must be “a registered elector of the borough.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It would indeed seem counterproductive and contrary to the public interest to establish for the first time a rule that one who has been elected by his fellow citizens, served on the council, and presumably has knowledge and experience in local governmental affairs is per se ineligible to fill a vacancy in the mayor’s office.

Such exercise of the appointive power is against public policy, and is void on its face, and the one so appointed, it has been said, is not even a de facto officer. . . .

Weissinger, </em><a href="/ky/140/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="140 Ky. 353" data-case-ids="4399391" data-case-paths="/ky/140/0353-01">140 Ky. 353</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20S.W.%2040" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="131 S.W. 40">131 S.W. 40</a> (1910). Meglemery was a member of the appointing body which appointed him to the office of bridge commissioner. Three days after his appointment, his term of office on the appointing board expired, thus he was only holding one office. He was subsequently removed from the office of bridge commissioner and he brought suit seeking reinstatement; the court refused reinstatement, relying on the aforesaid general rule stating: “As Meglemery was on December 31, 1909, a member of the body that appointed him to fill this place, the appointment was void for reasons of public policy that are both <em>sound </em>and sufficient. And so we have held that in cases like this the fiscal court cannot appoint one of its members to a place that carries with it duties and compensation. . . . Nor does the fact that his term expired within a few days after his appointment, or the fact that his duties would be prescribed and his <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>compensation allowed by a body of which he was not a member, or the fact that he was not present with the court when his appointment was made, have the effect of changing this salutary rule. The fact that the power to fix and regulate the duties and compensation of the appointee is lodged in the body of which he is a member is one, but not the only, reason why it is against public policy to permit such a body charged with the performance of public duties to appoint one of its members to an office or place of trust and responsibility. It is of the highest importance that municipal and other bodies of public servants should be free from every kind of personal influence in making appointments that carry with them services to which the public are entitled and compensation that the public must pay. And this freedom cannot in its full and fair sense be secured when the appointee is a member of the body and has the close opportunity his association and relations afford to place the other members under obligations that they may feel obligated to repay. Few persons are altogether exempt from the influence that intimate business relations enable associates to obtain, and few strong enough to put aside personal considerations in dispensing public favors. And it is out of regard for this human sentiment and weakness, and the fear that the public interest will not be so well protected if appointing bodies are not required to go outside their membership in the selection of public servants, that the rule announced has been adopted, and ought to be strictly applied.” Id. at 354-55, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20S.W.%2040" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="131 S.W. 40">131 S.W. at 41</a>. Hence, in adopting the general rule the <em>Meglemery </em>court recognized that to operate effectively municipal appointive bodies must be free from every Mnd of personal interest, or influence. The central theme of the importance of freedom from influence when a person exercises judgment under his public trust was carried forward by the courts of New York in the case of <em>Wood </em>

In this case the Delaware Court was faced with a factual situation strikingly similar to the one at hand. In <em>McDaniel, </em>a vacancy existed in the office of mayor of the city of New Castle, one of the members of the city council had been appointed by the council to fill the vacancy. There was a statute which prohibited this action and to avoid the statute, McDaniels resigned as a member of the council and left the council room, he was then nominated and elected by the council to the office of mayor. Although this action met the requirements of the statute, the court ousted McDaniels from the office relying on the phili sophy of the aforementioned common law general rule, stating: “Both the common law and the statute demand that the power of appointment be exercised fairly and impartially. In order to attain tMs purpose it is important that the deliberations of the appointing body not only be free from wrongdoing but free from suspicion of wrong as well. Meglemery v. Wiessinger, <a href="/ky/140/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="140 Ky. 353" data-case-ids="4399391" data-case-paths="/ky/140/0353-01">140 Ky. 353</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20S.W.%2040" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="131 S.W. 40">131 S.W. 40</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20L.R.A.N.S.%20575" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="31 L.R.A.N.S. 575">31 L.R.A., N.S. 575</a>; Parrish v.

    <p id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[168,1260,1150,261]],["BL_454.1",454,[179,326,1162,2012]],["BL_455.1",455,[157,334,1149,307]]]'>In accordance with the views expressed by these courts, I would herein adopt the general rule that a member of an appointing body is not eligible for appointment to an office by that body. I view this rule as best suited to protect the general public and the <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>appointing bodies. For the protection of the public, it is necessary that officers holding an office under a public trust must exercise their best judgment at all times. For a situation to exist where influence resulting from close personal contact is exercisable by one member of a body upon another leaves the public in a position where it could possibly be deprived of adequate representation and good government in the best interest of the citizenry of a government unit. Likewise, this rule protects the members of the appointing body. When the body is forced to go outside its membership to select an appointee, there can be no suspicion of bias or partiality resulting from the close working association between the members of the appointing body. In the instant case, there is an allegation of trading votes, which raises the suspicion that the members of the Council were acting for their own interest, rather than that of the public. Whether or not there was a trade of votes is not the question before me, and I in no way pass upon this question. I recognize, however, that this type of allegation raises great problems, since the only parties who can answer this question are those involved. If the parties deny the allegations, doubt may still exist in the eyes of the public, and the faith in the performance of their local government may be severely shaken. Once this form of allegation is raised, the parties involved can never rid themselves of the suspicion attached to the allegation, whether it is true or not, and this is to be avoided. Consequently, I believe it is in the best interest of all concerned to adopt the general rule. The majority apparently believes the adoption of such a general rule would bar indefinitely a councilman from running for the office of mayor. Such a rule would in no way cause such an unjust result. A councilman would not be barred from running for the office in the next general election, he would only be foreclosed from being ap<a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>pointed to the interim vacancy. The two situations are distinctly different, for in the first the voting public controls the outcome of the filling of the office, in the latter there is the possibility of personal influence or bias, or at least a suspicion thereof, and these possibilities should be foreclosed.</p>
    <p id="b455-4" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[157,662,1149,364]]]'>Furthermore, appellee and the majority argue the statute itself makes him eligible for appointment, since the statute merely says the Council must appoint a “registered elector of the Borough,” which he is.

    <p id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.6",455,[154,1048,1151,754]]]'>I believe this question is controlled by a rule which has its foundation on strong public policy, and to override such a policy there must be an explicit statutory directive.

It is clear that one individual, i.e., a mayor, cannot appoint himself to an office. This rule was stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Douglass, </em><a href="/binn/1/0077-02" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="1 Binn. 77" data-case-ids="1787901,1787927" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0077-02,/binn/1/0077-01">1 Bin. 77</a> (1803) : “One having a discretionary authority to appoint a fit person to a public office appointing himself, seems a solecism in terms; and it cannot be deemed the fulfillment of his duty.” <a href="/binn/1/0077-02" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="1 Binn. 77" data-case-ids="1787901,1787927" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0077-02,/binn/1/0077-01">Id. at 84</a>.

If the personal interest of one man having the appointing power creates disqualification so that he cannot appoint himself, viewing the appointing board as one entity, why then should the board be allowed to appoint itself, or at least a part of itself, i.e., one member, to an office. In the <em>Whitehall </em>case, supra, the court adopted this approach in the foUowing language: “Viewing the question from another aspect, the same result is arrived at. When the members of the board are given the appointing power, it seems necessarily implied in that power that they cannot appoint themselves. The situation is not different in principle from where the appointing power, instead of being vested in a board is vested in a single official. The mayors of most of our cities, for example, have the power to appoint a superintendent of public works, a city attorney, and various other functionaries. It has never occurred to anyone to argue that a mayor thus situated may appoint himself to these various offices, or to any one of them. How is the situation different where the appointing power is vested, not in a single individual, but in a board consisting of a half dozen individuals? Each one is a part of the board. If the board appoints one of its own members, it appoints itself, or a part of itself. It cannot be material whether the part of the board appointed participates in the act of appointment. It is still the act of the board, and, as the appointee is a member of it, the board appoints part of itself, the same as if he had actively aided. His own participation cannot matter. He has as much right to assist in the appointment of his own entity as the board has to assist in the appointment of a part of its entity.” 120 Mise. Rep. 125-26, 197 N.X.S. 791.</p>
