In a subsequent hearing, guilt was fixed at murder in the first degree and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed. Although no appeal was taken from that judgment of sentence, the appellant has pursued various collateral remedies in the intervening years.</p>

After an evidentiary hearing, the petition was denied. An appeal to this Court from that denial was dismissed for <em>non prosequitur.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[184,760,1155,860]]]'>Appellant then petitioned the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that he had not been represented by counsel at the Juvenile Court hearing after which he had been bound over for trial as an adult, and further that his guilty plea was the product of a coerced confession. The District Court ordered a <em>de novo </em>certification proceeding, during which the court of common pleas determined that appellant had been properly bound over for trial. The District Court then considered appellant’s additional allegation, specifically found that the confession was not involuntary by then existing standards, and denied relief; the Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>United States ex rel.

After an evidentiary hearing, the court below denied the petition, finding as a fact that “defendant entered his guilty plea, while represented by counsel, knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. . . .” Appeal of that denial comes to us under the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, July 31, <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>1970, P.
