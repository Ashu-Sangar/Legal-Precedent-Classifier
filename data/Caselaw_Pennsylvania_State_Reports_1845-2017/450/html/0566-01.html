However, at some point in the questioning “all <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>of the surrounding circumstances—the duration and conditions of detention . . ., the manifest attitude of the police toward him, his physical and mental state, the diverse pressures which sap or sustain his powers of resistance and self-control—is relevant” and may serve to render any statement or confession involuntary. <em>Culombe, </em>supra at 602, <a href="/us/367/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="367 U.S. 568" data-case-ids="1785545" data-case-paths="/us/367/0568-01">81 S. Ct. at 1879</a>; <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v.

    <p id="b624-4" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[209,764,1159,1155]]]'>Moreover, this Court has emphasized that when “[t]he questions in the voluntariness area have passed beyond the physical coercion stage to the much more difficult area of psychological coercion ... a close analysis of all the surrounding circumstances is necessary,” <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, </em>supra, and that “the test for an involuntary confession, must concern itself with those elements impinging upon a defendant’s will.” <em>Commonwealth v. Baity, </em><a href="/pa/428/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="428 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1912397" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0306-01">428 Pa. 306</a>, 315 n.7, <a href="/citations/?q=237%20A.2d%20172" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="237 A.2d 172">237 A. 2d 172</a>, 177 n.7 (1968). Thus in the instant case we must weigh all the factors influencing appellant’s will at the time he made his statement. The record evinces <em>uncontradicted </em>evidence that appellant, a 20-year-old with a tenth grade education, was isolated for several periods of time; that upon his initial interrogation he refused to admit involvement in the shooting; that eleven hours later when told by the police he would get more lenient treatment if he confessed, he signed an incriminating statement; and that he was not arraigned until some twenty-five hours after arrest.</p>
    <p id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.6",624,[207,1940,1156,377]]]'>The combination of all these factors based on the Commonwealth’s uncontradicted evidence constituted a subtle but nonetheless powerful form of impermissible psychological coercion. See <em>Spano v. New York, </em><a href="/us/360/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="360 U.S. 315" data-case-ids="8889" data-case-paths="/us/360/0315-01">360 U.S. 315</a>, <a href="/us/360/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="360 U.S. 315" data-case-ids="8889" data-case-paths="/us/360/0315-01">79 S. Ct. 1202</a> (1959). We conclude that appellant’s signed statement was involuntary and should therefore have been suppressed.</p>
