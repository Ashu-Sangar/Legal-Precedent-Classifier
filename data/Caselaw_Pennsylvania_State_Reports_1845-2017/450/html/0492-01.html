    <p id="b543-7" data-blocks='[["BL_543.10",543,[157,1203,1151,594]]]'>The facts relevant to the motion to withdraw may be summarized as follows: In May, 1970, appellant, Efrain Santos, was charged with murder. In October of the same year, after meeting with the district attorney and his own counsel, the appellant entered a plea of guilty to voluntary manslaughter which was accepted by the trial court after a determination that Santos possessed both a familiarity -with the English language<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and an awareness of the consequences of his plea. Sentencing was deferred pending a presentence investigation.</p>

R. Crim. P. 320,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in which appellant alleged that although the term “voluntary” was used by the court to describe the charge, he thought he was pleading guilty to the crime <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>of involuntary manslaughter. Appellant attributes his mistaken impression to either a breakdown in verbal communications due to his limited command of the English language or a misunderstanding of the legal terminology employed by counsel and the court. He asserts that he realized the mistake when he read a newspaper account of the entry of his plea of guilty to the crime of voluntary manslaughter. At the hearing on his motion to withdraw the plea, the appellant consistently maintained that he thought he had pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter. Nevertheless, the trial court denied his motion and sentenced him to a term of six to twelve years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>
