All of defendant’s evidence plus the testimony he elicited on cross-examination was consistent with the asserted claim for acquittal on self-defense. Moreover, in requesting points for charge, defense counsel submitted 12 points, all relating to self-defense. It is evident from this record that counsel’s defense strategy was fashioned and patterned for acquittal based on self-defense. This was, indeed, the defense blueprint for trial and submission of its position to the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Nowhere does the record reveal any attempt or plan to have the jury return an alternative verdict of voluntary manslaughter.

The de<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>fense neither requested a manslaughter charge nor objected to the one the court gave—desiring not to have the manslaughter verdict presented or emphasized to the jury.

    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[186,688,1154,1109]]]'>Viewing this defense strategy as it developed during the trial and prior to the verdict, it is clear that here, just as in <em>McGrogan, </em>“counsel sought to limit the jury’s options to either finding first or second degree murder or outright acquittal.” <em>McGrogan, </em>supra at 590, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20456" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="297 A.2d 456">297 A. 2d at 459</a>.

First, appellant contends <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>that eliciting on cross-examination that appellant had supplied the decedent with wine prior to the stabbing was unduly prejudicial and irrelevant.

    <p id="b329-3" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[164,731,1150,830]]]'>Secondly, appellant argues that he did not place his character in issue. Therefore evidence elicited by the Commonwealth showing that appellant did not pay any rent to the owner of the dwelling where he lived and where the stabbing occurred was an impermissible attack on his character, because it implied he was a “freeloader.” However, such cross-examination was not an attack on appellant’s character or reputation. Appellant’s theory of the case was self-defense. Thus, in order to show he had no duty to retreat when attacked by decedent, appellant sought to establish that he was in his own dwelling. The Commonwealth attempted to rebut this element of self-defense by proving that appellant paid no rent and thus was not in his own dwelling as he claimed at the time of the stabbing.</p>

Appellant was confronted in his bedroom by three police officers and informed he was under arrest. Before any of the officers said anything further appellant stated, “I was going to give myself up in the morning anyhow.” This statement appellant claims, should not have been admitted at trial over his objection.

The act of killing must, of course, be voluntary; the very name of the crime implies that. Because voluntary manslaughter involves an intentional act, confusion sometimes exists in the jury’s mind concerning the difference between that crime and the crime of first degree murder.

In <em>McGrogan </em>counsel failed to request an omitted voluntary manslaughter charge, while here counsel failed to object to an erroneous voluntary manslaughter charge. Both actions have the identical goal of seeking to limit the options available to the jury.</p>

The majority states that relief was denied in <em>Commonwealth v. Jennings, </em><a href="/pa/442/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="442 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="1935341" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0018-01">442 Pa. 18</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=274%20A.2d%20767" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="274 A.2d 767">274 A. 2d 767</a> (1971), because the appellant’s failure to take a specific exception to the erroneous charge foreclosed our consideration of the issue on appeal, as mandated by Pa. E. Crim. P. 1119(b). While the quote from <em>Jennings </em>is accurate, it is clearly out of context. Belief was denied Jennings, not because of the asserted failure of compliance with Eule 1119(b), but rather because a plurality of the Court concluded that the asserted error did not rise to the level of basic and fundamental. <em>Jennings </em>went on to state specifically that Eule 1119(b) did not change the law of Pennsylvania and that the basic and fundamental error rule, as summarized in <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/432/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="432 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1919746" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0557-01">432 Pa. 557</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20301" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="248 A.2d 301">248 A. 2d 301</a> (1968) still obtained in Pennsylvania.</p>

My dissent in <em>Jennings </em>was based upon my view that the asserted erroneous charge constituted basic and fundamental error. The instant case is distinguishable on its facts, and the record here supports the conclusion that trial strategy dictated the action of counsel at trial, and it is for that reason, and that reason alone, that I concur in the result reached by the majority.</p>
