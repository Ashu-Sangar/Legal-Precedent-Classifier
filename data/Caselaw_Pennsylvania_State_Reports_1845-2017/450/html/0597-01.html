Again, the empirical data <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>is to the contrary. See Lehrieh, supra at 239-40. In fact, mandatory disclosure, rather than protracting the sentencing proceedings, would have the opposite effect. Counsel, having had an opportunity to examine the report, would be aware of the information upon which the judge is relying and, thus, could effectively narrow the scope of argument to the relevant considerations. See Lehrieh, supra at 240; ABA Standards, supra, commentary at 222. So too, as a practical matter, it is unlikely that counsel would risk irritating the judge at this sensitive stage of the proceedings by employing dilatory tactics. See Amsterdam, Trial Manual for the Defense of Criminal Cases—II §468 (1971); Note, 58 Geo. L.J., supra at 423; Note, 81 Harv. L. Rev., supra at 841. It is our view that delay in the sentencing process is more readily prevented “by reasonable use of the court’s discretion to control its own proceedings”, Lehrieh, supra at 240, than by nondisclosure of the report.</p>

If a defendant sees psychological diagnoses of himself, it is said, he will be more resistant to successful treatment. Perhaps so, and perhaps genuine psychiatrists’ diagnoses should be shown only to defense counsel. But all to often pseudo-scientific characterizations of the defendant creep into the report by way of the probation officer. These are not genuine ‘diagnoses,’ and have little if any <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>medical validity.

The advocates of disclosure are influenced by the <em>“specter of the defendant serving an unjustifiably harsh sentence because a presentence report that he never saio and never had an opportunity to rebut misrepresented his personal history in one way or another. </em>This does not appeal* to be a misplaced concern. Even if probation officers were all extremely competent and had manageable case loads, stiH the law of averages would dictate that every once in a while a mistake—perhaps serious—would be made. And the sad fact is that many probation officers are not as competent as they really ought to be, and their case loads are in fact so burdensome that they cannot possibly give each case the time and care that it should receive. The President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice reports: ‘In most felony courts presentence reports are prepared, but they are of uneven quality and usefulness.’ ” Lehrich, supra at 241 (emphasis added).</p>
