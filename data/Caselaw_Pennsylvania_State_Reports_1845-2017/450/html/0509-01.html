Though the act of applying for federal funds was a public manifestation of the intent to adopt Early Action, we believe that the August 15, 1968, adoption of the Rapid Transit Committee’s recommendation of Early Action is the date more suited to the examination of whether a conflict of interest was present. Since the question whether a conflict existed must rest, to some extent, upon the determination of whether the Westinghouse study was influential in causing Early Action’s adoption, it must be determined when the Authority actually committed itself to the Program, not when it manifested its intent to the federal government.</p>

In fact, it seems that the consultant selection process could thus be turned to the advantage of plaintiffs’ viewpoint.</p>

There is no merit to either view.
