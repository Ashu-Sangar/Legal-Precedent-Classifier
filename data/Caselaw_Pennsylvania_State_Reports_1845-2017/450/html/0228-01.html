On November 12, 1947, the appellant, with her husband, executed an easement in favor of the appellee, The Manufacturers Light &amp; Heat Co. The easement authorized the construction of a 14 inch pipeline along a line which had been surveyed prior to the grant of the easement. In accordance with the easement the appellee constructed the 14 inch pipeline. For approximately 23 years there were no problems between the parties concerning the easement and the 14 inch pipeline.</p>

The appellant gave notice to the appellee not to enter her property. Appellee informed the appellant it was <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>acting within the rights granted to it under the 1947 easement agreement and the appellee then began construction of the 20 inch pipeline across appellant’s property.</p>
    <p id="b281-4" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[146,563,1149,606]]]'>Appellant filed a complaint in equity, and a preliminary injunction, halting construction, was granted against the appellee on October 29, 1970. On November 2, 1970, a hearing on the appellant’s motion to continue the injunction was held. Both parties agreed that this hearing would also serve as a hearing on the permanent injunction. At the conclusion of the November 2, hearing, the chancellor dissolved the preliminary injunction and refused to grant a permanent injunction. Exceptions filed by the appellant before the court en banc were dismissed and this appeal followed.</p>

Construction was completed between November 2, 1970, the date the preliminary injunction was dissolved and April 5, 1371, the date the court en banc dismissed appellant’s exceptions. Appellee claims that since the act to be restrained has been completed there is nothing for this court to decide. We disagree.</p>

This court, refusing to dismiss the appeal because the controlling question had become moot, stated, “More importantly, even assuming the correctness of appellee’s averment that the work . . . has been completed, this does not moot this litigation. Appellant’s prayer for relief in the court below did not seek only to restrain the defendant contractor from performing its duties under the contract, it also sought to restrain the defendant, Philadelphia Housing Authority, from performing its duties and, in addition, such other and further relief as may be deemed just and reasonable.”</p>

The easement which the appellee claims gave it the right to construct the 20 inch pipeline across the appellant’s land was created by a standard form grant used by the appellee. Before the grant was signed by the appellant and her husband, certain parts of appellee’s standard grant were crossed out by the appellant and her husband, who refused to sign the form grant as printed and presented to them. The crossing out was done by typing a series of lower case letter <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>“mis” over certain words in the standard form.

The same sentence which refers to the right to lay a 14 inch pipeline (singular) has a later reference to “said lines” (plural). The use of the plural “lines” makes no sense because the only previous reference has been to a “line” (singular). The writing is additionally ambiguous because other key words which are “also may change the size of its pipes” are dangling in that the possessive pronoun “its” before the word “pipes” does not have any subject preceding, to which the possessive pronoun refers. The dangling phrase is the beginning of a sentence, the first word of which does not begin with a capital letter as is customary in normal English usage. Immediately preceding the “sentence” which does not begin with a capital letter, there appears a dangling <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>semicolon which makes no sense at the beginning of a sentence and can hardly relate to the preceding sentence which is already properly punctuated by a closing period.</p>

We note, however, that in the instrument before the appearance of the phrase “. . . relaying . . . said pipe line . . .” there are two prior references to which “said pipe line” could refer. One of the prior references speaks of a “14 inch pipe line” laid “along a line which has been surveyed”. The other previous reference is to the confusing word “lines” (plural). The <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>ambiguity in the use of the plural “lines” becomes clear when we note that it appears after the first typed-over portion which reads “construct a telegraph and telephone line”.

In addition it would mean that, if in the future, the appellee wishes to construct a larger pipeline across the appellant’s property it could do so 10 feet to the west of the 20 inch pipeline and could do so by claiming it was “relaying” the 20 inch pipeline.</p>
