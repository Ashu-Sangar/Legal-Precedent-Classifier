He first contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States because of the many “tactical decisions” made at trial by his attorney which had neither a reasonable basis nor were designed to effectuate his best interests.

In essence he is claiming that counsel’s failure to rehearse appellant’s testimony prior to both the suppression hearing and trial resulted in certain inconsistencies with his written confession, which the prosecution later exploited. We cannot characterize counsel’s stewardship as ineffective merely because his client was unable to adhere to a consistent version of the facts. Certainly counsel’s decision to advise his client to take the stand in a murder case where counsel’s theory was self-defense was a reasonable and considered choice inasmuch as appellant was the only defense witness.</p>

Appellant argues that the trial court erred by giving the jury an unrequested additional instruction which coerced the jury to reach a guilty verdict. The jury had been sent out to begin deliberations at approximately 1:00 P.M. on September 11, 1969. Prior to reconvening on the morning of September 12,1969, and without any indication of a deadlock or potential deadlock the court presented the challenged charge to the jury.
