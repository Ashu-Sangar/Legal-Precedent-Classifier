The appellant, Withers Ponton, was later indicted for her murder, and after a jury trial was found guilty of murder in the first degree.

    </p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[179,663,1162,1090]]]'>First, appellant contends that a statement made by him to the police and introduced at trial over objection was made without adequate warning of his constitutional right to free counsel if he were indigent, <em>Miranda v. </em>Arizona, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">16 L. Ed. 2d 694</a> (1966); therefore, he argues, he could not have made a knowing and intelligent waiver of that right. Before being interrogated or giving any statement to the police, appellant was read the following warning from the standard police interrogation card: “If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, and you want one, we will see that you have a lawyer provided to you before we ask you any questions.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In order to ascertain appellant’s understanding of this right, the interrogating officer then asked “Do you understand that if you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, and you want one, we will not ask you any questions until a lawyer is provided for you?” Appellant answered “Yes”, thereby unequivocally acknowledging his understanding of the warning as presented.</p>

Where, as here, the explanation used by the police very clearly expresses the <em>Miranda, </em>warning and the accused responsively acknowledges his understanding of this explanation, we can detect no deviation from the holding or the intent of the <em>Miranda </em>decision. While there may occur cases where a warning, adequate on its face, is in fact not understood, or where a seemingly adequate warning is not in fact genuine, this is not such a case.</p>

While it may be good practice to include that phrase in the warning, all that is constitutionally required is that an indigent accused be informed that if he has insufficient funds to retain a lawyer, a lawyer will be provided for him. That standard was clearly satisfied in this case. See also, <em>Commonwealth v.

After the movie, at approximately 10:30 P.M., the deceased went to a neighborhood tavern in the company of appellant, who is six feet tall and weighs 164 pounds. They had a few drinks, and played shuffle bowling on a pinball macMne. The deceased was observed to place a Pall Mall cigarette, offered her by appellant, into her purse. The couple left the bar together at approximately 11:15 P.M.</p>

The victim’s face was covered with lacerations and abrasions, her skirt ivas hiked above her knees, and, as it was determined upon later examination, semen stains marked her underclothes. At 2:0G A.M., appellant approached another tavern in the Eoxborough area. The tavern keeper said appellant looked as though he had been in a fight and was wearing a bloodstained “T” shirt. At about 3 :45 A.M., appellant was discovered walking on a highway in the neighborhood by two policemen answering a call that there was a hospital case on the highway. Appellant had blood on his “T” shirt and blood on his hands and face.</p>

Dr. Marvin Aronson, Assistant Medical Examiner of the City of Philadelphia, testified unequivocally that the victim died from “blunt injuries of the face” and anoxia (an insufficiency of oxygen), and that the manner of death was homicide. He gave it as his opinion that, because of the deceased’s diminutive size, the anoxia could have been caused by someone lying on top of the victim with his chest over her face. Tests from the crime laboratory showed that the blood found on appellant’s “T” shirt matched that of the deceased and differed from his own. They also established that appellant’s undershorts were stained with semen.</p>

At the close of the testimony the defense had demurred to a separate voluntary manslaughter bill of indictment, and the demurrer had been sustained. Presumably this was a deliberate tactic on appellant’s part to enhance the chances of a verdict of acquittal by removing the opportunity for a compromise manslaughter verdict. Appellant cannot charge the court with error when the propriety of conviction for voluntary manslaughter had been removed from the case by his own motion.</p>

The warnings were unclear on this point and could reasonably have been interpreted by Marsh to mean that counsel would be provided at the time of trial. If Marsh did not clearly understand his right to have the assistance of counsel during the police questioning, he could not intelligently waive this important right and as to this right the record was barren with the exception of the warning given as detailed before.

In discussing the content of the necessary warnings, the United States Supreme Court cogently stated: “The warning of a right to counsel would be hollow if not couched in terms that would convey to the indigent—the person most often subjected to interrogation—the knowledge that he too has a right to have counsel present. As with the warnings of the right to remain silent and of the general right to counsel, <em>only by effective and express explanation to the indigent of this right can there be assurance that he was truly vn a position to exercise it. . . . </em>[I]f police propose to interrogate a person <em>they must make known to him </em>that he is entitled to a lawyer and that if he cannot afford one, a lawyer will be provided for him prior to any interrogation.” (Emphasis added.) <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">Id. at 473, 474</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S. Ct. at 1627, 1628</a>. This language makes it clear that what is constitutionally required is more than a mere formal recital of what a defendant’s constitutional rights are during in-custody interrogation. The Supreme Court made it mandatory that “only by effective and express explanation to the indigent” could the police “make known” his constitutional right and thereby assure “that he was truly in a position to exercise it.” In accord with the language and dictate of <em>Miranda </em>is the ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Jus<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>tice, Standards Relating to Providing Defense Services, §7.1 (Approved Draft 1968), which, states: “. . . The offer should be made in <em>words easily understood, </em>and it should be stated expressly that one who is unable to pay for adequate representation is entitled to have it provided <em>without cost to him. . . </em>.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
    <p id="b101-3" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[152,738,1149,491]]]'>To insure this constitutional objective of a knowing and intelligent decision by the defendant, the Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>explicitly required the application of federal standards for determining waiver to custodial interrogations: “This Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights, Johnson v. Zerbst, <a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">304 U.S. 458</a> (1938), and we reassert these standards as applied to in-custody interrogation.” <a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">Id. at 475</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.

    <p id="b101-4" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[151,1240,1149,266]]]'>It follows inexorably from <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Johnson v.

    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.6",101,[149,1519,1150,867]]]'>I am unable to make the distinction which the majority makes between <em>Marsh </em>and the instant case. The only essential difference in the two cases is that in <em>Marsh, </em>the defendant was told that if he could not afford counsel, counsel would be “obtained for him,” while in the case at bar, the defendant was told that if he could not afford to hire a lawyer, one would be “provided.” I see nothing in either case which would indicate an understanding on the part of the defendant that the lawyer “obtained” or “provided” would be compensated by the Commonwealth and not the defendant. If <em>Marsh </em>was wrongly decided, a view which I do not hold, it should be overruled rather than attempting to distinguish that case from the instant case, where the factual situations present what I believe to be a distinction without a difference.</p>
    <p id="b102-3" data-blocks='[["BL_102.4",102,[189,353,1156,765]]]'>
      <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>Furthermore, this case appears to be even stronger than <em>Marsh. </em>Here, the police who were doing the questioning advised appellant that if he wanted a lawyer, <em>“we </em>will see that you have a lawyer provided to you before <em>we </em>ask you any questions.” (Emphasis supplied. ) One in the appellant’s position might well have concluded that a lawyer provided by the police would be of little value to one being questioned by the police. Consequently, I believe that the warning, in addition to making clear that the attorney to be provided will be provided without cost to the defendant, should also make clear that which is made clear by Buie 318 of the Eules of Criminal Procedure, i.e., that it is the <em>court </em>which will provide counsel, not the police.</p>
    <p id="b102-4" data-blocks='[["BL_102.5",102,[186,1130,1156,646]]]'>The majority holds that the warning was adequate because appellant said that he understood it. However, the record does not indicate just what it was the appellant understood. It does not indicate that he understood that he was entitled to free counsel or that such counsel would be appointed by the court. Since I believe that the warning was insufficient to convey this information clearly, I believe that the strong possibility exists that appellant’s understanding was also insufficient to support a finding that he knowingly waived his rights. I would vacate the judgment of sentence and remand the case for a new trial.</p>
