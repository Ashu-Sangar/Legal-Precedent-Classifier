The Supreme Court of the United States has characterized suppression proceedings in terms of appellate procedure: “Although the <em>reviewing </em>court will pay substantial deference to <em>judicial </em>determinations of probable cause, the court must still insist that the magistrate perform his neutral and detached’ function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police”.

    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[173,940,1159,1207]]]'>The record in the present case illustrates the hazards inherent in relying on the memories of those present at the time a warrant is issued. As stated above, appellant’s suppression hearing was held more than four months after the challenged search. At that hearing, as the majority opinion states, “Detective Burbush was initially unable to recall giving any oral testimony whatsoever. The magistrate, while acknowledging the existence of the sworn oral testimony, admitted that his memory was dimmed by the fact that the proceeding was ‘some time ago’ ”. It is not surprising that the recollections of these witnesses were clouded. During a four month period a policeman normally makes numerous search warrant requests to a magistrate who must, in every case, make an independent review of the sworn facts presented to him and determine whether they constitute probable cause. To expect officer and magistrate to recall with accuracy at some later time what transpired on each such occasion is to place an impossible burden on the individual officials and an onerous burden on the efficient administration of justice.</p>

The Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and Article I, Section 8, of the Pennsylvania Constitution cannot reasonably be read as permitting the result reached by the majority. Information related orally to the magistrate but not recited in the affidavit, the basis for issuing a warrant, cannot be later considered in testing whether probable cause existed for the issuance of the warrant—unless we read the constitutional provisions in an unnatural and unreasonable manner.</p>

    <p id="b375-4" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[169,731,1149,435]]]'>The Pennsylvania Declaration of Human Eights states: “The people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, <em>nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation subscribed to by the affiant. . . </em>.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b375-5" data-blocks='[["BL_375.6",375,[169,1179,1149,156]]]'>The Pennsylvania Constitution requires that the probable cause be supported by oath or affirmation subscribed to by the affiant.</p>
    <p id="b375-6" data-blocks='[["BL_375.7",375,[165,1348,1152,548]]]'>The strained and unnatural interpretation placed on the above language in <em>Commonwealth v. Crawley, </em><a href="/pa-super/209/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="209 Pa. Super. 70" data-case-ids="778093" data-case-paths="/pa-super/209/0070-01">209 Pa.

According to the <em>Crawley </em>case, the words in the Pennsylvania Constitution “subscribed to by the affiant” refers only to the oath or affirmation separate from the probable cause. Only a tortured reading permits such a conclusion. An oath or affirmation does not hang in midair. It is the imprimatur of that which is being sworn to or affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b375-7" data-blocks='[["BL_375.8",375,[165,1908,1148,260]]]'>An oath or affirmation does not appear at the end of a blank sheet of paper. It <em>supports </em>that which precedes the oath or affirmation. The Constitution makes clear that the <em>probable cause </em>must be <em>supported </em>by the oath or affirmation.</p>
    <p id="b375-8" data-blocks='[["BL_375.9",375,[165,2188,1147,157]]]'>The language of the Constitution states that the affiant must subscribe to <em>something. </em>One does not subscribe to nothing.</p>

    <p id="b376-4" data-blocks='[["BL_376.5",376,[206,783,1155,211]]]'>Again, the Pennsylvania Constitution refers to the <em>affiant. </em>An <em>affiant </em>is one who signs an affidavit. An <em>affidavit </em>is always a <em>written statement </em>of the facts signed by the affiant under oath or affirmation.</p>
    <p id="b376-5" data-blocks='[["BL_376.6",376,[203,1007,1157,659]]]'>The Fourth Amendment requires specificity. It speaks of <em>particularly describing </em>the place to be searched and the person or things to be seized. The Pennsylvania Constitution is likewise specific. As to the place, person or things, it requires <em>describing them as nearly as may be. </em>Better language could not have been chosen to express in the context of the. constitutional provisions, that a writing is required. The effect of the majority’s conclusion would be to allow the specificity required by both Constitutions to sometimes be related orally which cannot possibly have been intended by the language in the Constitutions.</p>
    <p id="b376-6" data-blocks='[["BL_376.7",376,[202,1679,1155,595]]]'>Under the majority’s conclusion, a magistrate can issue a warrant upon an application which contained nothing in writing except a person’s name or an address. All other particulars can be handled by oral recitation and proven months or years later. I cannot agree with such a loose and blatantly unreasonable interpretation of the language in the Federal and Pennsylvania Constitutions. In interpreting human rights the first concern is the freedom of a free people. The judgment of sentence should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>
