During the course of the trial, appellant called William Brown, the bartender at the Norris Tavern where the appellant allegedly was drinking prior to the homicide. On direct examination by the defense, Mr. Brown testified that appellant was not present in the Norris Tavern on the night in question. Attempting to rebut Mr. Brown’s testimony, the Commonwealth called Betty Gary in reliance upon her pretrial, sworn statement in which she specified that appellant was present at the Norris Tavern. However, once on the stand, Miss Gary testified that she was, “not too sure that I did or not [see the appellant].” Over defense objection, the court below granted the Commonwealth’s plea of surprise and the Commonwealth proceeded to cross-examine its own witness.</p>

As in this appeal, the trial <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>court granted the Commonwealth’s plea of surprise and the ruling was assigned as error.</p>

However, the record clearly reveals the following discussion by the trial judge in his charge: “Members of the jury, allow me to comment at this time that these photographs are not before you for the purpose of inflaming your mind or your passions, but rather to enable you to see the nature and the gravity and the extent of the assault that was committed upon this victim, and you should consider them for the purpose and that purpose alone.” We find no error in this respect.</p>
    <p id="b307-4" data-blocks='[["BL_307.5",307,[174,1520,1150,604]]]'>During the course of the trial, two of appellant’s alleged accomplices testified against him without any constitutional warnings being given to them. For this reason, appellant contends that <em>his </em>constitutional rights were violated. It is axiomatic constitutional law that a witness’ constitutional rights are personal and cannot be claimed by or for another, including the party by or against whom he is called to testify. <em>See, generally, </em>98 C.J.S. <em>Witnesses, </em>§451a (1957). If each accomplice’s counsel saw fit to permit such testimony, appellant cannot object.</p>

However, appellant argues that these individu<a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>als should not have been characterized as accomplices. For a variety of reasons, there is no error. First, the instruction could only harm the Commonwealth as the appellant could only benefit from cautionary instructions concerning those witnesses against him. Second, failure to give such instruction might have been reversible error. <em>E.g., Com. v. Sisak, </em><a href="/pa/436/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="436 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1926152" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0262-01">436 Pa. 262</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=259%20A.2d%20428" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="259 A.2d 428">259 A. 2d 428</a> (1969).

In his summation, the District Attorney stated, “[a]s a matter of fact, ladies and gentlemen, when that Bible was sitting up here, I was afraid it was going to jump up and hit all three of them, because they took an oath.” Defense counsel immediately objected but later apologized for interrupting. Nonetheless, the trial judge did remind the jury that the witnesses were under oath when they testified.</p>

Even if we were to conclude that the prosecutor’s remark in the instant appeal was improper, compared to <em>Cordon, </em>any error would be harmless. We also include in this category those statements made by the District Attorney during the course of the trial concerning appellant’s counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>At the close of the Commonwealth’s case, an agreement was reached, pursuant to defense counsel’s request, that the names of certain individuals subpoenaed by the Commonwealth but not called as witnesses, would not be read to the jury. The “consideration” supplied by appellant for this agreement was that no reference would be made of the Commonwealth’s failure to call these witnesses. Appellant eventually called one of these individuals, Mr. William Brown (the same William Brown we discussed earlier in a different connection), as an alibi witness. Despite the understanding between counsel, defense counsel, during summation, suggested the jury ask the prosecution, “Why didn’t he tell you that Mr. William H. Brown had told him and the authorities that Willie Stafford was not present in the Norris Tavern on March 11, 1968.” The Commonwealth interposed an objection and this inquiry was stopped; the jury was not instructed to disregard this statement. However, during its summation, the Commonwealth answered this question: “Willie Brown sat in this Court Room day after day until yesterday, when he was called by the defense, and he sat in this court room not because [defense counsel] called him here but because the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania served him with a subpoena to be here, to be here as a witness, and he was not called as a Commonwealth witness, but he was made available and required to remain here for [defense counsel’s] benefit. That is the answer, ladies and gentlemen.” In our view, any impropriety is attributable to both sides and we will not split hairs over which side is “more” wrong. It is our opinion that the Commonwealth’s retaliatory statement was provoked and invited by defense counsel’s question. On these facts, there was no error. <em>See, Com. v. Tauza, </em><a href="/pa/300/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="300 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="1125898" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0375-01">300 Pa. 375</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.%20619" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="150 A. 619">150 Atl. 619</a> (1930).</p>

On appeal, this Court held the refusal thereof was not error for two principal reasons: (1) the Commonwealth, at that point in the trial, had not received any reports from its psychiatrists; and (2) no question of sanity was raised at the trial. A third reason was the now-questioned general rule that the accused has no right to the inspection or disclosure before trial of evidence in the Commonwealth’s possession. <em>E.g., Com. v.

P. 310: “All applications of a defendant for pretrial discovery and inspection shall be made not less than five days prior to the scheduled date of trial. The court may order the attorney for the Commonwealth to permit the defendant or his attorney, and such persons as are necessary to assist him, to inspect and copy or photograph any written confessions and written statements made by the defendant. <em>No other discovery or inspection shall be ordered except upon proof by the defendant, after hearing, of exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons. </em>The order shall specify the time, place and manner of making discovery or inspection and may prescribe such terms and conditions as are necessary and proper.

In our opinion, it would be incongruous to rule that laboratory reports need not be disclosed at trial, especially since laboratory reports, unlike witnesses’ statements, are subject to the “exceptional circumstances” exception. Accordingly, we hold that laboratory reports concerning tests on an accused’s clothing should be made available at trial once the Commonwealth initiates a general inquiry concerning an accused’s clothing.</p>

We agree. The prosecutor in his summation said: “And then you’ve heard, this defendant at about 9:10, he’s arrested, 9:00 o’clock he’s arrested, brought down to the District Attorney’s office, advised of his rights; where were you, what did you do, he doesn’t have to say a word, nothing. He can sit there in complete silence on his constitutional rights, and that’s what he does. And you’ve heard from his own mouth that that’s what he’s done, up until yesterday ... up until yesterday. You weigh that, in your deliberations. And you heard the contents, in essence, of this statement.” The appellant <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>testified during direct examination by defense counsel that he had remained silent at the time of his arrest. Thus, the prosecutor was not commenting on his failure to testify. Even under these circumstances we believe the prosecutor’s remarks to the jury ran afoul of <em>Griffin v. California, </em><a href="/us/380/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="380 U.S. 609" data-case-ids="1524757" data-case-paths="/us/380/0609-01">380 U.S. 609</a> (1965). In <em>Griffin </em>the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment “forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused’s silence [at trial] or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.” <a href="/us/380/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="380 U.S. 609" data-case-ids="1524757" data-case-paths="/us/380/0609-01">Id. at 615</a>. In so holding, the Supreme Court stated: “For comment on the refusal to testify is a remnant of the Inquisitorial system of criminal justice,’ Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n, <a href="/us/378/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="378 U.S. 52" data-case-ids="6165037" data-case-paths="/us/378/0052-01">378 U.S. 52</a>, 55, which the Fifth Amendment outlaws. It is a penalty imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.” The Fifth Amendment protects the accused’s right to remain silent and it is of no moment that in the instant case the appellant remained silent at the time of Ms arrest. To allow comment on his silence at the time of the arrest would also make the assertion of his privilege costly. The difference between the prosecutor’s comment on the accused’s failure to testify in <em>Griffin </em>and the prosecutor’s comment here about the accused’s failure to answer questions at the time of Ms arrest is “infinitesimal.” <em>Gillison v. United States, </em><a href="/f2d/399/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="399 F.2d 586" data-case-ids="2140793" data-case-paths="/f2d/399/0586-01">399 F. 2d 586</a>, 587 (D.C. Cir. 1968). That the appellant himself brought his silence, at the time of Ms arrest, to the jury’s attention does not justify the prosecutor’s grasping the opportunity to suggest that the appellant’s guilt be inferred from his silence at that time.</p>
