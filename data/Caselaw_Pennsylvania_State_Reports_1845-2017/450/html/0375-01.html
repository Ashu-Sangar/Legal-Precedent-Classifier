After diverse pleadings were filed, all were withdrawn and an amended complaint was filed. Preliminary objections to this amended complaint were then interposed. After a hearing before the Commonwealth Court sitting en banc, appellee’s preliminary objections were sustained on the grounds that appellant had failed to state a cause of action for an action of mandamus.
