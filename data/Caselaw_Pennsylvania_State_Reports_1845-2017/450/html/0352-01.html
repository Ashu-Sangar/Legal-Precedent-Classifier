Immediately following the separation, the three children remained with the mother for about three and one-half weeks, but were then taken to <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>live temporarily with the maternal grandparents in Columbia County, because the mother experienced difficulty in establishing a suitable residence. In March 1969, following an aborted hearing in an action for custody in Chester County, the parties agreed that the children would be placed in the custody of the paternal grandparents, also residents of Columbia County. In May 1969, the children took up residence with the father in a house trailer in Columbia County.</p>
    <p id="b404-4" data-blocks='[["BL_404.5",404,[182,830,1155,417]]]'>In September 1969, the father phoned the mother and requested that she take the children to live with her, which she did. At the time, she was sharing an apartment in Willow Grove, Montgomery County, with Leroy S. Lucas, a black man. The parties were divorced in January 1970 and shortly thereafter the father married a Caucasian woman. In June 1970, the mother married Lucas.</p>

In the instant case, the record is completely barren of any evidence that the children here involved will suffer from living with the mother under the existing circumstances. Significantly, the children have evidenced no ill will towards the mother or concern over her second marriage, and no social problems, such as bias or prejudice, ensued while they were under her care from September 1969 to June 1970. The real issue posed by this appeal is, whether a subsequent interracial marriage by the mother, in and of itself, is such a compelí<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>ing reason as will warrant a court in denying her the custody of her children.

Cf. <em>Stingley v. Wesch, </em><a href="/ill-app-2d/77/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="77 Ill.

We agree wholeheartedly with Judge Hoffman’s statement that “in a multiracial society such as ours racial prejudice and tension are inevitable. If . . . children are raised in a happy and stable home, they will be able to cope with prejudice and hopefully learn that people are unique individuals who should be judged as such.”</p>
