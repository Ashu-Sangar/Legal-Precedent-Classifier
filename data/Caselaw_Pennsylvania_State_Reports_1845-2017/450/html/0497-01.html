(popularly known as Cat &amp; <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>Dog Stores) began, selling Class I milk suitable for human consumption at prices substantially below the minimum allowed by the Board, under the artifice that they were selling pet food. Not only did C &amp; D Budget Stores purchase all their milk from UDF, but the two organizations shared some common officers. In September of 1967 the Board obtained a preliminary injunction restraining C &amp; D’s continued sale of “pet food” on the ground that their operation was in fact an attempt to circumvent the minimum retail price. In November of 1967 UDF began its own direct sale of milk at retail through the outlets that had previously been used by C &amp; D Budget Stores.</p>
    <p id="b551-3" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[159,1036,1151,911]]]'>From the beginning, UDF conducted its milk sales in a manner which was in violation of the minimum price provisions of the Milk Marketing Law. Although the prices listed on all milk products displayed in UDF stores conformed with the then current permissible minimum prices established by the Board, prominent signs were posted announcing that “profit dividends” would be paid on all milk purchases. All the customer had to do to receive his “dividend,” more properly called a refund, was to present his accumulated cask register receipts a,t any UDF store between the 10th and loth of the next month. A refund ranging from 6%% to 15% of the total milk purchase price was then paid to the customer. Any milk purchaser was eligible to receive the refund, which was paid only on milk purchases and not on purchases of bread, eggs, or other items available at UDF stores.</p>

However, instead of renewing the license, the Board issued a citation on UDF to show cause why the license should not be revoked in light of UDF’s continuing practice of selling milk below the minimum price allowed. Two days later UDF instituí<a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>ed an action in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (later transferred to the Middle District) seeking to have the Milk Marketing Law declared unconstitutional and seeking to enjoin the revocation of UDF’s license. During the pendency of the Federal litigation UDF continued to operate its chain of retail dairy stores throughout the Pittsburgh area under a temporary license.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[176,763,1156,1359]]]'>On April 13, 1971, a three-judge Federal panel issued a per curiam opinion which not only upheld the constitutionality of the Milk Marketing Law but also found that UDF’s practice of giving cash refunds on milk purchases was an attempt to circumvent the provisions of the law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> On June 2, 1971, the Board initiated the present action by filing a complaint in equity in the Commonwealth Court seeking to enjoin UDF from paying any further “profit dividends” in violation of the law. By stipulation of counsel the Commonwealth Court proceeding was stayed pending the appeal of the District Court decision to the United States Supreme Court, which affirmed the decision on November 9, 1971.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Following an additional continuance necessitated by a change in the personnel of the Board, the present equity action was re-commenced in earnest with the filing of an amended complaint by the Board on May 24, 1972. Hearings on the request for a preliminary injunction were held before Judge Blatt and on June 9, 1972, the court issued a memorandum decree and opinion denying the Board’s request for a preliminary injunction. Following a petition for reconsideration, a further hearing was held and on June 19, 1972, Judge Blatt issued a decree granting the preliminary injunction which is the subject of this appeal.</p>

A thorough review of the record compiled at the hearings which preceded this preliminary injunction decree reveals the existence of reasonable grounds for the action of the Commonwealth Court. There is no evidence of abuse of discretion or palpable error of law in the issuance of this injunction. Indeed, considering the uncontradicted testimony presented at the hearings, the provisions of the Milk Marketing Law, and the prior decisions of this Court, it would have been error for the court below to have refused to grant the injunction.</p>
    <p id="b553-3" data-blocks='[["BL_553.4",553,[150,1263,1152,314]]]'>The appellants contend the preliminary injunction was improvidently issued because (1) the Board failed to show a clear right of relief; (2) granting the injunction does more harm than good; and (3) the Board lacked clean hands and is therefore not entitled to equitable relief.</p>

The Act directs the Board to establish minimum wholesale and retail prices to be charged for all milk sold in the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The Law also provides that after the Board has fixed a minimum price it is unlawful for anyone to buy or sell milk below the minimum. In order to insure that the minimum pricing provisions are not circumvented by artful <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>merchandising maneuvers, the Law specifically provides: “No method or device shall be lawful whereby milk is . . . sold ... at a price less than the minimum price applicable to the particular transaction, whether by discount, premium, rebate, free service, trading stamps, advertising allowance or extension of credit.</p>

    <p id="b554-5" data-blocks='[["BL_554.6",554,[189,711,1156,650]]]'>The Act provides several enforcement mechanisms which may be employed by the Board to punish and restrain violations of the Act. Specifically, the Board is authorized to seek “relief by injunction . . .to enforce compliance with or restrain violations of any provisions of [the Milk Marketing] Act or any rule, regulation or order of the Board made pursuant thereto.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> In light of the undisputed evidence that UDF stores gave “profit dividends” in violation of the minimum retail prices established by the Board, the Board was authorized by the statute to seek and secure an injunction prohibiting the illegal activity.</p>

It is true, as stated in the brief of the intervening appellants, that a preliminary injunction will not be issued unless greater injury will be done by refusing it than by granting it. <em>Herman v. Dixon, </em><a href="/pa/393/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="393 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1279704" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0033-01">393 Pa. 33</a>, 36-37, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20576" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="141 A.2d 576">141 A. 2d 576</a>, 577 (1958).

The situation is quite simple. The legislature has said that no one shall sell milk in Pennsylvania at a price lower than that established by the Milk Marketing Board. The Legislature also declared that, in the event of a violation, the Board is entitled to enjoin the illegal activity. There is nothing left for the court to balance. The appellants are selling milk below the minimum permissible price and the law authorizes the Board to enjoin that illegal activity.</p>
    <p id="b555-3" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[161,879,1151,1308]]]'>As stated by Judge Woodside in the germinal case of <em>Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission v.

As stated by this Court in <em>Mead Johnson Co. v. Martin Wholesale Distributors, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/408/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="408 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="1308425" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0012-01">408 Pa. 12</a>, 14, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.2d%20741" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="182 A.2d 741">182 A. 2d 741</a>, 742-43 (1962), where the application of the Fair Trade Act was upheld despite allegations that it was inimical to the public interest: “These propositions and arguments are observations which the defendant may address to the Legislature but not to the courts, which are bound by the acts of the General Assembly which has already spoken authoritatively on the subject. . . .

The Milk Marketing Law provides that injunctions may be obtained to halt violations of the Act; therefore, injunctions may properly be issued when there is adequate proof of a violation.</p>

The charge stems from the Board’s delay in acting on a petition for reclassification which TJDF filed with the Board on February 19, 1972, and which had not been acted on by the Board in June, when the hearings were held and the injunction at issue was granted. Initially, there is absolutely no evidence that the delay was a result of bad faith or malice on the part of the Board. Secondly, even assuming the validity of the appellants’ petition for reclassification as a limited service dairy entitled to operate under separate minimum retail prices, and assuming-further that the Board intentionally delayed consideration of the UDF petition for reclassification, UDF’s remedy was not to violate the law by selling milk below the minimum price. As the Commonwealth Court stated in <em>G. S. F. Corp. v. Milk Marketing Board, </em><a href="/pa-commw/4/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="4 Pa.

During all of the period concerned, almost five years, the chaotic conditions which the Board and the Dairies predict for the future if this preliminary injunction is not granted now, have not occurred. The necessity for the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction, therefore, has not been thoroughly demonstrated. Moreover, the record indicates that increasing thousands of milk purchasers in the area concerned have come to depend-upon UDF stores for their milk supply, and they would not only be seriously inconvenienced but would also suffer a substantial monetary loss, if the operations of the UDF were now to be suddenly enjoined.”</p>

Act No. 294, §3, 31 P.S. §700j-201 (Supp. 1972). Hereafter, for the sake of clarity, the Milk Marketing Board and its predecessor will simply be referred to as the Board.</p>
