The case came to trial on October 14, 1971, before the Honorable Joseph W. deFuRTA, Jr., of the Delaware County <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>Court of Common Pleas. At that time the defendant, who had been represented by counsel throughout the proceedings, indicated his desire to change his plea from not guilty to guilty. After a complete, on-the-record examination of the defendant concerning the voluntariness and consequences of his plea of guilty, the court accepted the plea. Sentencing was deferred pending the preparation of a pre-sentence report. Thirty-five days later, on November 19, 1971, the defendant was brought before the court for sentencing. At that time counsel for the defendant urged the court to place the defendant on probation. Before imposing sentence the judge asked the defendant if there was anything he wanted say. The defendant answered affirmatively and made several statements about his present employment status and a previous conviction. Then the following discussion, which formed the basis for the Superior Court’s order vacating the judgment of sentence and remanding for a trial on the merits, occurred: “Dependant : ... As far as using drugs, I have never used drugs. I have never sold drugs. The Court : Now wait a minute, wait a minute. You pleaded guilty. Depend-ant: I did plead guilty, Your Honor, because I had no alternative really. Depense Counsel : There is no function in attacking the merits of the complaint [sic]. It has been entered. You cannot enter a plea of guilty and say well, really, I am not guilty. The Court : Let him say his piece. Have you anything further? Dependant: Well, I was just going to say that at 2303 [defendant’s residence] I am buying [the house]. I have two fellows there, one of my nephews, and another fellow living with me. One of the fellows, I understand, was selling drugs. One case, I came home one night and they had a raid at the house. I was not aware that drugs were being sold from my house. That is all I have to say, Your Honor.” At that point, with<a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>out considering* the implications of the defendant’s statement that he had never used or sold drugs, the trial judge sentenced him to five to ten years’ imprisonment in accord with the applicable provisions of The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act in force at the time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

After concluding that the defendant’s statement that he neither used nor sold drugs and that one of his roommates may have been selling drugs met the <em>Sampson </em>test, the Court ordered a new trial. What the Superior Court did not consider, however, was the thirty-five day delay between the entry of the defendant’s guilty plea and his subsequent “denial” of responsibility just prior to sentencing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In every ease which has considered the <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>propriety of accepting an equivocal guilty plea, the exculpatory statements were made contemporaneously with the entry of the plea.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Relying primarily on the language of <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Roundtree,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the opinion in <em>Slavik </em>makes it clear that claims of innocence and the assertion of exculpatory facts cannot be used to attack a pica of guilty unless they are made at the same time the guilty plea is entered. Therefore, in this case the defendant’s statement, made thirty-five days after his guilty plea had been accepted, came far too late to require refusal of his earlier guilty plea as equivocal under the rationale of <em>Roundtree </em>and <em>Sampson. </em>The defendant’s statement was not accompanied by a request to withdraw his plea nor has he ever requested to withdraw his plea. The sole issue before us is involved with the <em>acceptance </em>of the plea.</p>

Where, as here, the defendant’s protestations of innocence are not made until long after the plea has been offered and accepted, the rules governing the acceptance of equivocal guilty pleas are inapplicable. Of course, if the trial judge harbored any substantial doubts about the defendant’s guilty plea after the equivocal statements were made, the judge had the power to direct the withdrawal of the plea and the substitution of a plea of not guilty.

The defendant was charged with selling heroin in violation of Section 4(q) of The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act of 1981, 35 P.S. §780-4(q). After pleading guilty to the charges, he was sentenced in accord with Section 20(d) of the 1961 Act, 35 P.S. §780-20 (d), which provides for a maximum sentence of twenty years’ imprisonment for the first offense.

Thus, the first criterion for the application of the penalties in the 1972 Act is present; there is an offense in the new Act which is similar to the offense charged under the prior Act. The second requirement is also fulfilled. Whereas the maximum permissible sentence for selling heroin under the 1981 Act was twenty years’ imprisonment (with a five-year minimum sentence), the maximum sentence permissible under the 1972 Act is fifteen years with no specified minimum sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

In this ease the trial judge refused to consider probation for the defendant because he had been convicted of several other crimes, unrelated to narcotics. Reluctantly the judge sentenced the defendant to a “minimum” sentence of five to ten years. The judge commented: “I don’t like the five year minimum but there it is. . . . I am going to give him the minimum sentence, and you can take it that I don’t think he is entitled to that much, the minimum. . . .

        <em> </em>The two constitutional arguments raised in the appeal to the Superior Court are also raised in this appeal. The first contention is that the interplay of the penalties provided in the 1961 Act amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. Section 20(d) of the Act, 35 P.S. §780-20(d), provides a five-year <em>minimum </em>sentence for first offenders convicted of selling narcotic drugs. However, Section 20(e), 35 P.S. §780.20(e), allows the court to suspend the imposition of sentence on first offenders and grant probation or parole. The defendant argues that the disparity of the two permissi<a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>ble sentences for first offenders, coupled with <em>the </em>absence of any sentencing middle ground, is cruel and unusual. Tbe defendant also contends that the imposition of a minimum sentence is violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since women convicted of the same crime do not receive minimum sentences under the provisions of the Muncy Act, Act of July 25, <em>1913, </em>P. <em>L. </em>1311, §15, <em>as amended </em>by the Act of July 16, 1968, Act No. 171, 61 P.S. §566 (Supp. 1972).
