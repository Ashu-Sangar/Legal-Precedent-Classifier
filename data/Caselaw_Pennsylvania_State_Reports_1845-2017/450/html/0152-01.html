Upon entering, appellant took a seat at the bar, where<a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>upon, he began to converse with one Reynolds, who was seated to appellant’s immediate left. Moments later, Hazel Guisewhite, the victim, a previous paramour of appellant entered, and after a few moments, took the seat at the bar next to appellant, which Reynolds had now abandoned. The two began, what appeared to the Commonwealth’s eyewitnesses to be, a normal conversation. No loud words were spoken, no anger detected and no fight ensued. The appellant in fact testified he bought the victim a drink. Moments later, appellant and the victim arose from their seats, now standing but two to four feet apart. Appellant then pulled a revolver from his pocket, backed up a few feet and fired, thereby mortally wounding Hazel Guisewhite. Appellant, still brandishing the gun, backed towards the door and fled.</p>
    <p id="b205-3" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[161,1231,1149,660]]]'>To rebut this evidence, appellant took the stand. His testimony, in direct contradiction to that of three eyewitnesses, was that during the conversation with the deceased, she had threatened that before appellant left the tavern that evening, she and her new boyfriend, Reynolds, would attack and beat appellant. Now in fear, and with Reynolds allegedly advancing towards him, appellant arose from his seat and began backing towards the door. As a deterrent, appellant further testified that he drew a gun, which he regularly carried. By accident or instinct, the gun discharged. Still in fear, appellant fled.</p>

See also American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards For Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures. As the Standards Relating to Appellate Review of Sentences indicate (Standards, Appendix A), at least thirteen states now, by statute, provide for some form of appellate review of sentence.
