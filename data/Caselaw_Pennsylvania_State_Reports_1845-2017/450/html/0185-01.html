    <p id="b237-3" data-blocks='[["BL_237.7",237,[173,441,1147,206]]]'>On December 5, 1969, Sonia Rosenbaum was robbed and assaulted while in her home in Philadelphia. The victim, who was bound and gagged by the intruders, died as a result of the assault.</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.8",237,[171,666,1150,830]]]'>Subsequently, appellant, sixteen year old Robert Forbes, was indicted for various crimes stemming from this incident. On November 4, 1970, appellant entered pleas of guilty to murder, burglary, aggravated robbery, larceny, receiving stolen goods, and conspiracy. Prior to receiving these pleas, the trial court conducted an on-the-record colloquy, as required by Pa. R. Grim. P. 319 (a). Having concluded that the pleas were “voluntarily and understandingly made”, the court then held a hearing, pursuant to Pa. R. Grim. P. 319A, to determine whether “the case may constitute murder in the first degree.” Based on the evidence presented by stipulation, the trial judge determined that such a case had been made out and deferred any further action until a three judge panel was convened.</p>
    <p id="b237-5" data-blocks='[["BL_237.9",237,[170,1509,1148,380]]]'>On December 8, 1970, a three judge court was impaneled. At that time, however, appellant expressed a desire to withdraw his guilty plea because, as he stated, “I don’t want to plead guilty to nothing I didn’t do.” The court continued the matter until a hearing could be held on appellant’s request to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>
    <p id="b237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_237.10",237,[168,1903,1148,433]],["BL_238.1",238,[177,332,1153,210]]]'>At that hearing, on February 18, 1971, appellant said he no longer desired to pursue his withdrawal request ; therefore, on February 25, 1971, the three judge panel reconvened to determine the degree of guilt. At that hearing, it became apparent that appellant’s decision to abandon his withdrawal request was the result of defense counsel’s threat to withdraw from the case. The court, nevertheless, proceeded on appellant’s ini<a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>tial entry of the guilty plea. Appellant was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Sentence was suspended on the other charges.</p>
    <p id="b238-4" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[174,555,1156,490]]]'>On this direct appeal, appellant contends<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> that the withdrawal of his guilty plea was obstructed by defense counsel’s decision to withdraw from the case if appellant pursued his retraction of the original guilty plea. He urges that the trial court erred in failing to grant his withdrawal request—made prior to any evidence being offered at the degree of guilt hearing and, thus, prior to adjudication and imposition of sentence. We agree and must reverse.</p>
    <p id="b238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_238.6",238,[172,1060,1156,657]]]'>The record supports appellant’s contention that he abandoned the withdrawal of his guilty plea because of defense counsel’s intention to withdraw from the case. Counsel specifically stated, on the record, at the final hearing: “I have indicated to him before that if he felt, that if he insisted upon withdrawing his plea <em>and Judge Bruno thought there were circumstances under which he should be able to withdraw that, </em>I would ask to withdraw from the case. The relationship that we have had has been hanging in the balance and I think his mother has been the one most responsible for keeping that relationship.”</p>

There is no indication that appellant was informed of Ms right to persist in his request for withdrawal of the plea—in the face of counsel’s comment—and have new counsel appointed. Additionally, the court, itself, may have inadvertently intensified the coercion by denying appellant’s motion to continue the final hearing for two days in order to permit the presence of appellant’s mother who had been present at each of the prior hearings and who had been appellant’s actual counselor throughout the proceedings. The importance of her presence was even noted as above indicated by defense counsel.</p>

If the trial court finds “any fair and just reason”, withdrawal of the plea before sentence should be freely permitted, unless the prosecution has been “substantially prejudiced.” ABA Standards Eelating to Pleas of Guilty, supra. As the Third Circuit noted: “The liberal rule for withdrawal of a guilty plea before sentence is consistent with the efficient administration of criminal justice. It reduces the number of appeals contesting the ‘knowing and voluntariness’ of a guilty plea, and avoids the difficulties of disentangling such claims. It also ensures that a defendant is not denied a right by trial by jury unless he clearly waives it.” <em>United States v.
