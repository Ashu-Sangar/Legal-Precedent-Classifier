He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Shortly thereafter Starr’s counsel, although having filed no post-trial motions in arrest of judgment or for a new trial, placed before the court a “Petition to Withdraw Guilty Plea” on the ground that appellant’s plea was “not a voluntary or intelligent plea.” The trial court denied that petition without a hearing and appellant then prosecuted this direct appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

As a general rule, the guilty plea itself is “the defendant’s consent that judgment of conviction may be entered without a trial.” <em>Brady v. United States, </em><a href="/us/397/0742-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="397 U.S. 742" data-case-ids="12058257" data-case-paths="/us/397/0742-01">397 U.S. 742</a>, 748, <a href="/us/397/0742-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="397 U.S. 742" data-case-ids="12058257" data-case-paths="/us/397/0742-01">25 L. Ed. 2d 747</a>, 756 (1970). Nothing remains to be done following acceptance of a valid plea save to impose sentence. Consequently, a motion to withdraw a guilty plea made before sentencing normally precedes any indication by the court of what penalty will be exacted. There is therefore little risk that the defendant will enter a guilty plea and then withdraw it before sentencing as a means of testing the court’s attitude towards sentencing. Similarly, there is less risk that the prosecution will be substantially prejudiced by the withdrawal, before sentencing, of a constitutionally valid guilty plea.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The determination of the existence or nonexistence of manifest injustice lies, we believe, with the trial court in the first instance. It was that court which initially accepted the plea and that court which heard witnesses at the degree of guilt hearing (including in this case the defendant’s own account of the hilling).

We have concluded that the preferable practice, since it may narrow the issues on appeal or perhaps obviate <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>an appeal entirely, is to file post-trial motions in any first degree case where error is asserted, whether the conviction follows a full trial or only a degree of guilt hearing held after a plea of guilty.” Because this case must be remanded in any event to enable the trial court to consider appellant’s petition to withdraw his plea, we further direct that appellant may file post-trial motions <em>nunc pro tunc </em>within 30 days of the date of filing of this opinion.</p>
