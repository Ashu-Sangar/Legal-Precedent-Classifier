    <p id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.9",181,[131,1025,1149,308]]]'>The appellant, Christopher Lambert, was convicted of second-degree murder by a jury and sentenced to from ten to twenty years’ imprisonment. Post-trial motions were filed and denied after a hearing. This counseled direct appeal followed. We affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b181-6" data-blocks='[["BL_181.10",181,[131,1354,1151,591]]]'>There is only one issue raised in this appeal. The appellant contends that his right to a hung jury and a mistrial was prejudiced by a supplemental instruction given to the jury when they reported they were hopelessly deadlocked after eleven and one-half hours of deliberation. However, since the appellant neither objected to the supplemental instruction at the time it was given, nor at any time sought to have the jury declared hopelesly deadlocked, or to have a mistrial granted, he has waived his right to challenge the supplemental charge on appeal.</p>

Closing arguments and the charge were given Thursday afternoon and the case went to the jury. The final charge given to the jury concerned the standards they should follow in their deliberations and was taken directly from the model instruction <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>promulgated by tbe American Bar Association Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, <em>Trial by Jwry, </em>§5.4(a), “Length of deliberations; deadlocked jury.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Tbe jury retired and deliberated for two hours Thursday evening. The jury continued their deliberations for five hours on Friday and four and a half more hours on Saturday (a total of eleven and one-half hours) before informing the court that they were unable to reach a verdict. At that time the trial judge repeated the American Bar Association-approved instruction which had been given earlier.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Following the supplemental charge, which was not objected to by the appellant, the jury deliberated for two more hours before returning the verdict of guilty of second-degree murder.</p>

      <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>The procedure followed by the trial judge was beyond reproach. Indeed, in <em>Commonwealth v. Spencer, </em><a href="/pa/442/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="442 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1935365" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0328-01">442 Pa. 328</a>, 337, <a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="275 A.2d 299">275 A. 2d 299</a>, 304 (1971), where we recognized that “[deadlocked juries are a matter of concern to both bench and bar,” this Court specifically recommended the use of Section 5.4 of the American Bar Association Minimum Standards when the jury reports they are unable to reach a verdict.</p>
    <p id="b183-3" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[135,778,1151,484]]]'>The appellant’s contention that the charge given in the instant case had the same coercive impact as the now discredited <em>Allen </em>charge, <em>see Allen v. United States, </em><a href="/us/164/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="164 U.S. 492" data-case-ids="3591459" data-case-paths="/us/164/0492-01">164 U.S. 492</a> (1896), is meritless.

In order to return a verdict, each juror must agree. Your verdict must be unanimous. You, as jurors, have a duty to consult with one another and to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement, if it can be done without violence to individual judgment. Bach juror must decide the case for himself or herself, but only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with your fellow jurors.</p>
