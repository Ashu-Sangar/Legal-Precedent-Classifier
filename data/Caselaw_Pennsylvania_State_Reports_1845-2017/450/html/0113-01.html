The petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied on September 2, 1965.</p>

From the denial of that petition on September 9, 1970, appellant appealed to this Court. This Court reversed the denial of the PCHA petition and remanded with directions to allow the filing of post-trial motions <em>mme pro tuno. Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[191,453,1157,538]]]'>The facts giving rise to appellant’s claim of unlawful arrest are as follows: Appellant Jackson found Miss Irene Richardson, a woman with whom appellant had kept company, and Mr. Edward Page, deceased, in a sexual embrace in appellant’s apartment. After Page left the apartment, appellant gave chase, knocking Page to the ground with a wooden plank and stabbing him to death with a butcher knife. Miss Richardson was stabbed in the breast and left shoulder while attempting to pull Jackson away from the victim.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.6",166,[189,1003,1158,472]]]'>Appellant was later apprehended while standing in a barroom. The arresting officer was possessed of an old photograph of appellant and was accompanied to the barroom premises by a prisoner informer, a man acquainted with appellant, who identified appellant as the man in the photograph, Robert H. Jackson. Jackson made no attempt to conceal himself nor did he take flight from arrest. The arrest was made without the issuance of a warrant.</p>

It is uncontested by appellant that the arresting officer had probable cause to believe a felony had been committed. Appellant alleges, however, that there was not probable cause to arrest him as the perpetrator of the subject homicide. He alleges particularly that the police did not know him and that the only identifying basis for the barroom arrest was an “old” photograph and the “unreliable” identification by the prisoner informer. Appellant also urges that probable <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>cause is vitiated by the fact that he did not attempt to hide or escape from arrest.</p>

    <p id="b167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[152,1215,1150,864]]]'>Patrolman Michael Dougherty, who perfected Jackson’s arrest, acted upon information derived from an investigation by the Pittsburgh Police Department. Two eyewitnesses to the crime reported to the police both the circumstances of the stabbing and appellant’s identity. Officer Dougherty obtained an Army photograph of Jackson to familiarize himself with the appellant’s features. Officer Dougherty brought along a male prisoner acquainted with Jackson in searching the area of appellant’s discovered whereabouts and obtained a positive identification of appellant before making the arrest. Appellant’s contention that this arrest was lacking in probable cause is without merit. That appellant did not flee the scene of his arrest has no negative effect on an arrest not otherwise lacking in probable cause.</p>

    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[171,438,1156,484]]]'>The question whether the decisions in <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo </em>should be retroactively or prospectively applied was answered by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Johnson v.

    <p id="b168-5" data-blocks='[["BL_168.6",168,[168,933,1157,526]]]'>Appellant posits that the nunc pro tunc posture of this appeal should permit the assertion of the principles established by <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo </em>because his conviction is not “final” until he has exhausted his right to direct appeal. Since <em>Johnson </em>decided that the <em>commencement </em>of the trial prior to the decision dates in <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo </em>prohibits the assertion of the principles set forth in those cases, the finality issue raised by appellant is irrelevant. The principles of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo </em>are not here available.</p>
