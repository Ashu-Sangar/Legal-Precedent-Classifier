This issue was raised in the trial court via a petition for habeas corpus<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and was decided adversely to Pearson after an evidentiary hearing. The court found that the delay was due to the fact that Pearson had difficulty in securing counsel to prepare and defend him at trial. In this connection, the record discloses the following facts.</p>

Klevit, Esq., but Mr. EJevit withdrew from the case in April 1968, after assuming a position with the Solicitor’s Office in Philadelphia. Subsequently (the exact date is not ascertainable from the files), Mary Bell Hammerman, Esq., was appointed by the <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>court to represent Pearson, and on October 24, 1988, she obtained a directive from the court ordering the Commonwealth not to try Pearson in less than two months. In March 1969, Attorney Hammerman withdrew from the case with Pearson’s concurrence. In May 1969, the office of the Public Defender of Philadelphia entered an appearance on Pearson’s behalf and filed a petition for habeas corpus seeking his discharge alleging violation of the right to a speedy trial. When notified he was to be represented by the office of the Public Defender, Pearson declined this representation. His present counsel, William Goldstein, Esq., was appointed by the court early in June 1969, and entered his appearance on Pearson’s behalf on June 10th.</p>

In each of these instances, the trial was continued, but the record fails to disclose who was the moving party or the reason for the postponements. However, at the habeas corpus bearing, Pearson testified, wtihout contradiction, that since Attorney Goldstein came into the case, no requests for postponement were made on his behalf.</p>
    <p id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[152,1655,1152,700]]]'>Prom the foregoing, it is readily apparent that the district attorney’s office of Philadelphia is not without blame for the delay in bringing Pearson to trial the second time, and we emphatically condemn such inefficient administration. No good reason appears in the record why the case was not listed for trial during the several months immediately following our mandate of September 27, 1967, during which Pearson was represented by Attorney Klevit. Likewise, no valid excuse appears in the record for the delay of one year in the trial following Attorney Goldstein’s entry as defense counsel. Nevertheless, <em>we </em>are not persuaded Pearson was denied a speedy trial in the constitutional sense.</p>

He stated he had a faint recollection of being in Philadelphia on December 21, 1962, and listening to a conversation between two men then known to him as Toney Martha<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and Prank Ouningham, wherein they discussed robbing a bank and a telephone company in Philadelphia (the charges against Pearson involved robberies of such business places), <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>but said due to Ms loss of memory he could not say whether or not he committed or participated in these or any other robberies.

We discern no such implication. Webster’s Third International Dictionary says to “restrain” oneself from taking action is to “restrict, limit or prevent oneself from doing it”, and to “refuse” to take action is “to decline to take action”.
