He lunged at the officer with the knife through the open car window, but did not “cut, stab, or wound” the officer.

In response appellant asserts that the court did not mold the verdict to guilty of the attempt offense, nor could it have done so after-discharging the jury.

The following excerpt from the record establishes that the <em>only </em>“molding” which occurred was the court’s insertion of the date, which the jury had inadvertently <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>omitted. “Minute Clerk: Who will read the verdict?

So too a cutting, stabbing or wounding of a person is only distinguished from an aggravated assault and battery as defined by Section 709 by the intent to maim. The Act of 1860, March 31, P. L. 382, §83, contained a substantially similar provision to the present Section 712; it is therefore appropriate for one to look to the common law for a definition of the word “maim” as used in this section. Black^s Law Dictionaey 1104-05 (Rev’d. 4th ed. 1968) defines “maim” as follows: “At common law, to deprive a person of a member or part of the body, the loss of which renders him less capable of fighting; or of defending himself; to commit mayhem.” Thus, if the intention required by, Section 712 is effectively accomplished the completed offense of mayhem has been made out.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>

By definition an attempt “is an overt act done in pursuance of an intent to do a specific thing, tending to the end but falling short of complete accomplishment of it. In law, the definition must have this further qualification, that the overt act must be sufficiently proximate to the intended crime to form one of the natural series of acts which the intent requires for its full execution. So <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>long as the acts are confined to preparation only, and can be abandoned before any transgression of the law or of others’ rights, they are within the sphere of intent and do not amount to attempts.” (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth v. Ellis, </em><a href="/pa/349/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="349 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="458903" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0402-01">349 Pa. 402</a>, 404, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.2d%20504" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="37 A.2d 504">37 A. 2d 504</a>, 505-06 (1944). Thus, an attempt being the first step beyond preparation, an attempt to commit an attempt must necessarily fall within the realm of preparation for which our law does not attach criminal responsibility. I am not impressed with the dissent’s distinction between an assault and a battery. The crime set forth in Section 712 provides for punishment of both an assault (discharging a weapon at) and also a battery (cutting, stabbing or wounding) <em>where either is accompanied by the requisite intent. </em>The basis for the rejection of the concept of an attempt to commit Section 712 does not turn on whether the overt act is the assault or the battery but rather that the offense as defined is in fact an attempt to commit mayhem.</p>

Here the appellant was accused of attempting to stab a police officer with a knife through an open car window with the intent to maim. While it is arguable that the act of lunging with the knife may be sufficient to remove these acts from the realm of intent and constitute common law attempt to commit mayhem it is clear that the legislature has preempted the area and ousted the court of common law jurisdiction. In an analogous situation a majority of this court stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Clopton, </em><a href="/pa/447/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="447 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1942951" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0001-01">447 Pa. 1</a>, 8, <a href="/citations/?q=289%20A.2d%20455" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="289 A.2d 455">289 A. 2d 455</a> (1972) : “Turning to our consideration of legislative intent, we must determine why the legislature would define, with such specificity, the most aggravated form of the crime, this extreme being the most obvious to discern and <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>easiest to establish. Certainly, if our lawmakers intended that lesser acts be punishable as attempted murder, it would have made much greater sense to define the acts that would most minimally constitute the crime. At the very least, if the legislature wished that acts more remote to the completed crime were to be considered as attempted murder, it would not have defined it at all.”</p>

The first count, which is not in dispute, charged that the appellant “did attempt to cut, stab and wound with intent... to murder.” The second count of the indictment charged that the appellant “did make and assault, and . . . did <em>attempt to </em>stab, cut and wound, with intent . . . then and there to maim, disfigure and disable. . . .” The words “attempt to” are emphasized not only because they clearly show that the indictment charged the appellant with <em>attempted </em>as<a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>sault with intent to maim, but also because they are a typewritten addition to an otherwise standard printed form used to charge other defendants with the completed crime.

    <p id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.5",160,[189,716,1156,318]]]'>The testimony presented at the trial by both the prosecution and the defense is further proof that at the time of trial there was no ambiguity on either side concerning the subject of the trial.

    <p id="b160-5" data-blocks='[["BL_160.6",160,[187,1046,1156,473]]]'>Any doubt that the appellant was tried for attempted assault with intent to maim is dispelled by the trial judge’s charge to the jury delivered at the close of testimony. Even the majority opinion recognizes that the judge “specifically limited the jury’s consideration to the offense of ‘assault by attempting to stab, wound or cut with the intent to maim’,” in which case the judge instructed the jury to find the appellant “guilty of the second count.”</p>

The majority is correct in maintaining that: “A jury is without authority to find a defendant guilty of a more serious offense than that submitted to it by the court.” However, in this case the jury did no such thing. Where the indictment, the evidence produced at trial and the charge of the trial judge all maintain that the “second count” is the offense of attempted assault with intent to maim, and the jury returns a verdict of guilty of the second count, there is no basis for a holding that the jury found the defendant guilty of the completed offense.</p>

However, as noted before, the crime of “assault with intent to maim” requires a touching, <em>i.e., </em>a cutting, stabbing or wounding and is thus more akin to a battery. Disregarding the section heading,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> it is clear from the elements of the <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>offense recited in the body of the statute that, at least as far as the statute proscribes a cutting with a knife, it describes a battery.

L. 872, 18 P.S. §5107, provides: “If, on the trial of any person charged with felony or misdemeanor, it shall appear to the jury upon the evidence, that the defendant did not complete the offense charged, but was guilty only of an attempt to commit the crime, he shall not by reason thereof be entitled to be acquitted, but the jury may return, as their verdict, that the defendant is not guilty of the felony or misdemeanor charged but is guilty of an attempt to commit the same.” The section also provides that the punishment for conviction of an attempt to commit a crime shall be exactly the same as if the conviction had been for the completed offense. As a result of his conviction in the instant case, the appellant was sentenced to from nine months to three years’ imprisonment, which is within the limits allowed by Section 712 of The Penal Code, “Assault with intent to maim.”</p>
