A decade later in <em>Commonwealth v. Safe Harbor Water Power Corp., </em><a href="/pa/423/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="423 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1903155" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0101-01">423 Pa. 101</a>, 104, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%20223" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="223 A.2d 223">223 A. 2d 223</a> (1966), this Court reaffirmed <em>Allied </em>and summarized the applicable legal principles as follows: “(1) [I]f a settlement is not made within the time provided by the statute, the burden is upon the Commonwealth to explain why the settlement should not be held invalid because of lateness; (2) the justification for permitting the Commonwealth to explain in the first instance is the presence of the phrase ‘so far as possible’ in §8(a) of the Act [Corporate Net Income Tax Act] ;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> (3) this phrase relieves the Commonwealth from compliance with the time requirements of the statute under circumstances wherein the Commonwealth was unable to act at all or, though able to act, was under some disability which prevented it from acting promptly; (4) what constituted such circumstances is a question which must be determined on the facts of each case.” The opinion added the qualification that <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>“without completely foreclosing the possibility that in a given case something may occur other than an act by the taxpayer itself which prevents settlement, we believe that the only general basis for excusing a late settlement is when the taxpayer does something to delay timely action.” Id. at 105.</p>

Lest these provisions become more honored in their breach, which was never the legislative intent, we have been most discriminating in determining what constitutes acceptable excusing circumstances.
