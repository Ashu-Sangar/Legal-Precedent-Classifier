Pleas of not guilty were entered to the three indictments. After trial the jury returned a verdict of guilty of arson and guilty of murder in the first degree. By direction of the court, Jones was found not guilty on the involuntary man<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>slaughter indictment. Post-trial motions were denied, and on the murder conviction Jones was sentenced to life imprisonment as the jury’s verdict directed. Sentence was not imposed on the arson conviction. An appeal was filed in this Court from the judgment imposed on the murder conviction. An appeal from the arson conviction was filed in the Superior Court and subsequently certified here. Both appeals were submitted to us on briefs and will be disposed of in this one opinion.</p>

In balancing these rights all relevant factors are to be considered, and in the recent case of <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em><a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">407 U.S. 514</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">92 S.

We can do little more than identify some of the factors which courts should assess in determining whether a particular defendant has been deprived of his right. Though some might express them in different ways, we identify four such factors: Length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.” <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">Id. at 530</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">92 S.

Under the facts of <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>the instant case the thirty-two-month delay is clearly a sufficient length of time to require us to inquire into the other factors which go into the balance.</p>
    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[181,496,1155,263]]]'>A second factor, identified by the Court, in <em>Barker </em>to be considered in determining if the rights of the accused were violated is the reason for the delay in bringing him to trial. In relation to this the record sustains the following conclusions by the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b498-5" data-blocks='[["BL_498.6",498,[176,771,1160,1028]]]'>While the case was not listed for trial in the first instance until eleven months after the arrest, Jones suffered no prejudice by this delay and in fact was not ready for trial during this period. A request for a psychiatric examination, the results of which could hopefully be used in defense of the charges was not made until eighteen months after the arrest. After the case received its initial trial listing, nine continuances were granted, five of these at the request of the defense and two at the request of the district attorney, to which no objection was entered and which in no way attempted to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense. Additionally, the case was removed from the trial list in one instance for the purpose of plea bargaining negotiations and in another instance for reasons not discernible from the record. While we do not look with favor on such delays, we are not persuaded that under the circumstances the delays constituted a violation of Jones’ right to a speedy trial.</p>
    <p id="b498-6" data-blocks='[["BL_498.7",498,[174,1811,1157,363]]]'>A third factor to be considered is the assertion of the right to speedy trial. The record shows that Jones never asserted this right until the day of the actual trial. As noted before, Jones did not object to the continuances granted to the Commonwealth, and in this regard it must also be kept in mind that he requested five of the continuances.</p>
    <p id="b498-7" data-blocks='[["BL_498.8",498,[173,2195,1153,154]],["BL_499.1",499,[169,335,1154,1805]]]'>A fourth factor to be considered is the prejudice to the defendant. With respect to prejudice the United States Supreme Court stated the following in <em>Barker: </em>
      <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>“Prejudice, of course, should be assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect. This Court has identified three such interests: (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired. Of these, the most serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system. If witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the prejudice is obvious. There is also prejudice if defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately events of the distant past. Loss of memory, however, is not always reflected in the record because what has been forgotten can rarely be shown.” <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">Id. at 532</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">92 S. Ct. at 2193</a>. With respect to this important factor, the instant record fails to establish the delays in any degree impaired Jones’ ability to defend the charges. He states that two witnesses were unavailable as a result of the delay, however, an examination of the record establishes there is no merit in this assertion. These witnesses were in fact Commonwealth witnesses and the Commonwealth made every effort to locate them to testify as part of its case, but were unable to do so. Furthermore, one such witness had testified <em>for </em>the Commonwealth at the preliminary hearing (where she was cross-examined by the defense counsel) and Jones refused to use this testimony at trial. With respect to the second witness, the record shows the delay was not the cause of his absence, hence there was no causal connection between the delay and his unavailability since he was never available, not even at the preliminary hearing which was held right after the arrest.</p>

      <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>Jones’ next claim of error is founded on the trial court’s failure to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter as a possible verdict. No request for such a charge was made and no objection for failure to so charge was entered. Moreover, no evidence was introduced on either side of the case which would warrant a verdict of voluntary manslaughter. Under such circumstances, the failure to submit the possibility of such a verdict to the jury was not reversible error. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

If you find the defendant guilty of arson, and you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a <em>causal connection </em>between the arson and the death of Sean McKinnon, then under the statute the defendant is guilty of murder in the first degree.

This guarantee is an important safeguard to prevent undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial, to minimize anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation and to limit the possibilities that long delay will impair the ability of an accused to defend himself. However, in large measure because of the many procedural safeguards provided an accused, the ordinary procedures for criminal prosecution are designed to move at a deliberate pace. A requirement of unreasonable speed would have a deleterious effect upon the rights of the accused and upon the ability of society to protect itself.

It was error for the trial court not to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter is defined as the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but in the course of some unlawful act not amounting to a felony ... or negligently doing some act lawful in itself. <em>Commonwealth v. Mayberry, </em><a href="/pa/290/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="290 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="1104465" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0195-01">290 Pa. 195</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=138%20A.%20686" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="138 A. 686">138 A. 686</a> (1927). The jury, as triers of fact, could have found that the death occurred as a result of a negligent act, since there was evidence that the fire was accidently set by the act of placing the can of gasoline too near the “hotplate”. It was within the province of the jury to either believe or disbelieve this testimony, and decide <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>whether negligence was present. The court erred by taking this consideration away from the jury by instructing them not to consider involuntary manslaughter as a possible verdict.</p>
    <p id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[157,559,1150,318]]]'>The trial court also improperly deprived the defendant of a jury trial on the issue of malice which is a necessary element of murder and must always be decided by the jury.
