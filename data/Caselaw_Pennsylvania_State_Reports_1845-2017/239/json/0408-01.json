A judgment entered on a judgment note under seal will not be opened where it appears that the defendant signed the note without its being dated, and with no name written therein as payee, and delivered it to an attorney-at-law, for the latter\u2019s accommodation, and the latter filled in the name of a client from whom he had received money for investment, which he had himself appropriated, and the client upon notice of the existence of the note in her favor, and in reliance upon it in part, ratifies the loan which the attorney had made to himself from her moneys.\n2. If one by his acts, or silence, or neglect, misleads another or in any way effects a transaction whereby an innocent person suffers loss, the blamable party must bear it.\n\u2022 3. The court to which application is made to open a judgment, may judge the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses and is not bound even where there is a conflict of testimony, to send the case to the jury. The whole proceeding resolves itself into the exercise of a sound judicial discretion.\nArgued Jan. 20, 1913.\nAppeal, No. 19, Oct. T., 1913, by defendant, from judgment of Superior Court, April T., 1912, No. 121, affirming judgment of C. P. Clarion Co., Dec. T., 1911, No. 180, discharging rule to open judgment in case of Margaret Wolfgang v. Jno. S. Shirley.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Mestrezat, Elkin and Mosohzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nSee report of case in 51 Pa. Superior Ct. 65, for further facts.\nBuie to open judgment. Before Willson, P. J.\nOrlada, J., filed the following opinion of the Superior Court:\nOn April 18, 1908, Margaret Wolfgang gave to John Slicker her check for $855.75, with instructions to deliver it to J. A. F. Hoy, an attorney of the Clarion County Bar, now deceased, for the purpose of investment for her. The attorney deposited the check in bank to his own credit and applied the proceeds to his own use. A short time subsequently Hoy procured from Shirley a judgment exemption note for $800.00 under seal, which was undated and with no name written thereon as payee, for his \u2014 Hoy\u2019s\u2014accommodation, Hoy stating that he needed the money to pay insurance premiums on his life, which would shortly become due. After Hoy\u2019s death this note was found among his private papers, with the name of Margaret Wolfgang written thereon as payee in Hoy\u2019s handwriting, and was delivered by his law partner to the plaintiff, who entered judgment thereon November 25,1909. A petition was presented to the court reciting the circumstances alleged as inducing causes to securing of the signature of Shirley, and prayed that the judgment be opened and he be let into a defense, which was deni\u00e9d by the court.\nThe farthest the defendant can urge his claim for equitable relief is founded upon his own carelessness and negligence in issuing a note under his hand and seal, and blank as to date, or payee, and assuming that it was to enable Hoy to raise money through a bank for his own use, it was but accommodation paper given by Shirley to Hoy, and so far as the. subsequent holder is concerned, it was not clouded by any restrictions or suggested defects.\nIt is not questioned that Hoy owed Mrs. Wolfgang, and that as her debtor he attempted to secure to her the amount of her claim against him. So far as Shirley\u2019s relation to the note is concerned, she is an innocent party who ratified the loan to Hoy partly on the faith and credit of Shirley\u2019s note. \u201cThe equities of the respective parties are not equal; where one of two parties, who are equally innocent of actual fraud, must lose, it is the suggestion of common sense as well as equity, that the one whose misplaced confidence in an agent or attorney has been the cause of the loss shall not throw it on the other\u201d: Penna. R. R. Co.\u2019s App., 86 Pa. 80; Shat-tuck v. Amerian Cement Co., 205 Pa. 197.\nIt is conceded that Shirley executed and delivered the note for the express purpose of enabling Hoy to raise money on it, to be applied to his, Hoy\u2019s own use. It is also shown that the very purpose of that transaction was fulfilled in Hoy\u2019s securing the money or its equivalent from Margaret Wolfgang, and served the very purpose that Shirley intended that Hoy should accomplish, and as said in Weigley v. Conrade, 132 Pa. 147, \u201cIn this respect the bond resembles accommodation paper given by one person to another to enable him to raise money thereon. It has been repeatedly held that want of consideration cannot be set up against such paper, even though the holder knew that it was made for the accommodation of the payee, for the reason that the object of issuing it was to raise money thereon.\u201d In this case Shirley emphasized the value of the paper by importing a consideration to it with his seal.\nIn Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, 286, it is declared, \u201cIf one by his acts, or silence, or neglect misleads another or in any way effects a transaction whereby an innocent person suffers loss the blamable party must .bear it.\u201d To allow the promises of Hoy with Shirley to destroy the consideration of the note and by his oath alone, would not only be correcting or reforming a written instrument by making it read different from what it is in fact, but would be destructive of the very terms of the paper as issued by the maker. \u201cThe instrument itself is evidence against him, and, therefore, both upon reason and authority, he must overcome the priina facie presumption arising from his' own act, and establish his allegations by the quantum and character of proof required to move a chancellor to make a decree in his favor, or be left where he has placed himself under the law\u201d: Shannon v. Castner, 21 Pa. Superior Ct. 294.\nThe court, to which application is made to open a judgment, may judge the weight of the evidence and the credibilty of the witnesses, and is not bound, even where there is a conflict of testimony, to send the case to a jury. The whole proceeding resolves itself into the exercise of a sound judicial discretion: Augstine v. Wolf, 215 Pa. 558.\nOn review of the whole record we affirm the judgment.\nRice and Morrison, JJ., dissent.\nError assigned was the judgment of the Superior Court.\nJohn S. Shirley, with him George F. Whitmer, for appellant, cited:\nDeTurck v. Matz, 180 Pa. 347.\nDon. C. Corbett, of Corbett & Rugh, with him Geary & Hindman, for appellee, cited:\nJenkintown National Bank v. Fulmor, 124 Pa. 337; Carpenter v. National Bank of the Republic, 106 Pa. 170; Weigley v.
