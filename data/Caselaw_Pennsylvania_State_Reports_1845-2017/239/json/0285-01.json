The court found that the corporation was insolvent when the assignment was made; that the defendants knew it was insolvent and that the assignment was executed for the purpose of giving them preference. If these findings were correct, the assignment was void, Sicardi v. Keystone Oil Co., 149 Pa. 148, and the decree directing a reconveyance and an accounting was properly made. Findings of fact by a chancellor will not be disturbed unless it is shown that they are clearly erroneous.
