The learned trial judge, on a careful review of the testimony, found that the representations alleged to have been made were not in fact made. This finding is conclusive of the plaintiff\u2019s right unless shown to be erroneous. This has not been done. The findings of fact by a judge, which involve the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, will be given the effect of a verdict of a jury and they will not be disturbed where there is testimony to support them.\nThe decree is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.",
