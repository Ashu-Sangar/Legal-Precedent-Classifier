In an action to recover a balance due for merchandise sold and delivered, it appeared that defendants had objected to the quality of certain of the goods already in their possession, and had declined to receive certain other goods at the custom house, and that the defendants had then written to plaintiff offering to take such of the goods at the custom house as they might determine, at a specified reduction, to which plaintiff had replied that it would accept this proposal, but that defendants must keep the whole of that which they had received, which offer of the plaintiff was accepted and acted upon. <em>Held, </em>the reduction specified applied only to the goods in the custom house, and not to the goods which the defendants had already received into their possession.</p>

The plaintiff, having proved the account, which showed a balance due of $1,989.98, rested. The defense was that the parties had compromised the claim, and that the defendants should have been entitled, under the agreement of compromise, to a credit of Fr. 21,087.82, whereas they had only been allowed credit for Fr. 11,137.90; and, secondly, that the defendants had sent their check for Fr. 25.08 in settlement of the account, which had been accepted by the plaintiff. The only testimony offered by the plaintiff was the book account, which was in the French language, the oral testimony being a translation into English and an explanation of the trade terms and the value of the franc. The defendants’ testimony consisted entirely of letters.</p>

The plaintiff had shipped to the defendants a quantity of horse hair, known in the trade as “utinam.” Part of this shipment hád been received by the defendants and part of it still remained in the custom house. The defendants were not satisfied with the quality of the goods nor with their color. They complained to the plaintiff, with the result that on December 19, 1905, the plaintiff wrote to the defendants and offered a reduction of five per cent, on the sum which they owed up to that date, on condition that the balance of the account be sent them by January 15 following.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[333,1340,1151,472]]]'>The difference in the amount of the credit claimed by the defendants and that allowed by the plaintiff arises from their different interpretations of these letters. The plaintiff claims that the deduction of Fr. 10 per kilo, or thirty-three and one-third per cent, of the price, should be confined to the goods which were at the time in the custom house. The defendants claim that this deduction was to be allowed on all the goods which they had received.</p>

The plaintiff did not accept this offer, but made a counter offer, that is, that they would accept the defendants’ proposal of a reduction of Fr. 10 per kilo, but provided the defendants would accept all the goods in their possession. Referring again to the defendants’ proposal of a reduction of Fr. 10 per kilo, it <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>is seen that it related only to the goods in the custom house. Therefore, when the plaintiff accepted their proposal of a reduction, and their counter offer was accepted by the defendants, it resulted in an agreement that if the defendants would keep the goods already in their possession and would accept the goods then in the custom house, the plaintiff would make a reduction of Fr. 10 per kilo upon the price of the goods in the custom house.</p>

This letter was mailed to Besancon, France. The plaintiff replied on August 22, 1906, which must have been practically immediately upon receipt of the letter, that they had placed the Fr. 25.08 to the credit of the defendants’ account, but that the same was not in settlement; that the account enclosed by the defendants was erroneous in that it claimed a greater credit than the defendants were entitled to.</p>
