Plaintiff, trustee in bankruptcy, filed a bill to set aside the conveyance and require the respondents to return the assets, or to account for the value of those which were not returned. The court made a decree declaring the assignment to be null and void, and requiring the respondents to reconvey the assets transferred thereby or to account for the value thereof, and to mark certain suits which they had begun, to recover upon said assets, to the use of the plaintiff, trustee in bankruptcy, or to discontinue said suits at the trustee’s election. Defendants appealed.</p>

The court found that the corporation was insolvent when the assignment was made; that the defendants knew it was insolvent and that the assignment was executed for the purpose of giving them preference. If these findings were correct, the assignment was void, Sicardi v. Keystone Oil Co., <a href="/pa/149/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="149 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="832626" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0148-01">149 Pa. 148</a>, and the decree directing a reconveyance and an accounting was properly made. Findings of fact by a chancellor will not be disturbed unless it is shown that they are clearly erroneous. We are not convinced that any error was made by the learned judge who heard the case and the decree is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.</p>
