The attorney deposited the check in bank to his own credit and applied the proceeds to his own use. A short time subsequently Hoy procured from Shirley a judgment exemption note for $800.00 under seal, which was undated and with no name written thereon as payee, for his — Hoy’s—accommodation, Hoy stating that he needed the money to pay insurance premiums on his life, which would shortly become due. After Hoy’s death this note was found among his private papers, with the name of Margaret Wolfgang written thereon as payee in Hoy’s handwriting, and was delivered by his law partner to the plaintiff, who entered judgment thereon November 25,1909. A petition was presented to the court reciting the circumstances alleged as inducing causes to securing of the signature of Shirley, and prayed that the judgment be opened and he be let into a defense, which was deniéd by the court.</p>

So far as Shirley’s relation to the note is concerned, she is an innocent party who ratified the loan to Hoy partly on the faith and credit of Shirley’s note. “The equities of the respective parties are not equal; where one of two parties, who are equally innocent of actual fraud, must lose, it is the suggestion of common sense as well as equity, that the one whose misplaced confidence in an agent or attorney has been the cause of the loss shall not throw it <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>on the other”: Penna.

It is also shown that the very purpose of that transaction was fulfilled in Hoy’s securing the money or its equivalent from Margaret Wolfgang, and served the very purpose that Shirley intended that Hoy should accomplish, and as said in Weigley v. Conrade, <a href="/pa/132/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="132 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="970534" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0147-01">132 Pa. 147</a>, “In this respect the bond resembles accommodation paper given by one person to another to enable him to raise money thereon. It has been repeatedly held that want of consideration cannot be set up against such paper, even though the holder knew that it was made for the accommodation of the payee, for the reason that the object of issuing it was to raise money thereon.” In this case Shirley emphasized the value of the paper by importing a consideration to it with his seal.</p>
