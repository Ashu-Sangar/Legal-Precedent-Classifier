Both acts were passed at the same extraordinary session of the general assembly. In both the legislature had in mind cities of the first class. In both the intent was to improve the public service. In short, these two statutes are in pari materia and must therefore be construed together. It would do violence to probability to suppose, without the amplest ground that one was intended to repeal the other. It must also be borne in mind that there is a certain quantity of unity in the action of a general assembly. Its very name imports the notion of one period or session. By the common law, statutes took effect from the first day of the session of Parliament at which they were enacted. This doctrine of relation having worked gross injustice, was changed in England by a statute of the time of George III, and has been changed in our State. But while the rule itself has changed, the important circumstance at the back of the rule remains, to wit, that the session of the general assembly, though spread over days, is a single, unified session, and that its acts have a coherence which forbids the assumption that an act passed on one day is repealed on the next. If on a superficial view of the Act of March 5th, there should appear to be a discrepancy between it and the Act of February 15th, it would be our duty to exhaust all the resources of interpretation, before coming to the conclusion that there is an irreconcilable repugnancy.</p>

L. 19, which is, therefore, superseded and repealed. We cannot, however, take the same view with relation to the second section of the Act of February 15, 1906,' which relates not to the manner or method of appointment or removal of officers, clerks or employees of cities of the first class, but to their conduct while in the employ of the city, and specifically defines certain things which shall not be done by them as being inconsistent with proper and efficient service to the city, and providing as a penalty for a violation of the act dismissal from the service. In other words, while' the Civil Service Act of March 5,1906, does not define specifically any cause for which employees of the city may be dismissed from its service, but provides only that they shall not be ‘removed, discharged or reduced in pay or position except for just cause, which shall not be religious or political,’ yet the Shern Act of February 15, 1906, Section 2, P. L. 19, defines certain offenses as legal causé for dismissal from the service which, therefore, must be considered as ‘just causes’ within the meaning of the Act of March 5, 1906. A just cause of removal may be any reason which renders the employee unfit for the position which he occupies or which may be inimical to the good of the service; and open and defiant disobedience of a statutory requirement and violation of the law under which he is employed is a just cause for dismissal. That the dismissal must take place in accordance with the provisions of the Act of March 5, 1906, is undoubtedly true; but this method provided for dismissal is not inconsistent with the causes for dismissal prescribed by Section 2 of the Act of February 15, 1906, P. L. 19. Nor do we consider that the causes for dismissal defined by the second section of the Act of February 15, 1906, P. L. 19, are ‘political’ causes within the meaning of the Act of March 5, 1906. The political cause referred to in the later act means political opinion, choice, pref<a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>erence, expression or-affiliation with a political party, and not political activity or engaging in political or party work, or active participation in party management, or watching or solicitation of votes at the polls, or interfering with the conduct of elections., which are the causes referred to in the Act of February 15,1906, P. L. 19, and which are thereby made legal causes for dismissal; and being legal causes, must be held to be just causes.</p>

But it is equally well settled that, apart from constitutional restrictions, the legislature which creates an office may control the mode of filling or vacating it. ......Without going into the discussion at length, we are of opinion that a policeman is a subordinate ministerial agent or employee, like a fireman or watchman or superintendent; of public squares or other property, <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>under the orders of the municipal department.
