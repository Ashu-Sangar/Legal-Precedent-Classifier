    <p class="summary" id="b68-7" data-blocks='[["BL_68.7",68,[320,849,1146,642]]]'>The investigation has taken a wide range and much testimony has been introduced. The issue, however, is readily understood as there is only one material fact in dispute and the case turns briefly on a question of law. The contract, which is called a license, provides that all pressed glass blanks for cutting which shall be used or sold by the licensee shall be subjected to a finishing operation by some of the methods covered by the letters patent issued to the licensor. All blanks made out of lead glass were subjected to the operation required by the contract; they were sold at the scheduled prices and an accounting was made therefor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b68-8" data-blocks='[["BL_68.8",68,[320,1503,1144,535]]]'>The defendants, however, sold other blanks for cutting at lower prices than those specificed in the instrument and without subjecting them to the finishing process required by the contract. Such blanks were made out of lime glass. The defendants contend that the sale of blanks made out of lime glass was not in violation of the contract. Such contention is resisted by the plaintiff company and hence the whole case turns on the construction of the contract and the meaning of the words “pressed glass blanks for cutting.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b68-9" data-blocks='[["BL_68.9",68,[320,2049,1147,371]],["BL_69.1",69,[119,344,1153,2070]],["BL_70.1",70,[335,353,1148,206]]]'>If would seem that there should be no trouble about the interpretation of this contract. It sets forth with reasonable clearness, although with some waste of words, the understanding of the parties. It provides that “all pressed glass blanks for cutting” shall be subjected to the finishing process; To one unfamiliar with the terms used in the glass trade, it would appear that <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>this provision should give rise to no misunderstanding. The language is plain and comprehensive. If we should read no farther than the first clause of the third paragraph it would seem plain that the licensee could not sell any kind of a pressed glass blank for cutting unless subjected to the finishing operation provided in the contract. As we read on, however, it is also plain that such was not the meaning intended because it is expressly provided “that the said patented inventions shall not be used by the licensee in the manufacture of ‘imitation cut glassware’ or other pressed glassware.” The whole idea was to confine the use of the inventions to the finishing of glass articles from which “cut glass” was made. The contract distinctly recognizes the possibility of applying the inventions to other uses and, therefore, prohibits their use in the manufacture of “imitation cut glassware.” This is further evident from the condition prescribed in regard to the sale of blanks as follows: “All blanks purchased under this agreement are sold subject to the express condition that they shall not be re-sold until they have been converted into the product known as cut glass.” The contract did not prohibit the licensee from manufacturing and selling ordinary pressed glassware or imitation cut glassware. The only restriction was that' the patented inventions should not be used “in the manufacture of imitation cut glassware or other pressed glassware.” The evidence shows that the inventions were not used in the manufacture of imitation cut glassware. The licensee continued to make and sell pressed glassware from which was made the imitation cut glass. And in plain language the right to do so is recognized in the contract itself. Prior to the time of the contract the imitation of cut glass was not much of a. success. Since that time by a new process an article is produced which only an expert can distinguish from genuine cut glass. The plaintiff complains that the glassware thus sent out is not subjected to the operation provided in the contract but such complaint is not justi<a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>fled as the contract expressly prohibits such use of the inventions. The contract must be enforced to carry out the intention of the parties at the time it was made and not changed to meet new conditions which have arisen.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b70-4" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[333,571,1149,533]]]'>The contract further sets forth that “by ‘blanks for cutting’ is meant blanks which are not put upon the market until the entire pattern pressed on the exterior of said blanks has been cut over and finished by the implements used in the manufacture of what is commonly called ‘cut glass.’ ” Thus showing that the whole purpose of the agreement was to require the use of the inventions only on blanks which were used in the manufacture of “cut glass” and to prohibit their use on blanks used in the manufacture of “imitation cut glass.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[332,1117,1148,694]]]'>On the theory that the meaning of the contract was doubtful because of the use of technical words and trade terms much parol testimony was introduced. It must be conceded that it will require one acquainted with the glass business to define a “blank” or to tell what is meant by a “pressed glass blank for cutting.” The law does no.t define these terms and one not an expert is ignorant of their meaning. As is usual with experts we have a variety of definitions. Thus John E. Marsden, a witness for plaintiff, testifies that: “all glass that cutters use are termed as blanks.” And Carl J. G-iometti, a witness for defendant says that: “A pressed blank for cutting is a lead glass with a design pressed on it.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b70-6" data-blocks='[["BL_70.6",70,[330,1823,1148,587]],["BL_71.1",71,[119,358,1150,154]]]'>But however the testimony may differ as to the meaning of trade terms, it is shown without contradiction that at the date of the agreement the only blanks in use for the making of cut glass were those made from lead glass. The testimony on plaintiff’s side establishes such fact. Thus John E. Marsden, says: “What is known as a lead glass blank is what has been used among cutters continuously.” And there is no testimony on either side inconsistent with such statement. As blanks for cutting made from lime glass were unknown to the trade at the time the contract was signed it is not easy to imagine <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>that such blanks could have been in contemplation of the parties or that it was the intention to subject such unknown articles to the finishing operation provided.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b71-3" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[119,524,1149,754]]]'>From the language of the contract as already pointed out and from the conditions existing at the time of its execution, it seems plain enough that the defendants did not violate the contract when they sold blanks for cutting made from lime glass. From such blanks the commercial article known as “cut glass” could not be manufactured and nothing could be produced but “imitation cut glassware” in the manufacture of which the parties agreed the patented inventions could not be used. The evidence, therefore, failing to show any violation of the contract on the part of the defendants or any intention of violating the same, it follows that the plaintiffs have not made out a case which justifies an injunction as prayed for.</p>
