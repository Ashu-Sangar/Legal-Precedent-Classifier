Plaintiff filed a statement of claim from which it appeared that by letter dated January 30, 1906, it offered to furnish defendant certain motors as specified therein, at a price of $822.00 each, further stating: “We can make shipment on the first of the above outfits in five months, and at the rate of two per week thereafter.” At the top of the letter was stamped: “Terms cash thirty, days from date of shipment.” On October 1, 1906, defendant replied by letter accepting the proposal contained in plaintiff’s letter, and further stating: “It is understood that you can make shipment of the first of these motors in five months from date and afterwards at the rate of two motors.per week. We hope that you can arrange to somewhat anticipate this rate of delivery as the entire contract must be completed in two hundred days,. or six months and twenty days, under penalty of twenty dollars per day.” A formal order for the motors was enclosed with, defendant’s letter. This order contained the words: “Price for the lot $8,220.00 F. O. B. Schenectady, N. Y. Terms not specified,” with a reference to the letters above referred to. It also contained the words: “Wanted one hundred days or less.” Certain additional orders were made and filed and certain amounts paid on account, as to which there was no dispute. Defendant filed an affidavit of defense in which it alleged that there was an oral agreement by which plaintiff “was fully acquainted with the facts that these motors were being purchased for the purpose of completing a contract which the defendant had with the United States of America through Thomas Eyan, the Acting Secretary of the Interior”; that plaintiff “was fully advised of the terms of defendants contract,” and then setting forth that said contract imposed upon defendant a liability of “the sum of twenty dollars per day occupied in excess of the time specified in” defendant’s contract; the affidavit further alleged that on account of these contract provisions imposing a penalty upon the defendant if it failed to complete. its contract with the Government by a specified time, that the plaintiff had orally “agreed that defendant should only be required to pay plaintiff for the motors its proportion of the moneys actually paid by the United States in accordance with the terms and conditions of payment provided” in defendant’s contract, a copy of which it was alleged had been' furnished to the plaintiff prior to the making of the contract in suit. The affidavit further alleged that defendant had made payments from time to time in accordance with this understanding which plaintiff had <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>accepted, and tbat a considerable sum of money was still retained by the United States Government pending tbe termination of the dispute with defendant, on account of delay in making deliveries under its contract, and that the cause of such delays, if there were any, was plaintiff’s failure to deliver motors at the time provided by defendant’s agreement with the plaintiff, as set out in the statement of claim. The affidavit concluded with the general averment that the plaintiff was chargeable with all of such delay and therefore would be under obligation to reimburse the defendant for all loss which might be occasioned therefrom. The affidavit did not aver that the alleged oral agreement was contemporaneous with the written contract, or that it was made to induce the defendant to enter into the same, or that it was omitted from the written agreement by reason of fraud, accident or mistake. It did not clearly or sufficiently aver that there was any delay in shipping the motors by the plaintiff, except as to seventy days’ delay as to certain of the motors. A supplemental affidavit was filed, averring in addition that plaintiff had failed to supply certain parts of the machines, which omissions created a further delay of two weeks, and that certain parts were not interchangeable as required under the specifications. The specifications, however, did not require that said parts should be interchangeable. <em>Held, </em>upon a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, that the affidavit and supplemental affidavit were insufficient in so far as they attempted to set up an oral agreement modifying a written agreement, for the sale of goods, and insomuch as they attempted to charge plaintiff with penalties for delay by reason of certain parts being not interchangeable, and in so far as they attempted to charge plaintiff with any penalty over and above the period hereinbefore referred to as to which the delay was sufficiently shown. Judgment was therefore correctly entered by the lower court for plaintiff as. to all except the penalty of twenty dollars per day for eighty-eight days or $1,760.00, as to which the rule was discharged.</p>

There is no definite allegation in the affidavit of defense, as to when the defendant shipped each motor to the United States. There is, however, an admission that the motors were “duly delivered.” Plaintiffs contract was to be complete, when it delivered the motors F. O. B. Schenectady, New York.

In addition it was averred, that certain of the parts furnished by the plaintiff, were not interchangeable as required under the specifications, attached to the plaintiff’s claim, which caused a further delay, until December 2d, 1907, and that it was not until March 31st, 1908, that the motors were tested and finally accepted by the United States making the two hundred and seventy-eight days’ delay claimed by the United States, of which one hundred and ninety-four were on account of the “certain parts not being interchangeable.” A careful examination of “the specifications” attached to the plaintiff’s statement of claim fails to show any requirement, that certain of the parts should be interchangeable, and so far as tests are concerned, the defendant’s acceptance states: That “under the Government contract it will be necessary for us to test one or two of these complete pump motor units at our works, before shipment.” If, as defendant avers, the test of the motors was to be made at defendant’s works, and if instead of so testing them before shipment, defendant accepted the motors and shipped them “to Garden City, Kansas, where under the contract with the Government defendant was required to deliver them,” it would apparently show an acceptance of the motors after a neglect to test them, as “under the Government contract it was necessary for the defendant to test them before shipping them.” The failure to find thq require<a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>ment for “interchangeable parts” in the specifications attached to plaintiff’s statement of claim, or to show how this fact delayed the completion of the erecting of the motors and the clear violation by the defendant of its undertaking with the United States in reference to testing before shipment, would in the opinion of the court show the fallacy of the defendant’s contention as to the matters in the supplemental affidavit of defense.</p>
