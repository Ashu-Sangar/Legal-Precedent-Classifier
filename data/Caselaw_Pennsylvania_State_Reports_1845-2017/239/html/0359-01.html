The royalty on pea coal was ten cents, and on buckwheat coal five cents a ton. The lease further provided as follows: “From and after July 1st, 1892, when the price received for the average of all sizes of coal at the breaker above the size of pea coal shall be $2.18 per ton, the lessee shall pay twenty-five cents per ton royalty on the coal mined from -the four-foot vein, and the same royalty on the pea coal and buckwheat coal from said vein, as is' paid on the coal from other veins; and when the average price for the several sizes above the size of pea coal exceed the sum of $2.15 per ton, the lessee shall pay sixteen per cent, of any such excess. Provided that when the price of pea coal equals that of any of the sizes above pea coal, then, pea coal shall be included with the other sizes in making the average and shall be subject .to the increased royalty.” There was no “excess” until 1897. From 1897 to 1903, with the exception of certain intervals, there was an excess of $2.15 per ton, but no demand was made by the lessor for any increase of royalties on account of the excess. This was due to the fact that the terms of the lease as to excess royalty had been overlooked. After 1903 disputes prevailed between the parties as to the construction of the lease. No coal was mined from the four-foot vein until 1907. Litigation was begun in 1909 by the lessor to recover the excess royalty. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the excess of sixteen per cent, applied to all the coal covered by the lease and not to the coal from the four-foot vein only; (2) that the lessor was not estopped from claiming the excess; and (3) that the failure of the lessor to claim excess royalties from 1897 to 1903, did not justify the conclusion of a con<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>temporaneous interpretation by the parties that no such excess was due to the lessor.</p>

On the 14th day of June, 1887, a coal lease was executed by and between the Hillside Coal and Iron Company, plaintiff, and the Grassy Island Coal Company, Limited, as lessee. This coal lease, Exhibit A of plaintiff’s statement, on March 15,1892, was duly assigned by the said lessee to the S ter rick Creek Coal Company, the defendant in the present case, who thereby assumed all the obligations, and succeeded to all the rights of the lessee under the original lease. Since the last mentioned date the defendant has been in possession of the property described in the lease, and has been engaged in the mining of coal from the veins contained in the property and in preparing and shipping the coal for market.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.6",391,[114,1893,1153,535]],["BL_392.1",392,[358,340,1147,524]]]'>2. It may be rightly stated that the sole question in dispute in this case is the amount of royalty to be paid by the lessee, under the fifteenth paragraph of the lease. A. “When the parties signed the lease in 1887 and agreed that a certain fixed and definite royalty price per ton should be paid for the coal mined, they evidently had in mind the probability that at some time in the future the coal market would improve to such an extent as to justify the payment to the lessor of a larger royalty than the specific rate per ton mentioned in the lease. To <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>meet this contingency, the fifteenth paragraph provided, inter alia, a division of any excess, received by the lessee, over and above a certain price per ton paid for coal at the breaker; that is the lessor should receive a percentage of the excess. The exact words of this provision are as follows : “And when the average price for the several sizes above the size of pea coal exceed the sum of two dollars and fifteen ($2.15) cents per ton, the parties of the second part shall pay sixteen per cent, of any such excess.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[354,884,1150,1302]]]'>The facts disclosed by the pleadings and the evidence as to the period when the percentage of the said excess first became payable to the lessor are undisputed; and there is no dispute as to what the parties did, or did not do, in relation to the matter. The first lessee mined coal from the property leased for a period of nearly five years; and then, in 1892, the defendant began and continued the mining of coal under the same conditions. There was no “excess” until after the month of May, 1897. At that time, and for the first time, the price of coal at the breaker exceeded $2.15 per ton; but neither of the parties paid any attention to this fact. The same routine method in the treatment of royalty accounts was observed as in the preceding period of five years. Monthly reports of coal mined were sent to the lessor, and vouchers for royalty were signed by the lessor monthly “in full of above account.” Although the excess over $2.15 per ton prevailed from May, 1897, to the institution of the present suit in 1909, with the exception of certain intervals of several months in the years 1898,1899 and 1900, yet, no claim was made by the lessor for its share of the excess, nor was there any agitation between the parties in regard to the subject until about September, 1903.</p>

In the year 1902, Mr. Peterson became superintendent of the plaintiff company, and his chief clerk was Mr. Taylor. Early in September (or late in August), 1903, at the request of Mr. Peterson, Mr. Taylor, who <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>was about going to Europe, made a synopsis of the plaintiff’s leases, among which was the lease involved in the present case. It was then that the importance of the proper interpretation of the fifteenth paragraph was considered for the first time by the plaintiff. The matter was called to the attention of Mr. May, the general manager of the lessor; and then it became the subject of correspondence between the representatives of the lessor and lessee, supplemented by the opinions of the attorneys as to the meaning of paragraph fifteen.</p>

The vouchers for coal royalties, from September, 1903, when the dispute between the parties first arose, to, December, 1904, were signed by the officers of the plaintiff company in the usual way; that is, “in full for the above account.” After that time, the vouchers were receipted “on account, without prejudice to claim for additional royalty due under lease dated June 14,1887.” B. “The fact that the vouchers were receipted in the manner stated during the period first mentioned is of no particular significance, because of the pendency of negotiations between the parties. The fact stated cannot be used to the prejudice of the plaintiff, nor in support of defendant’s contention.” The letters passing between the representatives of the two companies and the opinions of counsel on the question in dispute are to be found in the record and they explain themselves. It is proper for us to find as a fact that from September, 1903, to the beginning of the suit in this case, sincere efforts were made by the parties to settle the controversy. It is admitted on the record that subsequent to February, 1905, the attempts to secure a settlement of the dispute by arbitration failed through no fault on the part of either party.</p>

The failure of the plaintiff to make such a demand was not the result of a consideration or an interpretation of the terms of said paragraph; but, rather, it was the result of an oversight on the part of plaintiff’s employees, who, during the period mentioned overlooked the terms of the lease as to excess royalty.</p>

The plaintiff, the Hillside Coal and Iron Company, in addition to operating mines of its own, leased a certain tract of land to the Grassy Island Company, Limited, to whose rights the defendant company succeeded as lessee. It can be easily gathered from a reading of the lease that the officers of the two companies were acquainted with the coal business, the methods of mining, the question of royalties and the market rates for coal. It is a significant circumstance that these coal men, united in the anticipation that the coal market would improve at some time in the future, and, therefore, provided by the fifteenth paragraph that the lessor should be a beneficiary of a proportionate share of the improved conditions. The record shows that these improved conditions did not materialize until ten years later; but, the fact that they mutually provided for such a contingency shows the knowledge the parties had of the subject-matter of their <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>contract. A discriminating foresight is also shown by the parties in their treatment of the fonr-foot vein. On account of its thinness as a vein, an exception was made in its favor in the rate of royalty, with a sliding advance scale as the vein improved in thickness, until it reached a certain standard when it was no longer entitled to any discrimination in its favor. The benefits of the matters referred to were mutual, the lessor benefiting by the provision for excess royalty in the future, and the lessee by a lower rate of royalty for the four-foot vein. These facts, as well as the other provisions of the lease, suggest to us that the parties to the lease knew what they were doing and were fully able to look after their respective interests.</p>

The fifteenth paragraph is the last paragraph of a practical character in the lease.

The date at which the new period was to begin, in the judgment of the parties to the lease, depended on improved conditions in the coal market; that is, when the price of coal at the breaker for sizes above pea exceeded $2.15 per ton, but not before July 1, 1892.

By the lease the defendant, was required to mine ail the veins of coal, the four-foot vein as well as the others. So far as appears from the instrument itself, there was no reason why it should not commence mining in the four-foot vein immediately in 1887. If it did so and found the vein, as evidently was anticipated, thin, it would be required to pay a rate of royalty very small as compared with the royalty on the other coal, and it would have the privilege of mining as much as it could for five years of the four-foot vein coal at the small rate of royalty. Evidently, in compensation for what the lessor would lose in this way, it was provided in paragraph fifteen that if, after five years of mining at these low rates of royalty, the price of coal should reach $2.15 per ton, the royalty rates on four-foot vein coal should be the same as upon that of the other veins, and as a further compensation for the royalties which the plaintiff would have lost had the mining been carried on in the four-foot vein during these five years, it was not at all unnatural that an even higher rate should be provided for if the price of coal warranted it. For example, let it be assumed that three hundred thousand tons of coal above the size of pea coal could have been secured from the four-foot vein upon the premises and that the lessee considered it to its advantage to press the minings in that vein with exceptional energy, in view of the small rate of royalty, so that in the five years during which that royalty would continue, whatever the price of coal, it had taken out two-thirds of the four-foot vein, or two hundred thousand tons, the vein being less than three and one-half feet thick, in that case it would have paid but thirty thousand dollars in royalties for the two hundred thousand tons at fifteen cents, while the rate of royalty upon the same quantity of coal from the other veins would have <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>yielded fifty thousand dollars. It is entirely conceivable that under the provision for the payment of a higher rate of royalty than even the twenty-five cents per ton, if coal should bring a price so improbable at that time as ‘to seem a dream,’ in the language of Judge Kelly, the defendant should have been quite willing to agree to pay a higher price which might in some way compensate for the loss which the plaintiff has sustained by reason of the previous minings at the lower rate.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[345,854,1150,534]]]'>The foregoing argument suggests a possible theory as to the intentions of the parties as expressed in the third and fifteenth paragraphs of the lease; but the theory is unsound and specious, and leads the mind into a field of speculation. When we consider the fact, admitted on the record, that not a ton of coal was mined from the four-foot vein until 1907 — twenty years after the date of the lease — We are strongly convinced that the defendant does not successfully answer the rule requiring a reasonable interpretation of the lease.</p>

The elimination of the favor to this vein by the first clause of the fifteenth paragraph, leaves the remainder of the paragraph applicable to all the coal from all the veins. We have already stated that the two paragraphs covering the question of royalties must be construed together; and in the effort to do this we have inserted the first clause of the fifteenth paragraph as a part of the exception in the third paragraph, where it properly belongs, because it deals with the exceptional treatment given by the lease to the four-foot vein. If this transposition is proper, then there can be no question as to the real meaning of the fifteenth paragraph. In providing for the payment of a share of the excess royalty to the lessor, in broad and comprehensive terms, the conclusion is inevitable that it covers the royalty to be <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>paid on all the coal going through the breaker, regardless of the particular vein producing the coal.</p>

If the whole of the paragraph relates to the coal from the four-foot vein the anomaly would present itself of a higher royalty being paid for the coal from the poorest vein, which would be against the general scheme of the lease in regard to royalties, and against the dictates of good sense. And, on the same basis, the proviso in the fifteenth paragraph relating to pea coal would require an extremely unreasonable construction: The proviso states that when the price of pea coal equals that of any of the sizes above pea, then, pea coal shall be included with the “other sizes” in making up the “average” and shall be subject to the “increased royalty.” How can such a provision be confined to the four-foot vein? The coal from all the veins go into one breaker; the pea coal is the result of the breaker preparation of all the coal; the “other sizes” relates to the sizes into which the total production of the coal from all the veins is divided, and the “average” can have no proper meaning unless it means the average price of all sizes of all the coal going through the breaker.</p>
