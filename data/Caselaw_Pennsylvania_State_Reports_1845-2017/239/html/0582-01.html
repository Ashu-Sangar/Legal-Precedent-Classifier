    <p id="b617-3" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[138,648,1153,1399]]]'>Both the Federal and State Courts have settled this question adversely to the appellant. The Act of Congress of March 3, 1887, Rev. Stat,. Sections 563, 629, 711, confers upon the Circuit Courts of the United States concurrent jurisdiction with the State Courts in all suits where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum of two thousand dollars, and arises “under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties, etc.,......or in which controversy the United States are plaintiffs or petitioners, or, etc.” It has long been determined, as held in Bletz v. Bank, <a href="/pa/87/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="87 Pa. 87" data-case-ids="1057838" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0087-01">87 Pa. 87</a>, that “State Courts have concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the laws of the United States where it is not expressly prohibited.” The Supreme Court of the United States has frequently upheld the concurrent jurisdiction of the State Courts with those of the Federal Courts. In delivering the opinion in Claflin v. Houseman, <a href="/us/93/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="93 U.S. 130" data-case-ids="5647311" data-case-paths="/us/93/0130-01">93 U. S. 130</a>, 136, Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, says: “Bights, whether legal or equitable, acquired under the laws of the United States, may be prosecuted in the United States Courts, or in the State Courts competent to decide rights of the like character and class; subject, however, to this qualification, that where a right arises under a law of the United States, congress may, if it sees fit, give to the Federal Courts exclusive jurisdiction.”</p>

We see no ground to sustain such contention. The first Act of 1894 does not provide in what court an action shall be brought on the bond. It simply gives the subcontractor a right of action in the <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>name of the United States for his use against the contractor and surety. It is clear that the act does not divest the State Courts of jurisdiction in such cases. The other Act of 1894, in its fifth section, provides with reference to such bonds that any surety company “may be sued” in any court of the United States where the bond was made or in which the principal office of the company is located. It will be observed that this act does not compel the suitor to bring his action in a United States Court but simply permits him to do so. This section of the act provides that the surety company may be sued in any court of the United States, but does not provide that the company must be sued in such court. This has been the uniform construction put upon this provision and the other Act of 1894 by the courts: United States v. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company, <a href="/vt/78/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="78 Vt. 445" data-case-ids="4464280" data-case-paths="/vt/78/0445-01">78 Vt. 445</a>; United States v.

The court sustained the jurisdiction, saying (p. 525).: “If it (the act of congress) has for certain classes of actions conferred a jurisdiction for the benefit of the assignee in the Circuit and District Courts of the United States, it is concurrent with and does not divest that of the State Courts.”</p>
    <p id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.4",618,[334,2055,1147,367]],["BL_619.1",619,[128,349,1153,2013]]]'>It is urged, however, by the appellant that if the State Courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Courts under the Acts of 1894, that the Act of Congress of February 24, 1905, denies to the State Courts jurisdiction in such cases. This contention should be sustained if the Act of 1905 was applicable to the case in hand. It will be observed that the Act of 1905 author<a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>ized a suit to be brought in the Federal Courts “and not elsewhere.” But the Act of 1905 has no application to this case. The contract and the bond were both executed prior to the enactment of the statute, and it has been distinctly ruled by the Federal Courts that the statute relates to and affects substantive rights as well as procedure, and that where the contract was made prior to the act it is not within its provisions. The act provides “that hereafter any person or persons entering into a formal contract with the United States for the construction of any public work,......shall be required before commencing such work, to execute the usual penal bond, with good and sufficient sureties, with the additional obligation that such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them with labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract.” As the act affects substantive rights and not simply mere matters of procedure it - can have no retroactive effect, and is not applicable to contracts or bonds entered into prior to its passage. In United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company v. United States, <a href="/us/209/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="209 U.S. 306" data-case-ids="8289198" data-case-paths="/us/209/0306-01">209 U. S. 306</a>, an action brought upon a bond similar to the one in suit and executed in 1903, the Supreme Court of the United- States held that the Act of 1905 is prospective, and does not relate to or affect actions based upon rights of materialmen which had accrued prior to its passage, and that such actions are properly brought under the Act of 1894. A like conclusion was reached by the same court in Davidson Bros. Marble Company v. U. S., <a href="/us/213/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="213 U.S. 10" data-case-ids="8287412" data-case-paths="/us/213/0010-01">213 U. S. 10</a>. It is there said by Mr. Justice Moody, delivering the opinion: “In this case the. contract with and the bond to the United States,.and the contract under which Gibson furnished labor and materials, all antedate the passage of the amending-act (of 1905), and the rights of the parties, therefore, must be determined under the Act of 1894”’</p>

United <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>States, 187 Fed. Repr. 98, a suit was brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on the same bond and contract involved in the present action. The bond and original contract were entered into prior to the passage of the Act of 1905, but subsequent to the passage of the Act of 1905 certain supplemental contracts were made between the United States and The Schofield Company and additional work and materials were furnished under them. It was held that the Act of 1905 did not apply to suits for materials furnished under the supplemental contracts made subsequent to the passage of the act. In the case at bar the contract, the supplemental contract, and the bond were all entered into prior to the passage of the Act of 1905. The condition of the bond in suit requires “the surety company to conform in all respects to said contract as it now exists or may be modified by the parties thereto according to its terms.” The rights and liabilities of the parties were clearly fixed prior to the Act of 1905, and that act can have no effect upon them or on the procedure by which they are to be enforced. The fact that a part of the labor and materials were furnished subsequent to the passage of the Act of 1905 does not affect the case, as it was done in pursuance of the provisions of the contract of 1904, which determines the rights and liabilities of the parties.</p>
