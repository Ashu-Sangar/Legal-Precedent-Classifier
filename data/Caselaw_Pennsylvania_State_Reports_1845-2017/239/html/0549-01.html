The load was at least six feet high and consisted of long “stringers”; it was supported and kept in place by stanchions or uprights on, both sides held together at the top by wires. At the direction of one Beamer the plaintiff cut certain of these supports, which caused the lumber to fall. The testimony shows that Beamer employed the plaintiff and others; that at first he sent him to another place to work but subsequently brought him to the location of the bridge; that he had charge of, superintended and directed the work of the plaintiff and his fellow-workmen prior to and at the time of the accident; and that he not only employed the men, but at least one had been discharged by him. A witness for the plaintiff testified that Beamer had charge of the <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>defendant’s work at Ocean City where the bridge was being constructed, that he was the “superintendent of the bridge” who “gave the orders himself right straight out”; and another who was employed on the job said that Beamer had charge of and always directed the performance of all his duties. The defendant claimed that Beamer was merely a gang boss without authority to hire or discharge men and not in any sense a superintendent; but the defendant’s witness admitted that Beamer was in a position where, after being told what to do, he went ahead without consulting others above him, and that he was responsible for what he and the men under him did. The question of Beamer’s relation to the defendant corporation was, therefore, for the jury, and the issue was fairly submitted and found against the defendant.</p>

The jury could have found from the testimony that Beamer ordered several of the employees of the defendant company “to go to work in a great big hurry”; that he said, “Hurry up, men, because you have been down here all day and very near nothing done”; that one of the men took an axe and cut certain of the wires which held the supports of the lumber together; that at this time the plaintiff was “down the track a piece......not more than fifty yards” when “Beamer called him to this car” and said, “Go ahead and get the axe and cut it”; the plaintiff replied, “Do you mean me?” and Beamer said, “We have been here all day and we have not anything done.... .go ahead and cut them quick.” At that time all the supports but two had been severed; the plaintiff took up his axe and cut one of the remaining supports and “had cut one lick in the other” when it gave way and the lumber fell. The accident happened in April, 1907, at which time the plaintiff was 34 years of age; he was an inexperienced colored <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>man who knew nothing about unloading cars, never having done work of that character before, and he was not given any instructions. Under the circumstances we feel that the plaintiff’s cause falls within the rules governing cases where an employer gives orders for the prompt performance of work involving in its execution dangers to the employee, which dangers, while not obvious to the latter, the former knew or ought to have known and by the use of ordinary due care could have avoided; where the negligence consists in hurriedly ordering the employee without notice or instructions into a position of danger; and where the employee having been directed to perform the work quickly can be held to have acted on the judgment of his superior, upon the theory that a “servant is not called upon to set up his own unaided judgment against that of his superiors and may rely upon their advice and still more upon their orders,” and that in such cases he is not “held to the standard of care which should be exacted when there is more time for observation and deliberation.” (See Lee v.
