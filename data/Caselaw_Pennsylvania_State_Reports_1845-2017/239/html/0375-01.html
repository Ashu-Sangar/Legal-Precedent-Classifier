In that case, the Allentown National Bank, which had discounted a note made by Shimer and endorsed by Danner, presented its claim against the administratrix of the estate of Danner. It was shown that the note was protested after maturity, and that a written agreement had been entered into between the bank and Shimer by which it agreed to discount another note with another and a different endorser in place of the one endorsed by Danner, upon the understanding that such other note, or any renewals thereof or substitutions, should not be considered as payment. The agreement further provided that the transaction should not be considered as a release of the endorser, and the right was reserved to the bank to proceed to the collection of the money due on the original note as fully and effectively as if the additional notes, renewals and substitutions had not been made.
