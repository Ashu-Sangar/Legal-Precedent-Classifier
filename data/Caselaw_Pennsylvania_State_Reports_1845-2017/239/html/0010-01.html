    <p class="summary" id="b40-9" data-blocks='[["BL_40.15",40,[338,1867,1146,425]]]'>John Haberman died testate December 6, 1910, leaving to survive him a widow, but no issue. The only provision made in his will for his widow is the devise of a life estate in two and a quarter acres of land, upon which he resided, and a legacy of $300.00. She elects to take against the will, and claims that the amount in the hands of the accountant, $2,806.00, be distributed to her under the Act of April 1, 1909.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b40-10" data-blocks='[["BL_40.16",40,[340,2303,1143,99]],["BL_41.1",41,[123,353,1148,371]]]'>The legatees under the will offered an ante-nuptial agreement entered into between Mrs. Haberman and <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>the decedent, August 27, 1889, a few weeks prior to their marriage, by the terms of which she was to have upon his death the life estate given in the will, and if he survived her, he was to have $3,800.00, the whole amount of her estate, less legacies of $130.00, given to her kin. If, then, Mrs. Haberman is bound by this agreement her claim must be rejected.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b41-4" data-blocks='[["BL_41.4",41,[124,738,1150,807]]]'>When the agreement was made she was a widow, aged about fifty years, without children, and the decedent a bachelor, aged sixty-five years. He then owned real estate worth about $10,000 and $7,000 of personalty, consisting of money at interest. The agreement was prepared by a justice, now deceased, who did not understand German, and as Mrs. Haberman understood and spoke English very imperfectly, J. H. Haberman, decedent’s nephew, acted as interpreter. He says, “She told me first in German, then I told ’Squire Rodgers in English, after it was down he read it in English, then I read it in German again.” Mrs. Haberman says, “I didn’t understand half, when he explained anything he always spoke too fast, I could not understand half, it was half English and half German.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b41-5" data-blocks='[["BL_41.5",41,[126,1558,1148,480]]]'>That this contract is an unconscionable and unreasonable ante-nuptial agreement there can be no question. Whilst Mrs. Haberman is provided with a house to live in, there is no adequate provision for her maintenance, as it is entirely improbable that she could support herself by renting the two and a quarter acres of land, or by cultivating it herself. As against this inadequate provision for Mrs. Haberman, she covenants to give her husband all her estate, except $130.00 given her kin.</p>

It does show, however, that the agreement was made at the suggestion of J. H.
