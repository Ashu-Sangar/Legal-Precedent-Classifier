The issue, as stated by petitioner, is:\nWhether, by using an arbitrator\u2019s evidentiary ruling as the basis for a finding that he exceeded his authority, committed procedural irregularities, and deprived a party of due process, the Commonwealth Court improperly expanded the intended scope of review of Act 111 grievance arbitrations and acted contrary to both the prior holdings of this Court and the long held public policy of this Commonwealth favoring swift and final arbitration awards.\nThe parties are also requested to prepare argument on the following issue:\nIf the court determines that the arbitrator\u2019s actions were not merely an evidentiary ruhng but constituted an award of sanctions, there is an additional question of whether an arbitrator can award such sanctions, and, if so, what is a reviewing court\u2019s role in reviewing the sanctions under the Act 111 narrow certiorari scope of review.",
