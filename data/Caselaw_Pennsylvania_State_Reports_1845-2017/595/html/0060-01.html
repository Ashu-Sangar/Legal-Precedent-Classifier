Over the next decade, several decisions were issued by the Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ) regarding this petition, each of which was appealed to the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB) and subsequently remanded. In December, 1996, the WCAB again remanded the matter to the WCJ, this time for conclusions of law concerning the statute of limitations for filing a petition to set aside a final receipt.</p>

The parties stipulated claimant was entitled to specific loss benefits, which rendered moot the petition over which they had wrestled for so many years. Thus, the only issue before the WCJ was whether claimant’s specific loss benefits should be calculated based on his average weekly wage at the time of the original injury in 1976, or the date of the amputation in 1984. The WCJ concluded benefits should be calculated based on claimant’s 1976 wages, and ordered Liberty Mutual to pay such benefits. On appeal, the WCAB disagreed, and remanded for recalculation of benefits using claimant’s 1984 wages, having determined his specific loss injury occurred when his finger was amputated.</p>

The employer was entitled to credit for benefits paid because of the injury, but there was no issue in the Commonwealth Court’s opinion about which date’s wages would be used to calculate benefits.

Furniture Division/Burlington, </em>at 694 (Leadbetter, J., dissenting) (citing <em>South Abington Township v.

The dissent stated it would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Act to award specific loss <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>benefits based on claimant’s 1984 wages when he would only be entitled to benefits based on his 1976 wages if he had experienced merely a recurrence of his original injury.</p>
    <p id="b103-4" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[215,529,1155,524]]]'>We respectfully disagree with this conclusion. It is difficult to think of amputation as less than an “aggravation” of the prior injury. The amputation in 1984 was not a mere recurrence of the prior temporary injury for which claimant signed a final receipt six years previously, the efficacy of which the insurer defended for another dozen years. Having an injured finger that hurts in winter is not pleasant, but to lose the finger entirely is, at the very least, an “aggravation.” As such, we cannot accept the dissent’s application of the cited case law.</p>

This may be true where, as in <em>Bethlehem Mines, </em>the claimant receives permanent benefits from the time of the initial injury, wages being thus unchanged between injury and specific loss. However, where entitlement to benefits has been terminated, and only reestablished by intervening trauma such as amputation, the logic of the suggestion loses traction.</p>

Until 1996, there was no acknowledgment of a specific loss at all, despite the absent finger. For more than 13 years, employer’s insurer took the position the final receipt was the end of compensation payable for the injury. As of the date of the amputation, there certainly was no suggestion much less agreement that the prior trauma merely recurred and became a permanent loss. Even if it was the insurer that finally suggested in 1996 there was entitlement to specific loss benefits, it appears a bit disingenuous to have resisted any entitlement to benefits for the 1976 injury, lo these many years, and now claim 1976 is indeed the relevant date that spawned entitlement and hence must be used for calculations.</p>

Therefore, we hold claimant is entitled to permanent loss benefits based on his wage on the date of the specific loss injury, September 6, 1984. Since Kemper was the workers’ compensation provider at the time claimant suffered the specific loss injury, it is responsible for paying claimant’s specific loss benefits.</p>

    <p id="b105-4" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[199,449,1154,691]]]'>Finally, I agree with Judge Leadbetter’s observation that the remedial aims of the Workers’ Compensation Act might better be served by utilizing a claimant’s current wages upon resolution of an injury into a specific loss to calculate specific loss benefits. <em>See J.G Furniture v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Kneller), </em><a href="/a2d/862/0689-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="862 A.2d 689" data-case-ids="9162569" data-case-paths="/a2d/862/0689-01">862 A.2d 689</a>, 696 (Pa.Cmwlth.2004) (Leadbetter, J., dissenting). I believe, however, that the application of traditional principles pertaining to the existing statutory scheme yields the opposite result. As such, and given that the Act represents a compromise between the remedial goal and the furtherance of legitimate business interests, I conclude that any adjustment to the present scheme is better left to the Legislature.</p>

In distinguishing the amputation from the original injuiy, the majority places considerable reliance upon the absence of any claim for a compensable injury from 1978 to 1983 and Employer’s initial position that the execution of a final receipt effected an end to compensation payable for the injury. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 66-68, 938 A.2d at 237-38. Such reliance, however, fails to account for Claimant’s statement in the petition to set aside the final receipt that he had experienced continuing problems with his hand, which prompted a visit for treatment in 1980; Claimant's testimony and contentions in connection with his efforts to set aside the final receipt, <em>see </em>Opinion of WCJ Perry, August 25, 1995; <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>and the workers' compensation judge’s undisturbed factual finding concerning causation referenced above</p>
