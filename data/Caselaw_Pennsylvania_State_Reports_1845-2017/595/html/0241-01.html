The Commonwealth Court, in a four-three <em>en banc </em>decision, reversed the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia’s determination that the taking was lawful, and found that, among other things, the taking violated the Establishment Clause.

The RDA prepared a redevelopment proposal for the Planning Commission, including the request from Hope Partnership. The Planning Commission approved the proposal, which was then submitted to Philadelphia’s City Council (“City Council”). Following a public hearing, the City Council passed an ordinance approving the acquisition of, among other things, the 39 properties designated by the Hope Partnership and the Partnership was identified as the developer. There is no question that these properties were blighted — only two were actually still occupied — and the estimated just compensation for the Property was $12,000. All 39 properties were to be transferred to the Hope Partnership. R. 69a.</p>

According to Judge Pellegrini, the fact that the potential developer was a religious entity was not pertinent to the decision. Relying on <em>Belovsky, </em>the dissent would have found that the public purpose necessary to effectuate the taking is completely realized when the taking occurs for the purpose of clearance, reconstruction and rehabilitation of the blighted area. <em>In re 1839 N.

The secular purpose in the RDA’s taking of the Property was but another in a series of steps taken to eliminate blight, as established in the Urban Redevelopment Act. 35 P.S. § 1702 (“Redevelopment Authorities ... shall exist and operate for the public purposes of the elimination of blighted areas through economically and socially sound redevelopment of such areas ... in conformity with the comprehensive general plan of their respective municipalities”). The Property was one of many properties in the area, all certified as blighted for over a third of a century, which were acquired after a developer was found who expressed an interest in the redevelopment project. The Property was acquired pursuant to the Redevelopment Plan. R. 42b-63b. The elimination of blight is a valid public purpose that, in the absence of bad faith, is completely separate from any religious use of the property subsequent to the taking. <em>See In re Condemnation by the Urban Redevelopment Auth. of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/590/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="590 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="3852270" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0431-01">590 Pa. 431</a>, <a href="/pa/590/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="913 A.2d 178" data-case-ids="3852270,8436588" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0431-01,/a2d/913/0178-01">913 A.2d 178</a> (2006); <em>Belovsky v.

In <em>Mueller, </em>the Court rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to a program authorizing tax deductions for educational expenses because the class of direct beneficiaries included all parents rather than specific schools. Similarly, in <em>Witters, </em>the Court rejected a challenge to a vocational scholarship program that provided tuition aid to a blind student who wished to use the grant to attend a Christian college and become a pastor, because the aid that ultimately flowed to religious institutions did so only as a result of the choices of the aid recipients. In <em>Zobrest, </em>the Court examined whether a deaf student was permitted, under the Establishment Clause, to bring his state-employed sign-language interpreter with him to a Roman Catholic School. The Court concluded broadly that government programs that neutrally provide benefits to classes of citizens without regard to their religion are not <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge. Finally, in <em>Zelman, </em>the challenged program provided tuition aid for certain students to attend participating public or private schools of their parent’s choosing and tutorial aid for students who remained in public school. The Court held that because the aid reached the religious organizations only by way of the choices of the individual recipients, the incidental advancement of a religious mission is attributable to the individual aid recipients, not the government. In all of these cases, the Court emphasized that the student, not the religious school, was the intended beneficiary of the state aid, and that any money that ultimately went to the religious institution did so as an incidental result of private choices. <em>See also Agostini v.

The plan in question required assurances from religious beneficiaries of the plan that, for twenty years, the facilities would not be used for sectarian purposes, subject to a right of recapture in the event that they were so used. At the end of twenty years, however, the restrictions and right of recapture would lapse. Although the opinion was not a majority, the Justices unanimously agreed that the lack of restriction and a recapture right after twenty years violated the Establishment Clause by leaving a religious institution with something of substantial value, given by the government, in which the beneficiaries were permitted to forward religious interests.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

The Court reasoned that the scholarship program is not a form for speech, and its purpose, to assist students from low and middle income families with the cost of postsecondary education, was not “to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.” In so concluding, the Court pointedly distinguished cases dealing with speech forums as inapposite. Similarly, the Urban Redevelopment Law is not a forum for speech; its purpose, to eliminate blight, is not to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers. Viewpoint discrimination is not implicated where the issue does not implicate access to a forum for speech. To find, as the majority suggests, that withholding public funds from a religious school amounts to viewpoint discrimination would create an inherent conflict between the First Amendment’s establishment and expression aspects, causing the government to choose which aspect to vindicate, and which to violate, a result that finds no support in any legal authority.

This Court can affirm on any basis. <em>Carrozza v.
