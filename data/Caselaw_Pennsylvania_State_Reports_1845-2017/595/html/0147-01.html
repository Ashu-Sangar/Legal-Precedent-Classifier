In this case, the fact that there were multiple victims does not determine the limits of Parents liability coverage; the number of occurrences does. Although this is a disturbing case with tragic consequences, we are compelled to conclude that Parents’ alleged negligence constituted but a single “occurrence” for purposes of coverage under the Donegal insurance policy. Thus, we reverse the Superior Court’s finding that Donegal is required to provide coverage for six separate occurrences.</p>

The liability, if any, of the Baumhammers for the actions of their adult child implicates several issues, which include whether the Baumhammers owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs. The question of legal duty will involve a weighing of several discrete factors which include: (1) the relationship between the parties; (2) the social utility of the actor’s conduct; (3) the nature of the risk imposed and foreseeability of the harm incurred; (4) the consequences of imposing a duty upon the actor; and (5) the overall public interest in the proposed solution. <em>Althaus ex rel.

As to coverage, the majority examines the definition of an “occurrence” in the Policy, focuses on Richard Baumhammers’ violent acts, and determines that an accident, which qualifies as a covered occurrence under the Policy, took place because those acts were unexpected by the insureds. But then, to count the number of occurrences, the majority shifts its focus to the omissions of the Baumhammers that are alleged to be negligent, and states that “[b]ecause coverage is predicated on the Baumhammers’ inaction, and the resulting injuries to the several victims stem from that one cause, we hold that Parents’ alleged single act of negligence constitutes one accident and one occurrence.” (Majority opinion at 163, 938 A.2d at 295.).

Co., </em><a href="/so2d/849/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="849 So. 2d 263" data-case-ids="9105856" data-case-paths="/so2d/849/0263-01">849 So.2d 263</a>, 272 (Fla.2003) (referencing policies which include in the definition of occurrence “a series of related events”). Additionally, neither the policy’s use of the word “accident” nor, as explained below, its reference to repeated exposure does anything to clarify the number of occurrences in the instant case. Accordingly, I conclude that the definition of “occurrence” in Donegal’s policy is ambiguous. Under our longstanding case law, we must interpret ambiguous language in insurance policies in favor of the insured and against the insurance company as drafter of the provision. <em>Standard Venetian Blind Co. v.

[b]odily injury or [property damage.” R.R. at 81. In some cases, such as torts arising from exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, the phrase “continuous exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions” effectively limits the number of exposures found. The same language, however, has little utility in negligent supervision cases such as the one before us. In a case involving insurance coverage for negligent supervision of <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>a priest, Judge Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit opined on the application of a repeated exposure provision:</p>

Its language is a mismatch for a case in which the tort is negligent supervision of an intentional wrongdoer. “[C]ontinuous or repeated exposure to conditions” sounds like language designed to deal with asbestos fibers in the air, or lead-based paint on the walls, rather than with priests and choirboys. A priest is not a “condition” but a sentient being, and of course the victim was never “exposed” to the Diocese’s negligent supervision.</blockquote>

Respectfully, I must reject this conclusion because it fails to account for the second half of the occurrence definition relating to the infliction of bodily injury or property damage, which is also a prerequisite to every action for negligence. The absence of either a negligent act or an injury results in no coverage, either because the policy coverage would not be triggered absent the negligence act of the parents, or because, pragmatically, there would be no need for coverage if there were no injuries. If the Baumhammers had carelessly supervised their son and no one had been harmed as a result, there would be no actionable conduct to be covered by the insurance policy. Thus, the negligent act in and of itself cannot constitute an occurrence absent subsequent injury or property damage.</p>

In quantifying the number of occurrences, the point of conflict in both <em>D'Auria </em>and <em>Allen </em>relates to the first half of the definition of occurrence, because both cases involved numerous negligent acts. In <em>D'Auria, </em>the alleged negligent conduct involved a physician’s repeated misdiagnosis of a patient’s ailment, while in <em>Allen, </em>the negligent acts related to a woman’s repeated failure to protect children entrusted to her care from her pedophilic spouse.

I find this conclusion compelling because it acknowledges that a completed act of negligence requires both a breach of a duty of care and an injury. Moreover, it correlates to the potential number of tortious actions that could be brought against the insured. However, that interpretation results in the unenforceability of one sentence of the same limits of liability provision. The policy clearly provides, “This limit is the same regardless of the number of ‘insureds,’ claims made[,] or persons injured.” If the number of occurrences is always determined by the number of victims, then this unambiguous limit can never be applied, a conclusion that cannot be consistent with the parties’ intent. Accordingly, I am forced to reject this interpreta<a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>tion because I believe it conflicts with the language of the policy.</p>

A finding of an occurrence would require a pairing of both a negligent act of an insured, in this case the parents’ negligent supervision, and an injury, in this case the six shootings. However, to account for the unambiguous language rebuking the equation of number of occurrences with the number of victims, I employ the cause theory, as interpreted by other courts, to require consideration of whether there is “but one proximate, uninterrupted, and continuing cause which resulted in all the injuries and damage.” <em>See Allen, </em><a href="/a2d/708/0828-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="708 A.2d 828" data-case-ids="11821191" data-case-paths="/a2d/708/0828-01">708 A.2d at 833</a>; <em>D’Auria, </em><a href="/pa-super/352/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="352 Pa.

Under this interpretation, only one occurrence would result if multiple victims are injured in a single event, but separate occurrences result if there are separate events.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">4</a> For example, one occurrence would result if the negligence of the insured resulted in a tortfeasor detonating a single bomb, whether that bomb injured one or five hundred people because the injury or injuries resulted from one uninterrupted cause. In contrast, in considering the facts of the case at bar, each of the stops on Richard Baumhammers rampage constituted a separate event uniting of an allegedly negligent act and, crucially, an injury, triggering a completed act of negligence and therefore, a new occurrence under the terms of the policy. Accordingly, I would find one occurrence relating to the Mt. Lebanon death of Anita Gordon, a second occurrence consisting of the shooting of Anil Thakur and Sandip Patel in Scott Township, a third occurrence in Robinson Township where Ji<a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>Ye Sun and Thao Pak Pam were killed, and a fourth occurrence in Center Township which caused the death of Gary Lee.

The negligent act in this case is the alleged negligent supervision of Richard Baumhammers by his parents, specifically the (1) failure to obtain adequate mental health treatment, (2) failure to secure his gun, and (3) failure to notify authorities of the danger he posed. The Baumhammers and the victims in this case have not argued for three occurrences based on the allegations of negligence but instead have asserted six occurrences based on the number of victims that resulted from the shooting spree.</p>

Additionally, the outcome in <em>Allen </em>does not support the Majority's conclusion that the number of occurrences is dependent on the number of negligent acts because while the court in <em>Allen </em>found that the repeated failures of the wife constituted a single continuous act of negligence, the court nonetheless found one "occurrence” for each of the three children.</p>

Indeed, because that clause provides that exposure to one continuous cause triggers but one occurrence, logically, the absence of a single continuous cause should result in multiple occurrences.</p>
