Additionally before this Court are the following questions: (1) Did the General Assembly intend that a person charged under Section 6312(d) be subjected to individual counts for each item of child pornography possessed? and (2) If the General Assembly so intended, is it constitutional to impose separate punishments for each conviction? For the following reasons, we hold that Section 6312(d) is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Furthermore, we find that the General Assembly did intend that a person charged under Section 6312(d) may be subjected to individual counts and sentences for each item of child pornography possessed, and that the General Assembly’s intention in this regard is constitutional. Accordingly, we affirm the Superior Court.</p>

Lieutenant David C. Peifer of the CID, a 26-year police veteran, supervised the Taskforce. In the Fall of 1999, Lt. Peifer was involved in a joint federal and local initiative started by the <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>Dallas, Texas Police Department and the United States Postal Inspection Service, labeled Operation Avalanche. Operation Avalanche was an investigation into Landslide Incorporated (“Landslide”), a company that supplied child pornography for web access over the Internet. For a $29.95 fee, paid via credit card, an individual would gain access to Landslide’s Internet site for a 30-day period to view child pornography. Landslide’s Internet site was eventually shutdown and its records were seized by the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Dallas Police Department. Law enforcement recovered the database of customer records as a result of the seizure, constituting a list totaling over 35,000 names throughout the United States. The Dallas Police Department and the United States Postal Inspection Service then distributed the list to various task-forces and agencies throughout the United States for further investigation of individuals who purchased child pornography.</p>

Peifer and Detective William Henderson of the Ridley Township Police Department proceeded to the Ridley Township, Delaware County address provided for appellant in Landslide’s customer records. Lt.

Peifer asked appellant if others had access to the computer, and appellant explained that he owned the computer, that he was the only person with access to the computer and anything on the computer was put there by him. Lt. Peifer turned the computer off and disconnected the cables. While doing so, Lt. Peifer came across a separate hard drive sitting on top of the computer. Lt. Peifer asked about the hard drive, and appellant stated that he did not know what was on the hard drive, but that Lt. Peifer was free to take it. Lt.

Op. at 15-16. The court explained that viewing pictures of nude children for sexual gratification is a criminal act. Furthermore, the court held that Section 6312(d) is not overbroad, finding that viewing nude children for sexual stimulation or gratification “grossly offends what society deems to be acceptable behavior[,]” and prohibiting the same does not offend constitutionally protected activity. <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>

Appellant avers that the void-for-vagueness doctrine, Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, all focus on clear and understandable notice to citizens as to what conduct is prohibited by a statute, and on the fair, non-arbitrary enforcement of a statute. Appellant maintains that Section 6312(d) fails to define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness, rendering ordinary people unable to understand what conduct is prohibited, and encouraging arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Accordingly, appellant asserts that Section 6312(d) is void due to its vagueness.</p>

      <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>Appellant contends that the statutory qualifier to the term “nudity” in Section 6812(a) creates a standard that is completely subjective, requiring a person to guess at its meaning. Appellant argues that Section 6312(d) identifies three possible actors involved in the offense — the possessor, the depicter and any potential viewer. Appellant contends that one interpretation would punish the possessor if it was the purpose of the depicter to offer sexual stimulation or gratification to any potential viewer, and another interpretation would rest criminality on any viewer’s reaction.</p>
    <p id="b48-5" data-blocks='[["BL_48.4",48,[306,881,1161,1171]]]'>Further, appellant posits that the vagueness problem lies in determining which depictions of nude minors, not engaged in the statutorily specified sexual activity, qualify as “prohibited sexual acts.” Appellant asserts that the “any person” language in the Section 6312(a) “nudity” qualifier allows for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Thus, appellant argues that due to the absence of any objective criteria in the definition of “nudity,” while some pictures of a nude minor in a family or artistic setting are clearly not pornographic, they might provide sexual stimulation or gratification to a pedophile. Appellant consequently maintains that this fact would allow a subjective and potentially deviant viewpoint to control what constitutes child pornography under Section 6312. Moreover, appellant contends that a parent or an artist could be exposed to arrest for an otherwise innocent photograph if a police officer believed that the image was being depicted for sexual stimulation or gratification, thus inviting charges on a subjective basis. Accordingly, appellant maintains that, under Section 6312(d), an individual theoretically could be charged ■with and convicted for possessing images containing child nudity that are not possessed for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification.</p>

Appellant further charges that, under the “nudity” qualifier, child pornography becomes a strict liability crime negatively affecting individuals with a legitimate purpose, such as an artist, photographer, bookseller or advertiser. Appellant contends that these individuals cannot safely create or possess nude images of minors that do not implicate the Commonwealth’s interest in eradicating child pornography and protecting minors from sexual abuse. Appellant maintains that due to the language used, “the pedophilic gaze becomes central to the determination.” Appellant’s Brief at 23.</p>

Further, the Commonwealth maintains that the inclusion of Section 6312(f) prevents arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, and ensures that the statute does not encroach on a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. The Commonwealth asserts that Section 6312(d) serves to further a compelling state interest, to wit, protecting children by eradicating the production and supply of child pornography, thus preventing the abuse and exploitation of children.</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth posits as an example that photos of an infant in a bathtub taken by the child’s parents and disseminated to others objectively would not fall under the purview of Section 6312(d) because the images were not depicted for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of the viewer.</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth maintains that the “any person” language makes clear that the Commonwealth is not required to prove that a defendant was himself sexually aroused by the image.</p>

To the contrary, Section 6312(d) ensures that innocent depictions of nude minors do not fall under the statute because Section 6312(a) requires that the nudity be depicted for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification — an additional requirement that must be proven. Further, under Section 6312(f), the Commonwealth notes that materials with an educational, scientific, governmental or judicial purpose are specifically excluded from coverage under Section 6312(d).</p>

Accordingly, the Commonwealth asserts that Section 6312(d) is not overbroad because it clearly does not impinge on a substantial amount of constitutionally protected activity.</p>

Appellant charges that Section 6312(d) criminalizes the possession of nude images of minors if the distribution was intended, by the depicter, for sexual stimulation or gratification. This focus on the subjective intent of the depicter, appellant argues, fails to meet the due process requirement of notice. Appellant reasons that whereas the depicter has notice and knows whether his purpose in creating an image will run afoul of the statute, a mere possessor or viewer has no notice of the depicter’s intent and is therefore “held to an unconstitutional vicarious standard of criminal liability.” Appellant’s Reply Brief at 2. In any event, appellant maintains that a jury must still assess a possessor’s guilt through a determination of the depicter’s intent, thus making Section 6312(d) vague, overbroad and violative of the Due Process Clause notice requirements.</p>

Moreover, the Commonwealth notes that there is no double jeopardy issue if the General Assembly does not intend crimes to merge. In the Commonwealth’s view, appellant’s argument that possession of either one or of one thousand depictions of child pornography both constitute only a single count under Section 6312(d) is illogical and contrary to the General Assembly’s plain language and intent. In any event, the Commonwealth maintains that only lesser and greater included offenses can merge.</p>

The Commonwealth echoes the Superior Court panel below that possession of each image of child pornography is a different act, and thus, a different offense because each time a child is photographed in this context, that child is violated and victimized. The Commonwealth concludes that defendants who commit such multiple violations should not receive a volume discount for the many separate crimes they commit.</p>

Furthermore, the merger doctrine is of no benefit to appellant because a plain reading of the statute makes it apparent that the General Assembly intended possession of each pornographic image as a discrete and separate criminal act under Section 6312(d). Appellant’s offenses do not represent a single criminal act, and therefore his multiple criminal acts support his multiple convictions and sentences. There is nothing in this Court’s merger case law which supports the contention that only one sentence may be imposed for multiple criminal acts which result in multiple convictions.</p>

The General Assembly’s use of the term “any,” which could mean one or more items, suggests a lack of <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>restriction or limitation. Further, all of the objects listed in the statute are singular, <em>e.g., </em>a “photograph” or a “computer depiction,” meaning that each photograph or computer depiction constitutes a distinct occurrence of offensive conduct in violation of Section 6312(d). As the Superior Court correctly reasoned in <em>Koehler, </em>Section 6312(d) specifically criminalizes possession of any computer depiction, not possession of a computer hard drive which could contain an unknown quantity of images. <em>Koehler, </em><a href="/a2d/914/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="187" data-cite="914 A.2d 427" data-case-ids="8332691" data-case-paths="/a2d/914/0427-01">914 A.2d at 439</a>.

Each use of a minor to create a visual depiction of child pornography constitutes a separate and distinct abuse of that child, and thus represents an individual violation of the statute. As noted in <em>United States v. Esch, </em>“the key element of the offense is the use [of] a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of creating a visual depiction of such conduct____Each photograph depended upon a separate and distinct use of [a minor].” <em>Esch, </em><a href="/f2d/832/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="188" data-cite="832 F.2d 531" data-case-ids="10546290" data-case-paths="/f2d/832/0531-01">832 F.2d 531</a>, 542 (10th Cir.1987).

I write separately because I disagree with the majority that the trial court applied the correct interpretation of the statute when it evaluated whether certain images were, in fact, pornographic. As the plain language of the statute criminal<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>izes the possession of an image <em>based upon the intent of the depieter to titillate the viewer, </em>an image of a nude child is either pornographic at the moment of its creation, or it is not. Therefore, absent independent knowledge of the depicter’s intent, the context in which a third-party possessor stores an image is irrelevant to an inquiry of whether or not the image is pornographic. Rather, each image itself must indicate the intent of the depieter so that future viewers will be on notice that the image is illegal to possess. As I believe this standard may not have been properly applied by the factfinder, and for the reasons stated below, I would issue a limited remand. Thus, I dissent to the ultimate disposition of this case.</p>
    <p id="b77-5" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[208,993,1151,730]]]'>To come to this conclusion, I look to the words of the statute which are the key to ascertaining the intent of the Legislature. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921. The words here are clear: Section 6312 criminalizes, <em>inter alia, </em>the knowing possession of images of a minor engaged in a “prohibited sexual act.” Included in the definition of “prohibited sexual act” is “sexual intercourse ... lewd exhibition of the genitals or nudity if such nudity is depicted for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of any person who might view such depiction.” In ascertaining the intent of the Legislature, this Court can presume that the Legislature intended that this statute be constitutional. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3). We can thus assume that Section 6312 comports with the First Amendment and Due Process requirements of both the state and federal constitutions.</p>

On the other hand, the Court found that images of minors involved in lewd sexual conduct had “exceedingly modest, if not de minimis” value that is outweighed by the state’s compelling interest in protecting children from sexual exploitation and abuse. <em>See Ferber </em><a href="/us/458/0747-01" class="citation" data-index="261" data-cite="458 U.S. 747" data-case-ids="636693" data-case-paths="/us/458/0747-01">458 U.S. at 762-64</a>, <a href="/us/458/0747-01" class="citation" data-index="262" data-cite="458 U.S. 747" data-case-ids="636693" data-case-paths="/us/458/0747-01">102 S.Ct. 3348</a>. Section 6312 comports with that mandate because a nude image of a child is not banned <em>per se, </em>but rather becomes illegal only when the <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>child is engaged in a prohibited sexual act which includes images where the depicter of the image intended to titillate a subsequent viewer. Thus, once an image of a nude child is overtly sexualized or lewd, it steps outside the bounds of First Amendment protection, and the Commonwealth is free to criminalize it.</p>
    <p id="b78-5" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[315,663,1166,995]]]'>The next constitutional tenet to consider is the Due Process requirement of notice. In order to avoid a facial void-for-vagueness challenge, the statute must give fair warning of what conduct it criminalizes. <em>Commonwealth v.

To provide proper warning, the statute must provide a standard of conduct which is both ascertainable and objective. <em>Id. </em>at 772. Section 6312 provides an ascertainable and objective standard when it criminalizes images of children engaged in a prohibited sexual act when (1) the child is nude; and (2) the nudity is depicted in a sexually titillating manner, because the subjective intent of the depicter to sexually gratify the viewer will be manifest in the image itself.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The Legislature has clearly forbidden the knowing possession of images of nude children which are overtly sexualized or lascivious. As the majority stated, the content, focus and setting of the image itself will give fair notice to the viewer if the depicter had a prurient purpose. In other words, Section 6312 puts a viewer on notice that lewd or lascivious images of nude children are illegal.</p>

Knox, </em><a href="/f3d/32/0733-01" class="citation" data-index="266" data-cite="32 F.3d 733" data-case-ids="1844459" data-case-paths="/f3d/32/0733-01">32 F.3d 733</a>, 746 (3d Cir.1994), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals looked to the dictionary definition of “lascivious” which is defined as “tending to excite lust” or “lewd”. Under both the federal and Pennsylvania statutes, images of children which tend to excite lust are identifiable and give notice to the viewer that the image is prohibited.</p>
    <p id="b79-5" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[216,829,1157,1272]]]'>Clarifying the objective standard in Section 6312 is especially important in a case such as this one in which the depicter’s identity is unknown, and when the possessor acquired the images through an intermediary on the internet. Previous precedent construing Section 6312 has involved prosecution of the depicter as opposed to a third-party possessor. <em>See Commonwealth v. Savich, </em><a href="/a2d/716/1251-01" class="citation" data-index="267" data-cite="716 A.2d 1251" data-case-ids="11707028" data-case-paths="/a2d/716/1251-01">716 A.2d 1251</a> (1998). Circumstantial evidence related to the depicter is always germane when it is the depicter who is charged with the crime, because the statute criminalizes behavior based on the depicter’s intent. In the case of a third-party possessor, circumstantial evidence must be carefully vetted to insure that it meets the standard set forth in the statute which makes clear that child pornography only includes images created with prurient intent. For example, if a pedophile were to acquire a photograph of a child playing in the nude that had been taken by the child’s parents as a family memento, and the pedophile were to add that photograph to his or her collection of child pornography, the fact that the pedophile uses the image for the purposes of sexual stimulation would not make that otherwise innocent image into pornography, because the intent of the depicter was not for the purposes of sexual titillation. Objectively, that image does not tend to excite lust, and therefore, it is not criminal to possess.</p>

For example, the possessor has control of a series of photographs clearly depicting the same child and in some of the series the child is engaged in a prohibited sexual act while in others the child is simply nude. The fact that the third-party possessor has the entire series would put him or her on notice of the depicter's intent to cause sexual stimulation, which is criminal under Section 6312. This is one of the rare cases in which circumstantial evidence beyond any particular image itself would be relevant in the case of the prosecution of a third-party possessor.

If the book gives rise to 500 individual acts of criminal conduct, then I question the meaning of inclusion of the term “book” in the pertinent statutory section. Conversely, if the book gives rise to only one criminal act, which is consistent with a fair reading of the statute, then the determinative fact appears to be whether the defendant left his photographs loose, or organized them into a “book;” a term which could perhaps include a traditional photo album or loose leaf binder.
