In a relatively unusual procedure, the jury was charged with rendering a verdict on some of the charges, while the trial judge had the task of deciding another.

In <em>Ashe, </em>the government charged Bob Ashe with the gunpoint robbery of six men while they played poker in a friend’s basement. The government’s theory of the case was that Ashe committed the armed robbery with two or three other men. Ashe initially was tried for his part in the robbery of only one of the six victims. At trial, however, the identification evidence was weak and Ashe ultimately was acquitted due to insufficient evidence. Six weeks later, the government again tried Ashe for robbery, this time against a different victim. Once more, the government’s evidence was weak, although there was some improvement in the witnesses’ ability to identify Ashe. This time, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Ashe challenged the conviction, and the fact of the second trial, on the basis of double jeopardy. The United States Supreme Court held that the second trial should not have taken place:</p>

The Commonwealth characterizes the procedural posture of the instant case as a “classic hung jury situation,” and likens it to <em>McCane. </em>The Commonwealth insists that “there is absolutely no basis for concluding that retrial of States should be classified as a subsequent prosecution.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 20. Nonetheless, the Commonwealth concedes that “this Court has stated that double jeopardy encompasses elements of collateral estoppel <em>(i.e. </em>issue preclusion), under which a verdict ‘may, in certain circumstances, be viewed as a finding that forecloses consideration of an issue or fact in a subsequent prosecution.’ ” <em><a href="/us/395/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="395 U.S. 711" data-case-ids="1772134" data-case-paths="/us/395/0711-01">Id.</a> </em>(citing <em>Buffington, </em><a href="/pa/574/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="828 A.2d 1024" data-case-ids="588034,9107964" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0029-01,/a2d/828/1024-01">828 A.2d at 1032</a>). The Commonwealth does not offer any suggestion on how to reconcile its two assertions. Of course, if a retrial that follows a hung jury does not implicate double jeopardy concerns in any manner, and collateral estoppel in the criminal context is part of double jeopardy protections, then the application of collateral estoppel principles to any criminal <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>retrial is improper. But such a conclusion would render the rationale of our decisions in <em>Buffington </em>and <em>Zimmerman </em>invalid, and does the same to the Superior Court’s rationale in <em>Harris, Wallace, </em>and other cases. Each of those eases involved partially hung juries followed by retrials. In each, there existed the potential for application of collateral estoppel, and in some of them, the principle indeed was applied.

Thus, <em>McCane </em>is not controlling as it did not involve an acquittal of some of the charges and, therefore, did not implicate principles of collateral estoppel. Nor is <em>McCane </em>appropriate as persuasive authority on the issue of whether to apply collateral estoppel principles following a partial acquittal.

In <em>Wallace </em>the defendant was brought to trial on charges of attempted homicide and assault after the trial court granted the defendant's motion for severance of an additional weapons charge. Following an acquittal on the homicide and assault charges, the Commonwealth conceded that the jury's verdict definitively established that the defendant did not possess a gun, but nonetheless attempted to proceed to trial on the previously severed weapons charge. The Superior Court panel concluded that the defendant's request for severance did not prevent him from invoking collateral estoppel principles. Moreover, the <em>Wallace </em>court held, the Commonwealth’s concession that the jury found the defendant did not possess a gun precluded the Commonwealth from attempting to relitigate the issue. While <em>Wallace </em>certainly stands for the proposition that a request for and grant of severance does not eliminate application of collateral estoppel, the case goes no further and makes no comment on whether or to what extent a joint jury/bench trial affects application of collateral estoppel. Because <em>Wallace </em>was not a joint jury/bench trial, it does not control the facts before us.</p>
      <p id="b501-6" data-blocks='[["BL_501.3",501,[197,1685,1123,696]]]'>Nonetheless, we agree with the principle States asserts: his request for severance, which operated as a specific waiver of his right to have all charges brought against him in one proceeding, cannot be converted into a general waiver of all constitutional double jeopardy rights. Further, and perhaps more important, we do not see how States' agreement to a simultaneous jury/bench trial could be interpreted as a waiver of <em>all </em>double jeopardy protections. While the concession to a joint trial certainly may be viewed as an agreement to allow two different fact finders to reach independent (and perhaps contradictory) verdicts following a single proceeding, this case represents much more than that. In order to find for the Commonwealth here, we would have to determine that States’ agreement to the joint trial included a knowing and voluntary appreciation of the fact that the jury may be unable to reach a verdict, and if so, the Commonwealth would have the right to present the evidence to a jury a second time, regardless of how the trial judge ruled and regardless of States' double jeopardy/collateral estoppel righis. We would not find waiver of such an important Constitutional right in such circumstances.</p>

Clearly, there was no governmental overreaching in this case and no attempt by the Commonwealth to wear the defendant down with multiple trials, which would support a finding of double jeopardy. In fact, the separate trials in this case were a product of appellee’s own request and trial strategy. The Majority nevertheless awards the ultimate constitutional windfall. I disagree with the Majority’s far-reaching conclusion, and therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>

Appellee moved to sever the charge of accidents involving death or personal injury while not properly licensed from the other charges so that the jury would not learn that he did not have a valid driver’s license. The trial court granted the motion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Thus, it was appellee who demanded that he face not one, but two prosecutions. After invoking its right to a trial by jury, the Commonwealth agreed to a bifurcated trial with the accidents involving death or personal injury charge to be tried in a simultaneous bench trial along with the jury trial on the remaining charges. Appellee agreed to this bifurcated approach, which accommodated his severance request. Ultimately, the jury deadlocked on the charges of homicide by vehicle, homicide by vehicle as a result of driving under the influence of alcohol, and driving under the influence of alcohol. The trial court declared a mistrial and dismissed the jury, thus opening the way to retrial on those charges. On the less serious charge of accidents involving death or personal injury while not properly licensed, the trial court found appellee not guilty. Although it was not necessary to explain the basis for its decision to acquit, the trial court gratuitously offered that it felt that the Commonwealth had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellee was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident.</p>

Appellee argued that the bench trial acquittal on the minor charge precluded retrial on the remaining charges because the trial court — which was not the factfinder on those charges— had expressly found that he was not driving the vehicle. Appellee contended that, because each of the other charges required him to be the driver, the trial court’s statement and acquittal precluded a jury from returning a guilty verdict on <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>any of the remaining charges. The trial court disagreed and denied the motion, concluding that, as a general principle, a retrial following a mistrial does not violate double jeopardy and that, when a case is bifurcated with separate trials by different factfinders, inconsistent verdicts based upon the same facts are permissible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> In my view, the trial court’s analysis and conclusion are correct, and therefore, I would reverse the Superior Court’s decision upsetting that judgment.</p>

I respectfully disagree, however, with the Majority’s easy dismissal of this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

In my view, the reasoning employed in <em>McCane </em>is directly on point, as both cases involve the application of principles of double jeopardy to second prosecutions following a hung jury. In <em>McCane, </em>this Court succinctly stated when double jeopardy applies: “The prohibition against double jeopardy protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and multiple punishments for the same offense.” <em><a href="/pa/517/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="539 A.2d 340" data-case-ids="1809849,1809918,1809923" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0489-01,/pa/517/0488-01,/pa/517/0487-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/517/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="539 A.2d 340" data-case-ids="1809849,1809918,1809923" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0489-01,/pa/517/0488-01,/pa/517/0487-01">at 345-46</a> (citation omitted). The Majority correctly notes that the defendant in <em>McCane </em>had not been acquitted on any charges; instead, the jury was simply unable to reach a verdict as to the charges which the Commonwealth was seeking to retry. Likewise, in the ease <em>sub judice, </em>the Commonwealth did not seek to retry appellee on the charge of accidents involving death or personal injury while not properly licensed, for which he was acquitted by a judicial factfinder, but rather only on the separate charges that resulted in a jury deadlock and a declaration of mistrial. Because this case does not involve a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, or a multiple conviction or <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>punishment for the same offense, pursuant to <em>McCane, </em>double jeopardy is not implicated.</p>
    <p id="b511-4" data-blocks='[["BL_511.4",511,[185,455,1157,829]]]'>The Majority invokes collateral estoppel principles as affording a basis for its decision, concluding that the trial court’s unnecessary, record explanation of the reason for its verdict of acquittal precludes the Commonwealth from exercising its right to have a jury determine whether appellee was the driver in any retrial on the deadlocked charges. Application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel requires the adjudication of a specific issue with a resolution, in this instance, in favor of appellee. In its opinion addressing appellee’s motion to dismiss, the trial court correctly noted that two separate factfinders may make inconsistent findings of fact and, as a result, reach inconsistent verdicts; if that were not so, the court noted, there would be little reason to sever charges or bifurcate trials.

The trial judge rendered a verdict, but the jury was unable to do so; that jury deadlock was inconsistent with the trial judge’s statement that he found unconvincing the Commonwealth’s proof that appellee was the driver of the vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[306,614,1162,1491]]]'>Another difficulty with the Majority’s double jeopardy analysis is that it attaches constitutional consequences to a case-specific oddity — that the trial court stated the grounds for its acquittal — which is not a necessary part of a bench trial or a verdict in a bifurcation setting. A trial judge is not required to state the basis for an acquittal in a bench trial and, if the trial judge had not announced the basis for his decision here, appellee’s claim would lack any legal predicate. Acquittals are returned, by bench trial judges and by juries, for a variety of reasons, some legally justifiable, and some less so. Among the latter are acquittals reflecting factfinder nullification of charges, misunderstanding of the law, mercy verdicts, or decisions resulting from bias or prejudice. Thus, the fact of an acquittal does not necessarily mean that either the defense proffered or the argument forwarded was credited. In most instances, the basis for and legitimacy of the acquittal cannot be second-guessed; the verdict is conclusive. In terms of its inherent legal effect, then, an acquittal does not act as a finding concerning any particular fact: indeed, a factfinder may believe that all elements of a crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and yet acquit anyway. This reality is a factor which both the defendant and the Commonwealth weigh in determining whether to demand a jury or a judicial factfinder. Given this reality, a factfinder’s gratuitous statement of the reasons for a verdict of acquittal should not operate as a substitute for what is the only ineluctable effect of the verdict. In my judgment, a federal double jeopardy bar should not depend upon such an arbitrary factor.</p>

No interest of respondent protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated by continuing prosecution on the remaining charges brought in the indictment. Here respondent offered only to resolve part of the charges against him, while the State objected to disposing of any of the counts against respondent without a trial. Respondent has not been exposed to conviction on the charges to which he pleaded not guilty, nor has the State had the opportunity to marshal its evidence and resources more than once or to hone its presentation of its case through a trial. The acceptance of a guilty plea to lesser included offenses while charges on the greater offenses remain pending, moreover, has none of the implications of an “implied acquittal” which results from a verdict convicting a defendant on lesser included offenses rendered by a jury charged to consider both greater and lesser included offenses. There simply has been none of the governmental overreaching that double jeopardy is supposed to prevent. On the other hand, ending prosecution now would deny the State its right to one full and fair opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws.</blockquote>

Once a jury acquitted Wallace of attempted homicide and assault, the Commonwealth conceded that the jury found that Wallace did not possess a gun; and based solely upon that concession, the Superior Court found that Wallace could not be tried on the severed firearms charges. Thus, none of the cases the Majoiity relies upon control the issue presented here, much less do they command that we lose sight of the double jeopardy values that must guide our inquiry.</p>

      <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>Because they are powered by the values which undergird the protection against double jeopardy, the decisions in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Blyden </em>are relevant here. As a matter of constitutional principle, neither double jeopardy nor collateral estoppel precludes a full prosecution of a matter, based upon an acquittal in a separate prosecution, where the defendant is responsible for the severance of the charges that led to separate prosecutions before separate factfinders. In such an instance, there is no governmental overreaching. By contrast, in <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em><a href="/us/397/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="397 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12054849" data-case-paths="/us/397/0436-01">397 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/397/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="397 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12054849" data-case-paths="/us/397/0436-01">90 S.Ct. 1189</a>, <a href="/us/397/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="397 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12054849" data-case-paths="/us/397/0436-01">25 L.Ed.2d 469</a> (1969), the defendant was charged in separate criminal complaints with robbing six poker players. After a jury acquitted him of robbing one of the victims based on insufficient identification evidence, the prosecutor sought to try him for the robbery of a second poker player. Clearly, concerns of governmental overreaching are implicated in that scenario. In this case, the Commonwealth intended to try all charges against appellee in a single trial, but appellee demanded and received a separation of the proceedings. This is governmental accommodation, not governmental oppression. The windfall the Majority accords appellee furthers no constitutional value; it does, however, operate to deprive the Commonwealth of its constitutional right to a trial by jury. <em>See </em>Pa. Const. Art. I, Sec. 6; <em>Commonwealth v. White, </em><a href="/pa/589/0642-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="589 Pa. 642" data-case-ids="2572097" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0642-01">589 Pa. 642</a>, <a href="/pa/589/0642-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="910 A.2d 648" data-case-ids="2572097,8448754" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0642-01,/a2d/910/0648-01">910 A.2d 648</a> (2006).

In light of today’s decision, the Commonwealth should vigorously resist severance requests in similar cases, and let the jury hear the whole truth about the defendant and the full array of the crimes charged. If that fails, the Commonwealth should insist that the bench trial verdict be rendered after the jury verdict or, failing that, should insist upon an explicit waiver of what will come to be known as the defendant’s <em>“Commonwealth v. States </em>right,” <em>i.e., </em>the right to double jeopardy relief where no double jeopardy value is implicated.</p>

Although the court acquitted, it obviously did not find that the Commonwealth’s evidence concerning who was driving was insufficient to present a jury question.

Again, there is no governmental overreaching here; it is governmental accommodation, in a circumstance arising from appellee's own split-trial demand. If the implicit complaint is that the logically resulting waiver should not be chargeable to appellee because he was unaware of that possible effect, his quarrel is a collateral one with his lawyer. I know of no authority that requires an explicit waiver of all contingent effects in such circumstances. Frankly, it is unlikely in the extreme that a defendant in appellee’s circumstances at the time he made the motion, even if explicitly informed, would have insisted upon the single trial where the jury would have heard the harmful truth he was trying to keep from it. And so, I repeat, the windfall here serves no legitimate constitutional value; it lets a criminal defendant's pretend complaint turn a constitutional shield into a perverse sword.</p>

The trial court had one duty — determine whether the evidence warranted a verdict of guilty or not guilty on the Accidents Involving Death charge. The court was not empowered to bind the jury by finding specific facts. This case does not come to this Court in the posture of evaluating the evidence that may support a finding of guilt on the other charges, which were before the jury — there is no conviction against which to test that sufficiency. The question here is collateral estoppel.</p>

It may be that all 12 found appellee was the driver, but disagreed on other elements of the charges.

The trial court here did not “necessarily determine” driving was not proved — it found appellee not guilty, then went beyond its obligation and stated the reasons for its determination. <em>See </em>Trial Court Opinion, 7/15/04, at 3 (“[T]his [c]ourt admitted at the hearing on the motion to dismiss that the reason for its verdict of not guilty was that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt ...

At a retrial for the unresolved charges, would proof of driving be necessary?
