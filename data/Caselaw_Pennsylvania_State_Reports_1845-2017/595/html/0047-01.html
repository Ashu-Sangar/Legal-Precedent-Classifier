In analyzing this question, the <em>FOP II </em>court did not determine whether the 2003-04 retiree premium cap constituted a diminishment in health care benefits that current employees could expect upon retirement. Rather, the <em>FOP II </em>court focused on the latter portion of § 2962(c)(3) — namely, whether health care benefits provided to FOP retirees in any fashion implicated “rights or privileges of ... any present municipal employee in his pension or retirement system.” The <em>FOP II </em>court concluded they did not. The <em>FOP II </em>court interpreted the “pension or retirement system” language to be confined to referring to only those pension or retirement systems that were statutorily created.

At issue in that matter was whether an Act 111 interest arbitration panel exceeded its powers when it issued an award eliminating postretirement health benefits for retirees. In that matter, the township and a lodge of the FOP had a series of collective bargaining agreements in which the township had contracted to pay for the premiums on post-retirement health care benefits for retired police officers. The parties could not agree on a collective bargaining agreement for the 1983-1984 term. The dispute was submitted to interest arbitration. One of the issues the township submitted for arbitration was whether the township should continue to pay for the health <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>care benefit for retirees.

This prohibition can be parsed into two parts. The first is whether the provision in question constitutes a “diminishment”; the second is whether this diminishment impacted a benefit conferred by a “pension or retirement system”. The <em>FOP II </em>court focused on the latter of these two points, namely, whether the 2003-04 health care provision impacted the FOP’s constituents’ rights and privileges in a pension or retirement system. As noted <em>supra, </em>the <em>FOP II </em>concluded that these post-retirement health care benefits were not part of a “pension or retirement” system as they were contractually created and not statutorily conferred.

As there is no material difference between the 2003-04 retiree premium cap and comparable provisions in the preceding two working agreements, then we cannot conclude that the 2003-04 retiree premium cap worked a diminishment. As cogently stated by the trial court, this 2003-04 retiree premium cap merely “carried forward and renewed a mutually agreed to contractual right in place since January 1, 1996.” Tr. ct. op. at 6-7. Thus, as the 2003-04 retiree premium cap did not work a diminishment, there is no tension between this provision and § 2962(c)(3).

The FOP does not go so far as to make the quixotic argument that the language of the 2003-04 retiree premium cap differs from the comparable provisions in the preceding two working agreements. Rather, the FOP contends that in practice, the City has historically provided fully paid medical benefits to retired police officers even though contracts between the parties have not compelled it. The FOP recounts that in 1991, an Act 111 grievance arbitration award compelled the City to continue its past practice of paying the premiums on retiree health care policies even though the contract between the City and the FOP specifically provided that the City had no such obligation. <em>See </em>FOP’s brief at 7 (referencing the August 7,1991 Grievance Arbitration Award of Arbitrator O’Connell). The FOP goes on to state that following this 1991 grievance arbitration award, the City “continued to provide post-retirement medical benefits to retiring officers ... up to the effective date of the 2003-04 [Arbitration Award].” FOP’s brief at 7.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
