The matter was remanded to determine whether the High Court’s ruling should be applied retroactively. The <em>McNulty </em>Court held that the constitutional ruling applied only from the date of the decision forward because the tax was not unconstitutional until the U.S. Supreme Court so declared.</p>

      <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>The trial court noted that Section 5556b contemplates retro-activity, but rejected Oz Gas’s argument that the refund provision requires retroactive application of a case decision any time a statute or ordinance is held to be unconstitutional or its existing interpretation is found to be erroneous. The court found that subsection (b) merely provides an avenue of appeal in instances where the right to a refund is not based upon a finding that the tax statute is invalid, stating that subsection (b) plainly means: “a taxpayer is not required to pursue alternate refund remedies if the refund is claimed pursuant to a provision of a tax statute subsequently held by a court to be erroneous.” Trial Ct. Op. at 7. Looking to this Court’s decision in <em>McNulty, </em>the court further noted that, even though the refund statute at issue in that case was worded differently than Section 5556b, the same analysis pertained because both <em>McNulty </em>and the matter <em>sub judice </em>involve the question of a governmental entity’s entitlement to taxes:</p>

The <em>Chevron </em>analysis looks to: (1) whether the decision established a new principle of law; (2) a balancing of the merits by looking at the history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retroactive application will further or retard its operation; and (3) an evaluation of the equities involved. As to the first factor, the trial court concluded that <em>IOGA </em>did announce a new principle of law because this Court “decided an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 9 (citing <em>Chevron, </em><a href="/us/404/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="404 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6171158" data-case-paths="/us/404/0097-01">404 U.S. at 106</a>, <a href="/us/404/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="404 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6171158" data-case-paths="/us/404/0097-01">92 S.Ct. 349</a>). The trial courts conclusion that <em>IOGA </em>was not foreshadowed was based upon <em>F.H. Rockwell Co. v.

The overall effect of <em>IOGA, </em>in the courts view, was to grant the plaintiff in that case equitable and declaratory relief which, by its nature, is forward looking. In addition, the court noted that retroactive application would deprive political subdivisions of revenues already disbursed for the needs of the local governments and would, therefore, thwart the purpose of the statute. Finally, in the courts view, the third factor, the equities, weighed heavily in favor of prospective application of <em>IOGA </em>because for nearly 100 years property owners had paid <em>ad valorem </em>taxes on oil and gas interests, and tax sales had resulted from non-payment of those taxes. Retroactive appli<a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>cation of <em>IOGA </em>would, in effect, invalidate each of those tax sales, perhaps leading prior owners to seek return of the properties lost to those tax sales. The court also recognized the burden on the Taxing Authorities of having to refund taxes paid for the three years prior to <em>IOGA, </em>which could prove financially devastating to small rural governments that have depended on the taxation of oil and gas interests. Thus, the trial court ultimately found that: “based on a careful analysis of the <em>Chevron </em>factors, this Court concludes that all three prongs are satisfied and that the <em>[IOGA </em>] decision should be applied prospectively only.” Tr.

According to Forest, the Commonwealth Court erred by finding that the requirement that the taxing authority is not legally entitled to the tax pursuant to Section 5566b(a) is met when, consistent with Section 5566b(b), the tax statute is subsequently found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction. This intermingling of the subsections is, Forest claims, contrary to Section 1903(b) of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(b), which provides that: “General words shall be construed to take their meanings and be restricted by preceding particular words.” Forest contends that subsection (b) deals with alternative refund remedies unless the tax provision is held to be invalid, and that there is no indication in the statute that the alternative remedy provision is intended to define the term “not legally entitled” as used in subsection (a).</p>
    <p id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[196,1541,1153,476]]]'>Forest further argues that the Commonwealth Courts interpretation of Section 5566b is in conflict with <em>McNulty, </em>where this Court held that a tax refund statute by itself did not resolve the question of whether a decision like <em>IOGA, </em>disapproving a tax, should apply retroactively. Instead, Forest submits, the court must look to judicial precedent to determine the issue of retroactivity as the question of retroactivity in this instance is a judicial question, not a legislative one, which must be resolved by applying the <em>Chevron Oil </em>test.</p>

Warren notes (as Forest does) that at common law there was no right to a refund even if taxes were mistakenly paid or wrongly assessed. Section 5566b, therefore, is significant in that it altered the common law by providing a mechanism for refund. Thus, according to Warren, <em>Oz Gas </em>is entitled to a refund only of any taxes paid after <em>IOGA </em>because, after that decision, the Taxing Authorities were not legally entitled to collect the taxes.</p>

Oz Gas contends that Section 5566b would be rendered meaningless if a court finding a tax invalid could give that finding prospective-only application, where it was plainly the legislative intention to provide a mechanism for obtaining a refund of payments made on an invalid tax. Oz Gas counters Forests argument that the language of Section 5566b discussing taxes subsequently held invalid does not define the phrase “not legally entitled” by insisting that the only reasonable interpretation of Section 5566b would link the two phrases, with the concept of a subsequent holding of invalidity giving meaning to the term not legally entitled.</p>

      <em>IOGA </em>differs from <em>Scheiner </em>in that <em>IOGA </em>found that the <em>ad valorem </em>taxes on oil and gas reserves, at issue in that case, were improper as a matter of statutory construction, and not on constitutional grounds. A reasoned argument could be made (as it was made by the dissenting opinion in Smith) that a taxing statute found to be unconstitutional (as in <em>Scheiner) </em>should be deemed unconstitutional from its inception because the constitutional provision the statute violated never changed.

In <em>IOGA, </em>this Court interpreted Section 201(a) and determined that <em>ad valorem </em>taxes could not be assessed against oil and gas reserves that remained underground as a matter of statutory construction.

A retroactivity decision in a case like <em>Kendrick </em>implicates a fundamental liberty interest which simply is not present in a civil dispute involving a tax statute. This difference in interests is exemplified by the effect of a decision involving retroactivity. <em>IOGA </em>does not subject individuals to criminal liability but rather exempts certain taxpayers from paying <em>ad valorem </em>taxes. If a tax statute under which political subdivisions have been collecting taxes is declared invalid by this Court, as happened in <em>IOGA, </em>the future effect on the political subdivisions is clear, and those entities can budget public moneys to account for any decrease in tax revenue. To apply such a decision retroactively, however, subjects the taxing entities to the potentially devastating repercussion of having to refund taxes paid, budgeted and <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>spent by the entities for the benefit of all, including those who challenged the tax.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> In contrast, the <em>Besch </em>decision exempted certain individuals from the reach of a criminal statute, vindicating a liberty interest.

    <p id="b182-4" data-blocks='[["BL_182.4",182,[310,761,1162,742]]]'>Due to the perhaps-unique effect of holding that a decision regarding a tax statute is retroactive, the approach in <em>McNulty </em>(and the <em>Smith </em>plurality) is sensible. To avoid the potentially devastating consequences to taxing entities, it is important that taxes collected pursuant to a valid statute remain valid unless and until otherwise determined by this Court. The incentive to challenge still remains for the challenge, if successful, results in relief from the tax going forward. With respect to tax statutes, then, we reaffirm <em>McNulty </em>in holding that a decision of this Court invalidating a tax statute takes effect as of the date of the decision and is not to be applied retroactively. Accordingly, <em>IOGA </em>does not apply retroactively to invalidate taxes paid by Oz Gas for the three years prior to the issuance of that decision.</p>

Section 5566b clearly entitles a taxpayer to a refund only where “the political subdivision is not legally entitled” to the taxes. Pursuant to <em>McNulty, </em>the significance of the prospective application of <em>IOGA </em>is that the taxes at issue were valid until the date of the decision in <em>IOGA, </em>and the Taxing Authorities were legally entitled to collect the taxes prior to that decision. Thus, because the authorities were legally entitled to the taxes <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>paid prior to the <em>IOGA </em>decision, no refund is warranted under Section 5566b.</p>

Moreover, the taxpayer may seek the tax refund under the Refund Law where the taxpayer’s claim is to recover taxes paid under a statutory interpretation of a taxing provision which a court subsequently held to be erroneous. 72 P.S. § 5566b(b).
