A basic factual challenge to the underpinnings of the expert’s opinion was made here. While it is speculative to presume decedent would never return to work, it is also speculative to presume she would have done so in any of the capacities the expert considered. There was evidence calling all of this into question; at the very least, the timing and capacity of her potential return to work was at issue, rendering the expert’s evidence controverted.</p>
    <p id="b717-6" data-blocks='[["BL_717.6",717,[162,1844,1153,349]]]'>The concept of <em>Kiser, </em>that the verdict must bear a relation to the evidence, is in tension with the notion that a jury may reject any evidence offered, even if uncontroverted; a jury is not obliged to believe or disbelieve any evidence presented at trial, including an expert’s opinion. However, a jury’s verdict cannot be based on whim or caprice, hence the holding in <em>Kiser.</em>

If one party has the burden of proof, opposing counsel may strenuously controvert the evidence through cross-examination and argument; reasons not to accept the plaintiffs evidence may suffice to prevent the meeting of that burden, even without affirmative countervailing evidence.</p>
    <p id="b718-4" data-blocks='[["BL_718.4",718,[317,807,1161,772]]]'>The evidence here was not uncontroverted, and the expert’s opinion did not amount to “proven damages.” Appellants’ counsel challenged the underlying facts supporting the opinion of loss posed by appellee’s expert witness; it was admitted by the expert that if decedent never returned to the workforce, her net economic loss would be zero. Indeed, every scenario concerning the net economic loss of decedent was based on speculation as to whether she would have returned to work, and if she returned to work, in what capacity she would be employed. Appellants did not concede she would return in any capacity mentioned by the expert, and the jury was free to consider both his testimony on direct examination and his admissions during cross-examination.

Although asserted in the context of the loss of earnings determination, it is arguable that, by challenging the expert’s calculation of Decedent's life expectancy based upon her hypertension and smoking, Appellants <a id="p684" href="#p684" data-label="684" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*684</a>also were disputing the total value assigned by the expert to the loss of Decedent’s household services. <em>See </em>N.T. 10/23/2002 at 83-84.</p>
