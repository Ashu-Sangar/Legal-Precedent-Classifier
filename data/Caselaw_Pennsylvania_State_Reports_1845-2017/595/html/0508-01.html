HSP asserts that the clause does not require a "formal” submission, and that it is disingenuous for Council to suggest that the Plan of Development was not submitted to it. HSP states that the Plan of Development was provided to Council Member Juan Ramos and then introduced before Council for approval as a bill, and that Council held a hearing on the Plan of Development on June 13, 2007. HSP notes that at the hearing, the Planning Commission’s Executive Director testified about the Plan of Development, presented it to Council, and that Council’s Rules Committee amended the Plan of Development Bill to include the Plan of Development as an exhibit. <em>See </em>Petition for Review Exhibit Z.</p>

In the first instance, I have substantial questions about this Court’s jurisdiction to do so in this developing area of the law. Moreover, the pleadings have been filed directly in this Court, and there has been no lower court decision or, indeed, any fact-finding at all. There is therefore no record on which to determine the merits of Petitioner’s claims. Accordingly, even if this Court has jurisdiction in such circumstances, I believe it would be more appropriate to appoint a special master as Petitioner requests, <em>see </em>Petition for Review of HSP Gaming LP at 49, to hold any necessary, hearings and report back to this Court in an expeditious manner. In this way, the underlying, dispositive facts can be ascertained on a developed record. More generally, to the extent that the Court is, in the fourth item of the Order, presently granting the mandamus relief requested by Petitioner, <em>see id. </em>at 48, I would simply note that, pursuant to recent precedent, it appears that we lack jurisdiction to entertain a request for such relief. <em>See Philadelphia Entertainment and Development Partners v.
