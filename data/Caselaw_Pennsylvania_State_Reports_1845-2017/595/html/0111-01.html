Overruling the trial court, a divided Commonwealth Court panel determined that consent was not required under Section 5011 of the Act in this instance, based on the fact that the County is not a fee simple owner of the property. Based upon the plain language of Section 5011, as well as the agreement granting the open space easement, we disagree and, therefore, reverse.</p>
    <p id="b150-6" data-blocks='[["BL_150.6",150,[311,1126,1165,1066]]]'>, In 2000, the School District purchased approximately 80 acres of land, intending to construct a public elementary school on the south side of Market Street in Ephrata Township, Lancaster County, on a site bordering Ephrata Borough. The School District proposed primary access to the school from Market Street, a public thoroughfare. However, both Ephrata Township-and Ephrata Borough objected to the use of Market Street, citing serious traffic and safety concerns. The Township and Borough instead recommended primary access through Hummer Road and secondary access through Meadow Valley Road. In response, the School District entered into an agreement to purchase a 50-foot strip of land totaling 2.3 acres from Nelson and Miriam Nolt and David and Erma Lauver for the purpose of constructing an access road to the new school from Meadow Valley Road. The Lauvers and the School District later modified the agreement to reflect acquisition of a right-of-way subject to the rights of the Lancaster County Agricultural Preserve Board, a county agency, deriving from an open space conservation easement over the Lauvers’ property granted in 1984.</p>

Subsequently, on May 29, 2003, the <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>Board voted to recommend to the Lancaster County Planning Commission that the Planning Commission grant the School District an easement over the 50-foot strip of land. The Planning Commission approved the granting of the easement on August 12, 2003, also approving an offer by the School District to place 2.8 acres of adjoining farmland in an open space easement in exchange for 1.4 acres of the Lauvers’ land.</p>

The School District filed a Notice of Appeal from the County Commissioners’ decision. On March 9, 2004, following a conference with the parties, the trial court stayed the appeal proceedings pending the filing and resolution of a declaratory judgment action. The School District filed the declaratory judgment action that is the subject of this appeal on March 17, 2004, seeking a determination of whether County approval was required for the acquisition of a right-of-way over the Lauvers’ land and whether the proposed right-of-way violated the County’s open space easement.</p>

The County filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, asserting that approval was required and conceding that the proposed right-of-way would not violate the County’s open space easement.</p>

      <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>The trial court granted the County’s cross-motion for summary judgment, determining that, pursuant to Section 5011 of the Open Space Lands Act, the School District was required to obtain County approval for the acquisition of a right-of-way over the Lauvers’ property based on the County possessing an open space easement on the property. The court held that Section 5011(a) clearly provides that approval is required, and rejected the School District’s argument that approval was not required because the School District was not seeking to acquire a property interest from the County, but rather from the Lauvers. Addressing the School District’s argument that approval was required only where the County owned the property in fee simple, the trial court found that nothing in the language of Section 5011 requires fee simple ownership to trigger the approval requirement. Further, the court determined that whether the proposed right-of-way violated the County’s open space easement was irrelevant to the issue of whether approval was required under the statute. Finally, the court found that the County’s decision to deny the right-of-way while conceding that it did not violate the County’s open space easement was within the County’s authority because Section 5011 does not require that the open space easement be violated as a prerequisite to exercise of the right to deny approval of a right-of-way over the subject land.</p>

According to the County, the language of Section 5011 does not require that the County own the property in fee simple, and the Commonwealth Court erred by inserting that requirement into the statute. Section 5011, the County claims, speaks of the ownership of an open space easement, not ownership of the property burdened by the easement. As support for this argument, the County points to the opening language of Section 5011(a), which references “[t]he ownership by the Commonwealth or a local government unit of an open space property interest” (emphasis added) and notes that there is no reference to, much <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>less a requirement of, fee simple ownership of the land. Further, the County argues, if the Commonwealth Court panel majority’s decision stands, a public utility seeking a right-of-way will only need governmental approval if the Commonwealth or the local government unit is the fee simple owner of the property at issue. In the County’s view, this interpretation would gut the portion of Section 5011(a) providing a mechanism for the Public Utility Commission’s approval of a proposed right-of-way, an interpretation which is contrary to bedrock principles of statutory construction.</p>
    <p id="b157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[201,883,1152,1262]]]'>The School District responds that the Commonwealth Court panel majority’s decision affords Section 5011 its plain meaning, pointing to the language stating: “In the case of an acquisition from a local government unit by a body other than a public utility, such acquisition shall occur only if the governing body, after public hearing with notice to the public, shall approve the acquisition” (emphasis added). The School District urges that this language clearly means that the obligation to secure government approval attaches only when it is the government unit that is conveying the right-of-way. Because the land in question here is privately owned, the School District argues, it is seeking to acquire a right-of-way from a private party, and not the County; therefore, approval is not statutorily required. The School District further contends that approval would serve no purpose because the proposed right-of-way does not violate the County’s open space easement. In the School District’s view, the purpose of the approval process is to ensure that governmental units fulfill their fiduciary duties to their taxpayers, which is irrelevant to the conveyance of a right-of-way over privately owned property. Finally, the School District claims that requiring governmental approval of rights-of-way over privately owned property intrudes upon the constitutional rights of the property owners to freely use and enjoy their property.</p>

Given the concern with preserving open space in Pennsylvania, this focus is precisely what one might expect to find in a provision dedicated to such preservation. The fact that the County possesses an open space property interest in the Lauvers’ property is undisputed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>The plain language of Section 5011(a) leads to the conclusion that the trial court correctly found that approval was required in this instance. Section 5011(a)’s first sentence provides that the existence of an open space property interest in favor of the Commonwealth or a local government unit, such as the easement here, does not preclude the possibility of other rights-of-way existing on the same property: “The ownership by the Commonwealth or a local government unit of an open space property interest shall not preclude the acquisition, by lease, purchase, or eminent domain, and use of rights of way or underground gas storage rights in such property by a public utility or other body entitled to exercise the power of eminent domain.” 32 P.S. § 5011(a). The provisions that immediately follow then govern the acquisition of such rights-of-way on property in which the Commonwealth or a local government unit possesses an open space property interest. Indeed, the statute covers a number of different scenarios in the following sentences: “In the case of an acquisition from the Commonwealth by a body other than a public utility,” “In the case of an acquisition from a local government unit by a body other than a public utility,” and “In the case of an acquisition from the Commonwealth or a local government unit by a public utility.” <em><a href="/a2d/770/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="770 A.2d 318" data-case-ids="11100550,1276772" data-case-paths="/a2d/770/0318-01,/pa/564/0656-01">Id.</a> </em>Each scenario is followed by the procedure for acquiring a right-of-way in that circumstance.</p>

The obvious import of the procedures that follow Section 501 l’s declaration that a party may acquire a right-of-way over land that is subject to an open space property interest in favor of the Commonwealth or a local government unit is that the statutory procedures apply to that acquisition. Section 5011(a) nowhere mentions or requires governmental ownership, in fee simple or otherwise, of <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>the property subject to the open space interest and over which a right-of-way is sought. To insert such a requirement would make little sense, given that the first sentence discusses only the open space property interest, and not ownership of the property. This construct makes perfect sense since the statute is concerned with preserving existing, governmentally owned open space interests.</p>
    <p id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[313,749,1159,797]]]'>The procedure that applies here, therefore, is that governing an acquisition from a local government unit by a body other than a public utility: such acquisition shall occur only if the governing body, after public hearing with notice to the public, shall approve such acquisition. 32 P.S. § 5011(a). The statutory language is clear. Where, as here, a body other than a public utility seeks a right-of-way over property subject to an open space property interest vested in a local government unit, the entity seeking the right-of-way can secure it only if, after a public hearing, the governmental unit approves the right-of-way. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court’s holding that the plain language of Section 5011(a) requires approval of the local government unit, the County in this instance, before the School District can acquire a right-of-way over the Lauvers’ property.</p>

As the dissent explained, the Grant of Easement states that the use of the land covered by the open space easement “shall be restricted to agricultural and directly associated uses” as defined in the agreement. <em>Ephrata, </em><a href="/a2d/886/1169-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="886 A.2d 1169" data-case-ids="8903976" data-case-paths="/a2d/886/1169-01">886 A.2d at 1180</a> (Kelley, S.J., dissenting) (quoting Grant of Easement). The Grant goes on to define agricultural uses as the “use of land for the production of plants and animals useful to man,” and then lists examples of activities covered by that general definition. Following the definition of agricultural uses is the general definition of directly associated uses as “customary, supportive and agriculturally compatible uses of farm properties in Lancaster County.” The directly <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>associated uses are expressly limited to the previously mentioned seven specific listed uses, including: (1) the sale to the public of agricultural products produced on the farm; (2) structures contributing to the production, processing, direct marketing and storage of agricultural products produced on the farm; (3) structures associated with the production of energy for use on the farm; (4) the provision of goods and services such as arts and crafts so long as it remains incidental to the open space and character of the farm; (5) structures associated with irrigation, farm pond impoundment and soil and water conservation; (6) the accommodation of tourists within principally residential or agricultural structures on the farm as long as the use is incidental to the agricultural and open space character of the property; and (7) religious uses including the conduct of religious services on the property. The specific uses are followed by a “catch-all” provision, which provides that, “Other similar uses may be considered upon written request to the Lancaster County Agricultural Preservation Board.”</p>
    <p id="b161-4" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[200,1432,1151,434]]]'>There is no question that the School District’s proposed right-of-way is neither an agricultural use nor any of the directly associated uses as defined in the Grant of Easement. Thus, if such a right-of-way can be considered at all, given its clearly non-agricultural purpose of providing an access road to a school, it can only be considered under the catch-all provision, which requires the approval of the Lancaster County Agricultural Preservation Board.</p>

Clearly the owners cannot do so in derogation of the easement already given the County, but the County has no ability to demand its consent unless their easement specifically includes the ability to deny, <em>preemptively, </em>the owners’ grant of other easements.
