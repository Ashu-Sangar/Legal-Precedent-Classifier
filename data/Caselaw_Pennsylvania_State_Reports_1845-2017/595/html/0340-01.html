When Appellant Michael Nutter, now Mayor-Elect, filed a complaint in the trial court seeking to enforce the Ordinance against other putative mayoral candidates, those candidates challenged the validity of the Ordinance under state law. The trial court upheld these challenges, ruling that the Pennsylvania Election Code manifests the General Assembly’s intent to preempt all local campaign regulation to ensure the uniform elections provided by Article VII, § 6, of the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On appeal, the Commonwealth <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>Court reversed, finding in the Election Code insufficient indicia of the legislature’s intent to preempt local regulation in the area of campaign contributions, and ruling that Philadelphia was free as a Home Rule municipality<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> to enact campaign regulations governing campaign contributions to candidates for municipal office. <em>See Nutter v.

There as here, the act in question itself was silent as to local supplementation, and that omission, appellee argued, was tantamount to an affirmation of the General Assembly’s preemptive intent. We rejected this argument, relying in part on the Commonwealth’s parallel Barber Act. The two acts, we noted, had initially been passed in tandem in 1931, at which time neither statute addressed local supplementation. Soon after the Barber Act’s passage, however, a trial court deemed it to have preemptive effect over local regulation in that field. The General Assembly, in 1935, responded by revising the Barber Act to specifically provide that “[n]othing contained in this act, or the act to which this an amendment, shall be construed as prohibiting any municipality from adopting appropriate ordinances, not inconsistent with ... this act....” <a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.2d%20326" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="147 A.2d 326">147 A.2d at 328</a>.

      <p id="b392-7" data-blocks='[["BL_392.6",392,[316,1319,1154,586]]]'>. In his Reply Brief, Appellant Fattah rejects Appellees' reliance on the Ethics Act. Fattah argues that 65 Pa.C.S. §§ I103(b)-(c) aim to “prevent [] individuals from giving or receiving anything of monetary value with the <em>expectation </em>that the gift will somehow influence the public official. Under the Ethics Act, the size of a gift is relevant only in determining whether the gift must be publicly reported.” Reply Brief for Fattah at 2. Thus, Fattah maintains, the Ethics Act’s local supplementation provision, 65 Pa.C.S. § 111 I, contemplates only supplementary ordinances that directly serve to assure the public that influence is not for sale, which take the form of more stringent disclosure requirements, not contribution limits. As with the rest of Fattah’s arguments, however, this essentially hinges on the proposition that the General Assembly’s failure to enact statewide contribution limits necessarily betrayed its intention that no such limits may be applied by any government body in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p id="b392-8" data-blocks='[["BL_392.7",392,[343,1917,1126,468]]]'>This line of argument significantly undermines Appellant Fattah's view (and, for that matter, Judge Colins’ view, expressed in dissent in the Commonwealth Court, <em>see Nutter, </em><a href="/a2d/921/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="921 A.2d 44" data-case-ids="8318110" data-case-paths="/a2d/921/0044-01">921 A.2d at 68</a> (Colins, J., dissenting)) that permitting municipalities to enact local campaign contribution limits will “balkanize" election law in violation of the legislature’s asserted desire for uniformity. Clearly, the General Assembly had little concern for "balkanization" when it expressly invited local supplementation of the Ethics Act, notwithstanding that the effect would differ little, in the abstract, from permitting local campaign contribution limits. In either case, significant aspects of a candidate’s campaign-related activities will be determined according to where he is running for office.</p>
