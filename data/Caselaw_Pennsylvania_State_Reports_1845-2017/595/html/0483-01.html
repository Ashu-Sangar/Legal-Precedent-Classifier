    <p id="b522-7" data-blocks='[["BL_522.6",522,[311,611,1163,628]]]'>In this case, we granted allowance of appeal to determine whether the Superior Court improperly concluded that <em>habeas corpus </em>relief was available to Appellee Sheldon West, who, for nine years, remained at liberty despite the imposition of a valid criminal sentence after his conviction of various drug crimes and culmination of all appellate proceedings, because the appropriate authorities failed to call and commit him to serve his sentence. The Superior Court, in a published decision, found that West was entitled to <em>habeas coh'pus </em>relief and discharged him from having to serve his criminal sentence. For the reasons that follow, we now reverse the Superior Court’s decision.</p>
    <p id="b522-8" data-blocks='[["BL_522.7",522,[311,1272,1163,582]]]'>The facts are relatively straightforward. On May 10, 1989, West was arrested for selling cocaine. He was charged with possession and possession with intent'to deliver a controlled substance. Approximately one year later, on May 11, 1990, West appeared before the trial court, which heard evidence on West’s motion to suppress physical evidence. Following that hearing, the court denied West’s prayer for relief. On that same date, the court conducted a bench trial and found West guilty of the crimes charged. Thereafter, on July 17, 1991, West was sentenced to serve a term of twenty-seven to fifty-four months of imprisonment.</p>
    <p id="b522-9" data-blocks='[["BL_522.8",522,[311,1878,1161,359]]]'>New counsel was then hired by West’s mother to file an appeal on West’s behalf. Accordingly, counsel appealed to the Superior Court, and, simultaneously, sought West’s release on bail pending appeal. In his direct appeal, West alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred in failing to suppress the evidence obtained by police as he asserted they lacked probable cause to arrest him.</p>
    <p id="b522-10" data-blocks='[["BL_522.9",522,[311,2270,1159,96]],["BL_523.1",523,[187,330,1155,359]]]'>On September 11, 1991, the trial court granted West’s release on $20,000 bail pending his appeal. West’s mother <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>posted her residence as security on the appeal bond and West was released. On June 10, 1992, the Superior Court affirmed West’s judgment of sentence in an unpublished decision. Thereafter, his appellate counsel filed a petition for allowance of appeal with our Court, which we denied on March 24, 1993. On April 7, 1993, we remanded the certified record to the Allegheny County Clerk of Courts.</p>
    <p id="b523-4" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[189,714,1153,199]]]'>Following the above noted events, and despite West’s judgment of sentence becoming final, West was not recalled to serve his sentence in conformity with Pa.R.A.P. 1763, which specifies as follows:</p>

    <p id="b523-6" data-blocks='[["BL_523.6",523,[184,1424,1157,519]]]'>West remained at liberty for nine years, until April 24, 2002, when the matter was brought to the attention of the administrative judge of the criminal division of the common pleas court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Accordingly, on that date, the court issued an arrest warrant for West mandating his return to custody to begin serving his July 17, 1991 sentence. West remained at large until June of 2002, when he was stopped by police for a routine traffic offense. At that time, police discovered the arrest warrant and took West into custody. He was then committed to serve his prior criminal sentence.</p>

In his petition, West raised claims relating to both a violation of his substantive due process rights because of the government’s delay in confining him, as well as claims relating <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>to counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to inform him of the outcome of his direct appeal impacting a successful challenge to the legality of the search and seizure underlying his 1990 conviction. Hearings were held before the common pleas court on November 4, 2002 and January 27, 2003. During the course of the initial hearing, counsel for West orally requested that he be given leave to amend his request for relief to include a claim for post-conviction relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-46. The trial court granted the request; however, West never amended his pleading and, instead, on March 6, 2003, filed a “Brief in Support of Writ of Habeas Corpus/Post Conviction Relief Petition.”</p>
    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[310,1033,1160,517]]]'>In his brief, West contended that the failure of the courts to summon him promptly to serve his sentence after affirmance and then to recommit him years later was “outrageous conduct which is offensive to the [Constitution.” In this regard, he also claimed actual prejudice based upon the passage of time, which resulted in his inability to challenge his conviction and sentence because of missing evidence, dead witnesses and lost trial transcripts. Accordingly, he claimed the Commonwealth was estopped from enforcing the judgment of sentence at such late date.</p>
    <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[309,1582,1160,795]],["BL_525.1",525,[169,331,1149,84]]]'>The Commonwealth responded, initially framing their argument in terms of whether West was entitled to relief pursuant to the PCRA, which, in the Commonwealth’s view, was the sole means by which West could obtain relief at this stage of the proceedings, i.e., post-conviction. The Commonwealth noted in this regard that West’s petition was untimely on its face as a PCRA petition must be filed within one year of the date of final judgment. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1) (Any petition under this subchapter, including a second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final). Moreover, the Commonwealth pointed out that West failed to plead any of the applicable exceptions to the time requirements found in Section 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii) (including, governmental interference, newly discovered evidence and newly recognized retroactive constitu<a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>tional rights). Accordingly, the Commonwealth contended that relief was not warranted.</p>
    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[166,448,1154,572]]]'>The Commonwealth further argued that, even if review pursuant to <em>habeas corpus </em>was permitted, West was not entitled to relief on the merits of his substantive due process claim for several reasons. First, the Commonwealth pointed out that substantive due process rights protect against arbitrary and oppressive exercise of governmental power. Here, West was duly tried, convicted, and sentenced. Although there was substantial delay in finally recommitting West, there was nothing arbitrary about it. The Commonwealth conceded that although the delay was significant, it was due merely to negligence, not outrageous governmental conduct.</p>
    <p id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[166,1043,1151,465]]]'>Further, the Commonwealth contended that West suffered no prejudice from the delay. Specifically, the Commonwealth contended that rather than do something constructive with his life while he remained erroneously at liberty, West continued his life of crime, having been convicted of drunk driving, and cocaine possession in Allegheny County and felony drug charges in Westmoreland County. The Commonwealth also disputed West’s contention that he was unaware that his conviction had been sustained on appeal.</p>
    <p id="b525-7" data-blocks='[["BL_525.6",525,[160,1532,1153,838]],["BL_526.1",526,[314,327,1159,250]]]'>Thereafter, the trial court denied West’s request for relief. Without examining whether West was entitled to <em>habeas corpus </em>relief or whether the PCRA provided the sole means for relief as contended by the Commonwealth, the trial court examined the merits of West’s claim that the delay in committing him to serve his sentence violated his substantive due process rights. In this regard, the court examined the Superi- or Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Blair, </em><a href="/a2d/699/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="699 A.2d 738" data-case-ids="11910208" data-case-paths="/a2d/699/0738-01">699 A.2d 738</a> (Pa.Super.1997), where the court similarly examined whether pre-incarceration delay prejudiced the defendant thus entitling him to dismissal of his judgment of sentence. Defendant Blair was released on a $50,000 appeal bond following his conviction and sentencing. At the completion of a direct appeal resulting in affirmance of the conviction and sentence, the record was remanded to the common pleas court. Because the bond papers were missing from the record, the court was unaware <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>that Blair remained at large on bond and, accordingly, the court did not recall him to begin serving his sentence. Two years later, the mistake was discovered, and, following his return to custody, the court committed Blair requiring that he serve his sentence.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[314,609,1162,845]]]'>Blair filed a motion to dismiss and/or vacate his judgment of sentence, arguing that he was prejudiced by the delay between the denial of his appeal and his incarceration. The trial court denied relief and the Superior Court affirmed. Concluding that Blair was not entitled to relief, the Superior Court noted that it would “not allow the court system’s inadvertent error to cancel any part of Blair’s punishment for the crimes for which he was justly convicted and sentenced. Society has an interest in knowing that its criminals are serving the punishment to which they have been sentenced, regardless of an unintended delay or negligent error attributable to the government.” <em>Blair, </em><a href="/a2d/699/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="699 A.2d 738" data-case-ids="11910208" data-case-paths="/a2d/699/0738-01">699 A.2d at 743</a>.

    <p id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[315,1487,1161,313]]]'>As noted, the trial court in the matter <em>sub judice, </em>likewise denied West relief on the merits of his substantive due process claim raised in the context of <em>habeas corpus, </em>concluding that he did not suffer prejudice as a result of the government’s non-intentional delay in being recalled to serve his properly imposed criminal sentence.</p>
    <p id="b526-7" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[313,1826,1162,420]]]'>West filed an appeal to the Superior Court, again arguing alternatively that he was entitled to relief because the delay in recalling him to serve his sentence violated his substantive due process rights and that direct appeal counsel was ineffective in failing to inform him of the outcome of his direct appeal, which, in turn hampered his ability to file a petition for post-conviction collateral relief challenging that he was subject to an illegal search and seizure by police.</p>
    <p id="b526-8" data-blocks='[["BL_526.7",526,[316,2271,1159,97]],["BL_527.1",527,[184,332,1157,1433]]]'>The Superior Court initially recognized that the substantive due process claim made by West was raised as a claim for <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>
      <em>habeas </em>and that <em>habeas </em>relief is not available where a remedy is available pursuant to the PCRA, citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 6503(b)(“Where a person is restrained by virtue of sentence after conviction for a criminal offense, the writ of habeas corpus shall not be available if a remedy may be had by post-conviction hearing proceedings authorized by law”). Specifically, in this regard, the court recognized the longstanding principle that the PCRA subsumes the remedy of <em>habeas corpus </em>with respect to remedies offered under the PCRA. <em>Commonwealth v. West, </em><a href="/a2d/868/1267-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="868 A.2d 1267" data-case-ids="9181513" data-case-paths="/a2d/868/1267-01">868 A.2d 1267</a>, 1270 (quoting, <em>Commonwealth v.

The court concluded, however, that West’s claim that it would violate his substantive due process rights to subject him to confinement nine years after judgment of sentence was entered could not have been pursued through the PCRA. To reach this conclusion, the Superior Court examined the eligibility requirements of the PCRA, which, in substance, provide for relief where the <em>conviction </em>or <em>sentence </em>at issue resulted from a constitutional violation, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(i), ineffective assistance of counsel, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(ii), an unlawfully induced plea, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(iii), the improper obstruction by governmental officials, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(iv), or in a case where exculpatory evidence has been discovered, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(vi), an illegal sentence has been imposed, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(vii), or where the tribunal conducting the proceeding lacked jurisdiction. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(viii).</p>

The panel further noted that West was not alleging governmental interference with his right to appeal, that the sentence imposed was greater than the lawful maximum, or that the court lacked jurisdiction. Additionally, the panel found that West was not alleging after-discovered exculpatory evidence. Thus, the Superior Court determined that “none of the bases for relief under the PCRA address the unique situation presented in this case.” <em>Id. </em>at 1272. Conse<a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>quently, the panel concluded that because no other remedy existed, it would examine the merits of West’s claim for <em>habeas corpus </em>relief on due process grounds.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[310,507,1159,782]]]'>Accordingly, the Superior Court examined whether West’s substantive due process rights were violated when he was recommitted to prison in 2002 following a nine-year delay from the time the record was remanded after appeal. Recognizing the dearth of Pennsylvania authority on the issue of whether there is a right to “speedy incarceration,” the Superior Court looked at the factors used in the speedy trial case of <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em><a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">407 U.S. 514</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">92 S.Ct. 2182</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">33 L.Ed.2d 101</a> (1972) (holding that a defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial can be determined only on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis in which the conduct of the prosecution and the defendant are weighed and balanced and certain factors considered, including the length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant), and applied them <em>sub judice.</em>

Regarding the majority’s conclusion that West was prejudiced due to lost transcripts and missed opportunities to challenge further his conviction, the dissent noted that the only claim West asserted that he would have pursued involved the trial court’s alleged failure to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of his arrest. The dissent observed, however, that this was the very claim that was litigated on direct appeal and rejected. As it is well settled that claims that were litigated on direct appeal cannot be relitigated on collateral appeal, 42 Pa.C.S. 9543(a)(3), in the dissent’s view, West simply could not have been prejudiced by his inability to relitigate the claim on collateral appeal.

As noted earlier, in <em>Blair, </em>the court was faced with, <em>inter alia, </em>a due process challenge to defendant Blair’s incarceration following a two-year delay from affirmance of judgment of sentence and the time Blair was recalled to serve his sentence. Blair argued that such delay was egregious and warranted relief either in the form of credit for time served or, in the alternative, his discharge from sentence. Specifically, Blair claimed he suffered prejudice because during the two year delay, he had become gainfully employed, secured an apartment, purchased a car and continued his education, all of which would be lost if he was recalled.</p>

The <em>Blair </em>court, in examining this claim, applied the four part test of <em>Barker, </em>requiring courts to examine, 1) whether the delay itself is sufficient to trigger further inquiry, 2) the reason for the delay, 3) the timeliness of the defendant’s assertion of his or her right, and 4) any resulting prejudice to the defendant. In applying the test, the court concluded that the two year delay was sufficient to prompt further inquiry. Furthermore, the court concluded that the government’s delay was not deliberate, but rather, was due to negligence. Specifically, the documentation received by trial court following remand from the affirmance of judgment of sentence did not contain Blair’s bond papers. As to the third factor, while the court questioned whether Blair was unaware that his judgment of sentence had been affirmed, it assumed <em>arguendo </em>that he was unaware and, therefore, concluded that he acted promptly in asserting his rights after learning that final <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>judgment had been imposed. Notwithstanding these determinations, the court concluded that Blair was not entitled to relief because he was unable to demonstrate prejudice as a result of the delay. The court noted that the traditional areas of prejudice in the context of the right to speedy trial concern preventing oppressive pre-trial incarceration, minimizing the accused’s anxiety, and limiting the possibility that the defense will be prejudiced by lost or missing witnesses. Noting that none of these bases existed in the case before it, and rejecting the notion that Blair was somehow prejudiced by the gains he made while at liberty, the court denied Blair relief.</p>

Contrary to the Superior Court majority, we do not find that West suffered actual prejudice as a result of the nine-year delay he was erroneously at liberty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Specifically, West submitted testimony and evidence at the hearing before the trial court indicating that a correspondence dated September 3, 1996, was sent to Judge Dauer, then the administra]ive judge of criminal division of the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court, by the Superintendent of the State Correctional Institution inquiring about West’s status, noting that apparently he remained on bond with an active case. The letter further asked that the appropriate court staff research and advise the superintendent of West’s status. Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 11/4/2002 at 23.</p>

The Commonwealth points out that West testified that he was never notified one way or the other regarding the outcome of his appeal and that he never made inquiry as to whether the appeal had been successful. The Commonwealth further notes that while West testified he believed the appeal had been won, he never sought to have the appeal bond lifted from his mother’s residence. On the other hand, West’s mother testified that she never inquired further regarding the appeal bond because she became preoccupied with her husband's deteriorating health.</p>

To the extent that West’s claim of prejudice is based upon some alleged loss of the gains he made while erroneously at liberty, we also reject this assertion. As note previously, the Superior Court, in <em>Blair, </em>rejected a similar claim where Blair had made positive gains during his two years erroneously at liberty by obtaining an apartment, becoming employed and furthering his education. In contrast, the record reflects that West has not made positive gains while erroneously at liberty, but rather, has continued his contact with the criminal justice system, as reflected by his four subsequent arrests.</p>
