In 1994, Appellee Duane King entered a negotiated plea of guilty to third-degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(c), robbery, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3701, and conspiracy, 18 Pa.C.S. § 903, in connection with the 1993 murder of Darryl Crawford. As part of the <a id="p687" href="#p687" data-label="687" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*687</a>plea agreement, Appellee agreed to testify against his co-defendants, Kyle Dickerson and Shawn Harris. Appellee testified at his co-defendants’ joint trial in 1996 and both men were convicted of second-degree murder. During Appellee’s plea sentencing, the prosecutor made no recommendation as to the term of his sentence, but noted that Appellee’s testimony had resulted in the conviction of his co-defendants. The court sentenced Appellee to five and one-half to thirty years in prison for his role in the murder.</p>
    <p id="b723-4" data-blocks='[["BL_723.4",723,[174,826,1156,522]]]'>After serving his minimum sentence, Appellee was denied parole.

To bolster his claim of coercion, Appellee made six specific factual representations, which the Commonwealth later used in charging Appellee with six separate counts of perjury. The six alleged perjurious statements made during Dickerson’s PCRA hearing were as follows: 1) Appellee claimed that he was arrested before, not after, providing a statement to the police detectives; 2) Appellee claimed that the detectives told him to falsely accuse Ivan Bingham in Crawford’s murder; 3) Appellee claimed that the detectives told him that they would lift an open charge of murder against him in exchange for his false accusation against Ivan Bingham; 4) Appellee claimed that the detectives told him to falsely implicate himself in the Crawford murder (in order to bolster his testimony regarding Bingham); 5) Appellee <a id="p688" href="#p688" data-label="688" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*688</a>claimed that the detectives promised him that he would receive no more than five years in prison for the Crawford murder; and 6) Appellee claimed that Assistant District Attorney Fisk told him that she would dispose of his open homicide case and limit his sentence on the Crawford murder to five years in prison. In response, the Commonwealth presented evidence that each of these claims was false, as was Appellee’s overall recantation testimony. The <em>Dickerson </em>PCRA court rejected Appellee’s recantation testimony and denied Dickerson’s request for PCRA relief.</p>

After a jury trial, Appellee was convicted of one count of false swearing and six counts of perjury — one count for each of the six falsehoods related previously. The trial court sentenced Appellee to three to six years on each perjury conviction ordered to run consecutively, resulting in an aggregate term of eighteen to thirty-six years in prison.</p>

The trial court failed to provide such an individualized analysis of the alleged perjurious statements and the Commonwealth “essentially concede[d] that the six independent statements had only incremental value.” <em>Id. </em>at 6. Accordingly, the court concluded that the record only supported a single count of perjury when the six falsehoods were considered in the unified context in which they were given.</p>

The proper inquiry concerning the materiality of a false statement, according to Judge Olszewski, was whether the statement had the ability to affect the fact finder and the outcome of the proceeding, not whether the statement actually influences the result of the proceeding.</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth had to prove three items — the individual falsehood was a statement, that statement <em>by itself </em>“could have affected the course or outcome of the proceeding,” and that Appellee did not believe the statement to be true. 18 Pa.C.S. § 4902(b).

Davenport, </em><a href="/pa-super/255/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="255 Pa.

In <em>Davenport, </em>the defendant had made similar statements at two different proceedings, and the Commonwealth charged the defendant with two separate counts of perjury. While the situation was not identical to the case at hand, the court’s discussion provides some guidance for the instant matter. The court noted, “the use of the phrase ‘facts which are the subject of the representation’ makes clear that the legislature had in mind that a ‘representation’ may comprise more than one fact.” <em>Id. </em>at 550. The court then pointed out that the essential question was whether the “representations” described one event or were so inter-related as to a single subject matter to constitute a single “statement.” In support, the <em>Davenport </em>court quoted a portion of <em>State v. Anderson, </em><a href="/utah/35/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="35 Utah 496" data-case-ids="8871874" data-case-paths="/utah/35/0496-01">35 Utah 496</a>, <a href="/utah/35/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="35 Utah 496" data-case-ids="8871874" data-case-paths="/utah/35/0496-01">101 P. 385</a> (1909), a case that addressed when multiple false facts are so interrelated that they constitute only one count: “[T]he several assignments contained in the information consist of certain alleged successive statements made by defendant while testifying as a witness, and are so related to the one question which was the subject-matter of inquiry ... and were so linked and blended together in point of time, as to constitute but one act or transaction, and therefore constitute but one offense.” <em>Davenport, </em><a href="/pa-super/255/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="255 Pa.

The word “could” is the past tense of “can.” “Can” is “used to indicate possibility or probability.” American Heritage Dictionary, 2d College ed., 232 (1981).

After reviewing the historical concept of materiality and relevant case law, the Court concluded that the central object of the “materiality” inquiry was “whether the misrepresentation or concealment was predictably capable of affecting, i.e., had a natural tendency to affect, the official decision.” <em><a href="/us/485/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="485 U.S. 759" data-case-ids="13367" data-case-paths="/us/485/0759-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/485/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="485 U.S. 759" data-case-ids="13367" data-case-paths="/us/485/0759-01">at 771</a>, <a href="/us/485/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="485 U.S. 759" data-case-ids="13367" data-case-paths="/us/485/0759-01">108 S.Ct. 1537</a>.

Moreover, the false statement need not be material to the main issue, so long as it “has a legitimate tendency to prove or disprove some fact that is material, irrespective of the main fact at issue.

Rather, it was only when considered together with the lies that followed that the import of the statement was clear. Similarly, Appellee’s claim that the detectives told him to implicate himself falsely in the Crawford murder was only material within the framework of the two previous lies regarding the fact that the detectives wanted Appellee to implicate Ivan Bingham in the Crawford murder — the false implication was meant to bolster Appellee’s credibility in implicating Bingham, but the lie had no possibility or probability of influencing the decision-maker on its own. Finally, Appellee’s claim regarding the promises made by Assistant District Attorney Fisk were only material when considered in context of the remaining lies — why would ADA Fisk promise Appellee anything if she received nothing in return? The obvious answer is that she was promised Appellee’s testimony against Ivan Bingham, an answer that can be made only when looking at the previous four lies.

Appellee elaborated that it was the detectives’ idea, not his own, to falsely implicate himself in the Crawford murder (Count IV — relating to appellee’s allegation that the detectives told him to falsely implicate himself in the Crawford murder to enhance his credibility). Finally, appellee explained why he was allegedly willing to lie about the Crawford murder, given that he had separate assurances from the police (Count V — recounting that the detectives promised to limit appellee’s minimum sentence to five years on the charges arising from the Crawford murder) and from the district attorney’s office (Count VI — asserting that an Assistant District Attorney told him that, in exchange for his cooperation, charges in the unrelated homicide would be dropped and his minimum sentence on his Crawford guilty plea would be five years) that his punishment for the Crawford murder would be limited.

Ct. Op. at 5 (emphasis added). Likewise, the Majority, despite the lack of ambiguity on the face of Section 4902(b), has chosen to import a materiality test from a legal treatise and a single divided opinion of the Superior Court. The Majority states that the Commonwealth must prove that each statement could have affected the course or outcome of the proceeding by itself. To bolster its rewriting of the statute, the Majority states that a false statement is material when “the misrepresentation or concealment was predictably capable of affecting ... the official decision.” Majority Op. at 692, 939 A.2d at 882 (quoting <em>Kungys v.

The Majority seems to assume that this means each statement must be considered completely divorced from the context in which it was made. The Majority’s test thus requires the Commonwealth to establish that each statement, by itself, affected the course or outcome of the proceedings. But the Majority is not done. Having determined that no individual statement at issue meets its extra-statutory threshold, the Majority reads yet another test into the statute and permits the materiality requirement to be met by the collective effect of the statements considered together.</p>

Under that text, I would find that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that appellee’s six discrete statements each warranted a conviction for perjury. The central relevance and purpose of appellee’s testimony at the <em>Dickerson </em>PCRA hearing was to convince the PCRA court that appellee had lied in incriminating Dickerson (and himself) at Dickerson’s trial, and, as a result, the court should find that Dickerson was wrongly convicted of murder. Appellee could have just made the assertion, “I lied at Dickerson’s trial,” to make Dickerson’s after-discovered evidence point in the barest sense. But appellee went further and sought to explain why he lied, and thereby give the PCRA court a reason to credit his PCRA account. As a practical matter, the credibility of an individual witness is largely judged by the story told: the more complete and plausible the story, the greater the probability it will be believed. The credibility of the recantation here was bolstered by appellee’s explanation of why he testified differently at the earlier proceeding.

It is significant that the Superior Court failed to provide a rationale to explain why Count I had the ability to influence the outcome of the <em>Dickerson </em>PCRA court, but Counts II through VI did not. Clearly, if appellee’s assertion that the detectives arrested him before his confession could have influenced the jury, it is illogical to believe that appellee’s assertions that he was promised certain deals in exchange for his confession could have had no effect on the jury.</p>

Any "construction” of Section 4902(b) that would encourage a perjurer to reinforce his or her testimony with additional false statements would frustrate an obvious purpose of criminalizing perjury, namely, to ensure that the fact finder at trial reaches an accurate result.

    <p id="b738-8" data-blocks='[["BL_738.8",738,[317,692,1160,413]]]'>I find the majority’s consolidation of King’s six perjurious statements into a single offense is ill conceived. King lied under oath at least six times- — each lie supported the other, each a distinct brick in the wall of deception that he erected. Each was material to the ultimate purpose of providing exculpatory testimony. I find no reason to combine separate lies based on commonality of subject matter of the individual false statement.</p>
    <p id="b738-9" data-blocks='[["BL_738.9",738,[310,1135,1167,586]]]'>The flaw in the majority’s logic, in my view, is its interposition of the phrase “by itself’ into the definition of materiality. <em>■See </em>Majority Op., at 690, 939 A.2d at 880-81. While it is true each falsehood must be shown to be material, the analysis cannot be made as if the other five lies did not exist. That is, one must evaluate each lie in context, the entirety of all the testimony including the other lies. The question is, could each lie have affected the course of the proceeding? The question is not whether each lie <em>did </em>affect the <em>outcome. </em>We must ask, <em>“Could, </em>not did, each lie here have affected the <em>course, </em>not the outcome, of the proceeding?”</p>
    <p id="b738-10" data-blocks='[["BL_738.10",738,[318,1744,1163,636]],["BL_739.1",739,[181,334,1153,100]]]'>Was the course of the proceeding affected by each lie? If King had told the truth instead of the last lie, he would undo the previous five lies. They would have been exposed, his purpose of false exculpation thwarted. Thus, the final lie was necessary if the course of the proceeding was to continue as his purpose required. The same is true for each of his lies, for had any lie been replaced with the truth, the course of the PCRA proceeding would have been much different. Any trial attorney recognizes that materially false testimony necessarily changes the case; it changes strategy, one’s course of action, the witnesses to be called and their examination, one’s argument to court and jury. It may or may not affect the <a id="p703" href="#p703" data-label="703" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*703</a>outcome, but it inevitably alters the proceeding, and that determines the issue before us today.</p>
    <p id="b739-4" data-blocks='[["BL_739.4",739,[177,482,1158,563]]]'>Putting a common label of subject matter on some of the statements does not negate the fact that each false statement was material, and creates a proper basis for separate counts of perjury. The same lie told on two occasions is still two lies, not one, and each creates the chance to alter the proceeding. Having lied once, one should not be free to repeat the lie <em>ad nauseum </em>with impunity. King made six distinct significant material perjurious statements, and each could have affected the proceeding’s course, much less its outcome. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>
