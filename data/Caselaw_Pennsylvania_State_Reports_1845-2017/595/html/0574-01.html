Following retirement, pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Fraternal Order of Police, appellee continued to receive health care benefits.

Upon his birth, Benjamin became a dependent under appellee’s health plan. In March of 1995, appellee and his wife filed a medical malpractice action on Benjamin’s behalf against Hershey Medical Center and several physicians involved in his birth. The matter proceeded to trial on August 18, 1997. Following a verdict, each party filed motions for post-trial relief. In October of 1997, the trial court granted a new trial, and the parties subsequently settled the action in December of 1997 for an undisclosed sum to be paid in the form of a structured settlement. Because Benjamin was a minor at the time of the settlement, appellee and his wife filed a petition in the trial court for approval of the settlement, which the trial court granted on April 17, 1998. The settlement agreement required the establishment of a special needs trust for Benjamin’s benefit. The agreement also provided for monthly as well as various lump sum payments over the course of Benjamin’s life, but did not specify an amount for past or future medical expenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The parties corresponded between November 27, 1998 and September 21, 2000 regarding the subrogation claim, which was valued allegedly at $210,633. Initially, appellee was unresponsive and uncooperative, with the result that appellant first threatened to and then did terminate appellee’s health care coverage on October 15, 2000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In December of 2000, appellee <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>filed a complaint in equity seeking to enjoin termination of his healthcare benefits.

Based upon this clause, the trial court found that appellant had a right of subrogation against the malpractice settlement, and that there was no case law barring subrogation claims for medical expenses paid on behalf of minors covered on their parents’ medical insurance.

Here, the court noted, appellant provided its first notice of its subrogation rights three and one-half years after the medical malpractice action had commenced, more than a year after trial, ten months after the action settled, and six months after the court approved and sealed the settlement. The court found that appellee had no affirmative duty to give appellant notice of the settlement of the malpractice action, but rather, it was appellant’s burden to make inquiries into the settlement or possibility of settlement as the action progressed. Finding that appellant failed to exercise reasonable diligence, the court held that appellant had waived its right to subrogation.</p>

Appellant maintained that the trial court also erred in relying on workers’ compensation cases for the principle that a claim not asserted during the pendency of the underlying action is waived because, in the area of workers’ compensation, employers and their insurers are automatically notified of pending suits. The Superior Court rejected both arguments, finding persuasive the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Independence Blue Cross v. Workers’ Comp. Appeal Bd. (Frankford Hosp.), </em><a href="/a2d/820/0868-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="820 A.2d 868" data-case-ids="9313130" data-case-paths="/a2d/820/0868-01">820 A.2d 868</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2008). In that case, Independence Blue Cross paid medical bills on the claimant’s behalf, but did not raise the question of subrogation until fourteen months after the claimant settled with her employer. The Commonwealth Court held that Independence <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>Blue Cross waived its contractual right to subrogation due to its failure to exercise reasonable diligence, even though Independence Blue Cross had no affirmative notice of the settlement of the underlying action.</p>

The panel agreed with the trial court that appellant should have known of the likelihood that a third party lawsuit would be filed in this case and, as a result, should have taken some action to explore the matter and assert its subrogation rights, given that appellant, as an administrator of several health plans, routinely deals with subrogation claims.

    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[164,818,1156,1168]]]'>As to the first issue, appellant argues that the lower courts correctly found that appellant has a clear contractual right to subrogation arising out of the State Police Handbook. Given this clear right, appellant argues that appellees breach of that contract is beyond dispute: he settled the malpractice litigation on Benjamin’s behalf, but refused to reimburse appellant for the medical benefits that settlement paid to him. According to appellant, appellee thereby received double payment for Benjamin’s medical expenses, first from PEBTF and then from the settlement with Benjamin’s medical providers. Appellant asserts that the lower courts effectively approved this double payment when they erroneously refused to enforce appellant’s right to subrogation. Appellant further takes issue with the Superior Courts finding that nothing in the State Police Handbook placed an affirmative duty on appellee to notify PEBTF of any pending litigation. Pointing to other language in the Handbook stating, You will take no action prejudicing the rights and interests of the Plan, appellant maintains that this language placed a burden on appellee to be mindful of PEBTFs subrogation rights, a duty that appellee breached by concealing the existence and settlement of Benjamin’s litigation.</p>
    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.5",617,[161,2012,1153,367]],["BL_618.1",618,[315,327,1162,830]]]'>Appellant argues that the concept of contractual subrogation is well-entrenched in Pennsylvania law, citing to <em>Illinois Automobile Ins. Exchange v. Braun, </em><a href="/pa/280/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="280 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1084469" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0550-01">280 Pa. 550</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.%20691" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="124 A. 691">124 A. 691</a> (1924). There, the insureds’ truck was damaged in a collision with a railroad train. The insureds simultaneously sued both their insurer, the Illinois Automobile Insurance Exchange, and the railroad. Following trial against the Insurance Exchange, <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>the insureds secured a judgment for damages to the truck only. The insureds then settled the action against the railroad, an action encompassing damage to the truck and its contents; the settlement produced a payment of $750 to the insureds, but “a verdict by agreement” in favor of the railroad. The Insurance Exchange was aware of the action against the railroad, but was not apprised of settlement negotiations. When the Insurance Exchange learned of the settlement with the railroad, it sued the insureds, seeking subrogation for the amount paid to the insureds under their policy. This Court held that: “Under conditions such as those contained in the policy before us, an insured cannot settle with the one causing him loss, except with the acquiescence of the insurance company without putting in peril his status with the latter.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.%20691" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="124 A. 691">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.%20691" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="124 A. 691">at 693</a>.

    <p id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.4",618,[315,1189,1162,835]]]'>In addition, appellant argues that the language of the State Police Handbook is straightforward and uncomplicated and clearly sets forth PEBTF’s right to subrogation. Buttressing appellee’s obligation to appellant is, in appellant’s view, the language of the settlement agreement that appellee signed in Benjamin’s medical malpractice action, which stated that: “The undersigned hereby agrees ... to satisfy any and all liens that have been asserted and/or which could be or may be asserted for reimbursement of any medical benefits or other benefits provided to the undersigned by a third party----” According to appellant, this language leaves little doubt that appellee and his counsel were aware of his obligation to satisfy PEBTF’s subrogation rights. The language of the settlement agreement, appellant asserts, provides a corroboration of the contractual right to subrogation, which the lower courts ignored or misconstrued.</p>
    <p id="b618-7" data-blocks='[["BL_618.5",618,[314,2056,1162,309]],["BL_619.1",619,[181,332,1155,570]]]'>Appellant next takes issue with the Superior Courts reliance on a workers compensation case, <em>Independence Blue Cross, <a href="/a2d/820/0868-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="820 A.2d 868" data-case-ids="9313130" data-case-paths="/a2d/820/0868-01">supra,</a> </em>to reach the conclusion that PEBTF did not pursue its subrogation rights with reasonable diligence. The subrogation claim in <em>Independence Blue Cross </em>again arose out of a workers’ compensation claim under Section 319 of the Work<a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>ers’ Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 671. The <em>Independence Blue Cross </em>Court noted that Section 319 requires that subrogation rights be established either by contract or at the time of the workers’ compensation hearing. Finding that there was no agreement for subrogation, the court found that Independence Blue Cross waived its claim by failing to assert it at the compensation hearing. Thus, based upon the statutory requirement that a subrogation agreement must exist or the subrogation claim must be raised at the time of the compensation hearing, and finding neither event occurred, the court rejected Independence Blue Cross’s subrogation claim.</p>
    <p id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.4",619,[179,926,1156,1269]]]'>Appellant asserts that the decision in <em>Independence Blue Cross </em>turned upon the statutory language unique to the Workers’ Compensation Act and upon two critical findings— that no contract existed and that Independence Blue Cross failed to raise its subrogation claim at the compensation hearing despite the absence of evidence that Blue Cross lacked notice of the compensation proceeding. Appellant argues that the matter <em>sub judice </em>is fundamentally distinguishable in that it does not implicate Section 319 of the Workers’ Compensation Act or a similar statutory provision, there are two separate contracts recognizing the right to subrogation, and it is undisputed that PEBTF did not have notice of the malpractice litigation. Further, appellant claims that from a public policy point of view, workers’ compensation precedent should not apply to non-workers’ compensation matters because in compensation cases, the employer and insurer are routinely notified as soon as an employee files a claim of a job-related injury. Appellant posits that it makes sense, given the notice of injury, that a compensation carrier cannot be permitted to sit on its rights and waives its subrogation claim if it does so. By contrast, PEBTF argues, it is not automatically notified when one of its plan participants files a tort action, but instead receives notice only when a party provides that notice, which appellee failed to do in this instance.</p>
    <p id="b619-5" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[178,2220,1156,148]],["BL_620.1",620,[312,328,1159,842]]]'>Appellee counters that the trial court’s determination that PEBTF failed to exercise reasonable diligence to protect its right to subrogation was a question of fact for the fact finder, <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>which cannot be disturbed on appeal because appellate review is limited to determining whether the trial court committed an error of law. Thus, appellee claims that the issue under review is beyond this Court’s standard of review. We may dispose of this preliminary argument summarily, for it appears that appellee clearly is mistaken. The limited issue before this Court is not whether appellant in fact exercised reasonable diligence, but rather whether reasonable diligence (an equitable concept) is relevant at all, <em>ie., </em>whether appellant’s contractual right to subrogation could be waived by its failure to exercise reasonable diligence in asserting the right. Our decision of the purely legal issue of whether the lack of reasonable diligence may undermine or eliminate a contractual subrogation right does not necessarily encompass the subsidiary and contingent question of whether the party asserting a subrogation right in fact exercised reasonable diligence.</p>
    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.4",620,[308,1193,1160,903]]]'>Appellee’s remaining arguments do not address appellant’s issues head-on. First, appellee argues that, based upon <em>Independence Blue Cross, </em>the Superior Court properly found that PEBTF’s failure to assert its subrogation claim until after the settlement of the underlying malpractice action constituted a waiver of the claim for failure to exercise reasonable diligence. The crux of this argument is that appellant failed to act within a reasonable amount of time in that the subrogation claim was asserted, as previously noted, more than five years after Benjamin’s birth, more than three years after the malpractice action was filed, more than a year after trial, ten months after the matter settled, and nearly six months after the trial court approved the medical malpractice settlement. Comparing this delay to the fourteen-month delay that resulted in waiver in <em>Independence Blue Cross, </em>appellee concludes that, because PEBTF failed to take action for more than five years, it therefore clearly did not exercise reasonable diligence.</p>
    <p id="b620-5" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[308,2121,1160,257]],["BL_621.1",621,[159,331,1155,1216]]]'>Appellee’s second argument is that the State Police Handbook did not require him to notify PEBTF of the malpractice action, but rather merely required him to assist PEBTF if requested that he do so. Appellee quotes the relevant provision: “You are required to take such action, furnish such <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>information and assistance, and execute such papers as the Plan may request to facilitate enforcement of its rights” (emphasis added). Appellee argues that there is no allegation or evidence that he failed to do anything that PEBTF requested of him, and that the record is replete with evidence that PEBTF failed to take any action to assert its own rights. The Handbook, according to appellee, places any affirmative duty to take action on appellant, not on appellee. Further, appellee claims without basis that it is commonplace for an insured not to read an insurance policy, and that he had no legal obligation to read his Handbook. Appellee adds that PEBTF is more versed in the area of subrogation and, by its own admission, employs experienced attorneys to identify potential subrogation claims and initiate claims where appropriate. Thus, appellee contends that the burden to pursue its claim rested ■with appellant, and not with parents dealing with the everyday issues involved in caring for a severely handicapped child. Finally, appellee claims that the settlement in the malpractice action did not contemplate any payments to PEBTF because the language of the settlement agreement reveals that no money was paid for past medical expenses; therefore, there is no fund of money against which appellant could have a proper subrogation claim.</p>

According to appellant, appellee’s complaint in the malpractice action alleged that he had incurred and would continue to incur considerable expenses for Benjamin’s treatment. Because appellee settled the malpractice claim, appellant argues, he necessarily recovered for past and future medical bills, as they were part of the damages initially sought in the malpractice action. In addition, focusing on different and broader language from the Handbook, PEBTF claims that appellee did have an affirmative duty to protect its subrogation rights arising out of language contained in the paragraph covering subrogation: “You will take no action prejudicing the rights and interests of the Plan.” Appellant argues that appellee’s counsel, an experienced personal injury lawyer, understood <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>the significance of the subrogation language and that failing to notify appellant of the malpractice litigation would prejudice PEBTF’s subrogation rights.</p>

We agree with appellant that the workers’ compensation cases are inapposite. The law of workers’ compensation consists of a unique and comprehensive statutory scheme which, as relevant here, provides employers and their insurers with timely notice of any injury that may give rise to a subrogation claim. The same is not true in the context of insurers providing medical benefits to individuals who may or may not pursue an action against a third party tortfeasor. Thus, the subrogation waiver doctrine employed by Commonwealth Court applicable in the workers’ compensation arena is not sufficient support, on its own, for the decision below.</p>

Moreover, not having been notified of the subrogation claim at the time appellee settled with the medical malpractice defendants, appellee may not have contemplated that substantial expense in determining what was fair compensation for his sons injury, in light of the anticipated costs of his future care. Allowing for a post-settlement initial assertion of subrogation rights, in such an instance, may very well cause substantial hardship to the insured, and prejudice his position respecting the third party tortfeasor. The introduction of equitable principles, including a concept of reasonable diligence and prompt assertion of subrogation rights, can ensure that any such hardship is minimized or eliminated.</p>
    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.4",627,[179,1146,1160,788]]]'>Here, appellant waited a substantial period of time before raising its subrogation claim — all the while knowing it was paying medical benefits for a child who suffered a severe birth injury that was likely to give rise to litigation. In addition, as appellee notes, by its own admission, appellant employs experienced attorneys to identify potential subrogation claims and initiate claims where appropriate; thus, appellant was in a position to discover its potential claim far in advance of the date the first notice of the claim was provided to appellee’s counsel. By the time appellant forwarded its claim, the underlying malpractice settlement had been finalized. We, like the substantial majority of our sister courts, see no error in the lower courts employing equitable principles to determine that, under circumstances such as these, the right to subrogation can be waived or defeated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
