One of the victim’s co-workers testified about a bonus check the victim received on the day of the murder that was never recovered from his belongings, thus supporting the charges of theft, robbery, and receiving stolen property. Another co-worker testified about what the victim was wearing when last seen and described the victim’s briefcase, which matched the description of one later discarded by Barbosa. The witness who found the victim’s discarded wallet, which was crucial in later locating the victim’s body, recounted how she tried to return it, only to learn the victim was dead; she then gave it to police. The police chief testified regarding the missing person investigation and the discovery of the body. The victim’s wife testified about what her husband was wearing when last seen and identified his discarded belongings.

The prosecutor argued the (d)(6) aggravator (killing committed during perpetration of felony) alone was sufficient to warrant a death sentence; in so doing, he stated appellant’s killing the victim during the robbery was an aggravating circumstance which would permit the jury to impose the death penalty.
