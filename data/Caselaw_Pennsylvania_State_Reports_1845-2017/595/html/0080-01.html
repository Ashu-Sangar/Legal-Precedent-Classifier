After considering the legislative intent, we conclude that a large portion of the increase in the pension benefit in this case did not arise “from postseparation monetary contributions made by the employee spouse,” <em>see id., </em>but instead resulted solely from the legislature’s creation of a new class of pension benefits. Therefore, we hold that the portion of the increase resulting from legislative action constitutes marital property subject to equitable distribution. Contrarily, we find that a small portion of pension did result from postseperation monetary contributions made by the employee spouse, and that this portion should be characterized as nonmarital. We reverse the decision of the Superior Court to the extent it is contrary herewith, and remand to the trial court for implementation.</p>

Citing a December 16, 2003 letter from legal counsel at SERS, Wife noted that SERS calculated the present value of the pension for the period between the date of marriage in August 1974 and the date of separation in January 1995 as $402,890.

Wife contends that the total increase in Husband’s pension benefits in the case at bar falls under that exception because the increase was not based on Husband’s postseparation efforts or contributions. Wife notes that Act 2001-9 retrospectively increased pension benefits accrued prior to the effective date of July 2001, but prospectively increased contribution rates beginning in January 2002. In rejecting the argument that the contribution increase was a <em>quid pro quo, </em>she reasserts that a subset of SERS members, including Husband, could have retired between July 2001 and December 2001 and received the pension increase without ever paying the increased contribution. Wife contends, “In no way can it be said that the twenty-five (25%) percent increase of [Husband’s] entire pension was ‘purchased’ by what amounts to seven (7) months of increased contributions of one and one-quarter (1/4%) percent.” Brief for Wife at 11.

Rather, the election and related mandatory contributions from January 2002 to July 2002 constitute postseparation efforts and contributions, which under <em>Berrington </em>place the increase in the pension benefit outside the marital estate. Husband observes that the increase occurred over six years after the date of separation and three years after the trial court’s order dividing the pension and instructing the parties to file a proposed QDRO. Husband notes that the option to elect the increase did not exist and could not have been contemplated prior to the separation, and thus should not be included in marital property.</p>

The Divorce Code, generally, limits “marital property” to all property acquired by either party between the date of marriage and the date of final separation, 23 Pa.C.S. § 3501(a), and therefore excludes “[property acquired after final separation until the date of divorce, except for property acquired in exchange for marital assets.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 3501(a)(4). An employee-spouse’s pension benefit does not fit cleanly into either the marital or the postseparation category. On one hand, the pension can be viewed as a fruit of the marriage and the product of both spouses’ efforts during the marriage, thus warranting consideration as marital property subject to distribution to the non-employee-spouse. On the other hand, the eventual pension benefit may also result partially from the employee-spouse’s continued employment after separation, and thus, partially, would be non-marital property not subject to distribution.

Secondly, it assumed that “an asset cannot be marital if it depends on any efforts or contributions made after separation.” <em>Id. </em>(Cappy, J., dissenting).

He viewed the asset earned during the marriage as a <em>“promise </em>from the employer to make deferred compensation payments (for the years of the marriage) based upon a formula that can produce <em>higher </em>or <em>loioer </em>pension benefits than those calculated based upon the employee’s earnings as of the date of separation.” <em>Id. </em>at 598 (Cappy, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original).

The immediate offset method, whereby the present value of the pension benefit is calculated and the non-employee-spouse receives an offsetting portion of the marital assets to compensate for the employee-spouse’s eventual receipt of the pension benefits, a method that provides ex-spouses closure.

The OAJC found the first two questions satisfied because it was plain that there were increases in retirement benefits that were payable to the employee-spouse and became payable between the time of final separation and the time the employee spouse began receiving benefits. Regarding whether the increases resulted from the postseparation efforts of the employee-spouse, the OAJC concluded that the employee-spouse had not contributed anything to trigger the supplemental retirement income and bonuses because those early retirement benefits resulted simply from the years of prior service. Thus, the first two incentive packages were includable as marital property. Conversely, the employee-spouse did contribute to the ORBIT annuity by paying 27%, or $27,000, post-retirement from non-marital funds. Accordingly, the OAJC included in the marital estate only the 73%) of the ORBIT annuity paid by the employer, finding that the 73% did not result from postseparation efforts of the employee-spouse. However, recognizing that the early retirement inducements resulted not just from the employee-spouse’s employment during marriage but from his entire period of employment, the OAJC applied the coverture fraction to these inducements and awarded the non-employee-spouse her share of the marital estate.</p>

Unlike the language in the SERS provision applicable to the enhancement of benefits for service after June 30, 2001 that directly tied the enhanced benefits to the 1.5% increase in the payroll deduction, the SERS statute specifically provides that a member of Class AA “shall receive Class AA service for all Class A State service ... performed before July 1, 2001.” 71 Pa.C.S. § 5306(a.l)(3). In the legislation, the General Assembly made clear that its purpose was to pass on to state employees a share of the investment success enjoyed by SERS. Act of May 17, 2001, P.L. 26, No. 9. Despite his understandable protestations to the contrary, Husband made no postseparation monetary contribution to secure this benefit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> Indeed, if he had retired seven months earlier, <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>the increase would have been paid to him without his ever paying even the additional 1.5% payroll deduction, that he claims entitles him to all of the increase. Thus, Class A members, including Husband, received the enhancement in the value of their pre-July 1, 2001 service merely by their continued employment and the act of electing Class AA, and not through any postseparation monetary contribution or effort.

Thus, Husband’s nonmarital property is the difference between the value of the post-June 30, 2001 pension calculated at the 2.5% multiplier and the value of the pension for the same period calculated at the 2.0% multiplier, an increase attributable to the 1.5% of additional payroll deduction that began postseparation. Stated differently, the portion of Husband’s pension that is marital property subject to distribution through use of the coverture fraction is 100% of Husband’s pre-June 30, 2001 pension and all of the post July 1, 2001 pension except that attributable to the 1.5% payroll deduction that Husband paid postseparation above his pre-separation payments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a>

Although we defer to SERS for final pension calculation and the trial court for fact finding, for purposes of demonstration, we conclude that the following would approximate the formula to be applied: Coverture fraction (20.4 years of employment during marriage/30.58 years of total employment) x [Class AA Pre-July 1, 2001 pension benefit (2.5% x 29.58 years of service x final average salary) + Class A Post June 30, 2001 pension benefit (2.0% x 1 year of service x final average salary)].</p>

With regard to the latter, the majority <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>encounters a number of conceptual difficulties occasioned by the unique facts of the case. For example, it is undisputed that the employee-spouse withdrew and retained all of his monetary contributions to his retirement plan, <em>see </em>R.R. at 30a, and no claim is presently before this Court pertaining to a specific accounting for such sum. Presumably for these reasons, the majority elects not to consider whether the portion of those contributions that were contributed post-separation fit within the critical passage of Section 3501(c) exempting “enhancements arising from postseparation monetary contributions made by the employee spouse, including the gain or loss on such contributions.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 3501(c)(2). <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 100, &amp; n. 17, 938 A.2d at 258 &amp; n. 17. Yet, despite some awkwardness in working its way around this obstacle, the majority finds itself able to announce that the corresponding portion contributed by the employer (or the fund) does not arise from any post-separation contribution. <em>See id.</em>

This rationale, however, appears to assume that the Legislature intended application of a coverture fraction either to both of post-separation employee and employer contributions or to neither. This, however, appears to be belied by the Official Comment to Section 3501(c): “New subsection (c) seeks to----include <em>all postseparation enhancements except for postseparation monetary contributions by the employee spouse </em>in the value of the pension.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 3501(c) (emphasis added); <em>accord </em>17 West’s Pa. Practice, Family Law § 23:2 (6th ed. 2007) (explaining that post-separation increases in value based upon years of service are subject to the coverture fraction, but that the employee’s post-separation monetary contributions themselves are not).

This leads to the rather incongruous holding that, while about seventy-seven percent of Husband’s post-separation contributions is not a “postseparation monetary contribution” for purposes of the majority opinion, the other twenty-three percent is, in fact, a post-separation monetary contribution. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 104, 938 A.2d at 260. The majority also finds the employer-added benefit attributable to this twenty-three percent of Husband’s post-separation monetary contributions to be exempt from the application of the coverture fraction, <em>see id., </em>despite the rather clear parallel to <em>Gordon </em>as developed in the Official Comment to Section 3501(c).</p>

While <em>Gordon </em>is certainly distinguishable on its facts because it involved an early retirement incentive entailing a one-time post-separation contribution, the Legislature made general reference to the case in direct connection with the devising of a scheme for the equitable division of defined benefit retirement plans. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 3501(c) (captioned "Defined benefit retirement plans”).

As I find the entire enhancement of the pension was the result of husband’s postseparation effort, it should not change the mathematics agreed to by the parties when they divided this pension.</p>
