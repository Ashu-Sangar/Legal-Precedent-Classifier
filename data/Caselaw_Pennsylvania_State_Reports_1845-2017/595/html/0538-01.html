In July of 2004, the General Assembly enacted the Gaming Act, a statute that provides for slot machine gaming at a set number of licensed facilities within the Commonwealth. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1102. The Act established the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (“Gaming Board”), and empowers it to issue slot machine licenses at its discretion. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1202(b)(12). The Act provides for three types of slot machine licenses, designated by category. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1301. Each category permits an entity or person to apply to the Board for a license, and upon issuance, authorizes the placement and operation of slot machines at a licensed facility. <em>Id. </em>Under the Act, two Category 2 licensed facilities are to be located by the Board within a city of the first class. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1304(b).

That said, we also observe that § 1506 does not authorize this Court to review every such order, determination or decision. Rather, § 1506 expressly provides that only those orders or determinations or decisions that are “final” are appealable. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1506. Yet, the Gaming Act does <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>not define “final,” and because of the term’s alternative connotations, what amounts to an order, determination or decision that is “final” under § 1506 is less than clear in this context.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> It may be, as PEDP argues, the last word from any local body involved in effectuating Philadelphia’s zoning ordinances or it may be, as the City argues, that ultimate pronouncement made in accordance with and deemed conclusive and appeal-able under the administrative process the Philadelphia Code provides.</p>

For this, our recent decision in <em>PGCB v. City Council </em>is instructive. In <em>PGCB v. City Council, </em>we were called upon to consider the General Assembly’s objectives in re-enacting § 1506 after its predecessor, which expressly preempted local zoning regulations relating to the physical location of licensed facilities approved by the Gaming Board, was declared an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power by this Court and severed from the Act. <em>See Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion Fund v.

More specifically, in <em>PGCB v. City Council, </em>we looked to § 1506 as re-enacted to determine what role the General Assembly intends for local zoning provisions to play in the establishment of licensed facilities, in light of the exclusive authority it has given to the Gaming Board to locate such <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>facilities. Because the General Assembly declined to expressly preempt local land use and zoning ordinances in re-enacted § 1506, as it had in the original statute, and included nothing more in re-enacted § 1506 than a jurisdictional grant, we determined that it was the General Assembly’s aim in reenacted § 1506 to maintain a political subdivision’s power to zone and to have licensed facilities established in accordance with the land use and zoning provisions it has enacted. <em>PGCB v.

In our view, this construction of § 1506 is consistent with and advances the General Assembly’s intent in the Gaming Act to preserve a political subdivision’s authority to zone and subject the development of licensed facilities to local zoning regulations. <em>See <a href="/pa/593/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="928 A.2d 1255" data-case-ids="3250615,8357864" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0241-01,/a2d/928/1255-01">id.</a></em>

The first step is the decision the Department makes on a permit application. Under the Philadelphia Code, the Department accepts applications for a zoning or use registration <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>permit, and may grant the permit sought, refer applications to the Zoning Hearing Board for a certificate for regulated uses, or issue notices of refusal. Phila. Code § 14-1702, 14-1703. The second step is the decision the Zoning Hearing Board renders on the propriety of the Department’s decision. Under the Philadelphia Code, if requested, the Zoning Hearing Board reviews the Department’s decision, and may affirm, reverse, or modify it, issue the permit, grant a special exception or a variance, or issue a certificate for regulated uses. Phila. Code, §§ 14-1705, 14-1801, 14-1802, 14-1804, 14-1605(4).

At the same time, however, we observe that the General Assembly’s intent in § 1506 to preserve a city’s authority to zone does not mean that local zoning laws may be used to impede implementation of the Gaming Board’s decision to locate a licensed facility by those authorized to effectuate those local laws. Recently, in <em>HSP Gaming L.P. v. City Council for the City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/595/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="595 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="3844030" data-case-paths="/pa/595/0508-01">595 Pa. 508</a>, <a href="/pa/595/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="939 A.2d 273" data-case-ids="3844030,8301648" data-case-paths="/pa/595/0508-01,/a2d/939/0273-01">939 A.2d 273</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204226871" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2007 WL 4226871">2007 WL 4226871</a> (per curiam) (2007), we concluded that § 1506 gave this Court the jurisdiction to consider the refusal of Philadelphia's City Council to proceed with certain steps required under the CED Ordinance for the development of gaming facilities. <em>See supra </em>n. 2. City Council's decision not to proceed had prevented the licensee who was granted the second Category 2 slot machine license in Philadelphia from securing the CED designation it must have under the Philadelphia Code to develop its approved site into a licensed facility.</p>
