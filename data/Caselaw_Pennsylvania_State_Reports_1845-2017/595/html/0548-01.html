Jenkins, Sr. (Appellant), appeal the order of the Commonwealth Court directing Appellant’s employer, the Department of Corrections (DOC), to calculate his seniority, for purposes of furlough and promotion, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), rather than the State Civil Service Act, 71 P.S. §§ 741.1-741.1005 (the Act). The questions we address are whether, with respect to furlough and promotion, the Act and the CBA define and apply seniority differently, and if so, the consequence of any conflict. We conclude that the CBA’s definitions of seniority and the loss of seniority conflict with those of the Act. We further conclude that given this conflict, the DOC is required to follow the dictates of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the Commission’s adjudication.</p>

The Act defines the classified service to include all positions in enumerated departments of the state (other than certain managerial-type and unskilled laborers positions not implicated here). <em>See </em>Section 3(d)(l)-(15) of the Act, 71 P.S. § 741.3(d)(l)-(15); <em>Geary v. U.S. Steel Corp., </em><a href="/pa/456/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="456 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="584439" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0171-01">456 Pa. 171</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20174" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="319 A.2d 174">319 </a><a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a><a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20174" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="319 A.2d 174">A.2d 174</a>, 184 (1974). Section 807.2 of the Act, 71 P.S. § 741.809, establishes the seniority of all individuals employed within the classified service. In addition to the overarching category of seniority for all employees within the classified service, this Section also establishes two narrower categories within which seniority can accrue or be lost by a civil service employee. They are the more constricted category of “classification series” seniority, which includes all periods of employment in a particular classification series contained within the classified service, and the third and narrowest designation of “class seniority,” which is the seniority accrued within a specific job “class” within a “classification series” which, in turn, is within the “classified service.” <em>See </em>Section 807.2 of the Act, 71 P.S. § 741.809.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

This begins with the date of first civil service employment regardless of the civil service classification series and class, and continues to accrue without regard to how many positions the employee holds in any particular classification series or class. <em>See </em>Section 807.2, 71 P.S. § 741.809. The second category of seniority involves classification series and includes all periods of employment in any peculiar classification series, regardless of the number of classes occupied within that series. The final seniority category involves individual classes of employment and includes periods within one particular class, which is, by definition, <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>always within the same classification series and within the classified service.</p>
    <p id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[311,462,1160,677]]]'>Additionally, the Act’s implementing regulation, 4 Pa.Code § 101.71(a), speaks to the impact upon furloughs and promotions of movement from one classification series to another and from one class to another within a classification series. The regulation specifies that such movements do not impact accrual and retention of seniority so long as the positions held by an employee are all within the classified service in accord with Section 807.2 of the Act, 71 P.S. § 741.809. Under the Act and its regulations, therefore, a promotion, demotion or lateral transfer from one classification series to another or from one class to another does not result in a break-in-service impacting seniority so long as the promotion is within the classified service.</p>
    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.5",588,[310,1172,1158,412]]]'>Finally, the Act provides that a movement between positions within the classified service, whether such movement is a promotion, demotion or transfer, is not complete until the expiration of a three-month probationary period, <em>see </em>Section 603, 71 P.S. § 741.603. During these three months, the relocating employee has the option to return to his prior position without loss of seniority. Section 804.1(b), 71 P.S. § 741.804a(b).</p>
    <p id="b588-6" data-blocks='[["BL_588.6",588,[309,1611,1159,575]],["BL_589.1",589,[169,327,1150,150]]]'>Unfortunately, the CBA employs different terminology and mandates different consequences for employees moving within the classified service. Implicitly, like the Act, the broadest category of employment is the classified service. However, the CBA’s second broadest demarcation is “bargaining units” rather than the Act’s “classification series.” The difficulty with this distinction, which, in part, lies at the heart of this case, is that the CBA’s bargaining units do not encompass every class or classification series under the Act. The third and narrowest demarcation is referred to as a “classification” rather than a “class,” which is the term employed by the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>However, this distinction does not seem to present the same problem, as a CBA “classification” and an Act “class” are apparently coterminous.</p>
    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.6",589,[167,502,1153,683]]]'>As noted, the numerous CBA bargaining units within the classified service do not always correlate with the Act’s various classification series. Thus, an employee moving under the Act from class to class and therefore moving under the CBA from classification to classification can stay within a classification series for purposes of the Act, but, nevertheless, move from one bargaining unit to another bargaining unit for purposes of the CBA. The importance of this for purposes of the case before us is that the Act uses seniority within the classified service to determine priority among employees for furlough, and the CBA uses bargaining unit seniority for the same purpose; resulting in one of the conflicts between the Act and CBA.</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.7",589,[165,1220,1153,801]]]'>Also, importantly for purposes of this dispute is the Act’s and CBA’s disparate treatment of a classified service employee accepting a promotion. Under the Act, an employee changing classification series or classes has three months to unilaterally decide to return to his previous position. Section 804.1(b), 71 P.S. § 741.804a(b). If he does so, he maintains all seniority, regardless of the hiatus. <em>See </em>Section 807.2, 71 P.S. § 741.809. Conversely, under the CBA, once an employee leaves a bargaining unit, he immediately loses all seniority for both furlough and promotion. CBA, Article 27, § 2. If such employee returns within the three-month window provided by the Act, or, indeed, three days later, it is as if he has been hired into the classified service for the first time. <em><a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20174" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="319 A.2d 174">Id.</a> </em>Thus, for purposes of furlough and promotion, he is the most junior employee in the bargaining unit and/or classification.</p>

      <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>Finally, before turning to the facts of this case, it is important to recognize that the Pennsylvania Employee Relations Act (PERA), 43 P.S. § 1101.703, contains a provision that any conflict between a statute and collective bargaining agreement must be resolved in favor of the statute:</p>
    <blockquote id="b590-4" data-blocks='[["BL_590.4",590,[354,596,1120,356]]]'>The parties to the collective bargaining process shall not effect or implement a provision in a collective bargaining-agreement if the implementation of that provision would be in violation of, or inconsistent with, or in conflict with any statute or statutes enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the provisions of municipal home rule charters.</blockquote>

    <p id="b590-6" data-blocks='[["BL_590.6",590,[310,1030,1163,559]]]'>The issue in this case is whether as a matter of law the CBA and the Act are in actual conflict with respect to their determinations of seniority for purposes of furlough and promotion. If so, the question becomes whether the conflict provision in PERA (and the duplicated provision of the CBA) requires that we apply the Act, nullifying the inconsistent provisions of the CBA. Now that we have explained fully the nuanced distinctions between the Act and the CBA and the section of PERA directing that a statute prevails over a collective bargaining agreement in the event of a conflict, we turn to the facts of this case.</p>
    <p id="b590-7" data-blocks='[["BL_590.7",590,[311,1620,1161,250]]]'>Appellant is a member of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association (the Union), which represents 10,000 members, including all corrections officers employed by the DOC.

      <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>Appellant began his employment with the DOC on June 25, 1987, as a corrections officer trainee at the State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill. After successfully completing training, on October 1, 1987, he was made a Corrections Officer (CO). After working in this classification for several years he was promoted on March 1, 1992, to Sergeant, a Corrections Officer 2(C02) classification. In all three classifications, Appellant was a member of the HI bargaining unit of the Union. Accordingly, pursuant to the CBA, Appellant’s bargaining unit seniority began with the first day of employment within the bargaining unit, June 25, 1987. Appellant’s classification seniority in the C02 position began on March 1, 1992. On March 30, 2002, Appellant was promoted to Lieutenant, Corrections Officer 3(C03), a management level position at the State Correctional Institution at Chester. Promotion to this management level position took Appellant out of the HI bargaining unit, and, therefore necessarily, out of his classification. Thus, pursuant to the CBA, Appellant lost all seniority for purposes of both furloughs and promotion.</p>
    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[175,1342,1157,879]]]'>Soon after taking the new position, on April 10, 2002, for personal reasons Appellant requested to return to the C02 position at Camp Hill. His request was granted, and he was voluntarily transferred and demoted from the position of C03 at Chester to C02 at Camp Hill on May 26, 2002, thereby again becoming part of the HI bargaining unit after what is known as a “break-in-service.” Upon Appellant’s return to the C02 position, the DOC followed Article 27, § 2 of the CBA, and assigned him a new seniority start date of May 26, 2002, which, in substance, treated Appellant like a new employee, eliminating the bargaining unit seniority that he had accrued between June 25, 1987 and the day of his transfer out of the HI bargaining unit, as well as the classification seniority he had accumulated in the C02 position prior to his promotion. Thus, for both furlough and promotion purposes, he became the most junior employee in the bargaining unit and classification.</p>

      <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>It was Appellant’s position that to the extent the CBA defined his promotion to C03 and return to C02 as a break-in-service requiring forfeiture of his accrued seniority for purposes of furlough and promotion, it was in conflict with the Act, which allowed him three months to return to his prior position without adverse consequences; and that given this discrepancy, the Act should prevail in accord with PERA, <em>supra. </em>Specifically, Appellant believed that under the Act he was entitled to credit for all of his time in the classified service for purposes of furlough, and for all of his time in the C02 position, both before and after his transfer to the C03 position, for purposes of promotions.</p>

The Union and the DOC petitioned the Commonwealth Court for review of the Commission’s order. The Commonwealth Court vacated the Commission’s March 28, 2003, order, and remanded directing the Commission to afford the Union an opportunity to participate as an indispensable party in the question of how seniority should be calculated for furlough and promotion purposes for members of the HI bargaining unit.</p>

The essence of the dispute was, according to the Commission, the manner in which the CBA and the Act treated a promotion to a position outside of the HI bargaining unit and the C02 classification: under the CBA, such a promotion resulted in the loss of all accrued bargaining unit and classification seniority, whereas the Act protected seniority as long as the promotion was within the classified service and Appellant returned to his C02 position within three months. Accordingly, the Commission agreed that there was a conflict between the Act and the CBA, but perceived the conflict to be limited solely to the CBA requirement that its definitions of seniority apply in the context of furlough and promotions, <em>see </em>CBA, Article 27, § 1(a) and (b), because furloughs and promotions are controlled by the Act, while the other subjects are not.</p>

It'argues that nothing in the CBA interferes with or deprives Appellant of his classified service seniority under the Act. Further, relying on <em>State College, </em>the Union asserts that the Act does not “explicitly or definitively” prohibit bargaining on alternative definitions and applications of seniority. Additionally, relying on Section 701 of PERA, 43 P.S. § 1101.701, which requires collective bargaining “with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment,” the Union argues that seniority is an essential term of employment and is therefore a mandatory subject of collective bargaining. More specifically, the Union asserts that the General Assembly has given priority to collective bargaining agreements in matters affected by seniority, such as promotion, and furlough. <em>See </em>71 P.S. §§ 741.601, 741.602, and 741.802(a).</p>

It asserts that a decision not to credit seniority for someone who, like Appellant, accepts promotion and subsequently returns to the bargaining unit, affects the entire unit. It contends that every person with less seniority than Appellant in the HI bargaining unit and the C02 classification will be prejudiced by Appellant’s return, if he is allowed to keep his seniority. Finally, the Union points out that the language governing seniority in this case is not unique to this particular CBA. Rather, there are twenty unions representing 66,000 public employees in the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth has negotiated seniority with each of these unions. These provisions could become null and void if Appellant prevails here, which, according to the Union, <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>would jeopardize a multitude of contracts and negate decades of collective bargaining.</p>

Therefore, under the Act, an employee receives classified service seniority credit for all of the time he or she has been employed in the classified service, regardless of how many times he or she may have been promoted or transferred out of a particular classification or class and then returned to it, “providing such employment has been on a continuous basis.” 71 ,P.S. § 741.809(b). Likewise, an employee’s seniority for a classification series, which includes all periods of employment in classes within a series, <em>i.e., </em>Appellant’s accumulated seniority in the progression from correction officer trainee to C03, begins with the date of employment in that series and includes all periods of employment within the series as long as the employee remains “employed in a continuous basis in the classified service.” <em><a href="/pa/593/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="930 A.2d 1264" data-case-ids="3250218,3250807,8353109,8353173" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0382-01,/pa/593/0382-02,/a2d/930/1264-01,/a2d/930/1264-02">Id.</a> </em>Finally, class seniority begins with the date of employment in that class and includes all periods of employment in that class as long as the employee is “employed on a continuous basis in the classified service.” <em><a href="/pa/593/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="930 A.2d 1264" data-case-ids="3250218,3250807,8353109,8353173" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0382-01,/pa/593/0382-02,/a2d/930/1264-01,/a2d/930/1264-02">Id.</a> </em>Seniority in one’s classification series and class is interrupted when the employee accepts a position in a different classification series or class, but is not forfeited if the employee never leaves the classified service.

For purpose of both classification and bargaining unit seniority, a break-in-service occurs “if an employee accepts a transfer out of or is promoted out of [the HI bargaining] Unit.” CBA, Article 27, § 2.

In contrast, the CBA required the forfeiture of this seniority because Appellant had been promoted out of the bargaining unit, thus breaking service, and then returned. By defining a break-in-service to include a promotion out of the HI bargaining unit, where the Act protects such seniority, the CBA is in conflict with the Act. Further, by permitting an employee to be penalized following an unsuccessful promotion, the CBA discourages members from seeking and accepting promotions.

The statute is silent about the ability of the parties to negotiate a term different from those in the statute. Does that silence mean the parties can do so, or does it mean the parties are not permitted to do so? In one interpretation, the statute must expressly <em>authorize </em>negotiation of a different term; failure to do so precludes any such negotiation. In the other interpretation, the statute must expressly <em>prohibit </em>such negotiation in order to be seen as preclusive.</p>
