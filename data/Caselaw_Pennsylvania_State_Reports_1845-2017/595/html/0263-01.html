The court reversed, determining the power of attorney’s incorporation of Chapter 56 of Title 20 by reference to be insufficient to grant powers as it does not apprise the principal of the type of powers listed in the power of attorney statute; it declined to presume the principal intended to grant such powers absent notice, use of general language, or an attachment of the statutory provisions. The court stated <em>Reifsneider </em>“merely stands for the proposition that general language used in a power of attorney document can serve to grant the specific powers found in § 5602(a) and as defined in <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>§ 5603.

Section 5602 provides a principal may empower his attorney-in-fact to do any of an enumerated list of tasks, by including specific language or by including language showing a similar intent. 20 Pa.C.S. § 5602(a). Here, decedent chose to incorporate by reference the powers enumerated in the statute, and by doing so evinced her intent to confer broad authority to her attorneys-in-fact. She specifically stated no specific powers were intended to limit the general powers conferred. Under <em>Reifsneider, </em>general language may be used to show the “similar intent on the part of the principal,” if such general language, according to its common usage, encompasses such power or powers. <em>Reifsneider, </em>at 962. Decedent’s power of attorney expressly incorporated the Powers of Attorney statute, and expressly granted Rhodes the power and authority to do any act therein. As the general language shows decedent’s intent to empower Rhodes to do any or all of the things permitted by the statute, which includes engaging in insurance transactions, <em>see </em>20 Pa.C.S. §§ 5602(a)(17), 5603(p), we hold the power of attorney at issue was sufficient to empower Rhodes to change the beneficiary of the life insurance policy.</p>

I would have reached the opposite conclusion in <em>Reifsneider, </em>as I believe that Section 5602(a) either speaks directly to the contrary or is at least ambiguous in this regard. To the degree that the statute is ambiguous, strong policy considerations militate in favor of an interpretation requiring express language to be included within a power of attorney to support the exercise of the powers that the Legislature had deemed to be special ones. In this regard, it seems clear to me that the statute is facially designed to require specific notice to and assent by a principal relative to the authorization of vicarious consent to the series of important life choices that are set forth in Section 5602(a). <em>See </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 5602(a) (setting forth as special powers, <em>inter alia, </em>the ability to make limited gifts, renounce fiduciary positions, authorize surgical procedures, engage in real property transactions, borrow money, enter safe deposit boxes, and commit the principal as an organ donor). Indeed, as the majority notes, as to one of those choices, gifting, the Legislature has undertaken to specifically overrule <em>Reifsneider.</em>
