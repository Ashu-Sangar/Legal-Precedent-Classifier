(“PERA”). For the reasons that follow, we reaffirm the essence test as the proper standard to be employed by a court when reviewing a grievance arbitration award; adopt a public policy exception to that test; reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court; and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with our opinion today.</p>
    <p id="b687-7" data-blocks='[["BL_687.7",687,[174,1133,1156,579]]]'>The facts underlying this appeal are as follows. Sherie Vrable began her employment with the Westmoreland Intermediate Unit # 7 (“Intermediate Unit”) on October 28, 1978. She worked for the Intermediate Unit for over 23 years as a classroom assistant with no discipline prior to her termination. For the 2001/2002 school year, Ms. Vrable had successfully bid on the position of Classroom Assistant in the emotional support classroom taught by Cynthia Pierce, an IU Special Education Teacher located in the West Newton Elementary School in the Yough School District in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b687-8" data-blocks='[["BL_687.8",687,[174,1740,1153,636]],["BL_688.1",688,[310,332,1157,247]]]'>Ms. Vrable reported to work on March 18, 2002. On this day, Ms. Vrable was responsible for assisting Ms. Pierce with eleven emotionally disturbed children in grades three through five. Ms. Vrable complained when she arrived at school that she was not feeling well. At approximately 9:30 a.m., Ms. Pierce asked Ms. Vrable to take two sets of materials to the copy room in the library to make copies. Ms. Vrable agreed to do so and left the classroom. Approximately fifteen minutes later, Ms. Vrable returned to Ms. Pierce’s classroom with the copies from one set of materials and advised Ms. Pierce that she was getting worse and that she was going to call a substitute to work for her the rest of the day. Ms. Pierce <a id="p652" href="#p652" data-label="652" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*652</a>indicated that this was acceptable, but that that Ms. Vrable was to inform her of what arrangements she had made prior to leaving. Ms. Vrable advised Ms. Pierce that she would retrieve the second set of materials being copied and would call for a substitute. Ms. Vrable left Ms. Pierce’s classroom.</p>
    <p id="b688-4" data-blocks='[["BL_688.4",688,[309,611,1161,1002]]]'>After approximately forty-five minutes, Ms. Pierce realized that Ms. Vrable had not returned. She sent a student with a note to the copy room and to the nurse’s office to find Ms. Vrable. Evidently, Ms. Vrable entered Preschool Special Education Teacher Denise Fischer’s classroom and offered to do some tracing. Ms. Vrable left with the materials to do so. Approximately fifteen to twenty minutes later, School District Aide Patty Beraducci entered Ms. Fisher’s classroom and asked if all Intermediate Unit staff was accounted for. Ms. Beraducci explained that an unidentified individual had been in the restroom for an extended period of time. Ms. Fischer left her classroom and went to the door of the restroom. She knocked on the door and called Ms. Vrable by her name. Upon calling her name, Ms. Vrable let out a moan. Ms. Fischer asked Ms. Vrable to open the door and explained that if she would not open the door, she would have to call 911 and Ms. Vrable’s mother. When Ms. Vrable failed to further respond, Ms. Fischer advised Ms. Beraducci to contact the Principal, Joyce Speck, and to call 911.</p>
    <p id="b688-5" data-blocks='[["BL_688.5",688,[308,1636,1159,577]]]'>Ms. Pierce arrived at the restroom and attempted to speak to Ms. Vrable, but received no response, but rather only whimpering and crying. When Principal Speck arrived and could not get a response from Ms. Vrable, she instructed her secretary to call 911. During this period of time, Principal Speck placed the school under “Code Blue,” a security code under which the school is essentially locked down. During Code Blue, classroom doors must remain closed and students are not permitted out of their classrooms. Furthermore, students are not permitted to be released to use the restrooms, to go to lunch, or to be dismissed from school.</p>

After being unable to gain entry to the restroom <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>and failing to get a response other than what Officer Wilson believed to be crying, he sought backup from the Rostraver police and directed that an EMS unit be sent to the school. The officers obtained a screwdriver to unlock the restroom door. Once the door was opened, the officers found Ms. Vrable unconscious, partially nude, seated on a toilet, and leaning against a wall. The officers found a large amount of mucous coming from Ms. Vrable’s nose and mouth and the sound which was thought to be crying was actually Ms. Vrable choking and attempting to breathe. The nurse and Officer Wilson placed Ms. Vrable on the floor in anticipation of performing CPR. Ultimately, Ms. Vrable was transported by the EMS to a local hospital. Evidently Ms. Vrable was transferred to the mental health unit on March 20, 2002 and was discharged on March 21, 2002.</p>
    <p id="b689-4" data-blocks='[["BL_689.4",689,[159,1168,1154,788]]]'>Police investigation of the incident uncovered that that there was a Fentanyl patch on Ms. Vrable’s back and that the patch caused an overdose. Criminal charges were filed against Ms. Vrable for possession of a controlled substance and for disorderly conduct. Subsequently, Ms. Vrable entered into a plea agreement by which she agreed to Probation Without Verdict on the charge of possession and the charge of disorderly misconduct was dismissed. Probation Without Verdict is a probationary program for first offenders accused of nonviolent possessory offenses. 35 P.S. § 780-117. No verdict is entered against the defendant and the case is deferred. Upon the successful completion of the terms of probation, the court dismisses the charges against the individual without an adjudication of guilt or a conviction. The possession charge was a misdemeanor.</p>

During this investigation, Ms. Vrable explained that prior to March 18th, her physicians had prescribed several medications for her use including Wellbutrin, Neurontin, Ultram, and Detrol. Ms. Vrable explained that on Sunday March 17, 2002, a friend had given her a Fentanyl patch which she had placed on her back prior to coming to school. Evidently, the Fenta<a id="p654" href="#p654" data-label="654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*654</a>nyl patch precipitated an adverse medical reaction which resulted in Ms. Vrable’s condition.</p>

On September 17, 2002, Mr. Paul informed her that the administration had intended to recommend to the Intermediate Unit’s Board of Directors that she be terminated from her employment. On September 24, 2002, the Board of Directors approved Ms. Vrable’s termination.</p>
    <p id="b690-5" data-blocks='[["BL_690.5",690,[318,847,1162,583]]]'>On April 4, 2002, the Association filed a grievance on behalf of Ms. Vrable alleging that the Intermediate Unit did not have just cause for her discharge. The grievance was denied and was submitted to arbitration pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the Intermediate Unit and the Association. A hearing was held on March 19, 2003 before Arbitrator Elliott Newman. The issue before Arbitrator Newman was whether the Intermediate Unit “had just cause under Appendix C, Section 9(b) [of the collective bargaining agreement] to discharge Ms. Vrable, and if not, what shall the remedy be?”</p>

Thus, this provision of the School Code was incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement between the parties. It also was the focus of the question of whether the Intermediate Unit had just cause to terminate Ms. Vrable. Before Arbitrator Newman, the <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>Intermediate Unit asserted that Ms. Vrable’s illegal possession and use of the Fentanyl patch, on March 18, 2002 at the school during school hours constituted “immorality” under Section 1122 of the Pennsylvania School Code.</p>

    <p id="b691-5" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[169,888,1155,734]]]'>Specifically, as recognized by Arbitrator Newman, “[w]hile there is always a temptation to simply pontificate on the evils of abuse of an improperly obtained prescription drug, including a controlled substance, what happened here was one and only one workplace incident in Ms. Vrable’s 23 years with the IU [Intermediate Unit] that reduced to its essence reflects very, very poor judgment.” Arb. Award at 7. While it was not right for Ms. Vrable to use the friend’s Fentanyl patch, “it does mean that one such incident in a span of 23 years would not be a course of conduct, and when viewed in a rational, detached and dispassionate manner, it would not violate the morals of the community.” <em>Id. </em>Thus, Arbitrator Newman concluded that the Intermediate Unit failed to establish just cause for the discharge.</p>

Reinstatement was conditioned upon: (1) satisfactory completion of the terms and conditions of her one-year probation period and (2) her participation in a Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program and her agreement to be bound by its conditions. Ms. Vrable was to abstain from all mood-altering drugs or chemical substances while on-duty for the school year. Moreover, at the Intermediate Unit’s discretion, Ms. Vrable was to be subjected to periodic, unannounced drug/alcohol screening and a positive result would result in immediate removal. Furthermore, Ms. Vrable was required to participate in a counseling and treatment program and to <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>consent to release information to the Intermediate Unit to allow reports of Ms. Vrable’s attendance at and progress in the monitored program. Any breach of the arbitration award would result in Ms. Vrable’s immediate dismissal for violation of this “last chance” agreement.</p>
    <p id="b692-4" data-blocks='[["BL_692.4",692,[309,611,1166,672]]]'>The Intermediate Unit appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County. The court found that Ms. Vrable’s conduct was the type that bore upon the employer’s discharge of its public function. As discussed more fully below, this analysis has become known as the “core functions” exception which looks at whether an arbitrator’s award impacts the core function of the public entity and would deprive the employer of its ability to discharge that function. <em>City of Easton v. AFSCME, Local 447, </em><a href="/pa/562/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="562 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="225988" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0438-01">562 Pa. 438</a>, <a href="/a2d/756/1107-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="756 A.2d 1107" data-case-ids="11244753,225988" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/1107-01,/pa/562/0438-01">756 A.2d 1107</a>, 1111-12 (2000). The court concluded that the award fell within this exception and vacated the arbitrator’s award. The Association appealed the trial court’s decision to the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b692-5" data-blocks='[["BL_692.5",692,[306,1314,1161,1058]],["BL_693.1",693,[165,334,1158,787]]]'>In a two-to-one decision, a panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed in an unpublished opinion. Specifically, the Commonwealth Court majority, in an opinion authored by Judge Bernard McGinley, first found that the arbitrator’s award was not rationally derived from the collective bargaining agreement. The majority offered that the proper standard of review of a grievance arbitration award is the essence test, i.e., whether in rendering an award, the arbitrator’s interpretation can rationally be derived from the collective bargaining agreement. Here, as noted by the court, the collective bargaining agreement between the parties prohibited the termination of an employee without just cause. Just cause, under the agreement, included any cause for termination applicable to professional employees found in Section 1122 of the Public School Code. The majority reasoned that one such valid cause for termination under the School Code was “immorality,” and immorality has been defined as “a course of conduct as offends the morals of the community and is a bad example to the youth whose ideals a teacher is supposed to foster and elevate.... ” <em>Kinniry v. Abington </em>

The Commonwealth Court majority concluded that the Intermediate Unit satisfied the elements to establish the offense of immorality. According to the majority, this led to the conclusion that the arbitrator’s award did not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. Furthermore, the majority offered that our Court has recognized the unique nature of a public employer and has applied the “core functions” exception to whether an arbitrator’s award is rationally derived from the collective bargaining agreement. The Commonwealth Court majority concluded that the trial court properly applied the core functions exception when it found that the conduct of Ms. Vrable fell within the conduct that impacted the Intermediate Unit’s ability to discharge its public function of educating children.</p>
    <p id="b693-4" data-blocks='[["BL_693.4",693,[160,1147,1157,842]]]'>Judge Dante Pellegrini dissented. According to the dissent, the arbitrator sustained the Association’s grievance finding that Ms. Vrable’s conduct did not rise to the level of immorality and thus, the Intermediate Unit lacked just cause for discharging Ms. Vrable. The dissent, noting the circumscribed nature of the essence test would have reversed the trial court as the arbitrator’s decision was rationally derived from the collective bargaining agreement. Moreover, the dissent concluded that the core functions exception would not apply as nothing in the case showed that the ability of the Intermediate Unit to carry out its ongoing responsibilities was compromised. Here, the one-time-foolish act did not impact the children in any way from receiving services. Importantly, the dissent suggested the possibility that the core functions exception could subsume the essence test if interpreted to permit relief in such situations.</p>

The Association raises three issues before our Court. First, the Association asks us to examine whether the lower tribunals erred in reversing the arbitrator’s award by failing to apply the deferential essence test. Second, the Association questions whether the lower tribunals erroneously applied the core functions exception to the essence test in vacating the <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>arbitrator’s award. Finally, and related thereto, the Association also inquires as to whether the Intermediate Unit waived its argument regarding the core functions exception when it failed to challenge the arbitrability of the grievance before the arbitrator. As these three issues are interrelated, we will address them together.</p>
    <p id="b694-4" data-blocks='[["BL_694.4",694,[317,660,1161,1168]]]'>The arguments of the parties are straightforward. The Association argues that the deferential essence test is the applicable standard of review of this matter and that Arbitrator Newman’s award passes this test. Specifically, the Association submits that the arbitrator’s ruling in this instance that a one-time error in judgment did not offend the community standards necessary to constitute immorality was proper, as was the imposition of reinstatement with a lengthy unpaid suspension and subjecting her re-employment to numerous conditions. According to the Association, the trial court, and Commonwealth Court’s reliance upon the core functions test as an exception to the essence test was improper as that test is inconsistent with a limited standard of review, unnecessary and inapplicable in the public education context, and thus, should be rejected. Even under that test, the Association maintains that the Intermediate Unit failed to demonstrate that the core function of the school was egregiously impacted. Finally, the Association offers that the core functions exception goes to the arbitrability of the dispute, and thus, Intermediate Unit failed to preserve the issue of whether the award was inconsistent with the core function of the school as it did not raise this exception before Arbitrator Newman.</p>

According to the Intermediate Unit, it retained absolute authority to terminate an employee whose conduct, here possessing and using a controlled substance at school, undermined its ability to discharge its public function, i.e., vacating the award was appropriate under the core functions exception. Furthermore, the Intermediate Unit submits that it adequately preserved for appeal the issue <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>of whether it lacked the capacity to bargain away its right to discharge an employee for acting in a way that impairs its ability to carry on its core function.</p>

As we explained in <em>State System of Higher Education (Cheyney University) v. State College and University Professional Association (PSEA-NEA), </em><a href="/pa/560/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="560 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="95778" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0135-01">560 Pa. 135</a>, <a href="/a2d/743/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="743 A.2d 405" data-case-ids="11487623,95778" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/0405-01,/pa/560/0135-01">743 A.2d 405</a>, 409-10 (1999), the resolution of disputes through arbitration is the keystone to workplace peace and stability between parties legally bound in a long-term relationship. In labor relations, arbitration is the preferred method of dispute resolution by parties of a collective bargaining agreement. The arbitration process eschews the lengthy, formal, expensive process that at times are indicative of the more formal dispute resolution process found in our courts. Unlike the judicial system, the parties themselves are the ones who chose the arbitrator who will resolve the dispute and who brings with him or her a familiarity of the unionized workplace. Indeed, the value of arbitration to resolve disputes in a collective bargaining relationship is made manifest by the General Assembly requiring the arbitration of disputes under PERA. 43 P.S. § 1101.903 (“The arbitration of disputes or grievances arising out of the interpretation of the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement is mandatory.”). Moreover, the General Assembly requires that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. <em><a href="/a2d/743/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="743 A.2d 405" data-case-ids="11487623,95778" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/0405-01,/pa/560/0135-01">Id.</a> </em>Therefore, final and binding arbitration is not only highly valued in labor relations for its speed, inexpensiveness and efficiency, it is required under PERA.</p>

While the core functions exception as articulated in <em>City of Easton </em>attempted to set forth such a standard, we find, for the reasons stated above, the core functions exception is insufficiently precise, and raises serious questions regarding the jurisdiction to utilize arbitration as well as concerns regarding the potentially limitless reach of the exception as stated. Rather, like our adoption of the federal essence test for purposes of PERA, we conclude that the federal public policy exception is appropriately applied to arbitrator’s awards arising under PERA as well. We believe that such a public policy exception constitutes a reasonable accommodation of the sometimes competing goals of dispute resolution by final and binding arbitration and protection of the public weal and is more consistent with our recent case law in this area. <em>Office of Housing and Community Development. </em>Thus, we reject the core functions exception to the essence test and supplant it with the public policy exception to the essence test.</p>

It is axiomatic, however, that certain questions regarding jurisprudential matters, such as the appropriate standard of judicial review, are rarely questioned by the parties, but are raised and decided by the courts themselves. Moreover, in this appeal both the Association and amicus Pennsylvania State Education Association put the exception to the essence test at issue by urging the rejection of the core functions test. These parties, however, offer no alternative standard of review. Thus, as acknowledged by the dissent, this would leave a potential void in our judicial review which this Court would be remiss not to address.

This is somewhat curious, as not only is this standard sufficiently precise to be embraced by the United States Supreme Court in this same area of the law, but the identical standard has roots in our own case law. <em>See, Eichelman v. Nationwide Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/551/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="551 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="507777" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0558-01">551 Pa. 558</a>, <a href="/a2d/711/1006-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="711 A.2d 1006" data-case-ids="11829726,507777" data-case-paths="/a2d/711/1006-01,/pa/551/0558-01">711 A.2d 1006</a>, 1008 (1998)(Castille, J.)("Public policy is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interest.”); <em>see also Burstein v.

Moreover, the dissent fails to sufficiently account for our two-year old decision in <em>Office of Housing and Community Development, </em>which employs just such an exception to the essence test to vacate an arbitrator’s award. Finally, the dissent’s alternative of review for whether an award is "manifestly unreasonable” is a standard that has been considered and rejected numerous times. <em>See Cheyney University; see also Greene County; Danville Area School District; Civil Service Commission (Toth). </em>The reason, as explained in these cases is plain — it is inconsistent with the deferential standard of review that is the essence test. Indeed, the dissent's suggestion that manifestly unreasonable review is more limited than the public policy exception reflects a basic misunderstanding of the circumscribed nature of the public policy exception. Consistent with the statutory mandate of final and binding arbitration, the public policy exception is narrower and more defined, being firmly grounded in our Commonwealth’s law, than the broader and less precise inquiry of whether an award is “manifestly unreasonable.”</p>

I believe that this language is, in essence, an acknowledgment that arbitration decisions are subject to judicial review where they are manifestly unreasonable. To allow review only where the arbitrator’s decision cannot be rationally derived from the collective bargaining agreement is too limiting and places unbridled discretion in the hands of individual arbitrators. The majority’s standard of review would allow an arbitrator’s decision to stand if it could be made under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement even if the decision was manifestly unreasonable under the facts of the case.
