For the reasons that follow, we conclude that a second-class township has the authority to condemn property under the Township Code, for any legitimate recreational purpose, despite the fact that the Lands Act does not extend the authority to take for open space purposes. However, we further conclude that the record evidence in this case does not support the conclusion of the trial court that the fundamental purpose behind the Township’s taking was recreation, and therefore, the taking is <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>invalid.

The farm was partitioned by stipulated order in 1998 into four parcels. On September 12, 2000 the Middletown Board of Supervisors held a public meeting at which they considered a request to approve a preliminary plan of major subdivision. The chairman of the board, Mel Kardos, expressed his concern that the smallest parcel would be developed. The Supervisors discussed this concern and finally decided to table action on the partition until they could set up a meeting with the owners of the farm to discuss the possibility of acquiring the land to prevent any development. Two weeks later, on September 26, 2000 another public meeting was held. Kardos motioned to authorize the Township to condemn the entire farm, as if it had never been partitioned, and the Board approved this motion. The Township then passed a resolution and filed a declaration of taking citing its authority under the Township Code at 53 P.S. § 65101 <em>et seq., </em>“to acquire a fee simple interest to the [farm] for recreation and open space purposes.” (Declaration of Taking). The next day Kardos spoke to the Bucks County Courier Times. Kardos stated that the Township wanted to acquire the farm to preserve it as open space, “We don’t want to kick Joe Stone off the farm or anything like that. If we’re successful in acquiring the farm, he can keep doing whatever he is doing on it. We just don’t want it to go to developers.” (Exhibit 10 of the Deposition of Mel Kardos).</p>

Moreover, the Township maintains that Stone has misstated the relevant inquiry by focusing on the fact that certain Township Supervisors expressed their opposition to development. Rather, according to the Township, the sole question is whether the Township could lawfully condemn for recreational purposes. The Township argues that this is exactly what it did, pursuant to a long-term plan laid out in the Parks, Recreation and Open Space Plan, and under the authority of the Township Code, which authorizes a taking for recreational purposes. The Township avers that it never purported to act under the Lands Act, and that the limitation on the power of second-class townships found within that act only apply when a government entity attempts to exercise eminent domain in carrying out the provisions of that act.

When this Court is faced with a question of statutory interpretation, we must adhere to the rules promulgated by the Statutory Construction Act in order to ascertain and effect the intent of the Legislature as conveyed by the statutory language. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of the statute is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). Here the language is clear. The Township Code gives power to second-class townships to condemn land for recreational purposes. The Lands Act withholds power from second-class townships to condemn land for open space purposes. The two statutes do not conflict. The fact that the Open Space Lands Act exempts second-class townships from eminent domain powers to further the purposes enumerated under the Lands Act simply means that second-class townships have no authority to invoke the Lands Act to condemn property. 32 P.S. § 5008(b). This has no effect on the ability of a second-class township to take for recreational purposes under the Township Code. 53 P.S. § 67201.</p>

The record reveals that the Township’s Plan was adopted in 1991 in response to a county Open Space Program. (Addendum to Plan at 7.)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Plan sets forth a list of new goals which were deemed “necessary.” Specifically the Plan stated that a necessary goal was to (1) <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>seek ways to acquire properties to preserve in open space as critical natural environment; (2) maintain and upgrade existing park and recreational facilities; and (3) protect the Township’s remaining valuable agricultural resources. (Middletown Township Resolution No. 98-08R.) It is significant that the Plan specifically discusses the acquisition of property for the purpose of preserving open space, whereas recreation is contemplated only for <em>existing </em>parks and facilities. The Plan then identifies agricultural resources, stating that, “The remaining farmland in Middletown is a productive resource, contributing to the local economy, maintaining groundwater recharge areas, providing scenic open space, and enhancing the diversity and character of the community.” (Plan at 4.) The Plan identifies four large farm tracts for “potential preservation,” including the Stone Farm. The Plan discusses the Stone farm exclusively in terms of its agricultural and open space value. (Plan at 10.) Notably, there is no proposed recreational use related specifically to the Stone property. Therefore, the Plan offers no support for the proposition that the Township’s fundamental purpose in exercising its eminent domain power was for the authorized purpose of recreation, and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>

The trial court found that the Township had no specific plan for the property, but that various recreational options had been considered. The trial court erred in deciding that these proffered options were proper and that they support an assertion that the true purpose of the taking was recreational. The first option mentioned, to allow Mr. Stone to continue to farm the land, would invalidate the taking because of the Fifth Amendment requirement that a condemnation serve a public purpose. To condemn the land so that Mr. Stone could commercially farm it, thereby reaping a profit from land owned and maintained by the Township, serves a purely private, and thus, unconstitutional interest. <em>See Winger, supra. </em>The stated intent of re-instituting the Celebration <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>of Lights crosses into unauthorized territory as well. The record reveals that the Board of Supervisors testified that they wanted to use a portion of the Farm to provide an alternative entrance in the event that they choose to resurrect a Celebration of Lights that was previously held in a neighboring park. (Dep. of Mel Kardos at 15-16; Dep. of Joseph Wenda at 16; Dep. of John Burke at 20.) However, the Township is limited to taking only what land is necessary to serve its purpose, and certainly 175 acres is excessive to meet the purpose of creating a second entrance to a neighboring park <em>if </em>the Township should decide that <em>in the future </em>it would like to reinstitute a town celebration there. <em>See Winger, supra.</em>

The record is devoid of any suggestion that the Township has considered, let alone created, such a plan. (Dep. of John Burke at 18-20; Dep. of Joseph Wenda at 30). As stated above, the record demonstrates that the Stone farm came to the attention of the Board of Supervisors at a public meeting due to a court order which partitioned the farm into four parcels. Discussion was centered on a concern that the smallest parcel would be developed, and the Board voted to condemn the entire property two weeks later. The next day the chair of the Board spoke to the Bucks County Courier Times, stating that although Mr. Stone would be free to continue farming the land, the Township wanted to acquire the farm to preserve it as open space in order to prevent its development. It is notable that the record reflects that at the time the Township Supervisors acted to invoke the power of eminent domain, they did not discuss the source of their authority to take or note that recreation was the primary purpose authorizing the decision to invoke the power of eminent domain.</p>

After construing the relevant provisions <em>in pan materia </em>and cognizant of the requirement that statutes granting the power of eminent domain must be construed strictly, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(4), I conclude that a township’s power to acquire land for recreational purposes under the Second Class Township Code <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>applies only to takings outside the ambit of the Open Space Lands Act.

The Open Space Lands Act and § 2201 of the Second Class Township Code both authorize governmental units to acquire property. The Second Class Township Code, simply and unambiguously provides, “The board of supervisors may ... acquire lands or buildings by lease, gift, devise, purchase or by the exercise of the right of eminent domain for recreational purposes and construct and equip facilities for recreational purposes.” 53 P.S. § 67201. The Open Space Lands Act is a more complex statute applicable to many types of governmental units; however, as it is relevant to this case, it empowers local governmental units to “acquire any interest in real property situate within its boundaries by purchase, contract, condemnation, gift, devise or otherwise.” 32 P.S. § 5005(c)(1). The General Assembly dictated a number of purposes for which governmental units may acquire property under the Open Space Lands Act, many of which are consistent with recreational purposes. 32 P.S. § 5005 (providing for the acquisition of property for the protection of natural or scenic resources, the protection of scenic areas for public visual enjoyment from public rights of way, and the preservation of sites of historic, geologic or botanic interest). The Open Space Lands Act however forbids local governmental units, such as second class townships, from “exercising the power of eminent domain in carrying out the provisions of this Act.” 32 P.S. § 5008.</p>

For example, the Open Space Lands Act will have little relevance to the acquisition of property for the construction of basketball and tennis courts or swimming pools, which would clearly fall under the grant of authority encompassed by the Second Class Township Code. <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>However, there are innumerable situations where open space and recreational purposes overlap. Clearly, many large parks would serve both recreational purposes under the Second Class Township Code by way of trails, lakes, and picnic areas, and yet serve the purposes of the Open Space Lands Act through the preservation of forests, watersheds, and natural and scenic resources. Indeed, the Township’s own Declaration of Taking exemplifies the overlap between the statutes: “The purpose of the condemnation is to acquire a fee simple interest to the [Farm] for recreation and open space purposes.” Declaration of Taking, R.R. at 24a. Accordingly, I conclude that the two statutes are <em>in pari materia, </em>at least as applied to second class townships’ exercise of the right of eminent domain, and thus must be construed as one cohesive statute, giving effect to all the provisions. 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1921(a), 1932.</p>
    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[307,1201,1164,523]]]'>The parties have presented conflicting arguments regarding which of the two statutes controls the situation at bar. Clearly, both statutes cannot apply to this situation because the application would result in contradictory outcomes. This Court simply cannot conclude that the law both authorizes and prohibits the exercise of eminent domain in this case. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (“[T]he General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.”). Accordingly, we must harmonize these provisions in a way that honors the legislative intent of both statutes.</p>

Unlike the Majority’s broad interpretation of the Second Class Township Code as encompassing “any legitimate recreational purpose,” Maj. Op. at 609, 939 A.2d at 333,1 conclude that the rules of statutory construction require a narrow interpretation of the term “recreational purposes” because it is a statute granting the power of eminent domain, which must be construed narrowly under 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(4). Accordingly, “recreational purposes” under the <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>Code’s grant of eminent domain authority must be defined in opposition to the situations where the legislature has expressly prohibited a township’s exercise of eminent domain under the Open Space Lands Act. Thus, “recreational purposes” under the Second Class Township Code are the subset of generic recreational purposes that do not overlap with open space purposes.</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.4",661,[160,701,1156,408]]]'>As the Township in this case expressed its desire to take the property for open space purposes, as well as recreational purposes, I would hold that the land falls outside the purview of the Second Class Township Code’s grant of the power of eminent domain for recreational purposes. Accordingly, I would conclude that the lower courts erred in applying the Second Class Township Code, and that the Township did not have legal authority to take the Farm.</p>

On appeal, the Commonwealth Court concluded, “The evidence supports the finding that the Township condemned the Property for recreational uses.
