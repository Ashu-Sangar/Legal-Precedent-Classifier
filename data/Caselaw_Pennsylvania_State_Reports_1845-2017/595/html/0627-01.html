    <p id="b667-6" data-blocks='[["BL_667.6",667,[176,613,1158,1387]]]'>We granted review in this healthcare subrogation case to address the following issues. First, whether a recipient of healthcare benefits paid by the Pennsylvania Employees Benefit Trust Fund (hereinafter “PEBTF” or “Appellant”) is contractually obligated, when challenging a subrogation claim and a termination of healthcare benefits, to exhaust internal appeals to PEBTF’s Board of Trustees prior to seeking recourse through filing an action for declaratory judgment with a court. Second, whether PEBTF’s right to subrogation against a healthcare recipient’s recovery from a third party tortfeasor accrues as of the date of the recipient’s injury, or on the date when PEBTF reimburses the healthcare recipient’s medical expenses. As will be discussed, if PEBTF’s right to subrogation accrued on the date of the injury, PEBTF would be entitled to subrogate over $35,000 in benefits it paid after January 1, 1998, when, as explained fully below, it ceased operating as an ERISA qualified plan. If, however, the right to subrogate accrued after it paid the healthcare recipient’s medical benefits, PEBTF could only subrogate the $186 it paid when it was an ERISA qualified plan. For the following reasons, we conclude that a recipient of healthcare benefits paid by PEBTF need not exhaust internal administrative remedies prior to filing suit, and that PEBTF’s right to subrogation only arises once PEBTF has paid the recipient’s medical benefits. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

Thereafter, Appellee’s medical bills were submitted to PEBTF for payment. In total, PEBTF paid $186.00 on behalf of Appellee through the end of 1997.</p>
    <p id="b669-5" data-blocks='[["BL_669.4",669,[164,619,1152,795]]]'>On January 1, 1998, PEBTF’s status changed from an ERISA qualified plan to a governmental plan, and, as such, it became subject to the anti-subrogation provision of the MVFRL. Shortly thereafter, Appellee filed a liability action against the third parties and, the following year, secured a settlement for an undisclosed sum. Upon learning of this settlement, PEBTF filed a subrogation claim against Appellee for $35,815.90, which represented the total benefits it had paid on Appellee’s behalf since January 1, 1998.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> However, Appellee refused to pay PEBTF on grounds that it was no longer entitled to seek subrogation. PEBTF then terminated Appellee’s benefits pursuant to a provision in PEBTF’s governing documents entitling it to terminate coverage if a healthcare recipient refuses to cooperate in the exercise of PEBTF’s subrogation rights.</p>
    <p id="b669-6" data-blocks='[["BL_669.5",669,[161,1442,1155,473]]]'>Appellee subsequently filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment against PEBTF in the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County, and requested that the court enter an order providing that any subrogation rights be limited to the $186 paid by PEBTF prior to January 1, 1998, when it was an ERISA qualified plan. Appellee also requested that the court order PEBTF to reinstate his benefits, reimburse him for medical expenses incurred subsequent to the termination of his benefits, and direct PEBTF to pay costs and counsel fees.</p>

In support of the former claim, PEBTF alleged that Appellee was contractually obligated under the Summary Plan Description and the Plan Document (collectively, “the plan documents”), which applied to his coverage, to appeal to PEBTF’s Board of Trustees as a prerequisite to filing the instant declaratory judgment action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In furtherance of the latter claim, PEBTF asserted that Appellee failed to state a valid cause of action because, in its view, its right to subrogation accrued on the date of the accident, when it was still an ERISA qualified plan permitted to seek subrogation, and not on the dates it paid Appellee’s benefits, when it was a governmental plan subject to the MVFRL’s anti-subrogation provision.</p>
    <p id="b670-5" data-blocks='[["BL_670.4",670,[318,1088,1161,525]]]'>Following a hearing, the trial court issued an opinion and order dismissing PEBTF’s preliminary objections and its petition to transfer venue, and directed that PEBTF file a responsive pleading to Appellee’s complaint within twenty days. Accordingly, PEBTF filed an answer and, after Appellee filed his reply, PEBTF filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and/or Summary Judgment, raising the identical issues and arguments it had raised in its preliminary objections. In response, Appellee filed an answer to this motion and a cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>

However, the court found these provisions inapplicable because the decision to terminate Appellee’s benefits in this case was not premised upon his eligibility or on the denial of a claim for benefits, but was based instead on his refusal to reimburse PEBTF.</p>
    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[176,770,1154,852]]]'>The trial court then turned to PEBTF’s claim that its subrogation rights accrued on the date of Appellee’s injury rather than on the date of payment. In this regard, the trial court, adopting the analysis it had used in denying PEBTF’s preliminary objections, noted that subrogation presupposes an actual payment by the party seeking to be subrogated. <em>See Hagans v. Constitution State Serv. Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/455/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="455 Pa.

Thus, according to the trial court, PEBTF’s right to subrogate to recover the $35,815.90 did not accrue until PEBTF actually paid Appellee’s medical benefits after January 1, 1998. Because this date was after PEBTF had relinquished its status as an ERISA qualified plan, the trial court concluded that PEBTF was subject to Section 1720 of the MVFRL and therefore not entitled to subrogate.</p>

    <p id="b672-5" data-blocks='[["BL_672.4",672,[309,510,1160,1158]]]'>The Superior Court next considered whether PEBTF was entitled to subrogation for the payments it made after its change in status on January 1, 1998, and noted that subrogation is an equitable doctrine that presumes the party seeking subrogation has actually made a payment in satisfaction of a debt or obligation to the subrogor. <em>See, e.g., Daley-Sand v.

In light of this principle, the court agreed with the trial court that PEBTF’s right to subrogation could not have accrued until after it had paid Appellee’s medical bills, which, as relevant here, followed PEBTF’s change in status to a governmental plan.

It is not a liability to pay, but an actual payment to the creditor, which raises the equitable right to be subrogated to his remedies....

    <p id="b682-5" data-blocks='[["BL_682.4",682,[315,459,1161,908]]]'>This well-established legal precedent is in accord with the equitable purposes that underlie the doctrine of subrogation. As noted above, subrogation is designed to enable a party that is secondarily liable, i.e., the subrogee, but who has paid the debt of the subrogor, to be made whole by allowing the subrogee to succeed to the benefit of any rights and securities that may be due to the subrogor by the party who is primarily liable. <em>See Paxton Nat’l Ins.

It would be inconsistent with the notion of substantial justice that underlies subrogation to hold that a subrogee such as PEBTF can succeed to the rights of a subrogor such as Appellee prior to having actually paid Appellee’s medical expenses. Accordingly, we reject PEBTF’s contention that a right to subrogation can accrue prior to actual payment by the subrogee in satisfaction of its obligation to the subrogor, and conclude that the Superior Court was not in error in relying on <em>Daley-Sand </em>and <em>Hagans </em>in its analysis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

As mentioned in the discussion above, these cases address a statutory amendment to Section 1720 of the MVFRL which altered an employer’s workers’ compensation carrier’s right to seek subrogation. <em>Gokalp, </em><a href="/pa/553/0452-02" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="719 A.2d 1033" data-case-ids="356233" data-case-paths="/pa/553/0452-02">719 A.2d at 1033-36</a>; <em>DePaul Concrete, </em><a href="/a2d/734/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="734 A.2d 481" data-case-ids="11544143" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0481-01">734 A.2d at 482</a>. In holding that the law in effect at the time of the injury controlled, both cases merely reiterated the general principle that subsequent legislation cannot retroactively affect a party’s substantive rights. In contrast, the instant case does not implicate a change in legislation, but addresses instead when a subrogation right accrues where there has been a change in the legal status of one of the parties over a period of time. PEBTF’s reliance on these cases is therefore misplaced.</p>

Because the relevant payments in the instant matter were made following PEBTF’s change in status from an ERISA qualified plan to a governmental plan, the anti-subrogation provision of the MVFRL, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1720 applies and, therefore, precludes PEBTF from subrogating against Appellee’s third party settlement.
