Until 1994, the District was controlled by an elected school board. In 1994, the District was declared financially distressed under 24 P.S. §§ 6-691-6-697 of the Code and an SBOC was appointed to manage and control the District. In 2000, the Education Empowerment Act (“EEA”), 24 P.S. §§ 17-1701-B-17-1716-B, was enacted into the Code. At that time, the EEA required that districts certified as <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>financially distressed and having low academic scores for three years should be deemed “Education Empowerment Districts” and would be controlled by an Education Empowerment Board of Control. 24 P.S. § 17-1705-B(h)(4), <em>amended by </em>Act 187, <em>see </em>Pa.

The current SBOC for the District was then established under Section 692. Appellant Gillin was an original member, Appellant Nunn was appointed as a replacement for another member, Adrienne M.

Initially, the Commonwealth Court granted a peremptory judgment in the nature of mandamus, requiring Appellants to comply with the Code, and denying preliminary injunctive relief and the Department’s alternative request to <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>appoint a receiver.

Appellants contended that the Department could not seek and the Commonwealth Court could not grant an equitable remedy outside the Code. Furthermore, according to Appellants, Judge Colins violated the separation of powers doctrine, Article III, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, when he concluded that jurisdiction was proper because “the legislative scheme that has created the SBOC has been a marked failure,” and thus, it was up to the courts to remedy the failure. <em>See </em>Memorandum Opinion and Order, dated October 16, 2006, at 46-47.

The Department also pointed out that Appellants were not challenging the validity or effectiveness of the Declaration, but contended that even if they were, the Secretary was vested with discretion to make such a declaration under Section 692 of the Code and that such declaration had the effect of dissolving the SBOC.

Instead, this Court agrees with Appellants that they have standing to litigate the issue of whether the SBOC was dissolved by the Declaration and the related action of the Commonwealth Court on April 16th to substitute the Empowerment Board for Appellants on pending litigation. Under Section 692 of the Code, appointees to the SBOC (Appellants) are appointed for a five-year term. Section 692 also provides that appointees can be removed for misfeasance or malfeasance. In this case, however, the appointees’ five-year term was terminated prematurely when the Secretary of Education issued its Declaration without a finding of malfeasance or misfeasance. Accordingly, Appellants interest in challenging the Declaration surpasses that of the common interest of all citizens, the Declaration caused harm to their interest, and the Declaration had an immediate impact on their interests; and Appellants have standing for the limited purpose of challenging the manner in which the dissolution occurred, i.e., the Secretary’s action in issuing the Declaration, and the validity of such a Declaration to the extent preserved below.</p>

Moreover, by the scheme set forth in Sections 691 and 692, it is clear that the Legislature gave the Secretary nearly sole discretion and control over the financial distress process. Any involvement by the judiciary in the financial distress process is extremely limited — the courts step in only to make appointments upon <em>petition by </em>the Deputy Secretary of Education or his or her designated representative. Thus, the court’s involvement in the financial distress process comes only <em>after </em>it has been petitioned to do so by the Secretary’s representative. Clearly, <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>the Secretary retains primary control of the financial distress process. Indeed, Judge Colins recognized as much in an earlier opinion in this litigation when he stated unequivocally that “courts should not be running school districts.” <em>See </em>Memorandum opinion and Order of Commonwealth Court, October 16, 2006, at 46. Accordingly, in light of the deference to be given to an agency’s interpretation of statutes, the fact that the Department of Education is to administer the Code, and the broad discretion granted to the Secretary under the financial distress statutes, this court concludes that the Secretary was authorized to make the Declaration under Section 692 that “the period necessary to reestablish sound financial structure in the district” had elapsed. Furthermore, by virtue of the Declaration, the SBOC was dissolved, as the District was no longer governed under the financial distress part of the Code. Finally, Appellants’ suggestion that SBOC members can only be removed by the Secretary for malfeasance or misfeasance is absurd, since such an interpretation would essentially give the SBOC appointees a five-year vested term even if a school district has returned to financial soundness.</p>

The parties dispute whether the District was ever a party to this litigation. Appellants argue that the District was a party when the Department filed the original Petition for Review in this matter, whereas the Department points out that the District was never a named party in this matter. Instead, the Department contends that the only named parties were the SBOC and its members. The Department's argument appears sound, since the Petition for Review filed by the Department reflects that the Department sought relief solely against the Board and its members. <em>See, e.g., </em>Petition for Review, at 25 (seeking a judgment of mandamus requiring appointees in their capacities as members of the SBOC to comply with various sections of the Code) and 26 (requesting that the Commonwealth Court enter a judgment enjoining the SBOC from further violating the Code). Likewise, the District was not named as a Respondent in the caption of that filing. Thus, we agree with the Department that the only Appellants before us are the SBOC and its appointees.</p>

The record reveals nothing so much as the bitter acrimony that has characterized the proceedings below, and discloses no prior interpretation supporting the position now forwarded by the Secretary. The parties’ agendas do not concern me, nor should they, but privileging the Department’s interpretation of the Code under such circumstances is to put a thumb on the scales of justice based not on the soundness of the parties’ argument but rather their identities. <em>See id. </em>at 212 (“Deference to what appears to be nothing more than an agency’s convenient litigating position would be entirely inappropriate.”).</p>

Sections 6-691 and 6-692 of the Code plainly vest the Secretary with discretion to create an SBOC when he deems it necessary following a “proper investigation of the district’s financial condition.” Notably, even where the Secretary of Education finds one or more of the seven criteria listed in § 6-691 to be satisfied, the Code merely authorizes — but does not require— the Secretary, in his judgment, to form an SBOC. Nothing could more clearly demonstrate the General Assembly’s intent to grant the Secretary of Education broad discretion to identify and address non-functioning school districts than a statute that depends so heavily for its effectuation on the Secretary’s judgment.</p>

Const. art. VI, § 7 (“Appointed civil officers ... may be removed at the pleasure of the power by which they shall have been appointed.”). While it is true that § 6-692 prohibits mid-term removal of SBOC members except upon “clear and convincing evidence of malfeasance or misfeasance in office,” it also provides that an SBOC will assume control of a school district “during the period necessary to reestablish a sound financial structure in the district.” It cannot be the case that an SBOC must remain convened for as many as five years beyond its necessity. Moreover, there is no reason why dissolution of an SBOC <em>in toto </em>should require more or less than its creation when the Code does not so provide. The determination of when a “sound financial structure” has been restored to an afflicted school district must lie, as does the prior authority to convene an SBOC, with the Secretary.</p>
