Appellant faced Mr. Havens while pointing a stainless steel revolver at him, as his cohort approached him from behind. Mr. Havens surrendered his wallet and keys to Appellant, who then ordered Mr. Havens into the car and threatened to kill him when Mr. Havens initially hesitated. Mr. Havens sat in the backseat, and Appellant sat in the front seat, facing and pointing his gun at Mr. Havens while Appellant’s cohort drove. Appellant repeatedly demanded cash from Mr. Havens, and when he found the cash Mr. Havens had on hand unsatisfactory, he threatened to shoot Mr. Havens unless he withdrew more cash from an automatic teller machine. Mr. Havens, however, convinced Appellant that he had no available cash in his bank account, so Appellant and his cohort abandoned him on the side of a road and drove off.</p>

On automatic direct appeal, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 722(4) and 9711(h)(1), this Court affirmed in an Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court. <em>Natividad I, </em>at 181. Writing for the Court, then-justice, now Chief Justice Cappy found the evidence sufficient to support the first-degree murder conviction, and rejected Appellant’s guilt-phase claims that the trial court should have suppressed Mr. Havens’s photographic identification of Appellant, the trial court should not have permitted Mr. Smith’s attorney to testify, and the evidence was insufficient to support a robbery conviction for the gas station incident. Regarding Appellant’s penalty-phase claims, Mr. Justice Cappy concluded that Pennsylvania Sentencing Code subsections 9711(a)(2) and (c)(2), which permit victim-impact statements, are constitutional pursuant to the then-recent holding in <em>Commonwealth v.

The opinion also found that the Commonwealth gave Appellant sufficient notice of its intent to present victim-impact testimony, the trial court’s penalty-phase instructions regarding aggravating factors, mitigating factors, and victim-impact evidence were proper, and the evidence was sufficient to support the aggravating factors. Mr. Justice Zappala, joined by Mr. Justice Flaherty, dissented because he found the presentation of victim-impact evidence unconstitutional. Mr. Justice Nigro filed a separate, dissenting opinion, concluding also that the presentation of victim-impact evidence was unconstitutional, but also finding that the Commonwealth failed to give adequate notice of its intent to introduce victim-impact testimony. Mr. Justice Saylor concurred in the result.</p>

In fact, the unique nature of penalty-phase hearings for capital convictions requires jurors to consider carefully only those factors set forth by the Legislature by way of statute. <em>See Chambers, </em><a href="/pa/528/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="528 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1829794" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0558-01">599 A.2d at 644</a>. Thus, when a prosecutor exhorts a jury to impose the death penalty based on biblical or other religious writings, he invites the jurors to consider factors outside of those specifically established by our Legislature, and in a manner that is considered to have the unavoidable effect of prejudicing their minds to impose the death penalty. We are not confronted with such a situation here, where the prosecutor referenced God during guilt-phase closing arguments, and Appellant does not argue, nor can he reasonably do so, that the statements prejudicially impacted his convictions. Accordingly, we decline to extend <em>Chambers’s per se </em>rule to guilt-phase closing arguments.</p>

It is true that these instructions did not specifically identify malice as that element which self-defense would specifically negate. Nonetheless, it defies logic that Appellant could have incurred prejudice when the trial court instructed that the Commonwealth must disprove Appellant’s claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, and further that self-defense is a complete defense to the overall charge of murder. Simply put, if the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant’s actions were not in self-defense, then the jury could not find him guilty of the overall charge of murder, thus rendering the effect of self-defense on malice irrelevant.

As such, Appellant’s situation is markedly different from that in <em>(Reginald) Hall </em>because he offers no other evidence that Mr. Campbell was about to engage in illegal activity other than his own claim of self-defense and Mr. Campbell’s possession of a gun. Moreover, because he is alleging counsel’s ineffectiveness in failing to investigate the licensing status of Mr. Campbell’s firearm, Appellant must prove not only that the trial court would have admitted this evidence, but also that this evidence would have resulted in a different outcome. <em>See Strickland, </em><a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">466 U.S. at 694</a>, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">104 S.Ct. 2052</a> (holding that prejudice occurs when “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different”); <em>see also Pierce, supra. </em>In the context of the trial evidence, Appellant fails to develop any claim of prejudice. Despite his insistence that the evidence would have supported his claim of self-defense, he does not contest this Court’s finding on direct appeal that the unlicensed gun was snapped in Mr. Campbell’s holster at the time of the shooting. In fact, his mere assertion that Mr. Campbell’s possession of an unlicensed firearm “establish[ed] criminal conduct on the part of the deceased” would not only fall far short of the standards for a permissive inference, but would have almost no probative value to his self-defense claim, as he obviously was not aware of the fact that the gun was unlicensed and thus could not link the unlicensed status with any alleged fear of death or serious bodily injury. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 505(b)(2) (limiting use of deadly force for self-defense); Pa.R.E. 401, 402 (permitting admission of evidence only if it exhibits “any tendency to make <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence”); <em>see also </em>Pa.R.E. 404(b)(3) (forbidding admission of wrong-acts evidence in criminal case unless probative value outweighs potential for prejudice). Accordingly, Appellant fails to develop the requisite prejudice at the guilt-phase of trial by counsel’s failure to investigate this claim, and thus fails to prove that trial counsel was ineffective.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

In point of fact, the <em>Boyde </em>Court found that the instruction at issue there was “ambiguous and therefore subject to an erroneous interpretation.” <em><a href="/us/494/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="494 U.S. 370" data-case-ids="4909" data-case-paths="/us/494/0370-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/494/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="494 U.S. 370" data-case-ids="4909" data-case-paths="/us/494/0370-01">at 380</a>, <a href="/us/494/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="494 U.S. 370" data-case-ids="4909" data-case-paths="/us/494/0370-01">110 S.Ct. 1190</a>. Although Appellant claims that the instant instruction is not ambiguous, he argues only that it implies a presumption of a death sentence. Thus, he is, in actuality, arguing that it was subject to an erroneous interpretation of presuming a sentence of death, which triggers the <em>Boyde </em>Court’s “reasonable probability” test. <em>See <a href="/us/494/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="494 U.S. 370" data-case-ids="4909" data-case-paths="/us/494/0370-01">id.</a></em>

In the context of the entire jury instruction, the instruction at issue, which required only a written notation of the statutorily-mandated reason for imposing a life sentence, did not actually “conflict” with the clear and overwhelming instructions pertaining to the heightened burden of proof and unanimous votes necessary to impose a sentence of death, and also of the lower burden of proof and fewer number of votes necessary to find mitigating factors. <em>See Marinelli, </em>910 A.2d at 682-84.</p>

Therefore, even if Appellant is correct in arguing that the trial court impermissibly narrowed the focus of mitigating factors to only those relevant to the murder itself, the jury would appear to have ignored that instruction by finding his difficult family background as a mitigator.

Appellant objects to the instruction that malice may be inferred where there is “intentional use without legal excuse or legal justification of a deadly weapon on a vital part of another human body.” N.T., 11/10/97, at 101. According to Appellant, the jurors were permitted to find malice even if they believed he acted in “unreasonable but sincere self-defense,” Amended PCRA Petition at 26, thus lowering the Commonwealth’s burden of disproving his self-defense claim. However, we must consider the court’s charge to the jury as a whole to determine whether Appellant’s isolated concern was prejudicial. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Our examination reveals that while the trial court's malice instruction did not clearly state whether the jury may infer malice if it finds unreasonable but sincere self-defense as long as it finds intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim, the court’s subsequent instruction on voluntary manslaughter rejected that possibility:</p>
      <blockquote id="b251-7" data-blocks='[["BL_251.7",251,[276,1716,1086,195]]]'>If you find that at the time of the killing the defendant believed the circumstances to be such that if they existed would have justified the killing, <em>but his belief was unreasonable, </em>and if you believe that as a result thereof he intentionally or knowingly killed [the victim], then your verdict <em>should be </em>guilty of voluntary manslaughter.</blockquote>

Furthermore, the court’s instructions thoroughly informed the jury of the elements of first-degree murder, and Appellant provides no support for his assertion that a court must specifically label each element as "an element.” Additionally, we find no error with the court's instruction, which was almost <em>verbatim </em>from Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Jury Instruction (Crim.) 7.01(2), on reasonable doubt: "It is the Commonwealth that always has the burden of proving each and every element of each of the crimes charged and that the defendant is guilty of those crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.” N.T., 11/10/97, at 97.

Mr. Chief Justice Cappy concurred, joined by Mr. Justice Baer, finding the claims waived for failure to allege trial counsel's ineffectiveness properly, and therefore disagreed with addressing the merits of the claim. <em><a href="/pa/585/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="187" data-cite="888 A.2d 624" data-case-ids="2473196,8997708" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0144-01,/a2d/888/0624-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/585/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="187" data-cite="888 A.2d 624" data-case-ids="2473196,8997708" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0144-01,/a2d/888/0624-01">at 690</a> (Cappy, C.J., concurring).

    <p id="b276-11" data-blocks='[["BL_276.11",276,[308,1214,1159,634]]]'>I concur in the result of the majority opinion for the reasons set forth more fully in my concurring opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Marinelli, </em><a href="/pa/589/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="189" data-cite="589 Pa. 682" data-case-ids="2574600" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0682-01">589 Pa. 682</a>, <a href="/pa/589/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="190" data-cite="910 A.2d 672" data-case-ids="2574600,8448803" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0682-01,/a2d/910/0672-01">910 A.2d 672</a>, 689-90 (2006). As the majority points out, this case does not involve any “layered” claims of ineffectiveness. Thus, there is no need to consider the case law analyzing “layered” claims and the analysis in this case is controlled by <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="191" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="192" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a> (1987). For this reason, I respectfully disassociate myself from the majority’s proffered alternative analyses. As I stated in <em>Marinetti, </em>“either Appellant has raised his claims in a manner sufficient for review under <em>Pierce </em>or they are waived.” <a href="/pa/589/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="193" data-cite="910 A.2d 672" data-case-ids="2574600,8448803" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0682-01,/a2d/910/0672-01">910 A.2d at 690</a>.</p>
