    <p id="b211-5" data-blocks='[["BL_211.5",211,[208,465,1155,689]]]'>In this appeal by allowance we are asked to resolve the issue of whether the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (the “MVFRL”), 75 Pa.C.S. § 1701-1799.7, mandates the “stacking” of uninsured/underinsured (“UM/UIM”) motorist coverage under a commercial fleet policy. The concept of stacking relates to the ability to add coverages from other vehicles and/or different policies to provide a greater amount of coverage available under any one vehicle or policy. <em>McGovern v. Erie Insurance Group, </em><a href="/a2d/796/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="796 A.2d 343" data-case-ids="9437894" data-case-paths="/a2d/796/0343-01">796 A.2d 343</a> (Pa.Super.2002). As explained in greater detail below, we hold that the MVFRL does not mandate the stacking of UM/UIM coverage under a commercial fleet policy. Thus, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b211-6" data-blocks='[["BL_211.6",211,[207,1178,1155,473]]]'>The relevant facts underlying this appeal are not contested. On July 26, 2001, Robert E. Everhart (“Everhart”) died following an automobile accident in Erie County, Pennsylvania in which Everhart’s vehicle was struck by another vehicle operated by Karen Anne Stellmach. At the time of the accident, Everhart was President and CEO of the Northwest Division of Russell Standard Corporation (“Russell Standard”). At the time of the accident, Everhart was operating a 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe, which was leased by Russell Standard.</p>

Russell Standard was the named insured on the policy. The PMA policy at issue is “Business Automobile Policy” number 1500007089857. On the first page of the common policy declarations, Russell Standard is listed as the sole named insured.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the time of the accident, the policy covered Russell Standard’s three hundred twenty-three vehicles, including thirty-three passenger vehi<a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>cles such as the one driven by Everhart. Although the PMA policy provided Russell Standard with $1,000,000 in liability coverage, the UM/UIM coverage was reduced to only $35,000. As a matter of course, PMA does not offer stacked UM/UIM coverage to commercial insureds. As such, no waiver of stacked UM/UIM coverage was made by Russell Standard.</p>

Everhart and Christine Yost, as administrators of Mr. Everhart’s estate (the “Estate”) collected the policy limits from Infinity Insurance Company, which insured the Stellmach vehicle. Thereafter, the Estate sought UIM motorist coverage. The Estate filed a declaratory judgment action against PMA, seeking clarification that the Russell Standard policy provided Everhart with stacked UIM coverage based on the thirty-three private passenger vehicles in the Russell Standard fleet. Thus, the Estate contended that the available limit of UIM coverage is $35,000 multiplied by thirty-three, or $1,155,000. After all pleadings were filed and discovery was completed, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.</p>
    <p id="b212-5" data-blocks='[["BL_212.5",212,[307,1370,1160,470]]]'>The trial court granted PMA’s motion and denied the Estate’s motion. The trial court concentrated on the fact that Russell Standard was the named insured. Russell Standard, as the named insured, was the only class one insured, and in reliance upon precedent establishing that only a class one insured may stack coverage, the trial court concluded that this effectively precluded Everhart from benefiting from stacked coverage. The Estate appealed the trial court’s decision to the Superior Court.</p>

    <p id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[203,679,1153,202]]]'>We granted the Estate’s petition for allowance of appeal to determine, <em>inter alia, </em>whether Section 1738 mandates the stacking of UM/UIM motorist coverage provided in a commercial fleet policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[200,905,1154,782]]]'>The Estate argues that pursuant to Section 1738 of the MVFRL all policies of insurance are required to provide for stacking of UM/UIM motorist coverage unless a valid waiver is executed by the named insured. The PMA policy does not contain a valid waiver of stacking and as Russell Standard did not execute such a waiver, stacking of UM/UIM motorist coverage exists. The Estate offers that the Superior Court decision, which rested upon its decision in <em>Miller, </em>was in error because Section 1738 was enacted after <em>Miller </em>was decided and the language of that statute draws no distinction between commercial and non-commercial policies. As the statute does not provide any exceptions for commercial policies, the Estate submits that the General Assembly intended that absent waiver, the requirement of stacking apply to all policies, commercial and non-commercial alike.</p>
    <p id="b213-6" data-blocks='[["BL_213.6",213,[199,1719,1152,469]],["BL_214.1",214,[312,335,1164,475]]]'>PMA, along with Meyer &amp; Eckenrode Insurance Group, the independent insurance agents from whom Russell Standard purchased the coverage, and Russell Standard, (collectively, the “Insurers”) contend that the Superior Court reached the correct decision. First, the Insurers point out the practical differences between commercial fleet policies and non-commercial policies, and urge our Court to give effect to the intent of these sophisticated parties as expressed in the policy language upon which they agreed, i.e., that neither Russell <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>Standard nor PMA expected the policy to provide an employee with stacked UM/UIM coverage, and that no premiums were paid for stacked UM/UIM coverage. According to the Insurers, a determination that stacking was provided here would increase premiums and such increase would be passed on to insureds. Finally, the Insurers assert that the enactment of Section 1738 did not herald any change in the law then existing under Miller; because Section 1738 does not address fleet policies.</p>

Indeed, the statute is utterly silent as to whether stacking is mandated in this unique context. Moreover, ascertain language employed by the Legislature indicates, the General Assembly intended to <em>exclude </em>commercial fleet policies from its purview. Specifically, subsection (d) provides the required form for the waiver of stacking. It states, in relevant part: “By signing this waiver, I am rejecting stacked limits of uninsured motorist coverage under the policy for myself and members of my household. ...” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1738(d)(l)(emphasis supplied). Likewise, the statute provides the same language for waiving stacked underinsured coverage. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1738(d)(2).

As expressed by the Superior Court in <em>Miller, </em>“[o]ne of the most common reasons for denying stacking of fleet policies is that such policies potentially cover a multitude of vehicles.

I find further support for this construction by reading the various provisions of the subject statute, as they must be read, <em>in pari materia. </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1932. While Section 1702(1) standing alone could be read to include all individuals identified by name anywhere in the policy, raising questions about the importance of Everhart’s inclusion by name on the endorsements described above, this becomes impossible when read in the light provided by Section 1702(2). In Section 1702(2), the Legislature explains that the "individual” in Section 1702(1) is in fact the "named insured.” Section 1702(2) also limits which human beings are to be accorded the status of "insured” vis a vis their relationship with the "named insured” described in Section 1702(1). No human being could ever fall within Section 1702(2) if Section 1702(1) was meant by the Legislature to include the corporate form; a corporation has neither a household nor resident relatives.</p>

This concurring opinion is driven by my reading of the language of Sections 1702 and 1738 of the MVFRL, rather than either an interpretation of a policy goal, as explained above, or the imputation of expectations upon commercial insureds and their insurers.</p>
