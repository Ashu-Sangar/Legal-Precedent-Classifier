By way of contrast, the Commonwealth Court majority referenced <em>Township of Lower Merlon v.

The <em>QED </em>
      <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>court found that the tax was not properly imposed because the company in that matter had not availed itself of the “privilege of having a base of operations in the taxing jurisdiction.” <em>V.L.

Therefore, the majority determined that Rendina “was merely doing work within the city, and the [construction] project was an isolated transaction within Harrisburg city limits, albeit a rather long-term transaction, and [Rendina] did not routinely do business in Harrisburg.” <em><a href="/a2d/859/0888-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="859 A.2d 888" data-case-ids="9163808" data-case-paths="/a2d/859/0888-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/859/0888-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="859 A.2d 888" data-case-ids="9163808" data-case-paths="/a2d/859/0888-01">at 892</a>.

Additionally, the City maintains that the facts of <em>QED </em>are distinguishable from those of the present case because, in that matter, the taxpayer did not maintain a presence in the taxing municipality; rather, it merely made an initial visit to the job site to determine the work to be completed and sign a contract with the property owner, and thereafter subcontracted all of the building work to various subcontractors, one of which acted as a liaison between QED and the other subcontractors.</p>

      <em>Gilberti, </em>however, should not be read as establishing a broader judicial rule that is not supported by the plain language of the LTEA and derivative ordinances and regulations.

Here, moreover, in contrast to <em>Gilberti, </em>the City is not taxing Rendina on activities occurring outside of its jurisdiction; rather, it is taxing activities occurring wholly inside its boundaries. Thus, the factors in <em>Gilberti </em>pertaining to the relation of a company’s base of operations to its entire business enterprise are not necessary to establish Rendina’s nexus to activities occurring in Harrisburg. The nexus for taxing those activities is established by Rendina’s presence in the City— specifically, the Keystone Building job site — and in this respect, it does not depend on the presence of a base of operations to which other commercial activities may be attributed. Put differently, although <em>Gilberti </em>found that the taxpayer’s maintenance of an in-city base of operations from which it directed extra-territorial activities was a <em>sufficient </em>condition to permit taxation of such activities (so long as they were attributable to the operational base), it does not follow that the existence of such an office is a <em>necessary </em>condition for the <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>taxation of business activities that occur wholly inside of the taxing municipality’s boundaries.</p>

There is no present disagreement that the LTEA permits local taxation of gross receipts from a long-term construction project taking place inside the jurisdictional limits of the taxing municipality. Thus, the question distills to whether the building project falls within the definition of “Business” contained in the City’s business privilege tax. That issue must be resolved based upon the text of the local implementing scheme — Ordinance 31 together with its associated regulations — independent of the prior judicial use of abstract nomenclature in situations not implicated by this case.</p>

Further, these same regulations reaffirm that the tax at issue is intended to reach the “carrying on or exercising of any trade, profession, or other commercial activity,” and that “[i]t is not necessary to be a resident of the City, or to have an office or place of business within the City, to be doing business in the City.” <em><a href="/pa/579/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="856 A.2d 789" data-case-ids="1370942,9212266" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0463-01,/a2d/856/0789-01">Id.,</a> </em>§§ 201, 203.

In this regard, the court drew a distinction between a transaction, which it construed to be an “isolated incident,” and the carrying on of a business, which it deemed to reflect an ongoing, regular course of activities. <em>See Rendina, </em><a href="/a2d/859/0888-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="859 A.2d 888" data-case-ids="9163808" data-case-paths="/a2d/859/0888-01">859 A.2d at </a>892 n. 5 (“The ‘privilege’ of doing business within a locality implies that a potential taxpayer has hung its shingle and portrayed itself in the community as an entity conducting business within the taxing locality on a regular, permanent basis.”). In drawing this distinction, the Commonwealth Court relied on language from <em>Gilberti </em>that distinguished between transaction taxes and business privilege taxes. Specifically, <em>Gilberti </em>determined that any LTEA-based transaction tax' levied by Pittsburgh as to commercial transactions occurring wholly outside of Pittsburgh would be <em>ultra vires, </em>as the act only enabled Pittsburgh “to tax transactions ‘within the limits’ of the City.” <em>Gilberti, </em><a href="/pa/511/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="511 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1798653,1798716" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0100-01,/pa/511/0100-02">511 Pa. at 105</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="511 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1798653,1798716" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0100-01,/pa/511/0100-02">511 A.2d at 1324</a> (quoting 53 P.S. § 6902).

In this respect, we note that, in authorizing local taxes on such things as “transactions,” “privileges,” and “occupations,” the General Assembly used terms that are broad, overlapping, arid imprecise, and thus, its intention appears to have been to permit local governments to capture a broad <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>range of commercial activity. <em>See generally Gilberti, </em><a href="/pa/511/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="511 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1798653,1798716" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0100-01,/pa/511/0100-02">511 Pa. at </a>104 n. 1, <a href="/pa/511/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="511 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1798653,1798716" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0100-01,/pa/511/0100-02">511 A.2d at </a>1323 n. 1 (recognizing that the LTEA represents a “substantial reenactment of the so-called ‘Tax Anything Act’” of 1947) (citing <em>F.J.

It additionally serves to advance the enactment’s underlying policy of allowing for taxation as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for businesses advantaging themselves of local governmental benefits, including the availability of police, fire, and other services.

To the extent we would be constrained by the parties’ arguments in this regard, we find Senior Judge Kelley’s dissent from the majority holding of the Commonwealth Court persuasive. <em>See V.L.

In particular, we do not believe that the holdings of <em>Gilberti </em>or <em>Northwood </em>should be read to foreclose the straightforward recognition that the maintenance in a taxing jurisdiction of a job-site trailer for a major, long-term construction project represents commercial activity relying on the privilege to do business afforded by the municipality. We do note, however, that the issue of the sufficiency of the job site trailer cannot be resolved as such without inevitably begging the preliminary question of whether any base of operations was required for Rendina’s activities to come within the City’s business privilege tax in the first instance. As clarified above, we do not construe the LTEA or Ordinance 31 to impose such a requirement, and we are reluctant to fashion a rule of law in the present matter — which would bind other Pennsylvania municipalities having similarly-worded tax ordinances — premised upon the existence of such a requirement merely because the City has not advocated the position that no intra-jurisdictional base of operations is necessary.</p>

In this light, the Commonwealth Court's distinction between taxing transactions and taxing the “privilege” of conducting business appears to depend for its coherence on its understanding that a company only exercises the privilege of doing business in a particular locale if it lias a base of operations there.

The Majority is too hasty, however, to cast aside aspects of that ruling with broader implications, especially given that we lack the customary adversarial briefing for and against such a decision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> In particular, this Court in <em>Gilberti </em>spoke of and acted upon the need to distinguish the different forms of taxation authorized by the LTEA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Focusing on the operation of the tax, rather than how the taxing jurisdiction styled it, the Court found the levy in question unsustainable as a transaction tax but deemed it a permissible exercise of the authority bestowed by the LTEA to tax receipts attributable to an exercise of the privilege of maintaining a “base of operations” within the taxing jurisdiction.</p>

Indeed, were that all the privilege required, a business privilege tax would be indistinguishable from a transaction tax. To so conflate the two, the Court concluded, would be unsound in light of the General Assembly’s choice of language in enabling local jurisdictions to assess distinct categories of taxation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> In so doing, the Court emphasized the LTEA’s language restricting the imposition of any of the enumerated taxes to activity occurring “within the limits of such political subdivisions.” <em>Id. </em>at 1323 (quoting 53 P.S. § 6902). As a corollary to this restriction, which the Court properly construed strictly in favor of the putative taxpayer, <em>see Fischer v.

      <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>at 1824-26. This analysis seems to me consistent with the language of the LTEA. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921 (requiring us, where possible, to construe statutes to give effect to all of their provisions, and denying us the prerogative to disregard the letter of the law in pursuit of its spirit).</p>

The Majority disagrees, and in so doing undermines material aspects of the <em>Gilberti </em>analysis. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 414-15, 938 A.2d at 993 (rejecting the “base of operations” terminology as a “construct” not rooted in the LTEA), 10 (calling for this Court to disregard its prior “use of abstract nomenclature” in favor of Harrisburg’s interpretation of its own taxing ordinance). For all the reasons enumerated by the Commonwealth Court, <em>see V.L. Rendina, Inc., v.

Accordingly, were Harrisburg’s tax strictly structured as a tax upon the privilege of doing business in that jurisdiction, as understood in <em>Gilberti, </em>I would agree with the Commonwealth Court and with Appellee that the levy before us could not be sustained.</p>

As in <em>Gilberti, </em>I believe that we must also consider whether the tax in question, by whatever name, is sustainable as a duly enacted instance of one of the other forms of taxation authorized by the LTEA. The LTEA, of course, did not restrict Harrisburg to imposing any one form of taxation at a time, or preclude it from creating a hybrid tax designed to reach multiple forms of business activity. Although the Harrisburg ordinance uses the words “business privilege” it does so as <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>part of a compound title identifying the tax provision in question as a “Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax.” <em>See </em>The American Heritage College Dictionary 868 (4th ed.) (defining “mercantile” as “[o]f or relating to merchants or trade”). In so entitling its taxing provision, and in light of the local tax provisions highlighted by the Majority, I find it clear that Harrisburg intended to create a tax that established simultaneous but distinct levies on both the privilege of doing business in its jurisdiction as well as on any transactions completed within the jurisdiction, without regard to where the parties to those transactions conduct business generally or are “based.” This intent is manifest not only in the title of the tax, but also in the taxing ordinance’s broad definition of “business,” and its provision of examples that embody aspects of both business privilege and transaction taxation. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 410-11 &amp; n. 5, 938 A.2d at 990-91 &amp; n. 5. Nothing in the LTEA restricted Harrisburg from so fashioning its local tax, and I find nothing problematic with concluding that it did so and deeming it proper.</p>

Instead, I would identify this tax as one that embodies aspects of both business privilege taxation and transaction taxation, one that has been clearly so structured since its enactment, and one that operates, and properly, as a transaction tax with regard to Appellee under the circumstances of this case. In so ruling, I would avoid the temptation to cast into doubt the validity of our decision in <em>Gilberti, </em>which I believe properly swept more broadly in addressing the nature of business privilege taxation than the Majority credits, and should be preserved as a viable analytic tool in assessing the validity of <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>other business privilege tax provisions that come before the courts in the future.

I do not dispute that the legislature’s intent was to provide very broad taxing authority to local jurisdictions, nor do I question Harrisburg's authority under the LTEA to enact a transaction or business privilege tax. The danger lies not in overtaxation itself, but rather in so muddying the waters that a locality can recharacterize its scheme of taxation at will to generate more revenue, in violation of the fair expectations of parties doing business in that jurisdiction. Were Harrisburg to set up a tax plainly framed on tire business privilege as bindingly characterized in our caselaw, <em>see Gilberti, <a href="/pa/511/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="511 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1798653,1798716" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0100-01,/pa/511/0100-02">supra,</a> </em>it would be inequitable to permit it, based on the LTEA alone, to modify the character of its tax in practice to capture receipts not fairly identifiable as arising from the privilege of doing business in the jurisdiction.</p>
