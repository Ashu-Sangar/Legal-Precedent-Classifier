WCAB (Hass), 582 Pa. 405, 872 A.2d 159 (2005) and Commercial Credit Claims v. WCAB (Lancaster), 556 Pa. 325, 728 A.2d 902 (1999)?\nWhether the Commonwealth Court and the WCAB erred in affirming the Decision of the WCJ which was not based on substantial and competent evidence of record where the WCJ relied upon incompetent medical testimony and which never addressed the accepted work-related injury and incorrectly attributed responsibility to the petitioner for a preexisting herniated disc?",
