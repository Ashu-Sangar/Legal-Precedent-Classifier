Did the Commonwealth Court err by interpreting the \u201cLeave for service with a collective bargaining organization\u201d Section 8102 of the Retirement Code as preventing Petitioners from receiving full credit for the final average salaries they earned while serving as officers in a collective bargaining organization?\n2. Did the Commonwealth Court err by holding that Petitioners\u2019 salaries artificially enhanced or inflated their retirement benefits?",
