        "text": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 26th day of June, 2008, the above-captioned consolidated Petitions for Allowance of Appeal are GRANTED. The issues are:\na. Whether an empowerment board under the Education Empowerment Act of 2000 [EEA], 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1701-B et seq., has the power to modify an existing charter so as to place limitations on the enrollment of students in charter schools within the school district in order to effect needed economies in the district.\nb. Whether a charter school\u2019s charter is a contract that can be cancelled or modified by the Empowerment Board pursuant to its authority under 24 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 17-1707-B(c) and 6-693(1).\nc. Whether, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Statutory Construction, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1901 et seq., the specific provisions of the EEA and the financial distress \u25a0 statutes that address the authority of the Empowerment Board to cancel and renegotiate contracts supersede the general provisions of the Charter School Law addressing an empowerment board\u2019s authority.\nd. Whether the Department of Education and Secretary of Education Gerald L. Zahorchak, as Receiver Pendente Lite for the School District, were indispensable parties to the litigation such that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the litigation.\nThe Application to Consolidate and Expedite is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The request to consolidate Nos. 126 & 127 MAL 2008 with Nos. 9 & 19 MAP 2008 is GRANTED; the request to expedite is DENIED. The Prothonotary shall establish a briefing schedule and shall list all of the matters for oral argument in accordance with this order.",
