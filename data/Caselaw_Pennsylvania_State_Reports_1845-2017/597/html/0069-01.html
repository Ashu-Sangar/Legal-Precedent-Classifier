The two women had noticed that the gate and front door of the house their father, Pablo Padilla, Sr. (“Padilla, Sr.”), shared with their brother, Pablo Padilla, Jr. (“Padilla, Jr.”) were open. When they entered the home, they immediately noticed that it had been ransacked. Irma found her father laying on the living room floor with a blanket over his head. She removed the blanket and saw duct tape over her father’s eyes and mouth and a large pool of blood on the floor. Lillian ran outside to call the police.</p>

After speaking with Irma, Officer Gadomski entered the Padilla home. He found Pablo Padilla, Sr. lying on the living room floor in a pool of blood and ascertained that Padilla, Sr. had no vital signs and his skin was ice cold. Officer Gadomski observed that Padilla, Sr. had suffered a gunshot wound and called the Homicide Unit. Shortly thereafter, Officer Gadomski’s supervisor arrived, and together they searched the rest of the home. In the basement, Officer Gadomski found the body of Pablo Padilla, Jr. on the floor with his wrists taped together, his legs tied together with a scarf, and a kitchen knife driven into the back of his neck. Further investigation revealed that the entire house had been ransacked with cupboards and drawers opened and <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>rifled through and mattresses overturned. There was no sign of forced entry.</p>
    <p id="b123-5" data-blocks='[["BL_123.5",123,[197,431,1156,678]]]'>The homicide detective assigned to the case testified that when he arrived at the scene approximately two hours after the initial police arrival, he found Padilla, Sr.’s body on the living room floor with duct tape wrapped around his head and wrists, a blue and white nylon cord around his neck, and a gunshot wound to the upper right side of the back of his head. Items found near Padilla, Sr.’s body included a spent .32 caliber shell casing, Padilla, Sr.’s wallet with its contents strewn about, and a photograph of Padilla, Sr. with a woman later identified as Rosemary Santiago, which had been ripped into four pieces. An autopsy determined that Padilla, Sr. had been shot at close range and died from a gunshot wound to the head.</p>

A metal ice pick had been driven into Padilla, Jr.’s skull and a large kitchen knife had been thrust through his neck from the front to the back. An autopsy revealed lacerations and abrasions on Padilla, Jr.’s face, consistent with being struck with a fist or a foot clad in an athletic shoe. There were also abrasions on Padilla, Jr.’s knees consistent with injuries one would suffer upon “waddling” across a carpeted floor on one’s knees while tied. A metal ice pick was found buried almost five inches into his skull. The medical examiner testified that this injury would have caused a great deal of pain but would not necessarily have caused immediate unconsciousness or death. The medical examiner testified that the injury from the kitchen knife thrust through Padilla, Jr.’s neck would also have caused pain and, eventually, death. There was also evidence that Padilla, Jr. had been strangled by the cord around his neck, and that the pressure on the cord had been released at least once after the initial strangulation. The medical examiner was unable to determine whether Padilla, Jr. would have been conscious after being strangled or whether the pressure was reapplied <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>and eventually resulted in death. There was no evidence that Padilla, Jr. struggled against his taped arms or tied legs. It was not possible for the medical examiner to determine the order in which the injuries were inflicted or whether Padilla, Jr. was conscious when any particular injury occurred.</p>

Gonzalez has a hearing disability and problems remembering dates and times. Gonzalez testified that appellant lived with him for two weeks in April 1991, immediately prior to appellant’s arrest. According to Gonzalez, appellant’s mother had requested that Gonzalez allow appellant to live with him. During the second week, appellant told Gonzalez that: (1) he “did the murders at Fifth and the Boulevard near the Dunkin’ Donuts;” (2) the Homicide Unit of the Philadelphia Police Department was looking for him; (3) he and two other men had broken into the Padilla home and wrecked the house searching for something; (4) appellant and his two accomplices found the son (Padilla, Jr.) upstairs and dragged him to the basement; (5) while the two accomplices stayed with Padilla, Jr. in the basement, appellant searched the house and found money and drugs; (6) after finding the drugs and money, appellant told the other two perpetrators “we got paid;” (7) Padilla, Sr. entered the house as appellant and the two accomplices were leaving; and (8) the men grabbed Padilla, Sr. and appellant killed him. Additionally, Gonzalez testified that he had seen appellant in a van that matched the description of Padilla, Sr.’s van “back in January about the time he had all the money” and that appellant had purchased two cars in January.

Appellant indicated to Gonzalez that the driver of the car had offered appellant $10,000 to kill a man who had stolen drugs from the driver. Appellant told Gonzalez that the driver had asked Padilla, Sr. to return the money or the drugs, and Padilla, Sr. had declined. <em>Id. </em>According to Gonzalez, appellant indicated that his subsequent trip to the Padilla home was a result of Padilla, Sr.’s response to the request for the return of the drugs or for payment. <em>Id. </em>at 157-58.</p>

Padilla, Sr.’s former paramour, Rosemary was appellant’s live-in girlfriend at the time of the murders. Rosemary testified that the day after the Padilla murders, appellant had given her cash and together they purchased a car which was placed in the false name of “Marisol Santiago.” Rosemary further testified that when her relationship with appellant began to sour in February 1991, appellant said to her, “I’ll kill you like I killed your friends,” and that he “should have did [her] like he did [Padilla, Sr.].” N.T. 11/18/92 at 318-20, 328, 394-96, 399.</p>

Appellant wanted to know why the Homicide Unit was looking for him, indicating that he thought it had something to do with “those bodies on Third right below the Boulevard” (the location of the Padilla home). Later that same day, appellant again found Aponte and told him that he had been in the house with two other men to “stick this guy up,” but one of the other men went crazy and shot the father in the head and stuck a knife through the son’s neck. <em>Id. </em>at 536.

At a hearing regarding the after-discovered evidence, the court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a> found that, at the time of <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>appellant’s trial, the Ethics Accountability Division had merely begun the investigation, and neither the District Attorney’s office nor Officer Aponte was aware of it. Because of that lack of knowledge, the lower court found no <em>Brady </em>violation.

An intentional killing is a “Milling by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d). The Commonwealth may prove that a killing was intentional solely through circumstantial evidence. Moreover, a specific intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon to inflict injury on a vital part of the body. <em>Commonwealth v. McCullum, </em><a href="/pa/529/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="529 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1831203" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0117-01">529 Pa. 117</a>, <a href="/pa/529/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="529 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1831203" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0117-01">602 A.2d 313</a>, 322-23 (1992). A deadly weapon is defined as “[a]ny firearm, whether loaded or unloaded, or any device designed as a weapon and capable of producing death or serious bodily injury, or any other device or instrumentality which, in the manner in which it is used or is intended to be used, is calculated or likely to produce death or serious bodily injury.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2301.</p>

Both victims plainly were killed unlawfully. Roberto Gonzalez testified that appellant admitted that he had been involved in the crimes, <em>i.e., </em>that he “did the murders.” Rosemary Santiago testified that appellant admitted that he had killed Padilla, Sr., and he threatened that he would kill her, too, just like he had killed “her friends,” the Padillas. Officer Aponte also testified that appellant had admitted that he was present for the murder of the Padillas, murders which occurred during a robbery he and his cohorts were executing.</p>
    <p id="b130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_130.5",130,[271,987,1167,1065]]]'>The evidence indicated that appellant shot Padilla Sr. in the head, and thus clearly used a deadly weapon on a vital part of Padilla Sr.’s body, reflecting his specific intent to kill. The torn photograph of Rosemary Santiago suggested motive, malice and a specific intent to kill as well. The nature of the injuries inflicted upon Padilla, Jr. — including an ice pick forced through his temple and a knife pushed from the back of his neck through to the front — likewise reflect an intentional killing. With respect to Padilla, Jr., appellant was also convicted of conspiracy and the jury was charged on accomplice liability. The sum of the evidence — the multiple injuries involving deadly weapons, the prolonged nature of the attack upon Padilla, Jr., and appellant’s admissions to Rosemary Santiago and to Roberto Gonzalez — supports the jury’s finding that appellant shared in the specific intent to kill, even if he did not himself necessarily deliver one of the killing blows. Accordingly, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient for a jury to find all of the elements of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt as to both killings.</p>

Of course, although police in this Commonwealth are not required to record statements with witnesses or suspects, neither are they precluded from taking such measures in order to provide an objective record of the interview. Such a recording could conclusively confirm or refute a claim of police manipulation.

Based upon this Court’s precedent, a person cannot be convicted of first-degree murder under a theory or charge of vicarious liability unless the fact-finder determines that the actor personally harbored a specific intent to kill. When counsel argued as to both murders that the jury may have found only that appellant was a mere conspirator, the trial court understandably deemed that to be an improper attempt to relitigate appellant’s overall criminal responsibility for first-degree murder. Appellant could have responded with a differently angled and more precise argument, articulating to the trial court the narrow and precise theory of relative culpability he pursues here. Such an argument, however, would have had to concede that the jury had found, at a minimum, that appellant harbored a specific intent to kill both victims, and thát he either participated in a criminal conspiracy for that very purpose or he deliberately aided and abetted the person or persons who committed the fatal act. Thus, defense counsel could have argued that, although appellant was indeed fully responsible for these multiple first-degree murders, for penalty purposes, the jury could find that his culpability was “relatively” lesser than that of his cohorts. This, however, is not the argument counsel made, and he proposed no other theory or argument. Nor did counsel articulate to the trial court the basis for his objection. Perhaps counsel failed to appreciate the nuance. But, the trial court did not prevent appellant from presenting evidence, or argument, along the narrow permissible line in this area. The current claim of error, therefore, was not preserved. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 802(a).</p>

Judge Latrone also recognized that appellant could have argued the circumstances of the killing, and his relatively “minor” “participation in the homicidal act” as mitigation. Trial Ct.

Appellant produced no affirmative evidence at the penalty phase to establish his supposed lesser role in the “killings;” instead, he claims, his counsel was prevented from arguing his role based on the guilt phase evidence. Thus, the alleged error here involves argument, not evidence. In addition, the mitigation argument appellant says was denied him was not compelling. The jury was considering the proper punishment for appellant’s third and fourth murder convictions; the jury was properly made aware of appellant’s prior murder convictions as they provided aggravating circumstances for the instant murders. The real-world impact of the “precluded” argument is this: “I am criminally responsible for not one, but two first-degree murders here. As you have heard, these are my third and fourth murder convictions. But, you should view it as a point of mitigation that, as to one of these two murders, the Commonwealth did not show that I actually committed the homicidal act.” It must be remembered that the jury in this case unanimously found live aggravating circumstances as to each murder, circumstances which largely concerned appellant’s unique status as a multiple murderer thrice over. On such a record, the notion that the overall penalty verdict in this case would have been different if only counsel had argued that appellant’s relative culpability, for one murder, was less than that of his confederates, is simply not credible. Thus, even if it is assumed that <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>the trial court had erroneously precluded this argument in mitigation, any such error plainly was harmless.</p>

Like the majority, I agree that although the guilt-phase jury had determined that Appellant had the specific intent to kill Padilla, Sr., and Padilla, Jr., and was therefore responsible for the murders, his counsel had the right to argue to the penalty-phase jury that, in accord with the “catch-all mitigator,” Appellant’s “culpability was relatively lesser than that of his cohorts.... ” Majority Opinion at 290. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8) (“Mitigating circumstances shall include the following: ... (8) Any other circumstance of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.”)</p>

      <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>Indeed, the trial court seemingly agreed with this premise. Prior to the penalty-phase summations, it expressly indicated to defense counsel that he could argue that Appellant’s reduced level of participation in the murders should be considered as a mitigating circumstance. N.T. 12/1/1992 at 14. However, when Appellant’s counsel began to make this argument at closing, perhaps somewhat imprecisely, by noting: “Now, again, I don’t know what you believed with regard to the offense you found him guilty of but, if you believed that he did not do the. killings, but was a conspirator ...” (N.T. 12/1/92 at 134-35), the prosecutor immediately objected and the trial court sustained the objection. Rather than breaking off his summation, counsel noted his objection on the record, and continued with his plea for his client’s life, without the opportunity to make this peculiar argument.</p>
    <p id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.5",154,[271,1139,1162,850]]]'>The majority in substance holds that counsel should have interrupted his closing and engaged in extended argument with opposing counsel and the court, in the hope that he could persuade the judge to reverse his ruling. Regardless of the eventual result, counsel would have lost all emotional momentum, and may, indeed, have irritated the jury during what was, at best, a difficult task. Although with the benefit of a record to read and thoughtful hindsight, I understand the basis for the prosecutor’s objection and the trial court’s ruling, I believe also that they understood what defense counsel intended to argue. Moreover, counsel lodged an objection to the trial court’s ruling. Under these circumstances, I would not find waiver. I do not believe it wise to articulate a rule requiring the interruption of a closing to dispute a trial court’s ruling in order to preserve a question for appellate review, especially where, as here, counsel objected to such ruling.</p>
    <p id="b154-6" data-blocks='[["BL_154.6",154,[272,2019,1159,149]]]'>Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that the trial court’s preclusion of counsel’s argument in this context was harmless for all of the reasons so ably developed by its opinion.</p>
