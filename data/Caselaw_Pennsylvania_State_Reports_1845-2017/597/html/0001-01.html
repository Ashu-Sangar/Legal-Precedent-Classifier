At issue is whether the Commonwealth Court properly dismissed the declaratory judgment claims raised by the Pennsylvania Bankers Association, the Pennsylvania Business Bank, Fulton Bank, and Premier Bank (“Appellants” or “the Banks”), which alleged that § 517 of the Credit Union Code, 17 Pa.C.S. § 517, violates Article VIII, §§ 2 and 5 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As detailed <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>later in our opinion, the Banks also raised several alternative constitutional challenges to § 517, which remain pending before the Commonwealth Court.

Before taking up the specific circumstances of the case <em>sub judice, </em>a brief discussion of the tax treatment of credit unions is in order. Traditionally, credit unions have functioned as cooperative associations that were intended to provide persons of modest means with an opportunity to control their money and improve their economic and social condition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In light of these charitable purposes, credit unions enjoy numerous tax exemptions as non-profit corporations that are not enjoyed by banks. For instance, as non-profit corporations, credit unions are exempt from federal taxation, <em>see </em><a href="/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="26 U.S.C. § 501">26 U.S.C. § 501</a>(c)(14)(A), and from state taxation, on their profits. <em>See </em>17 Pa.C.S. § 517.

The events precipitating the instant litigation arise from a statutory amendment to the Credit Union Code that would allow credit unions to expand their membership by basing it not only on common bonds of association, but also on common bonds of geography. <em>See </em>17 Pa.C.S. § 501(e) (extending to credit unions the power to engage in activities authorized by Section 109 of the Federal Credit Union Act, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201759" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="12 U.S.C. § 1759">12 U.S.C. § 1759</a>(b), including the option of basing membership on geographical districts).

The Banks opposed these notices by filing pro<a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>tests with the Department.

      <em> </em>According to Appellees, this case is distinguishable from <em>Wickett </em>because the order in that case ended the plaintiffs’ declaratory judgment action against three of the defendants, resulting in their dismissal. In contrast, Appellees note that the Commonwealth Court’s order in this case did not end the litigation against any party, but merely narrowed the scope of the Banks’ broader request for declaratory judgment, which included several alternative arguments pertaining to the constitutionality of § 517 of the Credit Union Code. In Appellees’ view, because the Banks may still be able to obtain the relief they originally <em>sought </em>— i.e., a declaration that § 517 is unconstitutionally litigating their alternative claims before the Commonwealth Court, the Commonwealth Court’s order should not be construed as one declaring the parties’ rights or legal relations, as required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 7532.</p>

We note the following scenario. Initially, this Court adjudicates the Banks’ claims regarding §§ 2 and 5 and concludes that these theories would not provide the Banks with relief. The case then goes back to the Commonwealth Court on the Banks’ remaining claims, where the Appellees move for judgment on the pleadings regarding the Banks’ equal protection claim.

On appeal, this Court affirms the dismissal of the Banks’ equal protection claim. Finally, the case goes back again to the Commonwealth Court, which affords the Banks relief on their final claim under Article VIII, § 1, thereby rendering moot this Court’s two prior adjudications.

One should note that, pursuant to our Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Commonwealth Court is divested of jurisdiction to adjudicate the Banks' alternative constitutional claims pending the current appeal. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1701(a) ("Except as otherwise prescribed by these rules, after an appeal is taken or review of a quasijudicial order is sought, the trial court ... may no longer proceed further in the matter.”).
