According to his attorney, Appellee was advised that, if he prevailed in obtaining a new trial on appeal, the Commonwealth would be foreclosed from again seeking the death penalty.

The Commonwealth did, again, pursue imposition of the death penalty. In the guilt phase, among other evidence, the prosecution presented testimony from Appellee’s accomplice, Jeffrey Hammer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Hammer explained that he and Appellee hid outside the Heidelberg Family Restaurant after close of business with .41 and .22 caliber weapons, respectively, planning to rob the manager, handcuff him, and leave him in his truck. When the pair confronted the victim but he did not cooperate, Hammer related, Appellee shot Mr. Boyer repeatedly with the .22 caliber pistol. Further, Hammer indicated that the coconspirators placed the weapons and masks in a black bag and escaped in an all-terrain vehicle, but that the bag was lost during the travel.</p>

According to Wanner’s testimony, Appellee also complained that he had to grab the firearm from Hammer and shoot the victim after Hammer had shot and missed. Wanner said that he was able to see the participants in the conversation and that a person named Joe (later identified as Joseph Russo) was also present. Finally, although Wanner was facing sentencing in a pending prosecution, he stated that he did not expect to receive favorable treatment from the Commonwealth in exchange for his testimony.</p>

Rather that indicating that a reasonable doubt is one that would cause a reasonably careful and sensible person to “hesitate” before acting upon a matter of importance in his own affairs, Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Jury Instructions § 7.01(3) (1979), the trial court described a reasonable doubt as “a kind of doubt that <em>refrains </em>a reasonable person from acting in a manner of importance to himself or herself.” N.T., January 21, 1999, at 498 (emphasis added). Further, the court took it upon itself to advise the jurors of the penalties associated with the different degrees of murder. <em>See id. </em>at 512.</p>

Of particular relevance to one of Appellee’s present claims, the convictions relied upon by the Commonwealth in support of the (d)(9) aggravator, including one for third-degree murder, occurred after his initial trial in this case. Appellee offered brief testimony from his mother and a former employer in support of the catchall mitigator, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8).

The PCRA court appointed counsel, and an amended petition was filed, with supplements ensuing. Appellee asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that: the Commonwealth suppressed exculpatory evidence and knowingly failed to correct false trial testimony; trial counsel was ineffective at the guilt phase of trial for failing to gather available impeachment materials and adequately cross-examine Commonwealth witnesses; the trial court improperly instructed the jury concerning comparative penalties for the different degrees of murder; the court provided a constitutionally defective charge concerning reasonable doubt; trial counsel was derelict in assuring Appellee that the Commonwealth was foreclosed from seeking the death penalty upon retrial; and trial counsel inappropriately failed to investigate and present an adequate case of mitigation in the penalty phase.</p>

At some point, the district attorney prepared notes concerning this meeting; however, the post-<a id="p661" href="#p661" data-label="661" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*661</a>conviction evidence was in conflict concerning the timing of the preparation of these notes and the entire content of the underlying interview. On the one hand, the prosecutor testified that his notes were prepared one or two weeks after the meeting, and thus, did not reflect contemporaneous, verbatim responses from Hammer. The district attorney also related that he did not show Wanner’s statement to Hammer or specifically discuss the contents with him. According to the prosecutor, Hammer said he was unsure whether someone else besides himself and Appellee was present. Hammer, on the other hand, indicated that notes generally were taken during interviews with him. Further, he testified that the prosecutor did show him Wanner’s statement, and he expressed a belief that he had marked the portions of the statement that he claimed were false, including Wanner’s statements that Russo was present and that Appellee said that he had grabbed the murder weapon from Hammer.

Finally, although he reiterated that the Commonwealth had made no “deal” concerning his own sentencing in the unrelated prosecution against him, Wanner said that the prosecutor had said he would “see what he could do” in that case.

According to Appellee’s two mental-health professionals, a neuropsychologist and a psychiatrist, such record reflected a long history of learning disabilities and abnormal social development, thus presenting many “red flags” suggesting cognitive impairment or organic brain defect.

Nevertheless, counsel did not arrange for a mental-health examination. He noted, at various points in his testimony, that Appellee’s mother gave him no indication of a psychiatric history, and that there were indications in Appellee’s prison records that he had no mental illnesses. Counsel also indicated, however, that he did not know signs of cognitive disorder, <em>see </em>N.T., January 20, 2005, at 96 (reflecting counsel’s response to a question concerning his knowledge of “No, I am not a psychiatrist”).

Concerning the allegation of nondisclosure by the Commonwealth of the prosecutor’s notes of his interview with Hammer, the court explained that, even if Appellee had known the substance of the conversation, he would have been in the “very difficult position” of arguing to the jury that Hammer was truthful in various assertions, but that the jury should not believe the remainder of his testimony. <em>See Sattazahn, </em>No. 2194-89, <em>slip op. </em>at 14.

Thus, the court opined that Appellee could not establish that any information allegedly withheld by the Commonwealth would have changed the outcome of the trial if it had been provided to him. <em>See id. </em>at 14-15.

It must be noted that trial counsel did not cross-examine Fritz Wanner regarding the contents of this conversation in the barn, even though [Appellee] was an actual participant in the conversation. As a[d]efendant has a duty to participate in his own defense, one can logically infer that if the content of the conversation was different than what Wanner testified to, then [Appellee] would have informed his counsel, prompting him to vigorously cross-examine him on that subject.

Further, it extensively criticizes the PCRA court for its reliance upon a 1992 Department of Corrections report as containing “red flags” concerning potential mental health issues, since there is no evidence that Appellee revealed to trial counsel that he participated in a mental health evaluation while incarcerated. The Commonwealth also develops that trial counsel did subpoena and receive records from the Department of Corrections and argues that counsel should not be faulted where the report was not supplied by the agency in response to the subpoena. According to the Commonwealth, the report also does not readily reveal that further testing would be implicated, since it indicates that Appellee was “devoid of gross psychopathology.” The Commonwealth also asserts that Appellee’s own expert testified that only a neuropsychologist would have apprehended that the results of this report suggested further testing.</p>

As to information within the Berks County prosecutor’s immediate possession and control, the Commonwealth refutes Appellee’s claim of materiality. With regard to previous drafts of the memorandum of cooperation and plea agreement with Hammer, the Commonwealth explains that changes were not made to afford Hammer a more favorable bargain, since the penalties concerning deleted charges were to run concurrently with other charges to which Hammer pleaded, and thus, the actual sentence was unaffected. The Commonwealth further notes that trial counsel conceded that he would not have altered his cross-examination of Hammer based upon this modified agreement. <em>See </em>N.T., January 20, 2005, at 63.

According to the Common<a id="p684" href="#p684" data-label="684" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*684</a>wealth, Hammer’s personal wishes, however unreasonable, were not relevant, particularly since he already had entered his plea after the first trial. <em>See </em>N.T., January 15, 1999, at 265.

The Commonwealth also references trial counsel’s post-conviction testimony that he was careful not to cross-examine Hammer too closely regarding his convictions in Lebanon and Schuylkill Counties, as to do so may have risked the exposure of Appellee’s identity as Hammer’s coeonspirator in those crimes as well.

Nevertheless, we note that trial counsel established powerful motivation on the part of Hammer to curry favor with authorities, in the form of his exposure to capital punishment or sentences aggregating up to 240 years on a host of criminal charges, and his entry into a plea bargain centered on his cooperation in the prosecution of Appellee. <em>See </em>N.T., January 20, 1999, at 327-333.

Here, counsel testified Appellee’s mother gave no indication of appellee’s psychiatric history, Appellee’s prison records gave no indication of any mental illness, and Appellee failed to provide counsel with names of potential witnesses and discouraged further investigation into his background, indicating he had been a troublemaker. <em>Cf. Romero, </em>at 388 (appellant showed no signs of mental illness, never gave counsel any useful information about his childhood or family when asked, and prison records contained no indication of psychiatric problems, although counsel was aware appellant had done poorly in school and dropped out). Given these circumstances, counsel’s decision not to pursue evidence of mental health mitigation was not unreasonable. <em>See Commonwealth v.
