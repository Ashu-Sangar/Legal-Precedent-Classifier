Consequently, on July 9, 2003, the PCRA court held a hearing, after which it stayed the proceedings and ordered that appellee be examined by the court’s mental health unit as well as by two mental health experts retained by defense counsel — psychiatrist Robert L. Sadoff, M.D., and psychologist Gerald Cooke, Ph.D. On September 9th, the court granted a continuance to allow appellee’s examination by John S. O’Brien, II, M.D., a psychiatrist retained by the Commonwealth. Drs. Sadoff and Cooke examined appellee on September 17th; on December 9th, appellee was examined by Dr. O’Brien and by the court’s psychiatrist, Robert Stanton, M.D.</p>

On June 22nd, the court issued an order finding appellee presently incompetent and appointing Mrs. Watson as his next friend.

    <blockquote id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.7",545,[249,746,1111,1252]]]'>The Commonwealth claims that this Court’s ruling “essentially puts an end to this case by rendering it impossible to carry out the execution (or for all practical purposes even move forward with the current proceeding).” That contention is belied by the record. Prior to this appeal, the matter was scheduled to proceed with the PCRA hearing on May 2, 2005, with the defendant represented by the “next friend” (his mother) and counsel. This procedure was approved by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <em>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, at the hearing on the defendant’s competency, this Court determined, based on the testimony, that the defendant was not a danger to himself or others and therefore, could not be involuntarily medicated in an attempt to render him competent (see testimony of Dr. Robert Sadoff, 10/18/04 N.T. at 14-39). This was also based on the prison records submitted which disclosed that the defendant had been incarcerated for over 20 years in various institutions and had no history of violence to himself or others. Thus, while diagnosed as incompetent, this Court determined that, absent evidence the defendant is a danger to himself or others an order to involuntarily medicate him would be violative of the law.

With respect to the first requirement, both parties agree that the order at issue is separable from and collateral to the main cause of action. Indeed, the issue of whether appellee should be compelled to take psychiatric medication is completely distinct from, and has no bearing on, the questions of whether he wishes to pursue, and whether he is entitled to, collateral relief.

First, the Commonwealth argues, “the issue of involuntary medical treatment ‘raises questions of clear constitutional importance.’ ” Commonwealth’s Brief at 2 (quoting <em>Sell, </em><a href="/us/539/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="539 U.S. 166" data-case-ids="8897706" data-case-paths="/us/539/0166-01">539 U.S. at 176</a>, <a href="/us/539/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="539 U.S. 166" data-case-ids="8897706" data-case-paths="/us/539/0166-01">123 S.Ct. 2174</a>). Second, the Commonwealth contends, the order below also concerns “important public interests beyond those of the immediate litigants.” <em><a href="/us/539/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="539 U.S. 166" data-case-ids="8897706" data-case-paths="/us/539/0166-01">Id.</a> </em>In particular, the Commonwealth asserts that the PCRA court’s ruling frustrates the societal interest in the finality of criminal proceedings and that the issue presented will likely recur in future capital cases, in which defendants often allege mental incompetence.</p>

The result of this Court’s denying review, the Commonwealth contends, would be “the very harm sought to be avoided, <em>i.e., </em>indefinitely delaying resolution of this case by requiring the Commonwealth to litigate PCRA proceedings against a purported next friend, which will not finally conclude [appellee]’s appeals.” <em>Id.</em>

Noting that the <em>Sell </em>court held that “an order requiring involuntary treatment satisfies the ‘importance’ requirement,” appellee’s counsel argues that the second requirement of Rule 313(b) is not satisfied here because the Commonwealth’s appeal “does not seek to protect any right [ ] of clear constitutional importance.” Appellee’s Brief at 37. As for the third requirement, appellee’s counsel would distinguish the instant case from <em>Sell </em>based on the outcome in the lower court. In <em>Sell, </em>appellee’s counsel notes, denying review <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>meant that the defendant certainly would be medicated so that the case could proceed to trial, a harm that could not be undone even if he were ultimately acquitted. Here, counsel argues, the Commonwealth as the losing party merely “speculates that Mr. Watson might eventually regain competency and might then seek to raise new claims,” a harm too speculative to allow for an appeal under Rule 313(b). <em>Id. </em>at 37-38.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[280,741,1159,911]]]'>Taking the third requirement of Rule 313(b) before the second, we initially determine whether “the question presented is such that if review is postponed until final judgment in the case, the claim will be irreparably lost.” Pa.R.A.P. 313(b). In the instant case, if we do not grant immediate review, the question of whether appellee can be compelled to take psychiatric medication to restore competence to decide whether he even wants to pursue collateral relief will never be definitively answered. As a result of the dispositive order of the PCRA court, appellee’s competence is no longer relevant, and whether to pursue collateral relief becomes a matter for Marie Watson, appellee’s mother and next friend, to decide. In other words, if review is denied here, the Commonwealth’s claim that compelled medication is permissible to ensure a single, comprehensive PCRA proceeding simply disappears forever; the third requirement of the collateral order doctrine is therefore easily satisfied.</p>

The PCRA serves an important sub<a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>stantive, and failsafe, purpose exclusively for the benefit of convicted criminals — it exists to allow for vindication of persons who are actually innocent, or, if not innocent, at least have a colorable claim to a lesser sentence or conviction, or a claim to a new trial. An inmate who is entitled to relief should not be arbitrarily denied the prospect of collateral review. In short, compelled medication in a case like this would vindicate the inmate’s interests. If PCRA relief were not pursued, then that avenue would be waived. Therefore, the <em>Sell </em>caveat is relevant <em>here </em>— i.e., the Commonwealth should not have to meet the four strict <em>Sell </em>conditions because it is not seeking an end that is against appellee’s interest.</blockquote>

According to her testimony, Mrs. Watson’s conclusion that her pursuit of PCRA relief for appellee was in appellee’s interest was based on her conversations with appellee’s counsel and death penalty shadow counsel, none of whom appears to be receiving any cooperation or encouragement from appellee whatsoever. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/18/04, at 43-44 (responding affirmatively to the question, “And based on [the] conversations [with counsel], you understand it’s in the interest of your son to live and not to be put to death[?]”). For his part, appellee expressed to the PCRA court his ovm desire that his death sentence be executed.</p>

As the Commonwealth notes, Dr. O’Brien expressly confirmed that there were no less intrusive means of restoring appellee’s competence other than the administration of antipsychotic medication. In rendering this opinion, Dr. O’Brien noted that, during the years when appellee was under the supervision of clinicians, appellee’s symptoms were “under control” only during the periods of time when he was taking the medication. Dr. O’Brien’s testimony in this regard is undisputed. Therefore, the record made by the Commonwealth <em>sub judice </em>compels the finding that the administration of antipsychotic medication is necessary to further the societal interest in finality as well as appellee’s interest in determining whether to exercise his right to collateral review.</p>

Within the meaning of <em>Sell, </em>a treatment is medically appropriate if it is “in the patient’s best medical interest in light of his medical condition.” <em>Sell, </em><a href="/us/539/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="539 U.S. 166" data-case-ids="8897706" data-case-paths="/us/539/0166-01">539 U.S. at 181</a>, <a href="/us/539/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="539 U.S. 166" data-case-ids="8897706" data-case-paths="/us/539/0166-01">123 S.Ct. 2174</a>. Naturally, when considering the medical appropriateness of a given treatment, a certain degree of “deference [ ] is owed to medical professionals who have the full-time responsibility of caring for mentally ill inmates ... and who possess, as courts do not, the requisite knowledge and expertise to determine whether the drugs should be' used in an individual case.” <em>Washington v.

The Commonwealth also cites prison records admitted by the PCRA court indicating that physicians there had repeatedly prescribed such medication for appellee. Dr. Sadoff, the Commonwealth notes, did not provide a contrary opinion.</p>

Therefore, counsel for appellee argues, the Commonwealth has failed to show that the involuntary administration of antipsychotic medication is medically appropriate in the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[208,802,1158,1117]]]'>This characterization of Dr. Sadoffs testimony again is inaccurate. Dr. Sadoff did not testify that appellee would have to be injected with medications with “life-threatening” side effects. Rather, Dr. Sadoff testified that he would prescribe Haldol or Prolixin (the injectable medications with more serious side effects) only if appellee refused to take Zyprexa (one of two oral medications with less serious side effects that appellee had voluntarily taken in the past). In any event, Dr. Sadoff never characterized the side effects of Haldol and Prolixin as “life-threatening.” <em>See </em>N.T., 10/18/04, at 38 (identifying side effect of Haldol and Prolixin as “the shakiness that we call dyskinesia”). More importantly, Dr. Sadoff did not testify that treating appellee with any of the above medications was medically inappropriate. Thus, Dr. O’Brien’s testimony in this regard (that treating appellee with antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate) not only remained unrebutted — it was consistent with that of Dr. Sadoff. The record <em>sub judice </em>therefore was more than adequate to support the Commonwealth’s assumed burden, under <em>Sell, </em>of showing that the administration of antipsychotic medication is medically appropriate in the case <em>sub judice.</em>
