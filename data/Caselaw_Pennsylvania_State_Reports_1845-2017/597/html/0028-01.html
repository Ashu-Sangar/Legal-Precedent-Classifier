Kaneesha was playing with her friend Marquis, and her brothers were upstairs watching television; the victim was in the first-floor <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>dining room. At approximately 7:00 p.m., Appellant, a neighbor known to Kaneesha as “Binky,” arrived and asked if Kaneesha’s mother was home. Kaneesha — who was aware that Appellant had recently argued with her mother — indicated that she would get her mother from inside and bring her out, but that Appellant should not go inside because her mother might be getting dressed. Appellant did not wait, however, and entered the home directly behind Kaneesha, pushing the latter out of the way to approach the victim. When Appellant saw the victim, the two started arguing. Kaneesha picked up the phone to call the police because her mother had told her that Appellant was not allowed in the house. While trying to place the call, Kaneesha heard her mother say, “Get out of my house,” to which Appellant replied, “Okay, you going to call the cops, try to get me locked up[?]” He then produced a gun and shot the victim a total of ten times, killing her. Kaneesha ran to her friend’s home nearby and summoned the police.</p>

In this regard, a Crime Scene Unit officer who inspected the scene also observed that at least four shots were fired at close range in a deliberate downward motion, penetrating an area of the carpet that was saturated with blood.

Viewing the proofs favorably to the prosecution, it is relevant that Appellant had recently argued <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>with the victim, arrived at the her house with a gun, ignored her daughter’s directive to stay outside (and indeed pushed the daughter aside to enter the residence), responded in an angry manner to the victim’s command to leave the premises, and then shot the victim a total of ten times, including twice in the groin, once in the face, and six times in the back of the head. Of particular importance is the testimony provided by the ballistics expert and the medical examiner indicating that Appellant stood over the victim, firing downward at the back of her head while she lay face-down on the floor. As a specific intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body, <em>see Commonwealth v. DeJesus, </em><a href="/pa/580/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="580 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="1100728" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0303-01">580 Pa. 303</a>, 308, <a href="/pa/580/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="860 A.2d 102" data-case-ids="1100728,9145847" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0303-01,/a2d/860/0102-01">860 A.2d 102</a>, 106 (2004), we conclude that the jury was justified in finding Appellant guilty of first-degree murder.</p>

The only question Appellant raises is whether the evidence showed that he was not privileged to enter. He maintains that he was known to, and liked by, the family; highlights testimony to the effect that Kaneesha had ushered him into the home, <em>see </em>N.T. March 3, 2004, at 79 (reflecting Marquis’ testimony that Appellant asked Kaneesha “if her mother was in, she said yes, and she escorted him in”); and discounts Kaneesha’s contrary testimony as coming from an “interested witness.” He also argues that the record does not reflect that Kaneesha ever told Appellant he was not permitted to enter.</p>

Notably, however, there was also evidence indicating that, in all those years, Appellant had only been inside the victim’s home on one occasion, <em>see </em>N.T. March 3, <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>2004 at 34 (testimony of Kaneesha Cooper); that the victim had told her family members that Appellant was not permitted inside, <em>see id. </em>at 30; that Appellant had to “shove” Kaneesha out of the way in order to enter, <em>see id.; </em>and that the victim immediately ordered Appellant to leave the house as soon as she saw him, <em>see id. </em>at 43-44 (testimony of Kaneesha Cooper, recounting that her mother “jumped up when she saw me come in and [Appellant] was right behind me. First thing my mother said was get out.”). Furthermore, regardless of how the situation may have appeared to Marquis, the jurors apparently believed Kaneesha’s specific recollection that she had told Appellant not to enter the premises at the time of the incident. <em>See generally Cousar, </em><a href="/pa/593/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="593 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="3249550" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0204-01">593 Pa. at 219</a>, <a href="/pa/593/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="928 A.2d 1025" data-case-ids="3249550,8357422" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0204-01,/a2d/928/1025-01">928 A.2d at 1033</a> (an appellate court is not authorized to substitute its estimation of a witness’s credibility for that of the jury); <em>Commonwealth v.

As for Appellant’s assertion that Kaneesha never told him he was not permitted to enter, the record is to the contrary, as Kaneesha testified as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b84-5" data-blocks='[["BL_84.5",84,[331,1388,1115,195]]]'>So I walked up the [outside] steps to go get my mother, and before I hit the door, he was right behind me. And I said, “Oh no, you can wait, I’ll go get her for you because I don’t know if she’s dressed.”</blockquote>

As to the burglary conviction, Appellant largely repeats his arguments concerning evidentiary sufficiency, noting in particular that only one witness (Kaneesha) provided the testimony suggesting a lack of privilege to enter, and that that witness’s recitation of the events was in tension with the testimony of her friend, Marquis. He adds, as well, that there was no protection from abuse order in place, and that nothing in the record indicates that he had been told on any prior occasion that he could not simply enter the victim’s house at will. Appellant again, in this context, emphasizes that he was known to, and liked by, the victim’s family. As for the murder charge, Appellant highlights that there was no proof of any “bad blood” between himself and the victim; rather, he suggests that the proofs at trial demonstrated that as soon as he entered the home, he was “verbally attacked by the victim,” which caused him to fly “into a rage, firing multiple times.” Brief for Appellant at 21.

The factfinder is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses. The trial court will award a new trial only when the jury’s verdict is so contrary to the evidence as to shock one’s sense of justice. In determining whether this standard has been met, appellate review is limited to whether the trial judge’s discretion was properly exercised, and relief will only be granted where the facts and inferences of record disclose a palpable abuse of discretion.

It was a brief, offhand remark that appears to reflect possible momentary confusion on the part of the prosecutor, particularly as she had indicated, immediately prior to the challenged remark, that the sole “aggravator in this case” is that the killing occurred in perpetration of the felony of burglary. Accordingly, the comment does not seem more than minimally prejudicial when viewed within the context of all of the circumstances of the case. <em>See generally Commonwealth v. Dennis, </em><a href="/pa/552/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="552 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="559548" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0331-01">552 Pa. 331</a>, 347, <a href="/a2d/715/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="715 A.2d 404" data-case-ids="11705437,559548" data-case-paths="/a2d/715/0404-01,/pa/552/0331-01">715 A.2d 404</a>, 411-12 (1998) (reciting that the effect of improper prosecutorial argumentation must be evaluated by “considering all the circumstances of the case”).

Upon careful review of the record, we are persuaded that the death sentence was not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, but resulted from properly introduced evidence that Appellant intentionally and deliberately shot Johnetta Bryant to death. We also conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the single aggravating factor found by the jury in relation to the killing. Specifically, the fact that Appellant was convicted of burglary in connection with the shooting of Ms. Bryant provides sufficient evidence to support the aggravating circumstance that Appellant committed the killing in perpetration of a felony. <em>See 42 </em>Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6).</p>

Appellant does claim that it was standard protocol in Philadelphia to afford all capital defendants a second attorney, and so he was denied equal protection and due process. <em>See id. </em>at 26-27.

Therefore, his presentation to this Court is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation.
