Before an arrest was made, an investigating Grand Jury was convened. On March 18, 1992, Dr. Mihalakis testified before that Grand Jury and opined that the forensic evidence supported the Commonwealth’s theory that Donna was the victim of a homicide based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty. Relevant to this issue, Dr. Mihalakis stated that the evidence indicated that Donna’s head and upper torso were turned away from the shooter and that she had her arms up in a blocking effort. He also testified that given the location where Donna’s body was found (a small bathroom in the basement of her house), he believed that she was being pursued by the shooter. Additionally, Dr. Mihalakis opined that the evidence suggested that after the first gunshot wound to her jaw, Donna would have been physically unable to fire the second, fatal gunshot to her temple. On February 24, 1993, the Grand Jury returned <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>indictments, and appellant was subsequently charged with two counts of murder. At trial, Dr. Mihalakis testified consistently with his Grand Jury testimony. Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 11/1/93, at 57-63, 65.</p>
    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[218,544,1154,629]]]'>At trial, the defense vigorously countered Dr. Mihalakis’s opinion with expert testimony from its own forensic pathologist, Dr. Cyril Wecht. Dr. Wecht opined that the forensic evidence demonstrated that Donna Puksar had murdered her husband and then committed suicide. As part of that testimony, Dr. Wecht opined that, even after shooting herself once in the jaw, Donna would have been able to deliver the killing shot to her head. As noted in this Court’s opinion on direct appeal, in this case involving conflicting theories of experts on the cause of death, the jury apparently rejected the conclusions of Dr. Wecht and accepted those of Dr. Mihalakis when it convicted appellant of the two murders.</p>

In appellant’s view, trial counsel should have filed a <em>Frye </em>motion to have Dr. Mihalakis’s forensic opinions outright barred from trial. To support his attack on counsel, appellant presented the opinion testimony of three additional forensic pathologists at the PCRA hearing; these experts testified that Dr. Mihalakis’s testimony was based on speculation and not on forensic pathology. Furthermore, the defense PCRA experts disagreed with the conclusions of Dr. Mihalakis and agreed with the conclusions of Dr. Wecht that Donna Puksar had committed suicide. Specifically, Dr. Edward T. McDonough, the Deputy Chief Medical Examiner for Connecticut, opined that Dr. Mihalakis’s testimony before the Grand Jury was not based on generally accepted principles of forensic pathology. Dr. McDonough testified that Dr. Mihalakis’s hypothesis regarding the circumstances surrounding the murders was “literally a fantastic scenario about what happened to Donna Puksar.” N.T., 1/28-<a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>29/04, at 77. Dr. McDonough claimed that the factors relied upon by Dr. Mihalakis in drawing his conclusions were not the type of information that a reasonably competent forensic pathologist would rely upon in formulating opinions. <em>Id. </em>at 79-82, 87-88 (testifying that “an attempt to do some sort of scene reconstruction and trying to place Donna Puksar in a position where the initial gunshot wound of the face took place would be appropriate; that would be the appropriate method to do, but to imply that she was cowering, which implies a behavior or an emotional response, is inappropriate”); <em>id. </em>at 96-97 (explaining that word “executioner” used by Dr. Mihalakis during his testimony was “wholly inappropriate for an objective observer and somebody to come up with an informed scientific opinion”). Dr. McDonough further suggested that much of Dr. Mihalakis’s testimony was speculative. <em>Id. </em>at 97-98 (stating that crime scene reconstruction could have been done to support Dr. Mihalakis’s testimony that Donna Puksar was shot in temple while lying on floor, but “to my knowledge, it was not done”); <em>id. </em>at 101-05 (pointing to statements made by Dr. Mihalakis that were unsupported by physical evidence, such as his suggestion that Donna Puksar was “pursued,” that she “realized something was amiss,” and that “she was pushed”).</p>

Lee Institute of Forensic Science, likewise opined that Dr. Mihalakis’s expert testimony lacked any indicia of scientific reliability. <em>Id. </em>at 138-35. Finally, Dr. Marilyn T. Miller, also of the Henry C. Lee Institute, testified that there was no physical evidence to support Dr. Mihalakis’s testimony that Donna Puksar was pursued and that much of Dr. Mihalakis’s testimony was speculative and improperly drew conclusions from the lack of physical evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 175-76 (“It’s clairvoyant.”); <em>id. </em>at 178-79 (asked about validity of Dr. Mihalakis placing significance on Donna Puksar being dressed in business suit, Dr. Miller opined, “No, of course not.

From the defense experts’ testimony, one can reasonably conclude that a forensic pathologist reviews the physical evidence from the crime scene in order to determine cause of death. The defense experts implied that Dr. Mihalakis did not employ such a method, but rather engaged in speculation and guesswork in reaching his conclusions regarding the cause of Donna Puksar’s death. The experts further opined that Dr. Mihalakis’s testimony had no foundation in science, since in their view he selectively ignored physical evidence and only referred to physical evidence that supported his conclusions.</p>

Finally, counsel said he would have presented her testimony only in the penalty phase, but not at the guilt phase. Counsel’s representation was consistent with his statements during the trial indicating that appellant’s parents were in ill health. N.T., 11/8/93, at 1032-33.

Trial counsel noted that the last thing he wanted to do was jeopardize that ruling by eliciting dubious testimony from Mrs. Puksar and Attorney Warden that appellant and Thomas supposedly enjoyed a good relationship, thereby opening the door to the excluded, contrary evidence. <em>See </em>N.T., 11/26/08, at 96.

N.T., 11/2/93, at 42. In rebuttal, the Commonwealth presented evidence that the lack of fingerprints on the gun could indicate that it had been wiped clean or that some type of protective glove was worn.

The <em>Lambert </em>case that appellant refers to gained notoriety when Judge Stewart Dalzell, of the federal district court, sitting in habeas review of a separate Pennsylvania murder conviction, granted Lambert habeas corpus relief on alleged <em>Brady </em>claims, including a claim that the prosecutor committed a <em>Brady </em>violation in contacting Dr. Mihalakis about his proposed defense testimony. <em>See Lambert v.

During this time, Boccabella became acquainted with appellant’s lawyer in California, Lew Warden. In letters to Boccabella, Attorney Warden raised concerns that appellant was suffering from a “severe mental disorder”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">9</a> and forwarded Boccabella records of psychiatric and psychological evaluations that were performed on appellant in California (hereinafter the “Sierra Clinic records”). As a result of his communications with Warden, Boccabella retained Dr. Larry Rotenberg, a forensic psychiatrist, to evaluate appellant. This information, including Warden’s letters, was forwarded to trial counsel, Attorney Alan Sodomsky, as part of appellant’s file. Boccabella also stated that appellant was not able to follow his simple instructions when he testified before the Grand Jury. N.T., 11/25/03, at 55-59.</p>

Warden also verified an affidavit that was submitted to the PCRA court. In that affidavit, Warden offered that during the course of his representation, appellant’s depression deepened. Warden believed that, at some point during his representation, appellant crossed the line between reality and delusion because he had misled many of the experts as to his life history. He also believed that appellant was not competent to assist him in his <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>civil litigation since appellant could no longer perceive his best legal interests, yet appellant refused to seek psychiatric care.

At the PCRA hearing, Warden testified that he wrote a letter to Dr. Rotenberg informing him that appellant had misled Dr. Rotenberg during his mental examination, including that appellant had concealed prior mental health tests and evaluations he had received, and that appellant had a long history of misrepresenting his educational background and his military experience to investigators.

The first was Dr. ' Rotenberg, who was retained by Boccabella to evaluate appellant in 1991. At that time, Dr. Rotenberg diagnosed appellant with Axis I — adjustment disorder with mixed depressed and anxious moods, and personality disorder, not otherwise specified. Dr. Rotenberg further testified that he received more information after the initial evaluation, but he never did anything further with appellant’s file because he was never contacted by anyone until he was contacted by PCRA defense counsel to prepare a follow-up report.

Dr. Rotenberg’s <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>opinion in this regard was based on his belief that appellant’s competence became an issue only after he was found guilty, since he would have “given up on the system” at that point. Specifically, Dr. Rotenberg stated: “When he was found guilty he was so angry and so enraged that he essentially gave up on the system, and given his tendency to become depressed, to become anxious together with his tendency to say, in essence, to hell with it all, the world is not the way I want it to be, and therefore, I’m not going to participate, it was at that point that he became, in my opinion, as a result of many narcissistic issues within his personality, incompetent to say I’m giving up, I’m not participating, do your will.” Dr. Rotenberg insisted that, no matter how rational and logical appellant appeared during the waiver of mitigation colloquy, the colloquy would have been “infected by the impairment” he detected in appellant. Dr. Rotenberg admitted that he only saw appellant one time for about an hour in May, 1991, that he did not do any independent psychological testing, and that the only psychological testing that was done was completed four years prior to his seeing appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 203-09.</p>

After enumerating the records he had reviewed in preparing his report, Dr. Blumberg opined that appellant’s history raised serious questions about his ability to assist in his defense at sentencing. Dr. Blumberg testified that he interviewed appellant for a little under eight hours and conducted some psychological and neuropsychological tests. The results of those tests led Dr. Blumberg to believe that appellant was suffering from depressive disorder and, based on the Sierra Clinic records, he had been suffering from such a disorder since the mid-1980s. Dr. Blumberg also opined that appellant suffered from a personality disorder that made him lie about his life history to the point of being delusional, “[t]hat is at times his — he becomes — he becomes so convinced of these, I guess, fabrications that he has made up about his background that he appears to believe it and live it out.” N.T., 1/28/04, at 31.

His choice not to assist was one, in my opinion,- that was definitely impacted on [sic] by his depression, by his personality disorder....” <em>Id. </em>at 42-43. Dr. Blumberg acknowledged the length of time that had passed between the Sierra Clinic evaluations and Dr. Rotenberg’s opinion (six years) and the further time lapse by trial (two years), but said he believed the information was still relevant in forming his opinion. He also acknowledged that, well in advance of trial, appellant had maintained that he “likely did not want” to present mitigating evidence. Dr. Blumberg opined that the trial court and Attorney Sodomsky were incorrect in believing appellant to be competent at the time of the mitigation waiver colloquy. Finally, returning to the competency standard, Dr. Blumberg offered his opinion that appellant understood the nature and object of the proceeding, but stated a belief that his incompetence had to do with his depression and personality disorder, which prevented appellant from rationally participating in his defense. Like Dr. Rotenberg, Dr. Blumberg pinpointed the time of incompetence as arising abruptly, <em>i.e., </em>after appellant was convicted of first-degree murder. <em>Id. </em>at 44-52.</p>

Sodomsky testified that he vaguely remembered receiving the Sierra Clinic records and knowing that Dr. Rotenberg had evaluated appellant. He also stated that he did not have any contact with a mental health expert related to the penalty phase and never had appellant evaluated specifically for purposes of the penalty phase. Sodomsky had, however, retained a Dr. Michaels for the guilt phase to testify regarding the Puksars’ relationship and Dr. Michaels was available to him generally.

Appellant contends that this claim has arguable merit, since Attorney Sodomsky had evidence of appellant’s history of mental illness and information that he had been unable to assist his civil attorney concerning ongoing litigation in California between 1982 and 1992. Appellant argues that his then-mental state rendered the waiver not knowing and voluntary. Sodomsky compounded his error at the waiver colloquy itself, appellant says, when he told the trial court that there was “absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is a knowing, and voluntary decision.” N.T., <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>11/10/93, at 1031. Appellant also asserts that counsel had no reasonable strategy for failing to have appellant evaluated in light of the information he had about appellant’s mental history and he certainly had no reason for not attempting to contact Attorney Warden or Dr. Rotenberg. Finally, appellant asserts that he was prejudiced by counsel’s actions, since even a cursory mental health investigation would have revealed appellant’s incompetency to waive mitigation evidence. At the very least, appellant asserts, trial counsel should have informed the court of appellant’s mental health history so the court could have ordered a mental health evaluation.</p>

The Commonwealth points to the substantial gap in time between the trial and Dr. Blumberg’s evaluation as well as the minimal amount of information that Dr. Rotenberg had available to him in making his assessment. The Commonwealth also asserts that the experts’ opinions were inconsistent with each other, since Dr. Blumberg believed appellant suffered from depressive and personality disorders whereas Dr. Rotenberg diagnosed appellant with only a personality disorder. Respecting Dr. Rotenberg’s opinion on appellant’s competency, the Commonwealth questions the standard for competency employed by the doctor. The Commonwealth offers that the better measure of appellant’s mental state may be found in those who observed appellant during the relevant time, <em>ie., </em>the testimony of Attorney Sodomsky and the observations of the trial court.

Taking an absolutist position, appellant argues that, before a waiver of mitigating evidence can be deemed knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, counsel must investigate potential mitigating evidence and present that evidence to his client. Appellant poses that an individual cannot validly waive something if he has not been told what it is he is waiving. According to appellant, counsel’s performance can only be evaluated in light of the available mitigating evidence. Appellant points to <em>Strickland </em>and to <em>Wiggins v.

Referring to the mental health records from the Sierra Clinic, appellant argues that counsel was on notice that appellant suffered from mental health problems, and yet failed to investigate this critical area of inquiry. Appellant also argues that counsel had no reasonable strategy in failing to undertake <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>such an investigation, since counsel admitted that the bulk of his investigation was spent on the guilt phase and that he spent little time developing a penalty phase strategy. Appellant argues that the federal courts have concluded that the failure to prepare mitigating evidence is not a strategic choice between options, but an abdication of the minimum performance required of defense counsel. Finally, appellant argues that he was prejudiced by counsel’s failure, since even a cursory investigation would have revealed a “plethora of relevant and compelling mitigation evidence which he could have presented to his client in an attempt to educate his client as to the extent of the rights he was waiving and to convince his client that there was a compelling case to be made to the jury for life.” Appellant’s Brief at 57.</p>

Indeed, the Commonwealth notes, appellant did not testify at the PCRA hearing, and thus, he did not attempt to prove that the outcome of the waiver would have been different if only counsel had presented appellant with the case in mitigation he could have mustered. Thus, the Commonwealth concludes: “In light of the position Appellant took during the colloquy, what other choice did [trial counsel] have? ...

In that case, the defendant was “ambivalent” about the penalty phase, but “adamant” that counsel not present evidence suggesting that his mother was a bad parent, or “any kind of psychological testimony.” Counsel abided by the restriction and presented a truncated case in mitigation, painting a positive picture of the defendant, and the jury found a mitigating circumstance, albeit the jury returned a sentence of death. On post-verdict motions, the defendant claimed that his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to ignore the restrictions he placed upon them and develop further mitigation evidence, including evidence in the areas he specifically ordered them not to pursue. In rejecting the claim, the <em>Rega </em>Court noted that while certain jurisdictions require capital counsel to conduct an investigation into potential mitigating evidence in instances where the defendant desires to waive such evidence, Pennsylvania is not among them.

N.T., 11/8/93, at 1040, 1050, 1053-54, and 1057. Additionally, the Commonwealth points out that any uncertainty surrounding whether the jury understood that aggravating circumstances needed to be found unanimously was put to rest when the jury foreman stated that “the aggravating, um, circumstance unanimously found is....” N.T., 11/10/93, 1060 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 1061 (“The aggravating circumstance unanimously found is the Defendant has been convicted of another murder committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">13</a> The PCRA court agreed with the Commonwealth and concluded that appellant waived this claim under <em>McGill.</em>

Specifically, appellant contends that he has proven his innocence, since the supposedly “uneontested” scientific and medical evidence presented at the PCRA hearing by his experts demonstrates that Donna Puksar committed suicide. According to appellant, the <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>case against him was insufficient without the testimony of Dr. Mihalakis and Dr. Mihalakis’s testimony was so scientifically unreliable that it could not support the conclusion that appellant murdered the two victims. Appellant then contends that the relatively weak Commonwealth case led the Commonwealth to misrepresent material facts by telling the jury that appellant wiped the gun clean, when it knew such evidence to be false, and by arguing that Donna Puksar knew nothing about guns and denying that the victims were experiencing marital discord. Appellant concludes that the evidence in this case was so unreliable and untrustworthy as to violate due process.</p>
    <p id="b331-5" data-blocks='[["BL_331.5",331,[210,986,1157,690]]]'>Appellant’s argument in this regard is essentially a jury argument, and not a viable claim under the PCRA. The PCRA does not recognize “miscarriage of justice” as a distinct, standalone constitutional claim. Moreover, all of these arguments have been discussed in some fashion above, and there is simply no reason to relitigate them via appellant’s catchall reiteration. Furthermore, the Commonwealth literally had nothing to prove at the PCRA hearing, as it was appellant’s burden to prove that his counsel acted ineffectively. Therefore, the Commonwealth did not need to “contradict” appellant’s experts in order to prevail; and certainly, the Commonwealth’s decision not to present contrary evidence did not establish appellant’s “innocence.”</p>
