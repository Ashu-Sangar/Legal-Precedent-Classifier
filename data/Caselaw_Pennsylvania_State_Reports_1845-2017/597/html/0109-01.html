The police investigation centered on Appellant upon the discovery of his possession and use of Mr. Miller’s credit cards as Appellant traveled with another trucker, Monica Manion. Ms. Manion related to police that: Appellant was driving Mr. Miller’s rig in a time-frame near the time of the victim’s death as determined by a medical examiner; Appellant parked the trailer at a truck stop in Kuhnsville in the location where the victim’s body was later discovered; and Appellant gave her a flashlight belonging to the victim. Upon his apprehension, Appellant confessed to having shot Mr. Miller in the back and to having taken his rig and various items of his personal property. The Commonwealth charged Appellant, <em>inter alia, </em>with criminal homicide and robbery and furnished notice of its intent to seek the death penalty.</p>

Attorney Charles was permitted to withdraw, however, in light of an asserted conflict of interest arising from Appellant’s complaints lodged against him relative to the representation. Initially, Attorney Charles was replaced by other members of his office. He maintained, however, that the conflict was shared by his staff, a matter which he ultimately raised before this Court. Then-Chief Justice Nix convened a conference with Attorney Charles, the two appointed assistant public defenders, and the district attorney, and he directed the attorneys to convey to the trial judge his suggestion that the judge should reconsider his order requiring the assistant public defenders to represent Appellant. The attorneys complied, and the trial court appointed new counsel, Charles Sieger, subject to a $3,500 fee cap and, apparently, a $500 limitation on available reimbursement for investigative services.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The trial court also rescheduled trial, which commenced twenty-two days later.</p>

Appellant testified in his defense, admitting to having taken possession of the victim’s tractor-trailer and credit cards, but indicating that his confession was falsely given on account of threats directed toward his intimates by a personal adversary.

Appellant claims that this timing issue was irreversibly determined by Chief Justice Nix, in response to the Commonwealth’s argument that trial already was overdue and that the public defender’s application was interposed solely to delay trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Appellant asserts that, in response, and on account of the attitude and interests of Attorney Charles and his staff, the public defender’s office bartered a short-term trial date in return for the authorization of the desired withdrawal, without providing Appellant any say in the matter.

Particularly as the PCRA court’s opinion focuses on the merits of the underlying claims of trial court error, we will review the opinion and arguments on such terms. Again, however, as with other claims of trial court error and ineffective assistance of trial and post-verdict counsel discussed below, we consider these underlying aspects solely as a means of addressing the only potentially extant claim' — that of deficient stewardship on the part of counsel on direct appeal. <em>Accord, e.g., Commonwealth v.

If such proceedings had resulted in the irrevocable setting of a trial date, Appellant’s position might carry more force. However, the PCRA court’s reasoning encompasses an essential finding that a future continuance, based on developing circumstances as might be conveyed by Appellant’s substitute counsel, was not foreclosed. We believe that, in resolving this factual matter, inference served a critical role, in the absence of persuasive direct evidence. Here, there is abundant evidence that Chief Justice Nix’s central concern was the withdrawal of counsel, and that the discussions of trial timing were collateral.

Here, by contrast, counsel of record for Appellant was noticed and present for all relevant proceedings. Although such counsel had styled the matter as an adversary proceeding against the client, the interests of counsel and the client were aligned insofar as both favored the withdrawal, and the PCRA court’s apparent conclusion that counsel had not completely abandoned Appellant’s interests in all other respects is supported by fair inferences from the record. <em>Appel </em>concerned a competency proceeding, <em>see Appel, </em><a href="/f3d/250/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="250 F.3d 203" data-case-ids="11095818" data-case-paths="/f3d/250/0203-01">250 F.3d at 218</a>, a matter substantially different from the substitution of counsel with the defendant’s approval.</p>

In support of his argument, Appellant references a line of cases arising principally out of Florida, exemplified by <em>Makemson v.

Additionally, Appellant asserts that the PCRA court wrongly considered each facet of his claim of constructive denial in isolation, thus undeiweighting the cumulative significance of all aspects. Appellant further develops that trial counsel amassed a significant disciplinary record relative to his performance in other matters, which Appellant suggests is a reflection on counsel’s credibility and competence.</p>

He complains that trial counsel failed to travel to any of the many states involved in the investigation to speak with any of the dozens of witnesses mentioned in the police reports, or even to interview many of the local persons also mentioned in the reports, including pimps, prostitutes, or alternate suspects. For example, Appellant develops that trial counsel testified that Tammy Schenkel was a crucial witness because she was a prostitute; she had a pimp with a .38 caliber revolver; and, according to her statement to the police, she had a sexual encounter with the victim shortly before his death. <em>See </em>N.T., May 17, 2000, at 55-57. Although he never spoke with her before trial, counsel identified Schenkel as an alibi witness, <em>id. </em>at 53, but was only able to find her after trial, <em>see id. </em>at 54. Appellant also discusses two other individuals, Gary and Debbie Paquette, who assertedly acted as pimp and prostitute, possessed guns, and also were subjects of the police investigation before it centered upon Appellant. <em>See </em>N.T., May 17, 2000, at 65-79 (reflecting trial counsel’s post-conviction testimony concerning the Paquettes). Appellant contends that the reports projected significant doubts concerning his guilt, referencing a litany of federal decisions in which criminal defense attorneys were deemed ineffective relative to their guilt-phase investigation. <em>See </em>Principal Brief for Appellant at 46-47 (citing cases). Centrally, Appellant claims that counsel failed to so impeach the prosecution’s theory by showing that there were numerous other suspects who had motive, opportunity, and the means to commit the offense. Whether this asserted failure resulted from the objective conditions under which trial counsel labored, or from his own ineffectiveness, Appellant contends that it resulted in a deprivation of his right to effective counsel secured by the federal and state constitutions.</p>

Given the importance to the defense of a more precise determination of the time of death, Appellant asserts that competent counsel would have retained a forensic pathologist to provide expert testimony. On post-conviction review, he has now presented a declaration from Dr. Jonathan Arden, First Deputy Chief Medical Examiner for the City of New York, who reviewed the medical examiner’s testimony. Appellant complains, however, that Dr. Arden’s review was significantly hampered by the fact that the autopsy report, photographs, and medical examiner’s files were not made available to his current, post-conviction counsel. As a result, Appellant reports, Dr. Arden was unable to reach any definitive conclusion with respect to the validity of the medical examiner’s estimate of the time of death. Dr. Arden did indicate, however, that there are significant questions as to that estimate:</p>
    <blockquote id="AK9" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[316,1343,1119,745]]]'>Dr. Mihalakis testified that in his opinion the decedent died approximately five to six days before the autopsy was conducted on October 26, 1988. Without having available to me the autopsy report and photographs and the medical examiner’s file, I cannot reach any conclusion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the validity of this estimate. There are, however, several factors described in Dr. Mihalakis’ testimony, particularly relating to the degree of decomposition of the decedent’s body, that suggest the possibility that an estimate of a later time of death would be more accurate. The lack of access to the materials on which the medical examiner relied precludes me from analyzing all of the relevant data and reaching any conclusion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.</blockquote>

Appellant also presented a declaration from a crime scene analyst, Dale Ñute, Ph.D, who, based on a review of photographs of the victim’s body as it was found, opined that the body would readily have rolled if the truck was driven at any speed or around curves or <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>corners. According to the declaration, Mr. Nute also believes that a number of the physical findings are inconsistent with such movement, thus supporting his defense that Mr. Miller was killed at the location where the body was found, and demonstrating the falsity of Appellant’s confession to having killed Mr. Miller at a remote location. Further, the declaration reflects that Mr. Nute is also of the opinion that the medical examiner’s files may contain information that has a bearing on his theory as well. Appellant complains that, because the medical examiner’s files were not made available to his present counsel, he is unable to demonstrate the full extent of the prejudice that flowed from counsel’s deficient performance. Nevertheless, he contends that any evidence that would have led the jurors to question whether Mr. Miller was not killed until October 21, or that the victim was killed after the rig was returned to the location in which it was found, would give rise to a reasonable likelihood that Appellant would be acquitted on the basis of his alibi.</p>

According to the Commonwealth, in light of all the evidence presented to establish and refute the Commonwealth’s position concerning the date and time of Mr. Miller’s death, Appellant’s assertion that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call experts to rebut the prosecution’s theory is untenable.

Further, it develops that the introduction of the weapons was relevant to establish several matters, forming part of the history of the case in tracing the movements of Appellant before and after the murder; helping to establish the identity of Appellant; showing Appellant’s ability to readily obtain and dispose of guns; and corroborating his confession which he recanted at trial. Indeed, the Commonwealth emphasizes that this Court accepted that the weapons were relevant on such grounds at the direct appeal stage. <em>See Williams, </em><a href="/pa/537/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="138" data-cite="537 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="775574" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0001-01">537 Pa. at 20</a>, <a href="/pa/537/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="139" data-cite="640 A.2d 1251" data-case-ids="775574,7872109" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0001-01,/a2d/640/1251-01">640 A.2d at 1260</a>. The Commonwealth also suggests that, had it not presented to the jury the fact that Appellant had in his possession a .38 caliber gun that was not the murder weapon, it is likely that the defense would have claimed it was concealing exculpatory information. According to the Commonwealth, any prejudice revolving around the theft of the handgun was minimal, and the relevance far exceeded any prejudice. The Commonwealth also develops that, to avoid any confusion about the weapons, the trial court instructed the jurors that the weapons were not the murder weapons. <em>See </em>N.T., September 24, 1985, <em>et seq. </em>at 674. Additionally, the Commonwealth relies on this Court’s alternate, harmless-error disposition of the claim on direct appeal. <em>See Williams, </em><a href="/pa/537/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="537 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="775574" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0001-01">537 Pa. at 21</a>, <a href="/pa/537/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="640 A.2d 1251" data-case-ids="775574,7872109" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0001-01,/a2d/640/1251-01">640 A.2d at 1261</a> (“Even assuming it was error to have admitted these guns, in light of the overwhelming evidence of [Appellant's guilt, such error is harmless.”).
