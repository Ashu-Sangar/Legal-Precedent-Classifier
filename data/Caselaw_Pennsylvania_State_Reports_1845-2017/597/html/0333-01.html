Appellee’s experts also found historical and persisting adaptive deficits in both general and specific areas, including conceptual, social, and practical domains; communications; motor skills; functional academics; self-direction; self-management; self-care; health; safety; and work skills. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., July 30, 2007, at 56-78, 150-206.

While the Commonwealth recognizes the deference due to the jurist to whom a recusal motion is directed, it asserts that this Court is in at least equally as good a position to adjudge appearance matters and effects on public confidence. Therefore, the Commonwealth argues that this Court need not defer to the PCRA court’s judgment in this regard.</p>

According to the Commonwealth, the PCRA judge’s 1993 opinion clearly establishes that she felt capable of rendering impartial decisions of law, but not of fact. Furthermore, the Commonwealth stresses that the factually-laden question of whether Appellee is a mentally retarded person was strongly contested at the <em>Atkins </em>hearing. In this regard, the Commonwealth catalogues the evidence that it believes should have controlled the outcome, including: the testimony from its experts that Appellee is not presently mentally retarded under prevailing definitions due to improvements in his adaptive abilities; the recorded conversations from prison in which Appellee demonstrated such abilities; and the evidence of Appellee’s criminal sophistication. The Commonwealth also alludes to the PCRA judge’s actions as militating toward a finding that disqualification was warranted, including her decision to initially grant post-conviction relief from Appellee’s death sentences without a specific <em>Atkins </em>hearing, and her skepticism concerning the relevance of Commonwealth evi<a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>dence tending to show Appellee’s criminal sophistication. According to the Commonwealth, even Appellee believed that the PCRA court favored him, as, in another recorded prison telephone call, he mused that if the PCRA judge were removed from the case, he would surely be put to death.</p>

Appellee also develops the factual context of the incident of which the Commonwealth complains, coupled with the explanation that it is nearly impossible for a judge to preside over a hearing or trial lasting several days — particularly in an emotionally charged case such as the present one — without saying something that one party or the other would find objectionable. Appellee asserts that such comments have never been thought to form a basis for recusal. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Additionally, Appellee emphasizes that the PCRA court duly conducted the evidentiary hearing directed by this Court, affording both parties ample opportunity to develop their respective positions on the <em>Atkins </em>question. With regard to Appellee’s recorded conversation concerning his fear of a greater probability of being put to death should the PCRA judge step down, Appellee indicates that such expressions by a litigant should have little or no bearing upon a judge’s personal decision on a disqualification motion or the appellate review of such a determination. Finally, Appellee advances the alternative position of the PCRA court that the Commonwealth’s recusal claim is waived.</p>

The rubric she employed is consistent with language <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>used by this Court in pertinent opinions. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
