When asked whether treatment with antipsychotic medications was in appellee’s best medical interest, Dr. O’Brien responded that this would be “the treatment of choice” given the symptoms appellee was presenting. <em>Id. </em>at 37. Finally, when asked whether there was “any specific medication that [he] would advise the Court as absolutely appropriate,” Dr. O’Brien responded that he “wouldn’t dictate a specific choice of medication to a treating clinician because it’s up to the clinician to assess the patient and then work with the patient to identify a medication, or treatment regimen that would have therapeutic benefit and few, if any, side effects.” <em>Id. </em>at 42.</p>

This provision, perhaps more than any other contained in the PCRA, reflects the General Assembly’s recognition that the reason why convicted defendants are permitted to seek collateral relief is “not to provide convicted criminals with the means to escape well-deserved sanctions, but to provide a reasonable opportunity for those who have been wrongly convicted to demonstrate the injustice of their convictionfs].” <em>Peterkin, </em><a href="/a2d/722/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="722 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="11773538,765982" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0638-01,/pa/554/0547-01">722 A.2d at 643</a>.

The jury’s lawful verdict here was death, a verdict that became final when appellee’s convictions and sentence were affirmed on appeal. That judgment and sentence have not been executed, nor can they be executed so long as a PCRA petition, which appellee never authorized, sits in stasis in perpetuity — operating not as a collateral vehicle to secure relief from unlawful confinement, but as a roadblock to the execution of a lawful judgment. Moreover, at the hearing on the Commonwealth’s Motion to Compel, the Commonwealth’s psychiatric expert, Dr. O’Brien, testified that it was his opinion that appellee’s symptoms would not improve if left untreated. The defense expert psychologist, Dr. Russell, did not offer any testimony inconsistent with Dr. O’Brien’s opinion in this regard, nor did the PCRA court draw a contrary conclusion. Thus, we must assume for purposes of the instant appeal that, if left untreated, appellee will never be able to determine for himself whether or not to pursue post-conviction relief.</p>

Unless and until a next friend is appointed, however, the litigation of the PCRA petition filed “on behalf of” appellee by a lawyer not authorized to file the petition may not proceed, and the merits of the claims raised therein will not be considered. Furthermore, the notion that finality is achieved by effectively holding the PCRA petition in abeyance assumes that PCRA review serves no substantive purpose.

Nothing in the PCRA requires that the failure to avail oneself of a state court collateral attack be knowing and voluntary, or even that the failure be the result of a competent decision. Since appellee himself did not pursue — or authorize pursuit of — PCRA relief, and no timely and appropriate next friend did so, unless appellee can pursue PCRA relief through the guise of the present litigation, or finds a claim that qualifies for one of the narrow exceptions to the time bar, then appellee’s ability to collaterally attack his convictions and death sentences in Pennsylvania courts should be deemed to have expired, and the question of medication to enable competency is moot. In short, if the case is final, as appellee’s counsel says, it may be final in a way that is different than he assumes: appellee <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>would have to be deemed to have exhausted the state collateral review system, which would require the Governor to issue a warrant of execution.

Moreover, it must be remembered that this case, unlike <em>Sell, </em>involves interests that are important to appellee, and not merely to the Commonwealth and society. We do not think <em>Sell </em>requires the strict showing the PCRA court imposed.</p>

Preliminary, it is important to note that the PCRA court did not deem Dr. O’Brien’s testimony in this regard to be incredible. As the Commonwealth notes, Dr. O’Brien testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that appellee would respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication. Indeed, Dr. O’Brien concluded that appellee’s prognosis, after treatment with such medication, was “excellent.” Dr. O’Brien’s opinion was not ephemeral, as it was based in part on his observation that appellee had been successfully treated in the past with such medications. Appellee’s counsel’s reliance on Dr. O’Brien’s testimony as to there being no way to know for certain how one will respond to any given medication is a red herring. When considered in its entirety, Dr. O’Brien’s testimony on this point made clear that the psychiatric community has been able to calculate the statistical likelihood of certain therapeutic responses as well as certain side effects of a variety of different antipsychotic medications. With respect to appellee, Dr. O’Brien could be more certain of the drugs’ likely effectiveness because of appellee’s positive response and the absence of serious side effects while taking Thorazine, an older antipsychotic medication with a higher side effect profile. Dr. Russell, the defense’s expert psychologist, who was not a medical doctor, did not contradict the above testimony from Dr. O’Brien, nor could he (at least with respect to the likelihood of side effects), <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>as the PCRA court declined to qualify him as an expert with respect to the effects of such medication.</p>

The Commonwealth further notes that the involuntary administration of such medication would only be necessary if appellee refused to take the drugs orally, consistent with the course of treatment that Dr. O’Brien would recommend.

The Commonwealth suggests that the PCRA court erroneously substituted its own “speculation” for Dr. O’Brien’s uncontradicted testimony. Commonwealth’s Brief at 40.

Indeed, the Court specifically distinguished this particular purpose of administering medication from different purposes and explicitly mentioned “purposes related to the individual’s dangerousness” as distinct. <em>Sell, </em><a href="/us/539/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="539 U.S. 166" data-case-ids="8897706" data-case-paths="/us/539/0166-01">539 U.S. at 182</a>, <a href="/us/539/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="539 U.S. 166" data-case-ids="8897706" data-case-paths="/us/539/0166-01">123 S.Ct. 2174</a>. Consequently, we are puzzled by the PCRA court’s mention, in its analysis under the fourth factor of <em>Sell, </em>that appellee supposedly had been found not to be a danger to himself or others. The PCRA court’s conflation of the two inquiries is particularly troubling given Dr. O’Brien’s uncontradicted opinion that antipsychotic medication would be the most appropriate treatment for appellee. We therefore find that the PCRA court erred in concluding that treating appellee with antipsychotic medication would be medically inappropriate. In conclusion, because we find that all four factors of the <em>Sell </em>test have been satisfied, we hold that the PCRA court erred in determining that federal due process precludes the involuntary administration of medication in order to advance the PCRA process in the instant case.</p>

First, counsel for appellee argues that the Pennsylvania Mental Health Procedures Act (“MHPA” or “the Act”)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> requires that the Commonwealth’s Motion to Compel Medication be denied.

If such medication renders appellee competent, the PCRA court is hereby directed to ascertain the following: first, whether appellee, in fact, wishes to proceed with the PCRA petition that Attorney Dunham filed without his authorization; and, if the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, then, second, whether appellee can assist counsel in pursuing PCRA <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>relief. If antipsychotic medication does not succeed in rendering appellee competent, the PCRA court is directed to consider whether the PCRA petition should be dismissed, assuming a suitable third party cannot be appointed to serve as appellee’s next friend.</p>

Although the High Court in <em>Sell </em>did ultimately vacate the Eighth Circuit’s judgment approving of Sell's involuntary medication, the reason was not because the Court found the Government’s basis for involuntarily medicating Sell to be insufficient. Rather, the High Court remanded the matter in order to develop the record relative to the four factors it set forth as the test to be applied by the trial court in the first instance. As for the Government’s interest in restoring Sell’s competence to stand trial, the Court specifically directed that the Government could continue to pursue its request for forced medication on those grounds. <em>See Sell, </em><a href="/us/539/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="170" data-cite="539 U.S. 166" data-case-ids="8897706" data-case-paths="/us/539/0166-01">539 U.S. at 186</a>, <a href="/us/539/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="171" data-cite="539 U.S. 166" data-case-ids="8897706" data-case-paths="/us/539/0166-01">123 S.Ct. 2174</a>.

      <em> </em>The case before us presents much stronger facts against involuntarily medicating Sam, than those found lacking by the Supreme Court in <em>Sell. </em>In both cases, the defendants were and are not a danger to themselves or others.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> In <em>Sell, </em>the government risked the potential that, if it could not medicate Sell, it would be unable to convict him of attempted murder because the evidence against him could become stale <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>prior to his regaining competency to stand trial.

    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[201,590,1157,1759]]]'>The government’s interest in protecting the public in <em>Sam </em>is drastically less important than it was in <em>Sell, </em>as Sam has been tried, convicted, and sentenced for the crimes at issue, and will remain incarcerated for the balance of his life, without the possibility of parole. Moreover, as the government has already met all of its burdens of proof for conviction and sentencing; the risk of the loss of evidence falls squarely on Sam, who has the burden of demonstrating his right to relief under the PCRA. Additionally, I reject the Majority’s argument that the Commonwealth has demonstrated a two-fold “important” government interest in compelling medication: first, in order to secure society’s interest in the finality of the judgment of sentence, which has been delayed for over fifteen years, and second, to provide Sam the ability to exercise his rights under the PCRA. I find neither of these interests sufficiently important to impinge upon the vital liberty interest at stake. In fact, I find that both of these justifications are merely an attempt to obfuscate the real “finality” that is before us — the Commonwealth’s desire to put Sam to death. Compelling medication so that Sam can pursue collateral relief, because it is ostensibly in his best interest, belittles the significant liberty interest that is at stake in this case. Clearly, Sam has as much of an interest in avoiding an unwanted and forced drugging as he has in pursuing collateral relief. While, as posited by the Majority, there is certainly a governmental interest in carrying out the sentence this interest simply cannot be sufficient to trump the important liberty interest in avoiding forced medication, considering that the governmental interest in bringing Sell to trial was insufficient to overcome his liberty interests based on the record in <em>Sell. </em>Put differently, if the need to try Sell was insufficient to overcome his constitutional right to his bodily integrity, the need to execute Sam is also insufficient.</p>

The substantial liberty interest in this case compels that any exception to applying the <em>Sell </em>test must be confined to the exceptions set forth by the United States Supreme Court, i.e., the Commonwealth must demonstrate that Sam is a danger to himself or others or that there is a grave health risk at stake.
