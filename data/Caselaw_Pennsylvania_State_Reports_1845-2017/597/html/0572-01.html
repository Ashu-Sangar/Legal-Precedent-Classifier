In forwarding his <em>Batson </em>claim, appellant makes a number of distinct arguments that require separate discussion. Appellant first argues that McMahon violated <em>Batson </em>and its progeny in three ways, namely: (1) by failing to provide a race-neutral reason for striking three particular black venirepersons; (2) by giving pretextual reasons for striking two other black venirepersons; and (3) by striking black mothers from the venire but neither white mothers nor black women with no children. In addition, appellant challenges two evidentiary rulings that the PCRA court made at the hearings it held on his <em>Batson </em>claim. In particular, appellant claims that the court erred in excluding: (1) comments that Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham made about the McMahon videotape at a news conference held at the time of its release; and (2) statistical evidence of McMahon’s jury selection practices in other cases.</p>

Because the prosecutor chose not to strike a white venireperson who exhibited even greater reluctance, the <em>Turner </em>court deemed the prosecutor’s explanation pretextual.

Ms. Serrano testified that a few weeks after the murder of Alvin Tyler, appellant told her that he, Sondee Harmon, and Raul Serrano (Ms. Serrano’s brother) had committed a robbery at Tyler’s house and that “there was a struggle” among them. N.T., 11/2/88, at 897. When asked why she did not immediately report this information to the police, Ms. Serrano testified that appellant “had threatened me so many times, he had told me that if a woman ever jerked him, any woman, she would pay, and me specifically, that my brother would be the first to <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>go.” <em>Id. </em>at 899. When the prosecutor asked whether she believed him, Ms. Serrano responded: “Of course, I believed him. I seen what he had done before. I knew what he was capable of.” <em>Id. </em>at 900. At this point, defense counsel objected and requested a mistrial, but the trial court allowed the testimony, reasoning at a sidebar conference that it was “relevant to why she was afraid of him.” <em>Id. </em>Therefore, as trial counsel actually made the desired objection, the first instance of prior “bad acts” testimony does not support appellant’s underlying ineffectiveness claim. Moreover, the evidence plainly was proffered for a purpose other than to show criminal propensity and, thus, was relevant.</p>

Mr. Serrano testified that, on July 8, 1987, seven months after the murder and robbery, he described the crimes in a written statement to police. Serrano further testified that he had been “afraid to tell anybody” and believed that appellant “would do something to me.” N.T., 11/3/88, at 1018. Serrano, however, did not testify to any prior actions whatsoever on the part of appellant that inspired his fear. Because it did not mention “other crimes, wrongs, or acts,” Serrano’s testimony does not implicate Rule 404 and, therefore, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object thereto on other crimes / criminal propensity grounds.</p>

Brown testified that she did not immediately report her knowledge of appellant’s involvement in Tyler’s murder because she was afraid of appellant. N.T., 11/4/88, at 1112. Brown further testified that she was afraid of appellant “because [of] the things that he used to do to his girlfriends, he used to hurt them pretty bad. I didn’t want to be put in any chains [ ], so I just left it alone.” <em>Id. </em>Again, this evidence was relevant to explain Brown’s delay in relaying what she knew. Indeed, the day before Brown testified, the trial court had overruled an objection to Anna Serrano’s references to appellant’s prior threatening and vio<a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>lent behavior, reasoning that the testimony was “relevant to why she was afraid of him” and, in turn, to why she did not immediately implicate appellant in Tyler’s murder.

As Brown’s reference to appellant’s violent behavior was relevant for the same reason, the trial court would properly have overruled an objection by trial counsel if it had been made.</p>
    <p id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.5",663,[198,708,1157,990]]]'>Moreover, in subsequent testimony given the day before Brown testified, Ms. Serrano elaborated on the violent nature of her relationship with appellant. In particular, Ms. Serrano testified that appellant: (1) “throwed [her] down the stairs” more than once; (2) “put a gun to [her] head, and then asked [her] had [she] said [her] prayers lately”; (3) “pulled [her] arm out of place”; and (4) “swelled [her] a couple times,” including one occasion on which he “swelled up [her] head” so severely that she sought treatment at a hospital. N.T., 11/3/88, at 949-50. In addition, when asked more generally whether she “knew [appellant] had no problem with physical violence towards women or [her]self,” Ms. Serrano responded, “Absolutely.” <em>Id. </em>at 950. Thus, when Brown made a passing reference on the stand to appellant’s history of domestic violence, already fresh in the jury’s mind were detailed accounts of the injuries that appellant allegedly inflicted as provided by the very person who endured them.

This is especially true given the overwhelming evidence against appellant that the Commonwealth presented at trial. That evidence included the eyewitness testimony of two co-conspirators; the testimony of two other witnesses, including Anna Serrano, the mother of appellant’s children, that he had bragged about committing the murder; Ms. Serrano’s further testimony that, just weeks prior to the murder, the victim had made sexual advances to her and that appellant had responded casually by <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>telling her not to worry; and a glove identified at trial as belonging to appellant that was found underneath the victim’s body. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Therefore, in light of all the foregoing, we find that appellant has failed to show that, had trial counsel objected to Brown’s testimony referencing appellant’s history of violent behavior, there is a reasonable probability appellant would not have been convicted. Having failed to demonstrate prejudice, appellant is not entitled to relief on his layered ineffectiveness claim based upon trial counsel’s failure to object to the testimony of Dareyne Brown.</p>

When Mrs. Cook testified that she and Ms. Serrano had discussed Ms. Serrano’s preliminary hearing testimony, defense counsel asked Mrs. Cook what Ms. Serrano told her concerning that testimony. At that point, the prosecutor objected and a sidebar conference ensued. At the conference, the prosecutor warned defense counsel that he was opening the door to cross-examination as to whether Ms. Serrano had contacted Mrs. Cook complaining of an upset stomach after testifying against appellant on three separate occasions in two other cases in which appellant was charged with murder. After defense counsel voiced his concern as to the jury’s learning that appellant had been charged with other murders, the trial court instructed that the prosecutor could cross-examine Mrs. Cook as he wished “as long as he does not earmark it as to any specific offenses.” N.T., 11/9/88, at 1205.</p>

At a pre-trial hearing held just two weeks before <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>the direct examination of Sondee Harmon, defense counsel plainly stated to the court that “[t]he general defense that [he] gleaned from Mr. Cook in [his] discussions was that Sondee Harmon and [ ] Raul Serrano are not telling the truth.” N.T., 10/17/88, at 6. Thus, from the beginning of trial, there was no doubt as to the general trial strategy of the defense. Moreover, trial counsel certainly knew, at the time he chose not to object, what his strategy was. Had defense counsel objected to the Commonwealth’s reference to Harmon’s prior statement to her attorney, the trial court would have been well within its discretion to overrule the objection in light of defense counsel’s previously announced intention to portray appellant’s co-defendants as falsely testifying against him in order to obtain a more lenient sentence. Ultimately, the claim boils down to an order of proof issue. There is no arguable merit to appellant’s ineffectiveness claim based on defense counsel’s failure to raise an objection to the Commonwealth’s reference to Harmon’s prior consistent statement. Because its underlying allegation of improper bolstering lacks arguable merit, the instant ineffectiveness claim necessarily fails. <em>See Sneed, supra.</em>

Therefore, the after-decided <em>Victor </em>case does not support appellant’s claim that the trial court erred in describing reasonable doubt as “much more serious than a possible doubt.” Counsel cannot be faulted for failing to raise a claim that had no support in the law at the time of trial. Even if a court someday were to uphold appellant’s preference, that would not make counsel ineffective in 1988 for acting in accordance with governing law. Because there is no arguable merit to his challenge to the trial court’s reasonable doubt instruction, appellant is not entitled to relief on this ineffectiveness claim. <em>See Sneed, supra.</em>

Although PCRA counsel’s questioning of trial counsel does reflect some overlap in the former’s development of the record with respect to these two issues, PCRA counsel did elicit testimony from trial counsel that is relevant to his failure to press Dr. Catherman on the exact time of death. <em>See </em>N.T., 12/13/02, at 30 (reflecting trial counsel’s recollection that Dr. Catherman "couldn’t be more precise with respect to minutes or even hours from 12:00 noon the following day or so”).

In view of the comments made during the training session, the common pleas judge granted a new trial, as he simply did not believe that a particular African American juror would have been peremptorily stricken if she had had all the same characteristics but had been white. <em>See Commonwealth v. Spence, </em>Sept. Term 1986, No. 3311, PCRA Hearing at 2-3 (C.P. Phila.

Similarly, in the <em>Basemore </em>case, the PCRA court (on remand) granted <em>Batson </em>relief after finding the prosecutor’s race-neutral explanations “insufficient” and observing that he was unable to explain some of the peremptory challenges. In that matter, the court recognized that disparate treatment of similarly situated jurors may indicate that the explanations offered are pretextual, and referenced examples in which McMahon had explained that he used a peremptory challenge against a black prospective juror because the individual was uneducated, or was living with his or her parents, or had been the victim of a crime, but had accepted white jurors with similar characteristics. <em>See Commonwealth v.

He indicates that he struck prospective juror 328, a black female, because she was a 24-year-old student living with her unemployed mother, it was unclear where the “money [was] coming from,” and that these circumstances “rose [sic] the stability factor.” <em>See </em>N.T. December 11, 2002 at 44. It is not evident, however, why a 24-year-old student may be considered in any respect unusual or unstable. As to prospective juror 203, a black male, McMahon states that he exercised a peremptory strike because the individual had apparently been fired from his job, a circumstance that, again, “goes to the stability factor.” However, there is nothing in the <em>voir dire </em>

October 19,1988 at 135-37 <em>(voir dire </em>of prospective juror 357), notwithstanding any “stability” concerns that these circumstances may have given rise to. Moreover, in the training tape McMahon specifically recommends using lack of employment as a pretextual basis for exercising a race-based peremptory strike. <em>See Jury Selection with Jack McMahon, </em>transcript at 70-71. Finally, as discussed, McMahon was unable to explain several peremptory strikes on race-neutral grounds. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 606-07.</p>

Additionally, of the nineteen peremptory challenges that McMahon exercised, fourteen (73 percent) were against African Americans. <em>Cf. Miller-El I, </em><a href="/us/537/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="311" data-cite="537 U.S. 322" data-case-ids="9191097" data-case-paths="/us/537/0322-01">537 U.S. at 342</a>, <a href="/us/537/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="312" data-cite="537 U.S. 322" data-case-ids="9191097" data-case-paths="/us/537/0322-01">123 S.Ct. at 1042</a> (observing that, where the prosecutor used ten of his fourteen strikes (71 percent) against African Americans, such a result was not likely due to “happenstance”). It is not a convincing answer to say that African Americans served on Appellant’s jury and that McMahon did not exhaust all his peremptories: in the videotape, he tailors his racially based jury selection theory to advocate allowing some blacks onto the jury where, as here, the defendant and the eyewitnesses are black. McMahon hypothesizes in this respect that, unless there are a few African Americans in the jury room, the white jurors might be inclined to adopt an apathetic attitude toward <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>the crime during deliberations. <em>See Jury Selection with Jack McMahon, </em>transcript at 58-59; <em>see also id. </em>at 59 (“I’ve always felt that a jury of like eight whites and four blacks is a great jury, or nine and three, because then you’re not going to get any of that [apathy] in there.”).</p>
    <p id="b694-5" data-blocks='[["BL_694.5",694,[281,603,1162,195]]]'>In light of all of these circumstances, I would conclude that the PCRA court’s decision to credit McMahon’s explanations was clear error and would, accordingly, find that Appellant carried his burden under either <em>Swain </em>or <em>Batson.</em>
