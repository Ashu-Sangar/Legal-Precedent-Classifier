Does the Superior Court’s published decision contravene the precedent of this Court in that it grants relief based on a legal theory-that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a constitutional right to consult with counsel prior to the initiation of adverse proceedings-that defendant did not raise in the PCRA court or on appeal?</blockquote>
