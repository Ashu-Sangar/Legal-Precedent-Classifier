      <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>On December 24, 1990, Appellant and two companions, Gregory Tancemore and David Green, drove to a Philadelphia bar known as Woody’s Playhouse, where approximately thirty other patrons were present. Appellant entered a restroom at the rear of the establishment, where he confronted an off-duty bouncer, pointing a .45 caliber semi-automatic handgun at his stomach. A struggle ensued, and Tancemore fired his 9 millimeter semi-automatic handgun into the ceiling as an apparent warning. Appellant and Tancemore fired more shots while fleeing from the bar, resulting in fatal injuries to the victims, Vernae Nixon and off-duty police officer Frederick Dukes. Tancemore drove away with Green and picked up Appellant, who had been running in a different direction, a few blocks away.</p>

At first, Appellant admitted that he had been present at the scene of the killings, but he denied firing any shots. Rather, he indicated that Tancemore carried both the 9 millimeter and .45 caliber handguns and had given him a .380 caliber pistol as the two entered the bar. He also stated that Tancemore told him to follow the bouncer, whom Tancemore believed was selling cocaine, to the restroom and detain him there at gunpoint. Appellant explained that the struggle began when the bouncer saw the handgun and continued until Tancemore began shooting from the front of the bar. Appellant indicated that, when he reached the front of the bar, Tancemore told him to “get the money” and that Tancemore had fired all of the shots.</p>

When confronted with this information, Appellant admitted that the .45 caliber handgun was his, that he had brought the gun to the bar, and that he had concealed the gun within Green’s apartment. Appellant also stated that, after reaching the front of the bar, he saw Officer Dukes draw his weapon, and that he fired three shots at the officer before fleeing the scene. Based upon these statements, witness interviews, and physical evidence, Appellant was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a), two counts of criminal conspiracy, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 903, and one count of robbery, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3701.</p>

Apparently dissatisfied with this representation, however, Appellant retained Oscar Gaskins, Esquire, to represent him shortly before trial was scheduled to commence. The trial court initially directed Attorney Ciccone to be present and cooperate with Appellant’s new attorney throughout the course of the proceedings. Subsequently, during suppression proceedings, the prosecutor expressed a concern regarding the eleventh-hour substitution of counsel and requested that the trial court conduct a brief colloquy with Appellant. Appellant indicated that he was satisfied with the representation of Attorney Gaskins, and that he was ready to proceed with the joint representation. <em>See </em>N.T. September 24,1991, at 6.</p>

    <p id="b457-5" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[206,510,1153,952]]]'>In its case in chief, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of several eyewitnesses, including the barmaid and off-duty bouncer, who described the events that occurred on the night of the murders and positively identified Appellant as a shooter. The bouncer also identified the weapon that Appellant had in his possession as a .45 caliber handgun. Several police officers and detectives testified concerning their roles in collecting evidence from the scene and the circumstances surrounding Appellant’s apprehension and questioning. Further, a ballistics expert described his tests of the bullets and cartridge casings recovered from the scene of the killings, as well as the weapons involved, concluding with his opinion that a bullet recovered from the body of Officer Dukes was a .45 caliber bullet fired from the handgun recovered from Green’s apartment. The medical examiner explained his findings from the post-mortem examinations of the victims. Finally, the Commonwealth introduced Appellant’s statements implicating himself in the crimes.</p>
    <p id="b457-6" data-blocks='[["BL_457.6",457,[202,1513,1158,848]]]'>The defense countered by contesting the identification of Appellant by the Commonwealth’s witnesses and challenging Appellant’s ownership of the murder weapon. The defense also presented testimony that Appellant’s statements to the detectives had been coerced by physical force, with several witnesses stating that his appearance at his arraignment was consistent with his having been beaten. Appellant testified on his own behalf that he had been drinking with Tancemore and Green prior to the killings; he had no knowledge of a planned robbery; although he carried a .380 caliber handgun into the bar, he did not fire any weapon; Tancemore and Green did the shooting; and the .45 caliber pistol was Green’s. Appellant also indicated that the detectives had physically assaulted him to obtain his incriminating statements. Finally, the defense presented several character witnesses who testified to Appellant’s reputation for truthfulness.</p>

      <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>The jury found Appellant guilty of all charges, and, in the penalty phase, the Commonwealth offered as aggravating circumstances that the killings occurred during the perpetration of a felony, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to other persons in addition to the victims of the offense, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7); and the defendant had been convicted of another murder committed either before or at the time of the offenses at issue, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll). With regard to the murder of Officer Dukes, the Commonwealth additionally argued that the victim was a peace officer killed in the performance of his duties. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(1). In support, the Commonwealth presented no testimony, but, instead, relied upon the record of testimony adduced at the guilt phase, the file reflecting Appellant’s convictions in the present matter, and a stipulation from defense counsel that Officer Dukes was in possession of his police identification, badge, and pistol when he was killed.</p>
    <p id="b458-5" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[275,1292,1162,1071]]]'>Appellant offered as mitigating circumstances his lack of a significant history of prior convictions, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1), his age at the time of the offenses, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4), and the catch-all mitigator, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). To support these factors, Appellant presented several character witnesses, consisting primarily of members of his family and his friends, who testified that: he was twenty-two years old at the time of the murders; he was a good student in high school and attended community college for a time; his father was absent throughout most of his childhood; he was a good father to his own child; he was amenable to discipline from his family members; and the murders were out of character for Appellant. The jury returned sentences of death, finding that the three aggravating circumstances unanimously found — that the killing occurring during a felony, the defendant created a grave risk of death to another person, and the defendant was convicted of another murder — outweighed the sole mitigating circumstance found by any juror — that Appellant had no significant criminal history.</p>

In a separate count, Appellant also argued that, where claims of error were not adequately preserved, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to make objections, and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to raise these and other matters on direct appeal. The Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that Appellant’s claims were either waived, previously litigated, or meritless. The PCRA court granted the motion, finding an evidentiary hearing unnecessary. In its opinion, the court noted that all of Appellant’s claims had been either waived or previously litigated, and, addressing the substance of each claim, found them to be without merit.</p>

In the first instance, the PCRA court’s existing decisions regarding prejudice do not include a specific comparative evaluation concerning the mitigation case actually presented with that which Appellant currently alleges should have been presented. Indeed, as the Commonwealth emphasizes, some of the life-history aspects of the post-conviction mitigation case were developed in the penalty phase of trial. For example, Mrs. Gibson testified in the penalty-phase of Appellant’s trial that he was raised in a very difficult neighborhood which she characterized as a “jungle,” with crack houses two doors away and across the street. N.T., October 10, 1991, at 11. Additionally, through Mrs. Gibson’s penalty-phase testimony, the jurors were also advised that Appellant’s father had left the household when Appellant was twenty-one months old and did not participate in his upbringing. <em>See id. </em>at 12. In light of the admission of such evidence at trial, the PCRA court’s indication that counsel should have uncovered Appellant’s “abandonment by father,” <em>see Gibson, </em>No. 2809, January Term, 1991, <em>slip op. </em>at 4 (4/26/2006), seems incongruous. Furthermore, some of Mrs. Gibson’s post-conviction testimony concerning Appellant’s youth appears to be facially in tension with her penalty-phase testimony that she was able to keep Appellant under control when he was younger, <em>see </em>N.T. October 10, 1991, at 11-12, raising apparent credibility questions which the PCRA court should have resolved expressly.

Appellant contends that this statement would have alerted counsel to the possible defense of voluntary intoxication or potential mitigating factors relative to the penalty phase. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 13 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(8)). Further, Appellant argues that the statement would have supported his trial contentions that no robbery had been planned and that Tancemore had committed the killings, as Green denied any knowledge of a planned robbery and heard Tancemore admit to having an argument with someone and shooting “a couple of people.” Appellant also maintains that Green’s statement was material to the defense, relying on the declarations of Attorneys Ciccone and Gaskins, who stated that the statement would have substantially affected their preparation and trial strategy. Although Appellant admits that there are aspects of Green’s statement that could have harmed his defense, he claims that the favorable portions of the statement far outweigh any potential harm and created a reasonable likelihood that a jury, upon learning of Green’s statement or hearing him testify, would have rejected the Commonwealth’s conspiracy theory.</p>

Furthermore, the Commonwealth stresses that it was apparent at the time of trial that Green had given a typewritten statement to detectives; therefore, there is no doubt that both trial and appellate counsel knew of the statement’s existence. The Commonwealth highlights that Appellant has never offered to prove that the Commonwealth intentionally suppressed Green’s statement, a necessary requirement of a <em>Brady </em>claim. The Commonwealth also stresses that Green’s statement was neither favorable nor exculpatory, but rather, powerfully incriminated Appellant. In this regard, the Commonwealth relies on the following passages from the statement:</p>

In fact, the Commonwealth highlights that Appellant freely stated that he had been drinking on the night of the offense, <em>see </em>N.T., October 7, 1991, at 78-80, which would have apprised counsel of the possibility of any relevant defense.

Appellant argues that such evidence was inconclusive and, if effectively challenged, could have raised a reasonable doubt as to Appellant’s guilt. In this regard, Appellant asserts that the trial testimony established that three weapons had been fired at the bar — a nine millimeter, a .45 caliber and Officer Duke’s pistol — and that no one testified definitively that Appellant possessed the .45 caliber handgun on the night of the murders. Given these uncertainties, Appellant argues that trial counsel’s admitted failure to obtain a copy of the “ballistics report,” <em>see </em>N.T. October 3, 1991, at 179, and retain an expert, as well as counsel’s failure to object to testimony indicating that one bullet could not be linked to a particular weapon due to its passage through someone’s head, <em>see </em>N.T.

In the present case, the Commonwealth observes that the remarks were limited to a single passage. The Commonwealth also distinguishes the federal <em>Lesko </em>decision as involving a situation in which the defendant did not testify at the guilt phase, and thus, his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was implicated, <em>see Lesko, </em><a href="/f2d/925/1527-01" class="citation" data-index="244" data-cite="925 F.2d 1527" data-case-ids="1789169" data-case-paths="/f2d/925/1527-01">925 F.2d at 1544-45</a> (concluding that a prosecutor’s remarks about the defendant’s failure to express remorse in penalty-phase testimony “penalized the assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination”), and as entailing a scenario in which the prosecutor had asked the jury to punish the defendant for not apologizing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a>

      <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>Upon review of the parties’ arguments, although we believe that some of the prosecutor’s comments were ill-advised and approached the limits of appropriate advocacy, we agree with the PCRA court’s central conclusion that the prosecutor’s conduct, when viewed in context, did not so prejudice the jury such that it could not render a true verdict. We find the remarks concerning a lack of reciprocal discovery obligations to have been unnecessary but without significant prejudice; the asserted “vouching” to have been fairly responsive, <em>see generally Commonwealth v. Carson, </em><a href="/pa/590/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="245" data-cite="590 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="3851924" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0501-01">590 Pa. 501</a>, 530, <a href="/pa/590/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="246" data-cite="913 A.2d 220" data-case-ids="3851924,8436764" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0501-01,/a2d/913/0220-01">913 A.2d 220</a>, 237 (2006) (“[A] prosecutor must be permitted to respond to arguments made by the defense.”); and the claimed denigration of the defense to have been intemperate, but again, minimally prejudicial in terms of the overall trial. The prosecutor’s inaccurate questioning concerning a statement by Appellant at a prior hearing was the subject of an objection which was sustained by the trial court, and the present claim is not developed in terms of a challenge to trial counsel’s conduct in failing to seek further instructions or a mistrial. As the Commonwealth argues, the asserted victim-impact evidence was adduced during the course of appropriate questioning by the district attorney developing the factual circumstances of Appellant’s offenses, and again, the claim is not developed in terms of a failure on the part of trial counsel to seek particularized instructions or a mistrial related to the testimony which ensued. We do find that the arguments containing references to the victims’ families and his associated calls for justice approached the limits of appropriate advocacy at the time of Appellant’s trial, when victim-impact evidence was not an appropriate consideration in capital sentencing, <em>see supra </em>note 21. On direct appeal, however, this Court reviewed the full record and determined that the sentences imposed were not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, but rather, were “based upon compelling evidence that appellant killed two patrons in the course of a robbery in a crowded bar,” <em>Gibson, </em><a href="/pa/547/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="247" data-cite="547 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="468654" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0071-01">547 Pa. at 105-06</a>, <a href="/pa/547/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="248" data-cite="688 A.2d 1152" data-case-ids="468654,7366050" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0071-01,/a2d/688/1152-01">688 A.2d at 1169</a>, and our present review remains consistent with such prior determination. We also agree with the Commonwealth that the district attorney’s claimed invocation <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>of an uncharged aggravator was, in fact, a legitimate argument related to the Section 9711(d)(6) aggravator, <em>see </em>N.T. October 10, 1991, at 49-50 (referencing a desire on the part of Appellant not to be held responsible for his acts in connection with advancement of the in-perpetration-of-a-felony aggravator), and the comments concerning the age mitigator were proper to the extent that they did not concern the prosecutor’s personal life.</p>

Additionally, in terms of the Fifth Amendment interests, the Pennsylvania decisional law offers a “demeanor” justification to authorize prosecutorial commentary on a capital defendant’s failure to show remorse, <em>see, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Second, even if the Commonwealth proves the defendant’s exceptionality among his brethren of first-degree murderers, the defendant is guaranteed an opportunity for the jury — and all it takes is one juror — to spare him from death for reasons having to do with mitigation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> The High Court’s decisional law in the wake of this paradigm has been subjected to constant “tinkering” (Justice Harry Blackmun’s famous coda)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> or “annual improvisation” (Justice Scalia)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> resulting in new or retooled rules— concerning who is eligible, level of proof, how the jury is to weigh the proof, what the jury is to be told, requirements of juror unanimity versus individual juror nullification, and so on.

By corollary, on collateral attack, a capital defendant can assail his prior counsel for failing to produce such evidence in mitigation. Thus, just as the jury may be required to hear whatever the defendant can muster concerning his personal history, including family background and environment, alleged substance abuse, supposed mental limitations, <em>etc., </em>capital defense lawyers are subject to accusations of incompetence for failing to present every shred of evidence respecting that “life history” at trial.

      <em>Bond </em>accurately describes the role of habeas cases from the High Court which consider <em>Strickland </em>claims under AEDPA. Such cases cannot break new <em>“Strickland </em>” ground, and cannot impose new standards upon counsel. Indeed, in AEDPA cases, the Court does not even render a pure <em>Strickland-</em>application holding; it renders an AEDPA holding, which is not the same thing.

Like Justice Eakin, I cannot join in footnote 11 of the Majority Opinion, which suggests there is some “empirical support” for the "notion" that mental health mitigation theories and evidence may sway capital jurors favorably. I think that is impossible to say. Moreover, given the stakes in the death penalty debate, and the consequent blurring of "academics” and "advocates,” I do not know which purported "empirical studies” are trustworthy or accurate. Generally, there is no peer-review vetting of law review articles, and many articles obviously are slanted to forward the views and biases of the authors, or with an eye toward advancing a particular claim. This Court has seen its share of sham "empirical” claims. Moreover, I believe there is at least equal force to the points made in Justice Eakin’s dissent. Most people with difficult childhoods, and even with residual mental health issues arising from those circumstances, do not become multiple murderers. It is just as easy to imagine a jury being insulted by the <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>argument that such factors should operate in some way to diminish crimes such as these.</p>

Of course, the ABA does much good work to advance the cause of justice. In recent years, however, the ABA has chosen to be a very active voice, almost invariably on the defense side, in criminal and particularly capital matters. Its activism in this regard has been pronounced enough to lead many prosecutors away from the organization. Notwithstanding the good work and dedication of the ABA generally, and its prestige, in this instance at least, I would keep in mind that its suggestions are those of a private organization, not answerable to the peoples voice or purse, offering one view, which does not necessarily account for the views of all with front-line experience in these matters.</p>

Since there are conflicting views on whether pre<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>senting mitigation evidence of a defendant’s negative attributes helps a defendant at sentencing, and some of Appellant’s witnesses already testified to his troubled childhood at sentencing, Majority Op., at 422, 951 A.2d at 1122, I do not see how it is reasonably <em>probable </em>the sentence imposed here would have been different if such negative mitigation evidence was presented. While the majority criticizes this opinion for relying on dissenting opinions from two United States Supreme Court opinions, Majority Op., at 421 n. 8, 951 A.2d at 1121 n. 8, the majority’s “authority” for the notion that presentation of mental health mitigation evidence can be beneficial for a defendant at sentencing is a law review article, three federal court decisions, and one Illinois state court decision — none of which are binding authority on this Court. Majority Op., at 422-24 n. 11, 951 A.2d at 1122-23 n. 11.

Under the circumstances, Gaskins’ decision to concentrate on the guilt phase was quite understandable and not unreasonable, particularly in light of Appellant’s tardiness in bringing him into the case, and the trial court’s apparent denial of Gaskins’ request for a continuance. It is not surprising Gaskins focused on pursuing a not guilty verdict; in fact, if he had not focused enough time on that purpose, he would have been deemed ineffective for not focusing on the guilt phase.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

Due to his late entry at Appellant’s request, it was reasonable for Gaskins to focus on exoneration rather than mitigation, and to present Appellant’s positive aspects as he did through extensive testimony at sentencing.
