Appellant makes some effort in this regard, but the Commonwealth is clearly correct that Ritchie’s statements spanning ten years have never lined up, featuring trivial, even bizarre contradictions. While credibility determinations are not ours to make, prejudice is for Appellant to establish, and on the record pertaining to Ritchie, that burden is substantial. Appellant seems to take prejudice for granted, in reliance on <em>Curry Perry, </em>and that case simply does not justify such a posture.

In particular, then as now, Appellant presented this Court with observations regarding Overstreet’s comment to testifying eyewitness Bertha that he thought he recognized the person Bertha identified as the shooter, as well as Overstreet’s identification of Appellant from a photo array. Then as now, Appellant claimed that Leroy’s testimony would have established that the shooter was wearing a hat pulled down low, and thus would have called into question the ability of the testifying witnesses, who undisputedly had lengthier opportunities to examine the shooter, to reliably identify him <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>later. Plainly, we found that Appellant’s assertions in these regards failed to establish sufficient prejudice to sustain an ineffectiveness claim, regardless of the claim’s arguable merit or the arguable absence of a reasonable basis for trial counsel to at least attempt to interview these witnesses.

It notes that by the time of this statement the Commonwealth had considerable evidence of Appellant’s guilt, and that, while they nonetheless investigated Frazier’s claims at least preliminarily, not only were they unable to verify them but indeed the people they questioned in connection with the story tended to undermine Frazier’s account, as well as reveal motives for Frazier to be less than truthful.

Specifically, in response to counsel’s inquiry concerning wheth<a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>er trial counsel “recalled] any trial strategy for failing to object to the death qualification,” trial counsel responded with a question of his own: “When you say ‘death qualification,’ you’ll need to clarify that for me.” N.T., 5/5/05, at 197. An exchange followed among PCRA counsel, the prosecution, and the court, after which trial counsel never responded to this inquiry. Thus, PCRA counsel did not avail himself of the opportunity to ask any specific questions regarding the nature of the allegedly deficient death-qualification process, trial counsel’s understanding of that allegation, or trial counsel’s lack of action regarding the same.</p>

In the affidavit, the juror in question asserted as follows: “My understanding during sentencing deliberations was that because we found Mr. Dennis guilty of murder, our only sentencing option was to sentence Mr. Dennis to death.

While the Commonwealth concedes that Ritchie was addressed in Appellant’s Supplemental Materials in Support of the Supplemental Amended Petition and in Appellant's Opposition to Commonwealth's Motion to Dismiss Petitioner’s Supplemental Amended Petition, it argues that these documents "are not amended PCRA petitions” and therefore are subject to waiver. The Commonwealth cites no authority for this suggestion that serial filings, approved, accepted, and evidently considered by the PCRA court, nonetheless are not either amended PCRA petitions unto themselves or proper annexes to same. Although our research discloses no entirely on-point precedent in this Court, the Superior Court has ruled, under similar circumstances, that such supplements may properly be considered as part of Appellant’s PCRA <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>petition for purposes of disposition and review. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Our foregoing discussion clearly emphasizes the liberal attitude toward pleadings manifest in Pa.R.Crim.P. 905, and how it has informed our decisions in <em>McGill </em>and progeny. Given the lack of meaningful argument to the contrary offered by the Commonwealth, this objection must fail here and anywhere else it is raised.</p>

In this case, the Commonwealth observes, not only would the trial court not have felt compelled so to rule, but indeed, under then-valid Pennsylvania law, the court was expressly precluded from providing a <em>Simmons-like </em>instruction. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

In connection with this argument, Appellant also seeks to relitigate, under the rubric of evidence withheld by the prosecution, trial counsel’s failure adequately to investigate witness Latanya Cason. Brief for Appellant at 42-43. Appellant contends that Cason misread the “military” time stamp on her Department of Public Works welfare check receipt, which read 13:03, and believed that this meant 3:03 rather than 1:03 and, accordingly, calibrated her memory of events that day two hours ahead of their actual occurrence. Appellant does not even endeavor to claim after-discovered evidence, or to identify ineffectiveness on the part of appellate counsel, basing his present argument precisely on the same time-stamped receipt he brought before this Court on direct appeal, which, he continues to argue, discredits her testimony that she saw Appellant more than two hours after the shooting only four miles away, and suggests instead that she overestimated the time by approximately two hours and therefore in fact saw Appellant four miles from the murder scene between 2:00 and 2:30 P.M. We rejected this argument in essentially its current form on direct appeal, <em>Dennis I, </em><a href="/a2d/715/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="216" data-cite="715 A.2d 404" data-case-ids="11705437,559548" data-case-paths="/a2d/715/0404-01,/pa/552/0331-01">715 A.2d at 408</a> (finding the proffered evidence insufficient to establish alibi, cumulative of other testimony at best, and the receipt on which it was putatively based not subject to <em>Brady </em>disclosure), and the claim therefore is previously litigated.</p>
