On September 28, 2002, police found the naked body of Greta Gougler, who was 69 years of age, lying on the floor of her home. Ms. Gougler’s body was severely bruised, and her mouth was covered with a towel. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was asphyxiation; in addition, the victim had been sexually assaulted. Appellant, who resided in the same neighborhood as the victim, was arrested on October 2, 2002, and charged with criminal homicide, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2501(a); murder of the first degree, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a); murder of the second degree, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(b); rape, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121(a)(1); involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3123(a)(1); robbery, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3701(a)(l)(i); burglary, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a); aggravated assault, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(1); criminal trespass, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3503(a)(l)(i); theft by unlawful taking, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3921(a); and receiving stolen property, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3925(a).</p>

In Appellant’s omnibus pretrial motion, he sought, <em>inter alia, </em>suppression of the statement that he had made to the police. After a hearing, Appellant’s motion was denied. Appellant then filed a motion alleging that he was incompetent to stand trial and seeking a continuance. At a competency hearing on April 15, 2005, two forensic psychiatrists, Dr. Lawrence Rotenberg and Dr. Timothy Michals, testified for Appellant and for the Commonwealth respectively. Dr. Rotenberg conclud<a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>ed that Appellant was not competent to stand trial because he suffered from “a personality disorder based on narcissistic traits,” which was temporarily obscuring his ability to deal with reality. Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”) Competency Hearing, 4/15/05, at 33-34; Letter to Defense Counsel from Dr. Rotenberg, dated 4/1/05, at 5. Dr. Michals disagreed with Dr. Rotenberg’s diagnosis, opined that Appellant had the mental capacity to participate in his own defense if he chose to do so, and accordingly concluded that Appellant was competent to stand trial. The trial court found Dr. Michals’s testimony more credible, based in part on the court’s prior interactions with Appellant at other pretrial proceedings. Accordingly, the court found Appellant competent to stand trial and denied his motion for a continuance.</p>

Appellant submitted several mitigating circumstances to the jury: impairment by crack cocaine; long history of cocaine usage; cooperation with law enforcement; positive adjustment to incarceration; and remorse. On May 3, 2005, at the close of the penalty phase, the jury sentenced Appellant to death. The jury found one aggravating circumstance (killing committed while in the perpetration of a felony) and one mitigating circumstance (long history of cocaine use), and concluded that the former outweighed the latter.

Most relevant to the instant case, this Court has held on several occasions that evidence of death by strangulation can be sufficient to establish the requisite intent for first-degree murder. <em>See Mitchell, supra </em>at 445; <em>Commonwealth v. Simmons, </em><a href="/pa/541/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="541 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="470745" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0211-01">541 Pa. 211</a>, <a href="/pa/541/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="662 A.2d 621" data-case-ids="470745,7863238" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0211-01,/a2d/662/0621-01">662 A.2d 621</a>, 629 (1995) and citations therein. We next address each element in turn.</p>
    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[208,701,1154,948]]]'>First, the Commonwealth had the burden of establishing that Ms. Gougler’s death was a homicide. Ms. Gougler’s body was autopsied; the autopsy report was admitted into evidence, and Dr. Samuel Land, the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy, testified at trial. Dr. Land’s testimony and the autopsy report established that Ms. Gougler died of asphyxia due to blunt force trauma to her neck, <em>i.e., </em>strangulation, most likely with the towel that the police found around her neck. The autopsy report further concluded that a contributory factor in her death was blunt force trauma to her head, and in addition, she sustained blunt force trauma to her torso and upper and lower extremities, as well as traumatic injury to her vaginal and anal areas. Appellant’s own forensic pathologist expert witness also testified that Ms. Gougler’s death was caused by asphyxiation and was appropriately classified as a homicide. Thus, the evidence indisputably supported the jury’s conclusion that Ms. Gougler’s death was a homicide.</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.6",365,[206,1726,1153,623]]]'>Second, the Commonwealth had the burden of establishing that Appellant was responsible for the homicide. The evidence at trial included Appellant’s written statement to police in which he admitted that he had killed Ms. Gougler after forcing his way into her home looking for money. Sean Peterson, one of Appellant’s childhood friends, testified that Appellant had confessed that he had killed Ms. Gougler. The DNA profile of sperm collected from a smear of blood and seminal fluid found on the victim’s thigh matched Appellant’s DNA profile. From all this evidence, the jury could properly conclude that Appellant was responsible for Ms. Gougler’s death.</p>

      <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>Third and finally, the Commonwealth had the burden of establishing that Appellant acted with a specific intent to kill. Dr. Land, the forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy on Ms. Gougler’s body, testified that her death was caused by strangulation, most likely with the towel that was found around her neck. Mr. Peterson testified that Appellant had admitted that he had strangled the victim after forcing his way into her home. In Appellant’s written statement to police, he admitted that he had forced, his way into Ms. Gougler’s home; covered her mouth with a towel, tied it, and then made it tighter; hit and punched her; removed her clothing; tied her up with her clothing and a phone wire; and left her tied up on the floor while he went upstairs to look for money. When he came back downstairs with the victim’s money, she was not moving. This evidence is sufficient to support the <em>mens rea </em>element of first-degree murder, <em>i.e., </em>a specific intent to kill. <em>See Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/459/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="459 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="481037" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0141-01">459 Pa. 141</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="459 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="481037" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0141-01">327 A.2d 124</a>, 127 (1974) (“The admitted acts of placing a knotted cord around the neck of an elderly woman and so rigging it as to strangle are consistent” with the specific intent to take the life of another human being and thus support a first-degree murder conviction.)</p>

Thus, Appellant presented a defense of diminished capacity due to voluntary intoxication. We have recently reiterated the following principles with regard to this defense:</p>
    <blockquote id="b366-6" data-blocks='[["BL_366.6",366,[314,1935,1121,421]]]'>[T]he mere fact of intoxication does not make out a diminished capacity defense.

Appellant then watched Ms. Gougler and waited for her to go into her home; when she had just entered her backdoor, he forced his way into her home after her, demanded money, and started “tussling” with her. The victim was yelling at Appellant not to hurt her. After putting a towel around her mouth and tightening it around the back, removing her clothing, and tying her up on the floor with the clothing and a phone wire, Appellant went upstairs and looked around, found some purses, and took money. When he came back downstairs, the victim was not moving, so he left via the back door, bought five more bags of cocaine, and smoked one in the alley. He then returned to the victim’s home, smoked some more, untied the victim (except for the towel around her neck), and started to clean up, including wiping some surfaces, and discarding the wire that was wrapped around her legs. When he thought he heard someone next door, he ran out the back door again and “got high some more.” Appellant’s Statement to Police, dated October 2, 2002, at 2.</p>

To the con<a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>trary, Appellant’s statement constitutes evidence of his capacity — at the time of the murder — to formulate a plan, to act deliberately in pursuit of that plan, and then to take steps to attempt to conceal his actions.
