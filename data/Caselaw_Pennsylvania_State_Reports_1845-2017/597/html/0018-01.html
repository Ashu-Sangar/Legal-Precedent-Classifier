In return for paying required assessments, the Guaranty Association Act allows insurers a credit against their tax liability under the state gross premiums and annuity considerations tax,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> or premiums tax. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 991.1711(a).

    <p id="b67-4" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[197,921,1156,787]]]'>The present appeal arises in the aftermath of 1991 legislative changes expanding the premiums tax to non-pension annuity premiums, <em>see </em>72 P.S. § 7902 (Historical and Statutory Notes), and changes to Guaranty Association policy reflecting substantially larger assessments attributable to annuity premiums, which previously had been relatively nominal. Apparently the new practices on the part of the Guaranty Association were part of its response to liabilities arising from large insurance company insolvencies. Against this background, Appellant, an insurance company dealing primarily in annuity contracts, sought premiums tax credit for the assessments against its annuity premiums. The present appeal centers on tax year 1993, in which Appellant claimed a credit of $165,475, based on 1991 and 1992 life insurance and annuity assessments.</p>

The majority initially developed that the premiums taxation statute allows an insurer a tax credit against its tax liability for a “proportionate part of the assessments described in section 1707” of the enactment. 40 P.S. § 991.1711(a). Section 1707 assessments, the court explained, include those necessary to fund each “account and sub-account” maintained by the Guaranty Association in furtherance of its functions, and two of the sub-accounts are (1) the annuity sub-account; and (2) the unallocated annuity sub-account, which includes nontaxable annuity contracts. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 991.1704. From this structure, the majority concluded as follows: “Because a tax credit is allowed for <em>all </em>assessments described in section 1707 and because section 1707 describes assessments necessary to fund taxable <em>and </em>non-taxable annuity accounts, ... an insurer is entitled to a tax credit for ‘a proportionate part’ of its assessments related to both taxable and non-taxable annuities.” <em>Northbrook, </em><a href="/a2d/890/1223-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="890 A.2d 1223" data-case-ids="8993417" data-case-paths="/a2d/890/1223-01">890 A.2d at 1226</a> (emphasis in original).

According to Appellant, Pennsylvania courts have consistently permitted parties to limit the issues available for consideration by a reviewing court, with the sole constraint being that litigants cannot stipulate to matters affecting the jurisdiction, business, or convenience of the courts. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 19-20 (citing <em>Parsonese v.

Appellant explains that, as a practical necessity, legal issues are routinely stipulated in tax cases, thus permitting the courts and the litigants to channel their focus toward disputed matters. Indeed, Appellant contends that such stipulations are an integral part of negotiations and preparation for litigation. Appellant also argues that its due process rights were impinged by the Commonwealth Court’s decision to overturn the stipulation, since Appellant lacked the opportunity to present legal argument or develop a record concerning subject matter that it believed to be undisputed. Since the only issue presented to the Commonwealth Court was whether annuity assessments are subject to tax credit, Appellant requests that we overturn the Commonwealth Court’s determination concerning the calculation of the proportionate part factor, which Appellant contends is contrary to the methodology employed in the longstanding practices of the Department of Revenue and the insurance industry.</p>

Judge Pellegrini dissented, opining that, regardless of references to annuity premiums in other provisions of the Guaranty Association Act, Section 1711(b) specifically excludes them from the computation of credits for assessments paid. Thus, the dissent concluded that the General Assembly specifically delineated which types of accounts could be utilized in determining the tax credit, annuities are not included, and the majority's contrary decision "rewrites the legislation.” <em>Northbrook, </em><a href="/a2d/890/1223-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="890 A.2d 1223" data-case-ids="8993417" data-case-paths="/a2d/890/1223-01">890 A.2d at 1227</a> (Pellegrini, J., dissenting).</p>
