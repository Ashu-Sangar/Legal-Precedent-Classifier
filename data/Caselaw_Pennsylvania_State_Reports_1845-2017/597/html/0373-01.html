Zhang recognized the number as one used in a previous robbery, and so he called the police. In response, the Burglary Detail Unit of the Philadelphia Police Department posted officers at the delivery address. Meanwhile, at the instruction of the officers, Zhang took an empty box to that address. When Zhang arrived, he was approached by two men who took his cell phone and then attempted to flee. One man escaped, but the second man, appellee Benjamin Greer, was thwarted by Zhang, who grabbed his clothing. Appellee and Zhang fell to the ground, causing Zhang to break his ankle. The police then apprehended appellee, who was charged with criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, and robbery.</p>

After two days of testimony, the jury began deliberations late in the afternoon of February 10, 2005, breaking after less than an hour that day. The jury resumed deliberations the following morning. The jury then sent a note to Judge Glazer, asking that certain testimony be read back and seeking clarification regarding the law of criminal conspiracy. The relevant testimony was read back to the jury, Judge Glazer gave a supplemental instruction, and deliberations resumed at approximately 11:00 a.m. That afternoon, the jury sent the first of two additional notes to Judge Glazer. The first note, which was signed by the jury’s forewoman and stated that it was written at 12:30 p.m., volunteered that the jurors had reached a verdict of not guilty on the robbery charge, but were unable to reach a verdict on criminal conspiracy and aggravated assault. The note also volunteered that the jurors were divided 10-2 in favor of guilt for conspiracy, <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>with jurors nine and ten favoring a not guilty verdict; and that juror number ten was the sole juror in favor of a not guilty verdict for aggravated assault. The note further volunteered that the holdout jurors “have reasonable doubt about evidence.” At no point had Judge Glazer inquired as to the numerical split of the jury or the identity of the jurors in the minority.</p>

Judge Glazer suggested issuing a jury charge deriving from <em>Commonwealth v.

Judge Glazer complied and the jury resumed deliberations at 2:05 p.m. Forty-five minutes later, at approximately 2:50 p.m., the court received a second note signed by the jury forewoman, entitled “Reason for Hung Jury.” The note volunteered that: juror number nine was “not convinced” of (1) the police account of how they actually apprehended appellee, and (2) “the discrepancy between” Zhang’s testimony and the police testimony; and juror number ten was “not convinced” that the evidence “conclude[d]” that appellee was “the actual perp.” Judge Glazer informed counsel of the note, this time also apparently revealing that it identified the holdout jurors. Judge Glazer suggested that he make “one last comment” to the jury and then take a verdict at 4 p.m. As the court and counsel were discussing the options, the jury was brought back into the courtroom.

Judge Glazer rejected the argument, noting that his <em>Spencer </em>charge was directed at the jury as a whole, and that “maybe [the two holdouts were] right and the other ten are wrong. You don’t know that. I don’t know.” In the court’s view, it had the power “to remind them <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>of their responsibility to serve and to deliberate and to listen to each other, and reach a verdict, if they can fairly do so.” At 3:53 p.m., the jury returned with a unanimous verdict of not guilty on the charge of robbery, and guilty on the charges of criminal conspiracy and aggravated assault. <em>Id. </em>at 90-95.</p>

The judge directed the jurors to keep deliberating. A few hours later, the jury reported that it was still deadlocked, without outlining the vote. The judge then issued an <em>Allen </em>charge which included an admonition to jurors in the minority: “if the greater number of you agreed on a verdict, the other jurors may want ask themselves about the basis for their feelings when a substantial number have reached a different conclusion.” <a href="/f2d/961/0892-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="961 F.2d 892" data-case-ids="1863133" data-case-paths="/f2d/961/0892-01">961 F.2d at </a>893 n. 1.

The panel then noted other factors that tended to show that the <em>Allen </em>charge was not coercive: the jury did not return the guilty verdicts immediately after the charge, but instead deliberated two more days; the jury failed to acquit on the one charge where the vote was initially 9-3 in favor of a not guilty verdict; the jury asked for trial testimony to be reread; and the judge told the jurors “not to ‘surrender an honest conviction as to the weight and effect of the evidence simply to reach a verdict.’ ” <a href="/f2d/961/0892-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="961 F.2d 892" data-case-ids="1863133" data-case-paths="/f2d/961/0892-01">961 F.2d at 894</a>.</p>

The majority stressed that the trial court here knew the division in the jury, the identity of the holdout jurors, and the reasons they favored not guilty verdicts, and also assumed as fact that the holdout jurors were aware that the judge knew their identities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The majority next looked to the trial court’s second <em>Spencer </em>charge. The majority recognized that the trial court had conveyed the essence of <em>Spencer, i.e., </em>that the jurors were to listen to each other, and try to reach a verdict, but they were free to maintain deeply-held beliefs and not to abandon them for just any reason. The majority appeared concerned, however, with the trial court’s reference to the jury being “close but no cigar,” and its direction that “[tjhis is not the time for people to stand on ego.” Ultimately, the majority opined that the court’s knowledge of the jury’s division, that a majority favored conviction, and the identity of the holdout jurors required that the otherwise proper <em>Spencer </em>charge be viewed in a different light, <em>i.e., </em>as being “directed specifically at the holdout jurors.” The majority cited <em>Sae-Chua </em>as the sole <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>support for its conclusion. Finally, adverting to other Ninth Circuit factors in cases involving <em>Allen </em>charges, the majority noted that, following the second charge, the jury had deliberated for only thirty-three minutes and did not ask that any testimony be read back before it returned its split verdict. In light of this “totality,” the majority concluded that the charge was coercive and granted a new trial. <em>Greer, </em><a href="/a2d/895/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="895 A.2d 553" data-case-ids="8431138" data-case-paths="/a2d/895/0553-01">895 A.2d at 559-60</a>.</p>

The defendant argued that the portion of the charge which directed jurors in the minority to listen with deference to the majority and re-examine their minority position implied two troublesome points: (1) that jurors in the minority should yield to the majority; and (2) that those without reasonable doubt (the majority) need not re-examine their position despite the existence of reasonable doubt in the mind of a minority juror. <em><a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="275 A.2d 299">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="275 A.2d 299">at 303-04</a>. <em>Spencer </em>noted that “each notion is contrary to the hallowed tradition of trial by jury” secured by both the federal and the Pennsylvania Constitutions. <em><a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="275 A.2d 299">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="275 A.2d 299">at 304</a>.

The Commonwealth argues that the supplemental charge here was proper under <em>Spencer, </em>and posits that <em>Spencer </em>instructions that would normally be considered non-coercive do not become coercive simply because the jury voluntarily reveals its numerical split and the identity of the holdout jurors. The Commonwealth maintains that the panel majority below plainly erred in relying upon non-binding Ninth Circuit authority because those decisions: (1) misapply the U.S. Supreme Court’s supervisory decision in <em>Brasfield, </em>which governs situations where the court inquires into the jury’s division, which did not happen here; (2) the decisions are contrary to the weight of authority in situations where it is the jury that volunteers its division,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> including decisions by prior Superior Court panels in such scenarios;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and (3) the decisions are contrary to this Court’s teachings in <em>Spencer. </em>The Commonwealth further notes that, in relying upon the Ninth Circuit cases, the panel majority failed to appreciate that the supplemental charges in those cases were some form of the <em>Allen charge </em>— i.e., a charge <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>directing jurors in the minority to reconsider their positions in light of the majority view. The trial judge here, in contrast, followed <em>Spencer </em>and did not so target the minority jurors. The Commonwealth further argues that the general rule that has emerged outside of the Ninth Circuit considers supplemental jury charges complying with ABA standards to be non-coercive provided that the jury disclosed the split voluntarily and the instruction does not focus on the minority jurors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The Commonwealth argues that the <em>Spencer </em>charge here was consistent with that generally prevailing rule.</p>

In this case, the Commonwealth submits, Judge Glazer’s supplemental instructions were neither coercive nor directed at the holdouts. Far from being coercive, Judge Glazer’s second <em>Spencer </em>charge informed the jury that it would be dismissed at the end of the day and would not be held over the weekend. The Commonwealth further notes that Judge Glazer’s charge was directed at the entire jury, not the holdouts, informing the entire jury of the importance of reaching a verdict, and asking all to further deliberate and try to resolve their differences while, at the same time, repeatedly emphasizing that no juror should surrender strongly held beliefs merely to reach a verdict. The jury was not told that it had to reach a verdict, and the minority jurors were not told to show deference to the majori<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>ty.

Echoing (indeed simply quoting) the reasoning of the panel majority below, appellee also invokes the Ninth’s Circuit’s <em>Sae-Chua </em>decision and argues that the minority jurors’ knowledge that the court was aware of their status means that the minority jurors would have construed the supplemental charge as being aimed solely at them.

Appellee argues that any <em>Spencer </em>charge should be deemed <em>per se </em>coercive in a case such as this, because the holdout jurors were a “substantial minority” (two of twelve), they were aware that the trial judge knew their identity as minority jurors, and they therefore would have interpreted any supplemental charge as being directed only at them, and not at the jury as a whole.

For one thing, the Ninth Circuit is out of step with the majority of federal circuits on the <em>Allen/Brasfield </em>question addressed in <em>Sae-Chua </em>and <em>Ajiboye. </em>But, more fundamentally, the cases are inapposite because they involve <em>Allen </em>charges, <em>i.e., </em>charges squarely addressed to minority jurors to reconsider their views precisely because they are in the minority. The whole point of <em>Spencer </em>was to remove that focus — as a supervisory matter of Pennsylvania law. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit cases are inapposite because they are also part of a line of cases deriving from <em>Brasfield, </em>which involved a per se federal supervisory rule prohibiting inquiry into a jury’s division. Pennsylvania is not a <em>Brasfield/Allen </em>jurisdiction. This Court has imposed no <em>per se </em>supervisory rule in Pennsylvania concerning inquiries into jury divisions, much less have we held that such a rule, once imposed, should be extended to <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>prohibit issuing non-coercive <em>Spencer </em>charges anytime the Court learns the identity of initial holdout jurors.</p>

Notably, in <em>Spencer, </em>this Court employed a similar approach to evaluate the effect of the <em>Allen </em>charge there issued. We engaged in that totality of circumstances analysis precisely because <em>Allen </em>charges “contain the[ ] potential abuses” of suggesting that minority jurors should yield to the majority, and that the majority need not re-examine their positions in light of the minority jurors’ views. <em>Spencer, </em><a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="275 A.2d 299">275 A.2d at 304</a> (emphasis omitted).

Rather, the trial court addressed the jury as a whole, and while repeatedly advising the jurors that they were not expected to surrender deeply-held views, reminded them of their duty and function, and directed them to continue to deliberate and to try to reach a verdict.

While the U.S. Supreme Court held in <em>Brasfield </em>that inquiry into the numerical division of a jury is inappropriate as a supervisory matter, and the Ninth Circuit equates any knowledge of the division as a basis to preclude giving an <em>Allen </em>charge, this Court has never held, for <em>Spencer </em>purposes, that the Court’s awareness of the jury’s division precludes issuing a non-coercive <em>Spencer </em>charge. Indeed, in <em>Commonwealth v. Moore, supra, </em>this Court recently found no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s issuing a Spencer-type of charge in a situation where the jury had volunteered that it was divided 11-1 on a penalty verdict in a capital case. The defendant in <em>Moore </em>argued that the charge placed an “impermissible burden on the holdout juror,” in effect instructing the holdout “ ‘to try to deliberate and see if you can make the agreement unanimous.’ ” In addressing the defendant’s argument premised upon the court’s awareness of the jury’s numerical division, we reasoned as follows:</p>

Although the trial court sought further information concerning the nature of the jury’s numerical division ..., the trial court did not utilize this information in the instructions that followed. Instead, the trial court focused upon the relatively brief amount of time that the jury had deliberated and instructed them to “[g]o back, have open minds, try to deliberate and see if you can make the agreement unanimous.” ... Although Appellant maintains that the trial court was speaking solely to the holdout juror, we conclude that the trial court’s instruction was directed to all of the jurors, particularly as the impetus for the instruction stemmed from the brief period of time that the jury had deliberated.</blockquote>

Again, unlike in the <em>Allen </em>situation (and the Ninth Circuit cases speaking to that situation), a proper <em>Spencer </em>charge does not address jurors in the minority separately, but directs all jurors to be open to reconsideration. More importantly, as a matter of logic, the jurors already are acutely aware of where they stand relative to the private jury vote— whether the specific outcome of that poll is revealed to the trial court or not. No doubt, jurors in a minority position always feel some form of pressure to bow down to the will of <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>the majority.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> By the same token, a charge to continue deliberating theoretically could cause jurors in a majority position to feel pressure to switch views, if only to get the matter over with.

Again, the court was careful to direct its charge to the jury as a whole, and emphasized, yet again, that jurors were not to surrender deeply-held beliefs merely to reach a verdict. Nor did the court suggest that jurors in the minority had a special obligation to reconsider, over and above that of all the jurors. Finally, the general thrust of the charge was rather modest. The court began this portion of the charge by stating, “I’m just going to ask that you go back for a little bit” and ended it by saying: “We’re going to ask you to go back and try because I think you can do it. But just keep an open mind. Listen to each other. Okay? Go on.” This hardly smacks of coercion. We see no abuse of discretion in the charge.</p>

The Commonwealth also argues that, because the note to the judge disclosing the jury's numerical division and the identities of the holdout jurors was prepared by the jury forewoman, it is “pure speculation” to assume that the other jurors knew the contents of the note. Appellee counters that any communications to the trial court must be considered as coming from the jury as a whole, and merely signed by the foreperson. For purposes of decision, we will assume that the jury was aware of the contents of the forewoman's notes. Finally, the Commonwealth forwards an argument premised upon Pa.R.Crim.P. 648(F), which appellee rebuts. In light of our disposition, we need not address this distinct argument.</p>

Specifically, the majority finds such an approach inapposite because the second supplemental instruction in the present case was more in line with the one approved by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Spencer, </em><a href="/pa/442/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="442 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1935365" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0328-01">442 Pa. 328</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="275 A.2d 299">275 A.2d 299</a> (1971). While I agree that the instruction here overlapped substantially with <em>Spencer, </em>the overarching concern expressed in that decision — especially relative to the <em>Allen </em>charge — was the prospect of a coerced jury verdict in view of the possible effect of the supplemental instruction on jurors in the minority. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="275 A.2d 299">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="275 A.2d 299">at 335</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="275 A.2d 299">275 A.2d at 303</a>. Indeed, <em>Allen </em>has generally been seen as problematic in this regard — and its use was prospectively foreclosed by Spencer— precisely because of the possibility that minority jurors would feel pressured by the trial judge to vote, against their true beliefs, with jurors in the majority.</p>

The first reference — reflecting the trial judge’s belief that “someone is not talking or someone is not listening” — might be taken by jurors as a criticism of their conduct in the deliberations.

In this regard, it bears observation that both <em>Spencer </em>and the federal <em>Allen </em>jurisprudence share an overarching goal of protecting a defendant’s right to a fair trial in the face of potentially coercive actions taken by a trial judge facing a deadlocked jury, particularly where only one or two jurors are in the minority. Furthermore, because of the endless variety of ways in which a trial judge can phrase anti-deadlock instructions — and as illustrated by this case — it is not always possible to place such charges into neat <em>Spencer-versus-Allen </em>categories.</p>
