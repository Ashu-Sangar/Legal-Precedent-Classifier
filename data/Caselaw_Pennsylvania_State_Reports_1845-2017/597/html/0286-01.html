This argument is the basis for Appellant’s second issue, wherein he asserts that the PCRA court erred in refusing to treat his <em>Batson </em>claim as if it had been presented on direct appeal in light of the fact that he did not obtain the notes of testimony from <em>voir dire </em>until 1997. Appellant blames the delay in obtaining the notes of testimony on his direct appeal counsel, alleging that counsel was ineffective in failing to request that the notes of testimony from <em>voir dire </em>be transcribed. Appellant also alleges that the trial court’s failure to transmit the entire record, as required by Pa.R.A.P. 2189,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> prevented this Court from conducting the review mandated under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(h)(2) (permitting this Court to correct errors at trial and affirm or vacate a sentence of death and remand for further proceedings) and (3)(i) (providing that this Court shall affirm a death sentence unless we determine that the sentence was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor).

Thus, <em>Uderra </em>has aligned Pennsylvania with the growing consensus of the federal Courts of Appeals that the U.S. Supreme Court “in <em>Batson </em>‘envisioned an objection raised during the jury selection process.’ ” <em>Abu-Jamal, </em><a href="/f3d/520/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="520 F.3d 272" data-case-ids="3701855" data-case-paths="/f3d/520/0272-01">520 F.3d at 280-81</a> (quoting <em>McCrory, </em><a href="/f3d/82/1243-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="82 F.3d 1243" data-case-ids="7647061" data-case-paths="/f3d/82/1243-01">82 F.3d at 1247</a>).</p>
    <p id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[210,606,1152,581]]]'>Finally, as the Majority correctly notes in concluding that the existence of the McMahon videotape does not support a <em>prima fade </em>case under <em>Batson </em>of discriminatory jury selection at appellant’s trial, the trial took place approximately six years before the McMahon tape was created. While I agree that appellant’s reliance on the McMahon tape does not, for this reason, help him overcome his <em>Batson </em>waiver, I would also stress that the fact that appellant’s trial took place nearly five years before <em>Batson </em>was even decided, in my view, utterly forecloses the possibility of <em>Batson </em>relief. Appellant’s <em>Batson </em>claim was always a non-starter.</p>
