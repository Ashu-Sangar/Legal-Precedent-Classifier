      <em>Amicus </em>quotes a common pleas judge and commentator as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b407-6" data-blocks='[["BL_407.6",407,[248,1021,1115,736]]]'>Both judges and juries face a Herculean task in distinguishing the differences between the legal definitions of insanity and mental illness ... Any criminal trial judge who has attempted to explain the legal definitions of insanity and mental illness can relate the quizzical looks given by juries when the legal definitions are read to them. Almost by magic, these quizzical looks disappear and the proverbial “light bulb comes on” when the judge explains the import of their verdict. Suddenly, jurors understand that they are being asked to decide whether the Defendant should go free or face incarceration once his mental health treatment ends. In the parlance of the Superior Court, juries decide whether a “sick” person is also “bad” enough to warrant the punishment of jail.</blockquote>

In terms of the jury charge, the Commonwealth highlights the trial court’s use of the relevant charge from Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Jury Instructions pertaining to criminal law, which has been specifically approved by the intermediate appellate courts. <em>See duPont, </em><a href="/a2d/730/0970-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="730 A.2d 970" data-case-ids="11613625" data-case-paths="/a2d/730/0970-01">730 A.2d at 980</a>.

In this regard, the Commonwealth stresses that the trial court repeatedly told the jurors that they must first decide if Appellant was guilty of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt before they ever could consider the special verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity or guilty but mentally ill. The Commonwealth notes that this Court addressed the issue of the burden of proof required by Sections 314 and 315 of the Crimes Code in <em>Sohmer, </em>where it was recognized that a defendant’s sanity is presumed, <em>see Sohmer, </em><a href="/pa/519/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="519 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1813583" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0200-01">519 Pa. at </a>208 n. 3, <a href="/pa/519/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="519 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1813583" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0200-01">546 A.2d at </a>605 n. 3; that the burden of establishing insanity, by a preponderance of the evidence, is on the defendant, <em>see id,.; </em>and, further, that neither the defendant nor the Commonwealth has the burden of establishing mental illness, because that was a factual determination to be made from the evidence as a whole. <em>See <a href="/pa/519/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="519 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1813583" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0200-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/519/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="519 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1813583" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0200-01">at 212</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="519 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1813583" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0200-01">546 A.2d at 607</a>.

For medical definitions devised to justify treatment, like legal ones devised to excuse from conventional criminal responsibility, are subject to flux and disagreement.

Under the [guilty-but-mentally-ill] statutory scheme, the jury does not consider mental illness until it has first decided the defendant’s claim of insanity. Thus, the jury does not determine insanity and mental illness simultaneously. The jury must consider first whether the defendant committed the acts forming the basis for the charged offense, next whether the defendant was insane, and finally whether the defendant was mentally ill. We believe that the sequence in which these issues are resolved by the jury further demonstrates that the defense in a [guilty-but-mentally-ill] case does not have the burden of establishing conflicting propositions at the same time.</blockquote>

The distinction between "knowledge” and "appreciation” of wrongfulness forming a basis of the distinction between the common-law and Model Penal Code standards for insanity, which was referenced at Appellant's trial by the Commonwealth's expert, has been discussed in various judicial decisions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Meader, </em><a href="/f-supp/914/0656-01" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="914 F.

In this case, consistent with the governing statutory scheme, and as noted, Appellant himself proposed the narrower formulation centered on his "knowledge” in his proposed points for charge. Appellant also did not object to this formulation after the trial court issued its instructions. Further, he did not challenge the explanation of these concepts given by the Commonwealth's expert; rather, he sought to conform the testimony of his own expert to that explanation on rebuttal. <em>See </em>N.T., March 30, 2005, at 14. Accordingly, there is no basis at the present time to support a challenge to the focus of the trial court’s charge upon the “knowledge” concept.</p>

While, because the matter is unpreserved, the present appeal does not call for us to approve or disapprove the sick-and-bad terminology, we observe that it was used in this case, as it was in <em>Trill, </em>as an illustration of more conceptual descriptions of the not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity and guilty-but-mentally-ill verdicts. Moreover, as directed by the trial court, the jurors were to assess whether the Commonwealth met its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant committed the substantive offenses before the jurors ever were to consider the sick-and-bad distinction. In such circumstances, the danger that the jurors would take the references, not as they were intended, but as an invitation to determine Appellant's guilt or innocence by reference to his general character is far more remote than the arguments suggest.</p>

The legislature could well have believed that many defendants were being found not guilty by reason of insanity even though they did not satisfy the legal standard for the defense. The difficulty is that lay juries are presented with complicated and to some extent conflicting notions of what renders a person "insane" in legal, psychiatric, and common sense terms. The [guilly-but-mentally-ill] statutes are designed to insure that the jury applies the <em>legal </em>definition of insanity, by underscoring that a person might be “mentally ill” in clinical terms, "crazy” in common sense terms, yet not legally insane.</p>
