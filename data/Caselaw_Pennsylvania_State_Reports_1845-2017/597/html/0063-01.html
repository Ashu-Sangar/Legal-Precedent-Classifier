    <blockquote id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.7",110,[324,619,1117,527]]]'>1. Are gas utilities who lay and use dangerous underground gas lines for profit and who are statutorily required by the One Call Act to locate, mark and stake their underground lines upon request subject to liability under either the Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 552(l)-(2) or Section 552(3) for economic damages suffered by an underground contractor performing excavation work when said underground gas utility negligently mismarks or fails to locate, mark or stake the position of the underground gas lines?</blockquote>

Is this case, where petitioner underground gas utility contractor suffered economic damages as a result of respondent Columbia Gas Company’s failure to perform its statutorily mandated duty to mark its utility lines controlled by this Court’s decision in <em>Bilt-Rite Contractors, inc., v.
