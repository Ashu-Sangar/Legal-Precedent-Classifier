United States, </em><a href="/us/425/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="425 U.S. 341" data-case-ids="6176644" data-case-paths="/us/425/0341-01">425 U.S. 341</a>, <a href="/us/425/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="425 U.S. 341" data-case-ids="6176644" data-case-paths="/us/425/0341-01">96 S.Ct. 1612</a>, <a href="/us/425/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="425 U.S. 341" data-case-ids="6176644" data-case-paths="/us/425/0341-01">48 L.Ed.2d 1</a> (1976), the concern of the <em>Miranda </em>Court was to offset the coercive and compulsive aspect of custodial interrogation. While the police have a legitimate right to question those who may have knowledge of criminal activity, <em>Miranda v. Arizona, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">supra, </a></em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">at 477, 478</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. at 1629, 1630</a>, they do not have the power to force answers to their inquiries. Thus whether the questioning is classified as “investigative” or “accusatory,” it is immaterial where, as here, the individual is obliged to participate and the questioning occurs in the sterile and coercive police controlled setting.</p>
    <p id="b645-6" data-blocks='[["BL_645.5",645,[170,1554,1147,712]]]'>The fact that police suspicion had focused upon the individual is not controlling, rather it is the nature and setting of the in-custody interrogation the police employ to elicit the desired information. <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>U. S., supra. </em>Where the person has been placed in custody pursuant to an arrest, it is clear that the focus had also centered upon him. However, the <em>Miranda </em>definition of custodial interrogation is broader than the question of arrested suspects. Even absent a formal arrest, the <em>Miranda </em>concern is present where police initiate questioning concerning a crime or criminal activity and conduct that interrogation in a police controlled coercive setting. Such was the case here and appellant was entitled to the warnings.</p>
