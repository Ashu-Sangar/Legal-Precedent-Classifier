Appellant’s privately retained counsel filed post-trial motions which were subsequently denied. After sentencing, appellant’s representation was conducted by the Public Defender of Chester County, who filed a direct appeal to this Court. On appeal, appellant asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction of carrying a firearm without a license, and that the charge to the jury was inadequate. We agreed as to appellant’s initial claim and reversed his firearms conviction. However, we refused to reach the merits of his second claim because it was not timely raised at trial and was therefore not preserved for appellate review. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The obvious testimony that was lacking was that of appellate counsel, who could have explained whether he did in fact fully inform appellant of the presumption of waiver if the ineffectiveness arguments were not raised on appeal.

Appellant’s prompt attempt to seek relief on this basis within the framework of an ineffectiveness claim advances his position that he did not understandingly waive this on appeal.

By failing to charge fully on both types of voluntary manslaughter, the trial court removed from the jury the possibility of finding appellant guilty of one type of voluntary manslaughter, which may have resulted in a verdict of guilty of first degree murder when appellant may, in fact, have been innocent of the latter offense. Following my suggested analysis in <em>Watlington, </em>because appellant was convicted of murder, his allegation of ineffectiveness is a colorable due process claim which implicates the truth determining process and which, if true, might have the effect of imprisoning a person innocent of murder.
