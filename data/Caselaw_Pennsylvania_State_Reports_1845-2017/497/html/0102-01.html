Due to the lapse of time between the filing of the complaint in equity (1956) and the acceptance of the Consent Decree, a determination of the base-line dollar figure of monthly payments was considered of great importance to appellants. Because years of service correlate with anticipated monthly payments a specific dollar figure for each appellant was necessary. On the other hand, most health and welfare benefits are afforded pursuant to the fact of one being a pensioner, not according to years of service. Therefore, the explicit recitation of such obvious complimentary benefits was deemed unnecessary.</p>
