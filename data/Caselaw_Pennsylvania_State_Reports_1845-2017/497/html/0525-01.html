Under appellants’ approach, the Court — rather than the legislative branch as represented by the Legislative Reapportionment Commission — would have the ultimate responsibility of deciding the precise mathematical formula to be applied in dividing the population of the state among legislative districts. This usurpation of the legislative function would not only be inappropriate but also might well interfere with the Commission’s ability to achieve the goals of compactness and preservation of subdivision lines with which appellants are concerned.</p>

Yet, even with this large number of disparately populated political subdivisions and the closest adherence in the history of the Commonwealth to the ideal <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>of “one person, one vote,” the Commission’s Senate Plan has preserved the boundaries of 41 counties and all but two municipalities. So too, with the ideal population of a House district set at 58,456, a figure far exceeded by the populations of numerous counties and municipalities, the House Plan has nonetheless preserved the boundaries of 19 counties and all but 87 municipalities. None of the arguments presented by appellants convinces us that the drawing of district lines, which necessarily involves value judgments by the Commission, has been based upon impermissible considerations. Mere dissatisfaction with the fact that certain political subdivisions have been divided or have been included within particular legislative districts is not sufficient to invalidate the Final Reapportionment Plan as unconstitutional.

In the face of constitutional language which prohibits divisions unless “absolutely necessary,” there surely must be some showing of necessity, some demonstration that “the population principle cannot be otherwise satisfied.” The Commission has vouchsafed nothing, and the Court is reduced to trying to read its mind. It may be acknowledged that some dividing of counties, municipalities and wards and some surrender of <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>compactness is unavoidable, but there is no presumption that each split that was made or each misshapen district that was created falls into this category.
