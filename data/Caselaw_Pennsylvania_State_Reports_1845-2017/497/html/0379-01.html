Jarvis. The award constituted compensation for the death of Enos J. Jarvis (hereinafter Jarvis), appellant’s late husband, who was fatally injured on January 13, 1969, while working within the scope of his employment. Jarvis’ employer, Elsie M. Jarvis t/a John J. Jarvis, had, for seven consecutive years preceding the occurrence of the fatal accident, procured Workmen’s Compensation insurance from the appellee, Phoenix Assurance Company of New York, through the latter’s agent, the Emil Schurgot Agency (hereinafter Schurgot). Each year, near the expiration date of the annual insurance policy, Schurgot billed the employer for the following year’s premium, and payment ensued. The final policy so procured expired on January 9, 1969, just four days prior to Jarvis’ fatal accident. No renewal premium notice had been sent to the employer, since Phoenix Assur<a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>anee had terminated Schurgot as its agent.

The Court declined to hold that by reason of the insurer having renewed policies for successive years without request by the policyholder, an obligation arose to continue offering renewals from year to year indefinitely thereafter, or, if renewals were not to be offered, to inform the insured of the impending policy expiration and of the insurer’s intention not to offer continued coverage:</p>

As was the circumstance in <em>Luther, </em>the factual background of the present case contains no alleged affirmative assurances, promises, or statements, attributable to the carrier or its agent, that could have lulled the insured into believing that policies would be renewed indefinitely or that notice of non-renewal would be provided. Likewise, no request was made by the instant policyholder to maintain insurance coverage in effect from year to year, indefinitely.</p>

Certainly, however, the duration of the lapse is not determinative of the insurer’s liability. If a carrier does not inform a policyholder of the expiration of his insurance, and a lapse in coverage thereby results, the insurer’s liability should not be dependent upon whether an arbitrarily demarcated time period has expired prior to the occurrence of an accident for which compensation is sought.</p>

Common experience demonstrates that, in practice, routine billing procedures in the insurance field induce the belief that the insured is relieved of responsibility for monitoring the dates for policy expiration and premium payment. The insured has learned to rely wholly upon notices from insurance carriers and their agents for information as to impending expirations of policies and the need for action to maintain coverage. Indeed, this reliance has been encouraged by insurers and their agents, who, in the interest of retaining business, have almost invariably furnished such notices despite the absence of an express request therefor by the insured. The typical policyholder maintains no awareness of the date when his coverage expires, having been lulled into the belief that notice will be forthcoming as to the date when further action on his part is required. The insurance carrier, being responsible for instilling such reliance, cannot be permitted to silently ignore the harm that can result from failure to notify the insured of the termination of an agent, and the consequent non-renewal of coverage. Recognition of a carrier’s duty to provide the expected notice is, therefore, necessary, and when a breach of that duty occurs, as in the present case, the carrier shall be estopped from asserting the expiration of the policy as a bar to recovery.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This Court’s decision in <em>Luther </em>is, accordingly, overruled.</p>
