On June 2, 1976, he became totally disabled from anthracosilicosis, also known as black lung disease, as a result of his exposure to dust in the coal mines almost fifty years earlier. Shortly thereafter, appellant filed a claim for occupational disease benefits against the Commonwealth, appellee here, and Referee Thomas B. Noonan awarded him benefits under Section 301(i) of the Act. The Commonwealth, which was solely liable to pay the award, appealed to the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (“Board”), asserting that appellant’s exposure to occupational disease hazards occurred entirely prior to October 1, 1939, the effective date of the Act, and that the referee therefore erred in awarding him compensation. The Board affirmed the award on July 7, 1977, and the Commonwealth appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County. On November 18, 1977, the Board’s order was affirmed, and the Commonwealth then appealed to the Commonwealth Court. On December 27, 1978, the order of the Court of Common Pleas was reversed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellant petitioned this Court for review, <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>and we granted allocatur on August 20, 1979.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
