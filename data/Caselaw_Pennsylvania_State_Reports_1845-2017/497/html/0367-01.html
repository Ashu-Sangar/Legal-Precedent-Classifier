Appellant alleges that the revocation of his probation was improper because the revocation hearing was not held within a reasonable time, the hearing judge was not impartial, and appellant was denied the right to cross-examine the investigator who prepared the pre-sentence report. Having determined that none of appellant’s claims of error merits relief, we affirm.</p>

The term of probation was due to expire on April 10, 1978.</p>

He was found guilty by the Municipal Court of Philadelphia on June 27, 1978.

However, at defense request, the hearing was continued because of appellant’s pending appeal to the court of common pleas. The hearing was relisted on six subsequent occasions prior to the court of common pleas’ adjudication, and on each occasion a continuance was granted at appellant’s request. After appellant was found guilty of the underlying firearms offense by the court of common pleas, the probation hearing was scheduled for May 15,1979, twenty days later. On that date appellant was served with written notice of the probation violation, and the hearing was continued for one week. When the hearing resumed, appellant requested and was granted a continuance. The hearing was ultimately held on June 18, 1979, less than two months after appellant had been found guilty by the court of common pleas and fourteen months after his probation would otherwise have expired.</p>

From December 8, 1978, until the probation revocation hearing on June 18, 1979, appellant continued to be detained because of the probation violation now before this Court. During this period appellant repeatedly requested, as he had since July of 1978, that his probation revocation hearing be continued until after his trial <em>de novo </em>in the court of common pleas. Appellant has properly received credit for the time he spent in custody, see 42 Pa.C.S. § 9760, and cannot succeed on this incarceration claim.</p>
