She was sentenced to life imprisonment for each count of murder and ten to twenty years for arson, the sentences to run concurrently. Following trial counsel’s filing of boiler plate post-verdict motions, appellant obtained new counsel (hereinafter “appellate counsel”) who represented her for the disposition of post-verdict motions and on direct appeal. Argument on post-trial motions was rescheduled four times, the first time pursuant to appellate counsel’s request, the last three because he failed to appear. When appellate counsel failed to appear the fourth time, the trial court proceeded to decide post-trial motions, denying them on the merits on January 10, 1974. Two years later this Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant resented the relationship between Baltimore and Wagner and made threats against them on a number of occasions.

Two days later she dropped the charges, relying on Baltimore’s promise that he would stop seeing Wagner and, <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>instead, live with appellant. Appellant rented a room at the James Wilson Hotel, which is located across the street from 11 North Pitt Street. Baltimore did not leave Wagner as he had promised, and the arguments and threats continued. At 1:58 a. m. on August 29, 1972, a false fire alarm occurred at the James Wilson Hotel. At 2:20 a. m., appellant was seen at the Hamilton Restaurant which was adjacent to 11 North Pitt Street. The alarm for the fire at 11 North Pitt Street was turned in at 2:54 a. m.

I’m responsible for him being here.” When the nurse asked her how she could be responsible for a fire, appellant became calm and said no more.

She denied knowledge of the false alarm, but admitted making the above-described statement to the nurse.

Because of Mrs. Wagner’s mental state defense counsel determined, in exercising his professional judgment, that it would have been unwise trial strategy to call Mrs. Wagner to the stand. He feared her testimony would generate and underscore the jurors’ sympathy for the victim, and in light of the uncertain <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>and confused testimony, he concluded the possibility of harm to appellant outweighed the benefit of the testimony.</p>

Appellant asserts that Thompson’s testimony would have contradicted the bartender’s testimony that he had informed appellant of the false fire alarm.

Her testimony at the PCHA hearing was that she arrived at the lounge about 1:40-1:45 a. m., left about 2:30 a. m., and sometime during that period appellant requested change for a quarter. It is clear, then, that not only was Ana Thompson unable to corroborate appellant’s testimony that she was in the lounge about 1:45, she additionally was unable to testify to appellant’s lack of knowledge of the false fire alarm.

There is similarly no validity to the claim that defense counsel provided ineffective representation by his failure to object to Richard Baltimore’s testimony that appellant, weeks before the fire, referred to Richard Baltimore as “Ben.” Baltimore asserted that “Ben” was a movie about a rat named Ben who survived a fire in which his companion rats were destroyed. On direct examination appellant claimed she called Baltimore “Ben” because he treated Paula Wagner “like a rat.” We agree with the hearing judge’s conclusion that this testimony is relevant to questions of malice and intent, essential elements of an arson murder.
