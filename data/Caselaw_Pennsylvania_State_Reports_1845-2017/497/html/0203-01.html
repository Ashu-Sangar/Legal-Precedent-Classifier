In <em>Bartolomucci, </em>counsel for defendant had asked the trial court to give additional instructions to the jury which had been deliberating for some eleven hours. The trial court denied this request. Shortly thereafter, the jury was recalled to the courtroom and the judge <em>sua sponte </em>declared a mistrial and <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>discharged the jury. When the Commonwealth brought Bartolomucci to trial again, he asserted a double jeopardy claim on the grounds that the jury should not have been discharged absent a determination that it was hopelessly deadlocked and that mistrial was therefore “manifestly necessary”. The Commonwealth responded that the double jeopardy claim was waived because Bartolomucci did not state those specific grounds for objection at trial, but instead had requested additional instructions. The Court held that counsel’s “mere silence” following the lower court’s <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of mistrial did not amount to the request or consent to mistrial which would have been necessary to find a waiver of the objection.</p>

The opinion in support of reversal quotes one sentence from this Court’s opinion granting Hallowell a new trial, to-wit: “Upon analysis of the records, we find that Way perjured himself; we find that the testimony of the former chief of homicide was misleading; and we find that the district attorney’s office was guilty of perpetrating a falsehood and fraud upon the court, jury and people of this Commonwealth . ... ” Despite this quotation, it is absolutely clear from reading the entire opinion that there was a finding of neither “intent to provoke a mistrial” nor “bad-faith conduct intended to harass or prejudice” Hallowell. The thrust of the opinion was “constructive knowledge”; that is, knowledge (of promises of leniency) of one assistant district attorney was imputed to the prosecutor at trial. It was the “prosecutor’s office as an entity” concept which provided the basis for our decision, <em>not </em>a finding of actual misrepresentation or bad faith. Thus, the prosecutorial misconduct set forth in the opinion in support of affirmance does not rise to the level of prosecutorial “overreaching” warranting a discharge. However, because appellant is, in our view, estopped from seeking discharge, we would not reach the merits of the double jeopardy issue.</p>

No case of this Court would condition relief only upon a showing by appellant that the error of the first trial “would taint a retrial.” To the contrary, the issue of “taint” is wholly irrelevant to the constitutional prohibition against being placed twice in jeopardy. As the citations contained in the Opinion of Mr. Justice Nix indicate, the “taint” theory is espoused by Mr. Justice Nix alone, and is shared by no other member of this Court.</p>
