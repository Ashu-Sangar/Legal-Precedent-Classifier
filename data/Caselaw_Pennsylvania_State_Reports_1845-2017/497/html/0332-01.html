On direct appeal, two issues were raised: (1) the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions and (2) evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant was inadmissible because the search warrant was based on illegally obtained evidence. In a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, this Court affirmed the judgments of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v. Finley, </em><a href="/pa/477/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="477 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="1738250" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0211-01">477 Pa. 211</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="477 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="1738250" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0211-01">383 A.2d 898</a> (1978). Appellant subsequently filed a <em>pro se </em>petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. 1580 (1965), 19 P.S. § 1180-1 et seq. (Supp.1981-82), where she raised the identical issues addressed by this Court on direct appeal. Although appellant alleged she was indigent and requested appointment of counsel, the PCHA court denied her petition without a hearing, holding the issues raised in the petition had been finally litigated. 19 P.S. § 1180-4. On appeal from the denial of her petition <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>appellant requests the case be remanded to the lower court for appointment of counsel to assist in the preparation and filing of an amended petition under the Act.</p>

McClinton, </em><a href="/pa/488/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="488 Pa. 598" data-case-ids="1761064" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0598-01">488 Pa. 598</a>, <a href="/pa/488/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="488 Pa. 598" data-case-ids="1761064" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0598-01">413 A.2d 386</a> (1980). The Commonwealth urges us to deny appellant relief, arguing this case falls within an exception to the right to counsel provided in Pa.R.Crim.P. 1504. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1503(a) requires the court to appoint counsel once petitioner satisfies the court of his financial inability to obtain counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The only exception to this rule as provided in Pa.R.Crim.P. 1504 is as follows:</p>

Our prior case law has consistently adopted a strict construction of the language of the Rule. <em>Commonwealth v.

Rule 1504 provides an exception to the general right to appointment of counsel only where a previous <em>PCHA petition </em>involving the same issues has been determined adversely to the petitioner in a <em>proceeding on the PCHA petition </em>and the petitioner either knowingly waived his right to representation by counsel or was actually represented by counsel in that proceeding. Since Rule 1504 applies to proceedings on prior PCHA petitions, it is not dispositive of appellant’s claim instantly.</p>

Although Section 12 of the Act, 19 P.S. § 1180-12, provides appointment of counsel is not required where the petitioner’s claim is “patently frivolous and without trace of support in the record...”, this provision has been suspended in part and superseded insofar as it is inconsistent with Pa.R.Crim.P. 1503(a) and 1504.
