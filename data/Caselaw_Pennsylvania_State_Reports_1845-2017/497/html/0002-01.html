    <p id="b69-12" data-blocks='[["BL_69.12",69,[161,1755,1145,614]]]'>Claimant, Karen Jesiolowski, applied for unemployment compensation benefits in May, 1976. The Bureau of Employment Security denied the claim. After a hearing before a Referee, the denial of benefits was affirmed. The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board), appellant herein, then reversed the decision of the Referee and granted claimant unemployment compensation. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed the order of the Board and denied claimant benefits. <em>Franklin &amp; Lindsey, Inc. v.

      <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>The facts of this case, as found by the Board, are as follows: Claimant was employed as a draftsperson-surveyor by appellee, Franklin <em>&amp; </em>Lindsey, Inc., in April, 1975, at which time she began working as a draftsperson. In August, 1975 claimant also began doing field survey work for appellee. Beginning in March, 1976, appellee also required claimant to do secretarial work in the office, despite her protests. Throughout this period, claimant was enrolled an an evening student at Drexel University, majoring in civil engineering.</p>
    <p id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[258,891,1152,475]]]'>On May 21, 1976 claimant was laid off by appellee due to lack of field work. At the time, her salary was $120 per week. On May 26, 1976 appellee offered to recall claimant to do “purely secretarial work” at the continuing rate of $120 per week. Claimant refused the proffered employment because she felt that a purely secretarial job was not in keeping with her training and experience, that her drafting skills would deteriorate if not used, and that the job lacked sufficient opportunities for advancement.</p>

Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa/424/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="424 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="1904934" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0287-01">424 Pa. 287</a>, 290, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20174" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="227 A.2d 174">227 A.2d 174</a>, 176 (1967).

According to the Board’s findings of fact, claimant worked continuously for eighteen months as a draftsperson and/or surveyor, and for an addi<a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>tional three months as a draftsperson-surveyor with secretarial duties. In addition, claimant was enrolled as a civil engineering student at Drexel University.</p>

    <p id="b72-7" data-blocks='[["BL_72.6",72,[266,1019,1155,687]]]'>The Unemployment Compensation Law “is remedial in nature and thus should be liberally and broadly construed. Statutory Construction Act of 1970, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1928(c) .... ” <em>Gladieux Food Services, Inc. v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa/479/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="479 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1742098" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0324-01">479 Pa. 324</a>, 330, <a href="/pa/479/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="479 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1742098" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0324-01">388 A.2d 678</a>, 681 (1978). In keeping with this legislative mandate, we recognize that the Unemployment Compensation Law must allow for that advancement in the work force which occurs when an individual has achieved new skills by reason of ongoing training and experience. The law does not require that a woman, “once a secretary,” remain “always a secretary” after she has acquired significant training and experience in another chosen profession.</p>
    <p id="b72-8" data-blocks='[["BL_72.7",72,[266,1734,1151,473]]]'>Since appellee’s offer to claimant of “purely secretarial work” wholly disregarded claimant’s training and experience as a draftsperson-surveyor, and since claimant had no reasonable opportunity to obtain other employment in the areas of drafting and surveying, we conclude that appellee’s offer to claimant was not an offer of “suitable work.” Consequently, it was error for the Commonwealth Court to hold claimant ineligible for unemployment compensation based upon a failure to accept suitable work.</p>
