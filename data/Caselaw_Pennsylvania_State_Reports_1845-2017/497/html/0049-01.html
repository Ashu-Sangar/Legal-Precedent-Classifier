Harriet Saunders, the complainant, testified at trial that she was born on July 23, 1963, making her 13 years old at the time this incident took place on January 1, 1977. The complainant further testified that she consented to have sexual intercourse with the appellant at his home some time during the evening hours and that after leaving the appellant’s home, she went to her girlfriend’s house, and from there to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. The Commonwealth called appellant’s sister, Yvonne Smith, for the purpose of proving appellant’s age. She testified that she had personal knowledge that appellant was over 18 on January 1. As a foundation for this testimony, she stated that she was 19 years older than the appellant; that she was not present at his birth, but saw him three days later on November 12 or 13, 1958; that he was born in Abington Hospital; and finally, that his mother’s name was Doris and his father’s name, Emanuel. On <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>cross-examination, she conceded that her estimation of appellant’s age was an “approximation,” based on how long she thought he had been out of school. Later in the trial, appellant’s counsel recalled Mrs. Smith as a witness on appellant’s behalf and she testified that “his birthday is November 9th of this year [1977]. He should be 19,1 guess.”</p>

On this second contention, he further argues that he should receive a new trial because he was convicted on this felony on the basis of strict criminal liability without proof of <em>mens rea </em>or culpability in violation of his right to due process of law as guaranteed by Article 1, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>

The testimony of Yvonne Smith, the appellant’s sister, was sufficiently reliable and consistent to allow the factfinder to determine that the defendant was older than 18 years of age. Her responses to questions concerning the appellant’s age were thoughtful and based on her recollection of facts. The mere addition of the words “I guess” by the witness to her last answer, after stating once again that the appellant would be 19 in 1977, does not render her testimony fatally unreliable under the holding stated in <em>Commonwealth v.

Since her use of the expression “I guess” did not require the factfinder to conjecture to what the appellant’s age was and since it was for the factfinder to appraise the extent of this qualification, her testimony was sufficient to support the factfinder’s verdict with reason and not surmise. Thus, it is readily apparent that the evidence produced at trial was sufficient to sustain appellant’s conviction.</p>

The operation of § 3102 to bar the defense of age in the case of statutory rape cannot be said to be an arbitrary law. In an exercise of its police powers, the legislature rationally may require that one eighteen years of age or older who engages in sexual intercourse with a child below fourteen years of age does so at his own peril.

In light of the widespread acceptance of the idea that mistake of age should not be a defense to a statutory rape conviction, § 3102 hardly can be termed irrational. Our Crimes Code shares its basic culpability requirements with the Model Penal Code on which it is based. The Model Penal Code, like the Pennsylvania statute, bars the defense of mistake of age where the female is below a designated age. Although the Model Penal Code sets the age at ten, Model Penal Code, Proposed Official Draft, §§ 213.1 and 213.6, pp. 142 and 149-150, certainly the legislature may, consistently with considerations of due process, determine as a matter of public policy that the still tender age of fourteen is appropriate. Furthermore, prior case law in Pennsylvania held that mistake of age was no defense to a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, since it would not be a defense to a charge of statutory rape. <em>Commonwealth v. Sarricks, </em><a href="/pa-super/161/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="161 Pa. Super. 577" data-case-ids="461261" data-case-paths="/pa-super/161/0577-01">161 Pa.Super.Ct. 577</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%20323" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="56 A.2d 323">56 A.2d 323</a> (1948). Thus, the legislature’s determination to bar the defense was based on a long-standing and widely accepted principle of law and public policy, and may not be invalidated as irrational.</p>
