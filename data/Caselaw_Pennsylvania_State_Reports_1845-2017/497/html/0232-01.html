Following conviction by a jury, post-verdict motions were denied. Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder and a concurrent term of two and one-half to five years for the weapons offense. This appeal followed.</p>

He first claims that his warrantless arrest was invalid because it was not based upon probable cause. He does not contend that the Commonwealth’s evidence, if believed, fails to establish probable cause, but rather that the police version of the arrest was fabricated and that his version of the arrest should be believed. According to the Commonwealth, on January 25, 1978, a woman named Ruby Blocker approached a Philadelphia police officer and told him that she had been stabbed and held hostage by appellant. The stab <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>wounds were visible to the officer. She further informed the officer that appellant was wanted for two murders and that he was at that time fleeing in a brown Hornet automobile. The officer and Ms. Blocker then pursued the vehicle, which was still in sight. After a chase, appellant was apprehended by other officers who had heard the broadcast of appellant’s description and location over police radio. Seconds later, Ms. Blocker positively identified appellant as her assailant. This evidence clearly establishes that there were facts available to the arresting officers which would justify the belief of a reasonable person that a crime had been committed and that appellant was the perpetrator.

Appellant’s contention is based on the fact that, while appellant was being transferred to the homicide unit after his identification as Walter Penn, a police officer with him said, “Hey, you’ve been involved in other murders,” to which appellant responded, “Yeah, I was involved in a homicide in Pittsburgh.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Whether the officer’s statement constituted interrogation, as appellant claims, or was simply a gratuitous remark, as the Commonwealth contends, is immaterial. Appellant’s response, which merely confirmed a fact of record, was not introduced at trial. Indeed, all references to <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>this prior homicide in appellant’s subsequent statements were carefully redacted before those statements were introduced into evidence. Moreover, appellant has not shown that police in any way exploited this brief exchange of remarks in the subsequent interrogation of appellant, which was preceded by appropriate <em>Miranda </em>warnings. See <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/us/371/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="371 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="450611" data-case-paths="/us/371/0471-01">371 U.S. 471</a>, <a href="/us/371/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="371 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="450611" data-case-paths="/us/371/0471-01">83 S.Ct. 407</a>, <a href="/us/371/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="371 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="450611" data-case-paths="/us/371/0471-01">9 L.Ed.2d 441</a> (1963); <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant was arraigned five hours and twenty minutes after his arrest. Thus, he does not argue that his statements should be excluded on the basis of <em>Commonwealth v.

The record indicates that the first two hours following appellant’s arrest were required for his administrative processing, in large part because appellant had misled police as to his identity, and thus do not constitute unnecessary delay. <em>Commonwealth v. Dixon, </em><a href="/pa/454/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="454 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="579879" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0444-01">454 Pa. 444</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20613" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="311 A.2d 613">311 A.2d 613</a> (1973).

      <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>warnings and voluntarily gave two statements to police, the second of which he reduced to writing in his own hand. Because appellant has not shown that the time between his arrest and arraignment involved unnecessary delay, this contention provides no basis for relief. Moreover, the record is clear that appellant began to cooperate with police immediately after receiving his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that the next three hours were occupied continuously with the preparation of appellant’s two statements. In the circumstances, there was no requirement that appellant be rewarned of his rights. See <em>Commonwealth v. Dixon, </em><a href="/pa/475/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="475 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1734082" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0365-01">475 Pa. 365</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="475 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1734082" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0365-01">380 A.2d 765</a> (1977); <em>Commonwealth v.
