The project was completed in November, 1974, but debts incurred by Cameron to appellant and appellees remain unpaid. Each of the parties seeks to satisfy its claims against Cameron from the unpaid contract balance of $43,694.50, which has been interpleaded into court by the Authority. The interpleaded fund was withheld from Cameron by the Authority pursuant to their contract, which provided that final payment “shall be conditioned . . . upon submission by the Contractor of evidence that all claims for labor, material and any other outstanding indebtedness in connection with this contract has been paid.”</p>

He obtained a judgment on September 27, 1975, in the amount of $18,177 and immediately served the Authority with a writ of execution to satisfy his judgment from the retained contract balance. The Authority responded by filing a petition for interpleader, asking that all other claimants who had made demands on the contract retainage be added as parties. The Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County granted the petition, directing all known claimants to file a complaint with the court if they wished to have their claims adjudicated.</p>
