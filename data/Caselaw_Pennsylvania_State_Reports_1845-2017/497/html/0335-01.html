He was tried and convicted of all charges. Post-verdict motions were filed and following their denial on July 1, 1976, the appellant was sentenced to concurrent and consecutive prison sentences totalling seven and one-half (7V2) to fifteen (15) years. Thereafter, appel<a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>lant filed a direct appeal to the Superior Court which affirmed, without dissent, the judgments of sentence on October 20, 1978. A timely petition for the allowance of appeal was filed with this Court and was granted.</p>
    <p id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[181,563,1148,892]]]'>The essence of appellant’s claim for relief is that the trial judge’s conduct exceeded the bounds of propriety, and failed to maintain impartiality, thus depriving him of his right to a fair trial. To support this proposition, he cites a number of objections such as the court’s refusal to permit defense counsel to make motions out of the hearing of the jury or to make argument on motions; that the court unnecessarily suggested possible motives for the crime in his charge to the jury; that the court misstated the evidence in a manner favorable to the prosecution and highly prejudicial to the defense; that the court impeded cross examination by the defense by repeatedly interrupting at critical points; that the court’s manner toward the appellant, his counsel and his witnesses was sarcastic and reflected his (the court’s) disbelief of the defense’s evidence. We need not consider all of these allegations since one of the cited complaints is sufficient in itself to support the relief appellant now seeks.</p>
