The Commonwealth Court reasoned that, in this instance, the fee agreement between claimant and his attorney precluded an award of counsel fees. This agreement was that counsel would receive twenty percent of any award received. The critical factor according to the Commonwealth Court was that under this agreement, the claimant <em>himself </em>did not owe his attorney any counsel fee since no <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>award of benefits was received. Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth Court found the denial of counsel fees not only to be consistent with the fee arrangement but also to be required by Section 440 of the Act, 77 P.S. § 996, which states:</p>

    <p id="b586-6" data-blocks='[["BL_586.6",586,[276,1842,1153,253]]]'>Because it felt Section 440 was intended to provide only the same recoupment of costs incurred by the claimant as Section 442, the Commonwealth Court concluded there could be no award here, where claimant’s fee agreement imposed no cost on him in the absence of counsel’s creation of a fund.</p>

      <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>The Commonwealth Court erred in limiting Section 440 of the Act solely to recoupment as provided in Section 442. Our examination of these two separate statutory sections leads us to believe they serve different purposes. Section 442 evidences a legislative intent of protecting claimants against unreasonable fees charged and imposed on them by their attorneys under their own improvident fee agreements. As such, it is properly limited to recoupment. Section 440, on the other hand, shows a legislative intent of protecting claimants against unreasonable contests of a claimant’s initial or continuing right to the benefits of the act, including the benefit of a suspension, where a monetary award is not possible. To limit Section 440 to the same policy of recoupment as Section 442 would frustrate the legislative purpose of protecting claimants against unreasonable contests of their right to suspension since claimants dependent upon compensation for themselves and their families are not often in a position to incur a fixed obligation to their attorneys where there is no hope of that attorney’s creating a fund out of which it can be paid.</p>

There, the claimant was a member of a union which provided him with counsel and paid the expenses of his petition for compensation. The employer argued that under Section 440 of the Act only the claimant himself could be paid costs and that the referee could not direct that a witness fee be reimbursed directly to claimant’s counsel. In rejecting this argument, the Commonwealth Court stated: “We can find no requirement in Section 440 that would bar payment of costs to those who incurred them on behalf of a claimant, which in this case is the Union.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=374%20A.2d%20766" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="374 A.2d 766">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa-commw/30/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="30 Pa.

On this record, however, counsel’s representation of the claimant’s interests did not extend beyond the initial referee’s hearing. Thereafter, his efforts were directed to his own benefit in securing his fee.

The petition followed a refusal by claimant to sign a final receipt after he had returned to work, still suffering partial disability, but at wages equal to or in excess of those he was earning prior to the injury. The record shows he was not offered the alternative of a supplemental agreement providing for a suspension of benefits prior to the filing of the petition; and his counsel’s offer to dispose of the matter by suspension, prior to his appearance at the hearing, was refused. At the hearing the employer was unable to produce any medical evidence justifying a termination, but rested on a showing of return to work at equal wages, a showing which entitled it only to the suspension which was previously offered and refused.</p>

That the suspension, although providing no immediate pecuniary benefit to claimant, is valuable is beyond dispute to anyone familiar with our worker’s compensation practice. Had claimant signed the final receipt, he would have had the burden of proving medically a recurrence of disability if he desired to reinstate the award. Under a suspension, this burden is on the employer. Moreover, although this is an eye injury case in which the statute of limitations imposed by Section 413 of the Act, <em>as amended, </em>77 P.S. § 772 would not apply, in all other cases, once a final receipt is signed, a claimant’s right to reinstate ends three years after its date under 77 P.S. § 772. A recurrence of disability or loss of earning power thereafter from his injury would be without remedy. Under a suspension, he can seek reinstatement at “any time” during the continuance of such suspension i.e., during the remainder of the 500 week period (almost ten years) provided under the Act for partial disability.</p>
