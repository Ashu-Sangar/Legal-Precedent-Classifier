Although he escaped the next day, appellant was admitted to Allentown State Hospital four days later.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> On February 3, 1977, it was determined that appellant did not require further hospitalization. Six weeks later appellant was arrested and charged with burglary, criminal mischief and criminal attempt to commit arson. The attempted arson charge was dismissed at the preliminary hearing and appellant pleaded guilty to charges of criminal mischief and criminal trespass<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> on June 29, 1977. Following the guilty plea proceeding the hearing court deferred sentencing and ordered a psychiatric evaluation as part of appellant’s pre-sentence report. Appellant returned to Northampton County Prison to await sentencing.</p>
    <p id="b134-5" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[263,1053,1154,474]]]'>The court-appointed psychiatrist filed a report with the Court recommending continuous treatment for appellant. On July 26,1977, the warden of Northampton County Prison filed a petition for the involuntary commitment of appellant. A hearing was held before a mental health officer and appellant was involuntarily committed to Farview for a period not to exceed ninety days. The Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County held a hearing <em>de novo </em>and also ordered appellant’s commitment.</p>
    <p id="b134-6" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[264,1555,1153,359]]]'>At the hearing there was psychiatric testimony in addition to testimony describing appellant’s behavior while in the county jail. A psychiatrist who examined appellant and testified for the Commonwealth described appellant as schizophrenic with paranoid delusions. He further expressed the opinion that appellant posed a clear and present danger to himself and others.</p>

First, a correction officer at Northampton County Prison testified that he discovered appellant extinguishing a <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>burning newspaper in his cell. Second, there was testimony that appellant did not take scheduled doses of thorazine, a psychoactive drug prescribed for him. Finally, there was testimony that a routine search at the jail on July 25, 1977, revealed that appellant possessed a twisted piece of coathanger. Appellant now argues that the evidence described above is insufficient to support the order of commitment.</p>

    <p id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[259,1228,1155,527]]]'>Applying the above standard of review to the present case, it is clear that if appellant is to be found a clear and present danger to himself or others, it is necessary to show an overt act involving attempted suicide or self-mutilation or the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm to others to support the finding. In the absence of such an overt act, actions indicating inability to satisfy his own need for nourishment, personal or medical care, shelter, or self-protection and safety must be shown. § 301 of the Act, <em>supra; accord, In re S.C., </em><a href="/pa-super/280/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="280 Pa.

    <p id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[260,1790,1153,473]]]'>Clearly, the involuntary commitment of appellant was improper. There is no evidence of attempted suicide or self-mutilation. The burning newspaper in appellant’s cell cannot be viewed as such an attempt. Appellant was permitted to smoke and other inmates had access to his cell. There was no evidence that the newspaper was deliberately set on fire. The testimony reveals only that appellant was extinguishing a folded newspaper that was one-quarter burned when he was confronted by the correction officer.</p>
    <p id="b136-7" data-blocks='[["BL_136.7",136,[260,2286,1152,96]],["BL_137.1",137,[170,331,1147,464]]]'>Similarly, appellant’s occasional failure to take medication did not threaten his life or well-being. There was no <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>evidence to show that his behavior changed as a result of missed doses of the drug. Indeed, the only testimony offered indicated that the drug had long-lasting effectiveness and missing an occasional dose would not affect appellant’s behavior. Appellant’s possession of the piece of coathanger allegedly fashioned into a weapon was also not a proper basis for commitment. There was no testimony that appellant used or threatened to use the hanger to injure himself or others.</p>
    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[170,822,1147,417]]]'>Clearly none of the above instances constituted the overt act required by The Mental Health Procedures Act nor do they show such inability on the part of appellant to attend to his needs as to threaten death, serious bodily injury, or serious physical debilitation. As there was insufficient evidence that appellant posed a clear and present danger to himself or others under the Act, the hearing court erred in ordering appellant’s involuntary commitment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
