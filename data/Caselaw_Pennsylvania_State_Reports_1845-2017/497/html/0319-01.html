See 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b) and Pa.R.A.P. 312. At issue is whether an appeal from an order of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board upholding the refusal of the Board’s secretary to issue a complaint on unfair labor practice charges brought by a police union is to be taken to the Commonwealth Court or to the courts of common pleas. Appellant Delaware County Lodge # 27 (Fraternal Order of Police) appealed such an order to the Commonwealth Court. That court held that jurisdiction properly lies in the courts of common pleas and accordingly transferred the appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County. Because we conclude that the appeal was properly taken to the Commonwealth Court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 763, we vacate the order of the Commonwealth Court and remand for disposition of the merits of the appeal.</p>

(Supp.1981). In October of 1979, the Township filed a motion with the PLRB alleging that there had been improprieties in the election. In February of 1980, after several hearings, the PLRB sustained the Township’s claim and set aside the results of the election. The PLRB also dismissed charges of unfair labor practices filed by appellant against the Township for having refused to bargain for the 1980 calendar year while the dispute over the validity of the election was pending. 11 PPER ¶ 11069.</p>
    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[185,1044,1145,362]]]'>After further proceedings, the PLRB certified appellant as exclusive bargaining representative. Appellant filed new unfair labor practice charges with the PLRB in which it again challenged the Township’s refusal to bargain for the 1980 calendar year. The Secretary declined to issue a complaint. On June 4, 1980, the PLRB dismissed appellant’s exceptions. According to the Board,</p>

(1964 and Supp. 1981), jurisdiction over appellant’s appeal would have been vested in the court of common pleas. See <em>Philadelphia Fire Officers Ass’n v.

    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.4",388,[262,667,1155,726]]]'>Contrary to the view of the Commonwealth Court, the intent of the Legislature to effect such an alteration is clear. In the codification of the laws relating to this Commonwealth’s judicial system, the Legislature specifically stated that section 9(b) of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act is repealed “absolutely.” See Judiciary Act Repealer Act, supra. Section 9(b) is the very “portion” of section 9 which both created a right of appeal on behalf of “[a]ny person aggrieved by a final order of the board . . .and vested jurisdiction over such appeals in the courts of common pleas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> In repealing absolutely the right of appeal from orders of the PLRB conferred by section 9(b), the Legislature simultaneously provided for a general right of appeal from adjudications of Commonwealth agencies:</p>
