The Attorney General’s office, after study, concluded that the plan and regulations authorizing a two-year’s license was inconsistent with the Public Welfare Code, Act of June 13, 1967, P.L. 31, No. 21, 62 P.S. § 211 added by Act of July 10, 1980, P.L. 493, No. 105, (Supp.1981-82), and therefore was without proper statutory authority.

It mandates first that the Attorney General must review for form and legality all rules and regulations sought to be proposed by Commonwealth agencies. Second, it places upon the Attorney General the duty of notifying the agency in question if, in the judgment of the Attorney General, the proposed regulation or rule is either without statutory authority, violative of the Constitution or not in proper form. Third, this provision provides a new procedure in this Commonwealth whereby the Attorney General must also communicate his objection to the office of General Counsel and the General Assembly.

    <p id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[160,942,1148,734]]]'>An analysis of DPW’s argument reveals its fallacies. DPW seeks to latch upon the phrase “upon a proper showing” as evidencing a legislative intention to confer judicial discretion in determining whether the Attorney General’s request for stay should be granted. DPW concedes that section 204(b) authorizes the Attorney General to elect to trigger a judicial determination and that he may include a request for a stay of the implementation of the challenged rule or regulation. DPW then attempts to engraft the limitation that the stay will only be granted “if pleaded and proved in accordance with the applicable rules of appellate procedure and law.” [See appellee’s brief, pg. 6.] This implied limitation is supposed to flow from the legislative use of the phrase “upon a proper showing.”</p>
    <p id="b621-6" data-blocks='[["BL_621.6",621,[159,1694,1146,358]]]'>The initial error in this analysis is the effort to equate as synonymous the phrase “upon a proper showing” with the conferral of judicial discretion. The phrase “upon a proper showing” is equally compatible with the view that such a showing requires the Attorney General merely to establish that he has satisfied the procedural prerequisites dictated by Section 204(b).</p>

It is the duty of this Court to ascertain the intention of the General Assembly; that every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all of its provisions; that where the words of the statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit; and that the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable.

    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[267,830,1154,567]]]'>Following DPW’s approach, we are not only called upon to infer the existence of judicial discretion in the judgment of whether a stay should be allowed, but also we would be called upon to define the nature and extent of that discretion. Illustrative of the difficulty encountered with the acceptance of such a strained interpretation is DPW’s extensive discussion as to what factors should be considered and what standards should be employed in the exercise of that discretion. The fact that these questions were not addressed by the legislature argues strongly that these considerations were not intended.</p>

Excluding the use of the word “shall” that is presently questioned, it is clear from the other instances where the word was used in this subsection that the General Assembly intended a mandatory connotation.

This is especially surprising in light of the majority’s citation of, and alleged reliance upon, the rule of construction that every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to <em>a 11 </em>of its provisions.

Accordingly, the “manner as is provided for appeals”, including a <em>request </em>for a stay, consists of the rules of appellate practice and procedure governing appeals to the Commonwealth Court from final determinations of government agencies. Thus, the Attorney General’s petition for review and request for a stay must comply with the requirements of Chapter 15 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure (Judicial <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>Review of Governmental Determinations) and Chapter 17 (Effect of Appeals; Supersedeas and Stays), respectively.</p>

The Attorney General’s application for stay in the instant case fails to make any of these showings. Moreover, the applica<a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>tion makes no showing of the “reasons for the relief requested and the facts relied upon”, other than the bare legal assertion that the Commonwealth Attorney’s Act mandates granting the stay merely upon the Attorney General’s application. No facts are set forth in the Attorney General’s application that would justify the court’s granting the stay pursuant to the discretion vested in it under Pa.R.A.P. 1781(c) (“the appellate court . . . may grant an order of stay . .. upon such terms and conditions ... as the court or judge thereof may prescribe.”)</p>
    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.4",630,[262,872,1154,847]]]'>The majority interpretation would reduce the “proper showing” merely to the demonstration that the Attorney General reviewed the rule or regulation for legality and notified the appropriate parties. Such an interpretation totally ignores the requirement that the petition for review, including the request for stay, must be in the manner provided for appeals from final orders of government agencies. The majority voices concern with the “difficulty” of defining the nature and extent of that discretion since these questions were not specifically addressed in Section 204(b). However, this “difficulty” is no more or less than in <em>any </em>case involving an application for a stay under Pa.R.A.P. 1781. Accordingly, in order to give effect to all of the provisions of Section 204(b), I would affirm the denial by the Commonwealth Court of the Attorney General’s application for a stay.</p>
    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[263,1737,1156,635]],["BL_631.1",631,[202,353,1145,368]]]'>I am also unpersuaded by the majority’s discussion of “shall” versus “may”. It is quite clear that “shall be granted” is conditioned upon the Attorney General’s “proper showing”. Indeed other “shall” provisions of Section 204(b) are similarly conditional. For example, “[i]f the Attorney General determines that a rule or regulation is in improper form, not statutorily authorized or unconstitutional, he <em>shall notify . . </em>. the agency affected, the Office of General Counsel, and the General Assembly. . . . ” It would be absurd to argue that the use of “shall notify” <em>requires </em>the Attorney General to make a determination that the rule or regulation was in improper form, not statutorily authorized or unconsti<a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>tutional, yet the logic of the majority would suggest such an interpretation. <em>If </em>the Attorney General makes a proper showing, <em>then </em>the court shall grant his request for a stay— even though “shall” is mandatory, the condition must first be satisfied. Appellee’s interpretation does not, therefore, as the majority asserts, require “us to ignore the mandatory connotation usually attributed to the word ‘shall’.” (At 677).</p>
    <p id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.4",631,[200,745,1148,462]]]'>Finally, the purpose of the provision in question is no mystery. The majority maintains that unless its interpretation is correct, the Attorney General’s right to request a stay serves no purpose. The purpose is obvious — it confers <em>authority </em>upon the Attorney General to petition for review and request a stay or supersedeas where the governmental unit ignores his advice. Without such an authorization, the Attorney General would have no standing to pursue such review.</p>
