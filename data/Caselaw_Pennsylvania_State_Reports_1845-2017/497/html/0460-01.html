For example, Kelly responded “[o]h, absolutely, oh sure” when he was asked if “the Soviets were providing funds” to opponents of the B-l bomber. Kelly, who described himself as “an amateur student of Soviet affairs” also stated that Rockwell had once conducted a study to investigate “the degree to which the Soviets are funding the anti-bomber campaign.” Futher, while Kelly admitted he could provide “no specific documentation for Soviet activity” he “did not deny that he believes Soviets are involved financially.” The Thomas Mer<a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>ton Center is not even mentioned until the next to last paragraph in the article.</p>

Indeed, even the coordinator of the organization singled out by Kelly as “leading opposition to the project” understood Kelly’s remarks to mean that his group was merely the unwitting recipient of Soviet funds: “ ‘I am convinced we’re getting no funds from the Soviet Union... . If there’s any (Soviet funding), it certainly isn’t an appreciable amount.’ ”</p>

Our case law makes clear that Kelly’s failure to charge or imply appellee’s knowing participation in the purported Soviet funding is fatal to appellee’s effort to establish that Kelly’s statements are actionable. Thus, here this Court has held a letter actionable where the letter stated that the plaintiff had consciously participated in various communist organizations and had attended school at the Young Communist League. <em>Matson v.
