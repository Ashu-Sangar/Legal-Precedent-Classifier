The assailant attacked his victim from behind as she inserted the key into the door of her car. He grabbed her, then spun her around, choked her with one hand and repeatedly struck her with the other. After opening the door, he knocked his victim across the front seat, entered the car and locked the door. She was then pulled upright, seized by the throat, and beaten again. When she tried to escape, the assailant grabbed her and bit her cheek with such force that the scars were still evident at the time of trial. The assailant then took thirty-five dollars from her purse and forced her into the back seat, where he removed her clothes, and still choking her with one hand, raped her. The victim was unable to return to work for a month and bears a permanent scar on her face.</p>

As every one must be sensible, what sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another, and how necessary it is that a prisoner (when put to defend his life) should have a good opinion of his jury, the want of which might totally disconcert him, the law wills not that he should be tried by any one man against whom he has conceived a prejudice, even without being able to assign a reason for such his dislike. 2.

Both states, ultimately, require a showing that persons are challenged, in California, “because of their group association rather than because of any specific bias,” and in Massachusetts because “there is a likelihood they are being excluded from the jury solely by reason of their group membership.” It will be recalled that under <em>Swain v. Alabama, supra, </em>it is permissible to challenge a venireman peremptorily because of his race or religion or supposed group affiliation so long as there is reason to believe that the race, religion or supposed group affiliation is related to a significant issue in the case. <a href="/us/380/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="380 U.S. 202" data-case-ids="1524661" data-case-paths="/us/380/0202-01">380 U.S. at 221</a>, <a href="/us/380/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="380 U.S. 202" data-case-ids="1524661" data-case-paths="/us/380/0202-01">85 S.Ct. at 836</a>. A prosecutor’s response to an objection to peremptory challenge of black veniremen in California and Massachusetts, therefore, need be only that in the prosecutor’s judgment, the race of the venireman is related to the venireman’s ability to be impartial in the case. This idea has been considerably expanded in a recent article concerning the ease with which the California and Massachusetts approaches can be circumvented by prosecutors who merely articulate reasons for their challenges.

Moreover, the inclusion of members of the “distinctive class” on the petit jury, or at least the prohibition of a deliberate attempt to prevent their service, provides a perception of fairness in the proceedings. To argue, as the majority attempts to do, that the unfettered exercise of the peremptory challenge fosters the perception of impartiality by deliberate exclusion (in a cause where the racial overtones are obvious) is unrealistic and hypocritical. The closeness of the factual issues presented in this particular case was demonstrated by the difficulty the jury experienced in reaching a judgment. It is unfortunate that the legitimacy of the proceedings was allowed to be tainted by the misguided belief in the sanctity of an unbridled and arbitrary right to exclude prospective jurors who have otherwise demonstrated their competency to serve as impartial jurors.

It is true that prior convictions for theft and robbery have a sufficient relationship to the veracity of the defendant-witness to satisfy the first consideration of the <em>Roots </em>test. I would also agree that the third consideration would not dictate the <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>exclusion of the testimony since appellant had reached legal age at the time the alleged act was committed.

Had appellant been free to offer his denial subject to cross-examination by the prosecution, without reference to the prior convictions, the jury would have had before it the accused and could have made their judgment based upon the appearance of both the victim and appellant on the witness stand. The traditional standards for assessing credibility would have provided the basis for the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b114-6" data-blocks='[["BL_114.5",114,[260,1245,1152,737]]]'>It again must be emphasized that the question of guilt or innocence in this case was an extremely close one. Under such circumstances, the failure of the defendant to take the stand in his own behalf cannot be dismissed as having no significance. There also can be very little question of the legitimacy of the defense’s concern as to the prospects of having prior convictions of robbery and theft made known to this jury. It would appear that the instant situation presents a clear example of a situation where the introduction of the prior record would have a greater tendency to smear the character of the defendant than that testimony would serve to assist the jury in assessing credibility. Thus, the second criteria articulated in <em>Roots </em>appears to argue against the ruling made by the trial court.</p>

When we weigh the prosecution’s need for the introduction of the prior offenses against the availability of other evidence which the defense may have yhad to present its case, it appears that the scales must also be tipped in favor of the defense. In this case, the Commonwealth had available the <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>victim of the crime who was an eyewitness and could supply all of the details to support the Commonwealth’s version of the event. There was no reliance upon circumstantial proof. The defense, on the other hand, did not have other available means to refute the Commonwealth’s testimony. As noted by the majority, there was no alibi testimony. Under the facts of the case only the perpetrator and the victim were present. To conclude as the majority does that the failure of the defense to assert an affirmative defense such as alibi or consent reduces the defense’s need for testimony from the defendant is absurd. Unquestionably, the defendant’s assertion before the jury of a denial would have been critical to his position.</p>

The <em>systematic </em>exclusion of any “distinctive” group in the community from participation in the administration of justice is a real concern, <em>see e. g., Duren v.

This fact does not force the conclusion that the “fair-cross-section violation” is limited to a pattern of such violations. Constitutional protections must be as viable in individual cases as it is where a pattern of discrimination is demonstrated.</p>
