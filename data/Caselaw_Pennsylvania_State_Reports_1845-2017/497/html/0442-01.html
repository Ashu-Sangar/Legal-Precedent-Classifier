Armed with knives and screwdrivers, appellant and a dozen or so other members ambushed three boys coming out of a grocery store, stabbing all three and killing Steven Johnson. Appellant was placed under arrest after being questioned later the same evening.</p>

He was found guilty of murder of third degree, criminal conspiracy and various weapons offenses. Appellant filed a motion for a new trial and in arrest of judgment and on December 14, 1976, Judge Halbert granted appellant’s motion for a new trial.</p>

Following a denial of posttrial motions, Judge Stout sentenced appellant to fifteen months to five years for murder of the third degree, computed from the time of arrest. Sentences <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>were suspended on the other convictions. Appellant did not file a direct appeal.</p>

The P. C. H. A. court denied the petition and appellant appealed to this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

A complaint was filed against appellant on January 6, 1976. The Rule 1100 run date was July 4, 1976, a Sunday. In 1976, since the Fourth of July fell on a Sunday, it was celebrated on Monday, July 5th. The courts were closed that Monday and appellant was brought to trial the following day, Tuesday, July 6, 1976. Section 1908 of the Statutory Construction Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> provides that “[wjhenever the last day of any such period [of time referred to in a statute] shall fall on Saturday or Sunday, or on any day made a legal holiday by the laws of this Commonwealth or of the United States, such day shall be omitted from the <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>computation.” Section 1908 of the Act applies to the Rule 1100 run date calculation. <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, the 4th and 5th of July were excluded from the computation of the 180 days. Consequently, appellant’s Rule 1100 claim is baseless. Appellant’s counsel cannot be found ineffective for failing to pursue a meritless claim. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pettus, </em><a href="/pa/492/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="492 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1767206" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0558-01">492 Pa. 558</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="492 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1767206" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0558-01">424 A.2d 1332</a> (1981).</p>
