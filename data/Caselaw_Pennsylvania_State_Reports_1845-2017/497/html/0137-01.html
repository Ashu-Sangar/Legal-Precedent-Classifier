Court and county officials conferred several times in October and November of 1980, yet on December 10, 1980, the county published a proposed 1981 budget which not only excluded funding for these new positions but also provided for reductions in the Court’s existing staff. Subsequent meetings were apparently fruitless, as the county’s 1981 budget in its final form continued to reflect these limitations on court staffing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In addition, plaintiffs sought a writ of mandamus compelling defendants to comply with the court’s budget demands. Plaintiffs grounded their entitlement to relief on “the inherent power [of the judiciary] to determine and compel the budgeting, appropriation and payment by the executive and legislative branches of those sums that are reasonable and necessary to carry out its mandated responsibilities for the judicial administration.” (Plaintiffs’ Complaint at 2)</p>

Plaintiffs refer to the salary increase issue for the first time in their Petition That This Court Assume Plenary Jurisdiction.
