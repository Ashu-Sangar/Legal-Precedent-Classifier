It is argued that Mr. Turner did not admit participation in the homicide and to the contrary attempted to deny complicity.</p>
    <p id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[174,887,1147,579]]]'>The record reflects that appellant was arrested on August 2, 1978 for the murder of Edward Yagatich. The homicide-robbery occurred on June 14, 1978. On or about June 17, 1978, the name of Henry “Fats” Turner surfaced as a possible participant. As a result, there were several police interviews with Mr. Turner that failed to produce positive results. On August 2, 1978, Mr. Turner, during an interview, stated: “All right, I’ll tell you what happened.” Mr. Turner then proceeded to state that appellant and Paul Upshur had committed the robbery at Babyland and admitted that he (Turner) was the driver of the vehicle involved.</p>
    <p id="b327-7" data-blocks='[["BL_327.6",327,[172,1491,1148,419]]]'>The crux of appellant’s argument is that the statement could not qualify as a declaration against penal interest since Turner maintained that he drove appellant and Upshur without knowledge of their intent to rob the store in question. This position assumes that the declarant must acknowledge full-fledged participation in all aspects of the criminal scheme before his statement possesses the inherent reliability to support the warrant of arrest.</p>
    <p id="b327-8" data-blocks='[["BL_327.7",327,[171,1934,1147,419]]]'>In the earlier conversations with the police Mr. Turner mentioned that he had no personal knowledge of the event. In the August 2 statement he acknowledged his actual presence, as a result of which he was arrested and charged with hindering apprehension or prosecution. Moreover, his statements made him vulnerable, at least, to a charge of an accessory for his participation in or assistance in flight from the robbery.</p>

      <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>The fact that the participant was in a position to possess direct personal knowledge eliminates the concern that the information may be a product of hearsay. That the statement is to any extent adverse to the declarant’s penal interest, and exposes him to possible criminal prosecution supplies the reliability of the information offered. It is to be anticipated that a co-participant will attempt to minimize his own participation in the criminal venture and is likely to exaggerate the role of the co-actors. These inaccuracies may be exposed during the later stages of the prosecution, but they are not of sufficient moment to prevent the issuance of a warrant of arrest based upon such information. At the arrest stage the concern is the involvement of the suspect; the degree of that involvement is properly determined thereafter.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[258,1113,1155,303]]]'>Appellant also attempts to attack the probable cause for his arrest raising the unavailability of Turner at the time of the suppression hearing.

    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[256,1439,1154,928]]]'>It is clear from the record that the Commonwealth did make diligent efforts to locate and produce Turner for the suppression hearing. It is also a fact that Turner was available and testified at the Coroner’s hearing at which time he was fully cross-examined by appellant’s counsel. Moreover, the facts presented here do not present the concern in <em>Commonwealth v. Hall, supra. </em>The pivotal question in <em>Hall </em>was the reliability of the information attributed to an unnamed informer. The only basis for an assessment of the reliability of the informer’s information was the officers’ assertion as to the informer’s performance in other investigations. Here the declarant was known and appellant had the opportunity to offer any evidence that may have been available to challenge Turner’s credibility. Thus, for the foregoing reasons we must reject appellant’s challenge to the probable cause of the warrant of arrest as a basis for challenging the introduction of appellant’s inculpatory statements made to the police after his arrest.</p>

Trial counsel testified below he in fact interviewed this witness as well as all other potential witnesses. He stated that his decision not to call a given prospective witness was based upon his judgment that the testimony would have been either irrelevant or detrimental to the defense.

And you are not to speculate as to the question as to whether or not he took a lie detector. And in fact, whether or not there are any results, you will disregard that testimony. You will judge the credibility of this witness as you would judge the credibility of any other witness. I’ll explain in detail during the charge of the Court how you will go about determining truthfulness and accuracy of testimony.</p>

Turner maintained that he drove Upshur and Miller without knowledge of their intent to rob the store. This is not a declaration against penal interest. It is not illegal to drive persons from one point to another. It may be illegal to drive them knowing that they intend to commit a crime when they arrive, but that is not what happened here. If the probable cause to arrest is to withstand scrutiny, it must be because “we have tended to credit information supplied by one who has some direct personal knowledge of the crime.” <em>Commonwealth v. Stokes, </em><a href="/pa/480/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="480 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="1745054" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0038-01">480 Pa. 38</a>, 44, <a href="/pa/480/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="480 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="1745054" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0038-01">389 A.2d 74</a>, 77 (1978).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> Thus I concur with the majority in holding that the arrest warrant was valid, but only because it was supported by the personal knowledge of Mr. Turner.</p>

This Court has held that references to lie detector tests, which raise inferences regarding the guilt or innocence of a defendant, are impermissible. <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/441/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="441 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1933834" data-case-paths="/pa/441/0237-01">441 Pa. 237</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=272%20A.2d%20467" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="272 A.2d 467">272 A.2d 467</a> (1971).

Hence, the witness’ testimony was incurably bolstered by the reference to the test, and the curative instruction was <em>per se </em>inadequate to remedy the error. Thus, I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>

The first requirement is met by virtue of Turner’s presence with the accused in the car where he overheard the remark, “Why did you have to shoot the man?” The second requirement is met because Turner’s story places him, albeit unwittingly, at a criminal transaction. Turner, having told his story, can expect, at a minimum, to be closely examined by the police as to whether he was really a willing participant. Turner’s declaration is not against penal interest, but it is such as to invite close scrutiny, and, as such, is reliable.</p>
