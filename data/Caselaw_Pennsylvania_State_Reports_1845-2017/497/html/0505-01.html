On March 5, 1975, appellant was taken into custody by the police and interrogated in connection with the murder of John Wearing. At that time appellant made an exculpatory statement. At trial, during direct examination by the prosecutor, the interrogating officer read appellant’s statement into the record. On cross-examination, appellant’s <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>counsel elicited from the interrogating officer that appellant did not request that an attorney be present during the interrogation.

Appellant bases this contention on <em>Commonwealth v. Haideman, </em><a href="/pa/449/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="449 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1945637" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0367-01">449 Pa. 367</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="296 A.2d 765">296 A.2d 765</a> (1972). In <em>Haideman, </em>this Court held that testimonial reference to an accused’s silence and request for an attorney at time of arrest is a violation of the Fifth Amendment, and is reversible error. <em>Haideman </em>is based on the policy that a prosecutor should not be permitted to use a defendant’s exercise of a Fifth Amendment right to suggest an inference of guilt. However, it is not a violation of the Fifth Amendment for a prosecutor to elicit testimony concerning a defendant’s exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights, if it is not designed to suggest an inference of guilt, but rather to refute an inference that the defense has improperly suggested. <em>Commonwealth v. Kahley, </em><a href="/pa/467/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="467 Pa. 272" data-case-ids="1717312" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0272-01">467 Pa. 272</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="467 Pa. 272" data-case-ids="1717312" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0272-01">356 A.2d 745</a> (1977).</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[280,1702,1155,690]]]'>In his cross-examination of the interrogating officer, defense counsel attempted to mislead the jury into believing that appellant had never requested that a lawyer be present on the day of the interrogation, and thus was endeavoring to create the misimpression that appellant decided to forgo his Fifth Amendment right to counsel to suggest an inference of innocence. Thus, the question by the prosecutor was proper because it was designed to prevent the jury from being misled. Appellant’s contention that the prosecutor’s reference to appellant’s representation during interrogation was improper is without merit. Consequently, appellant’s trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor’s question.</p>

Since appellant was charged with criminal conspiracy, evidence of the gang activity involved in the present case is highly probative of whether a conspiracy existed.

Section 1180-3(d) of the P.C.H.A. states that a petitioner may not raise an issue in a P.C.H.A. petition if that issue has been waived. However, since this is the first time that he has been represented by counsel other than his trial counsel, appellant’s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel have not been waived. <em>Commonwealth v.

This Court has held that a prosecutor’s remark that a particular crime was “an attack at our very system” did not prevent the jury from rendering a true verdict, particularly when the prosecution reminded the jury to realize and discharge its duty “very fairly and firmly so that justice may be done.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Counsel did not object to the interrogating officer’s redirect testimony regarding the presence of appellant’s attorney at the stationhouse because the attorney was present only after appellant had made an exculpatory statement. In counsel’s judgment, the redirect testimony “tended to corroborate” the exculpatory statement. Counsel refrained from objecting to the prosecutor’s closing reference to gang activity on the basis of his determination that the references were helpful to appellant’s defense in light of the evidence indicating that appellant had not been a gang member.
