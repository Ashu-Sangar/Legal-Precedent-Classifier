On April 12, 1979, appellant filed a motion to transfer the case from the Criminal Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County to Juvenile Court, pursuant to Section 6322 of the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6322.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial court denied the motion to transfer on May 21, 1979, following a counselled evidentiary hearing.
