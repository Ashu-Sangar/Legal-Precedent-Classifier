Beilis, for the common law crimes of misfeasance, malfeasance and nonfeasance in office (hereinafter collectively referred to as “common law crimes”). At issue is whether Section 1104 of the Penal Code precludes prosecution of an accused for both a statutory offense and a common law offense when the misconduct charged could factually support a conviction for both, but the elements of the offenses are different.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We conclude that a common law prosecution is not barred simply because the facts alleged would also support conviction of a statutory crime which includes elements not found in the common law offense.</p>

Shortly thereafter, appellee called him and requested a payment of $4,000 in cash. The architect complied the very next day by handing appellee an envelope containing $4,000 in cash. Several months after this payment the architect received the final airport contract with the City for an additional fee of $175,000, and on July 26, 1972 appellee requested an additional $5,000 “contribution.” The following day, the architect gave appellee an envelope containing $5,000 in cash.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The records of the Democratic City Committee do not reflect receipt of any sums in these amounts from the architect or from appellee, and the architect never received any acknowledgement of the payments.

Although not addressed by the majority of the Superior Court, one final issue remains for our review. Citing the concurring opinion of Judge Spaeth in the Superior Court, appellee draws a distinction between misconduct <em>in </em>office and misconduct <em>while </em>in office. He contends that his conviction cannot be sustained because he “did nothing in office” which would constitute misconduct. We conclude, however, that the evidence sufficiently establishes that he used his powerful official position in an improper and corrupt way. Appellee’s entire kickback scheme was made possible solely because he held the office of majority leader of City Council and because he misused the power and status of that position. He deliberately created the circumstances under which he or his political party could benefit from a pay-off on a City contract. This reprehensible conduct is sufficient to satisfy a conviction for the common law crimes. <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>
