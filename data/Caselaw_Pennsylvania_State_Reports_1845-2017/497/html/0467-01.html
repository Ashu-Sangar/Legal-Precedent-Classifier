Exceptions were filed to the recommendation of the hearing committee, and a three-member panel of the Disciplinary Board heard oral argument. Thereafter, on October 28, 1981, the Board issued their report and recommendation, which adopted the hearing committee’s findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Board, however, rejected the committee’s recommendation of a five-year suspension and instead recommended to this Court that respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.</p>

Following argument on January 19, 1982, a thorough review of the record, and careful consideration of the arguments raised in respondent’s brief, we conclude, in keeping with the Board’s recommendation, that disbarment is the appropriate sanction in this matter.</p>
    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[179,1376,1147,789]]]'>The following facts are pertinent. In September, 1977, Mr. Wilmer Lovett (hereinafter “Lovett”) hired respondent to represent him in real estate legal matters and in the sale of land owned by Lovett. Respondent was to be paid a 10% commission for all land sold, and this amount was to include payment for respondent’s legal representation. Lovett also advanced respondent $1,200 at that time. Respondent subsequently became dissatisfied and proposed other fee arrangements to Lovett. Respondent asserted that Lovett agreed to either sign a promissory note in the amount of $6,930 or pay respondent “out of the next settlement.” Lovett never signed the promissory note. In fact, respondent claimed he rejected all other fee proposals. The next settlement was with one Fay Parker (hereinafter “Parker”) on December 13, 1978.</p>
    <p id="b535-6" data-blocks='[["BL_535.6",535,[179,2187,1147,203]],["BL_536.1",536,[274,337,1153,416]]]'>On February 9, 1978, respondent wrote to Lovett and stated that “all legal matters are at a stop” until respondent secured an acceptable financial agreement with Lovett. On March 5, 1978, respondent again wrote to Lovett and stated <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>that he could not “put forth anymore effort” for Lovett until he received at least $500. Nevertheless, despite Lovett’s refusal to accede to respondent’s fee demands, respondent continued to work on behalf of Lovett. In September or October, 1978, based upon respondent’s repeated notification that he would refrain from further representation unless Lovett paid him additional fees, Lovett hired a new attorney.</p>
    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[274,772,1155,302]]]'>Parker was a recipient of a loan from Lovett which was secured by a mortgage held by Lovett as mortgagee. In November, 1978, Parker contacted respondent, having been referred to him by Lovett’s previous attorney, and indicated that she wished to pay off her mortgage. She was never informed that Lovett had obtained new counsel.</p>
    <p id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[274,1102,1155,844]]]'>On December 7, 1978, respondent wrote to Lovett to verify the amount on the mortgage. Since Lovett believed that Parker would contact him directly, and further, that no settlement could occur without his presence, he never answered respondent’s letter. On December 18, 1978, a title officer of the Industrial Valley Title Insurance Company, mailed respondent a check in the amount of $2,059.28, payable to Wilmer Lovett, which represented full payment of the mortgage which had been held by Lovett and which was paid off by Parker. Five days later respondent wrote to Lovett and stated that he had received “the payoff from Mrs. Parker which is being applied to your outstanding legal fees.” Respondent concealed the fact that he had in his possession a check payable to Lovett. In fact, Lovett never learned of the check’s existence until the investigation by the Disciplinary Board began.</p>

Lovett never signed the check, and neither respondent nor anyone else requested Lovett’s permission to endorse the check in his name. On December 19, 1978, respondent deposited the check, with the forged endorsement, into respondent’s personal account at the Union National Bank and Trust Company. By January 2, 1979, respondent had spent the proceeds <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>for his own use, without the permission or consent of Lovett. Respondent has never made restitution to Lovett.</p>
    <p id="b537-4" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[168,456,1148,528]]]'>Also during this time, Lovett’s wife received a threatening letter from respondent, urging her to convince Lovett to pay his legal fees. Respondent threatened, should she not comply, to destroy Lovett’s files and promised additional “aggressive collection techniques.” Additionally, Lovett claims he was harassed by individuals purporting to be from the ABC Collection Agency on numerous occasions. He twice received telephone calls from an unidentified individual, once at 2:15 a. m., who threatened to kill Lovett’s 35 hunting dogs unless he paid respondent $4,000.</p>
    <p id="b537-5" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[168,1008,1147,475]]]'>Despite respondent’s letter to the hearing committee stating that he had indeed turned Lovett’s account over to the ABC Collection Agency, respondent not only failed to present any evidence as to his non-involvement in the aforesaid collection methods, but he also failed to present any evidence that the ABC Collection Agency even existed. Significantly, Lovett’s new attorney testified that respondent admitted to him that the individuals from the alleged collection agency were actually respondent’s employees.</p>
    <p id="b537-6" data-blocks='[["BL_537.6",537,[168,1506,1147,303]]]'>Finally, respondent advised Lovett by letter to utilize illegal methods to force his tenants to vacate Lovett’s property. To this end he devised a plan to force the tenants to leave, and accepted an $800 check from Lovett to put the plan into action. The plan was ultimately abandoned and the check returned.</p>
