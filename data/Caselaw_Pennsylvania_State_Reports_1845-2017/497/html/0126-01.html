On March 29, 1972 the left hand of David John Nath, appellant, became caught in the gears and blades of a wire and cable stripping machine which did not provide a guard to protect the user’s hands. Mr. Nath lost three fingers and part of the hand. His employer, Keystone Metals Company (now Keystone Resources) obtained the machine from the Rigby Manufacturing Company, which made it. Keystone asked appellee, National Equipment Leasing Corporation (National) to finance the purchase. Keystone had ordered the machine, bargained for the purchase price and received the initial invoice of $1,875.00.</p>

The party merely financing the transaction has no control over its manufacture, is not involved in the selection of the product nor in any way makes a representation as to its quality or soundness. Between the financier and the ultimate purchaser, it is usually the latter who selects the goods, negotiates for its purchase and has control over its use.</p>

Such a result would have catastrophic impact upon commerce. Financing institutions are not equipped to pass upon the quality of the myriad of products they are called upon to finance nor do they have direct impact upon the manufacturing process of the product to exercise quality control. Finally, their relationship with a particular manufacturer does not, in the normal course, possess the continuity of transactions that would provide a basis for indirect influence over the condition and the safety of the product.</p>

A theory of liability asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>was that of strict liability under § 402A of the Restatement (Second) of <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>Torts. The specific allegation in appellant’s complaint is that appellee leased or rented to appellant’s employer, under a contract captioned “Equipment Lease”, a wire and cable stripper, which machine was unreasonably dangerous in that it lacked a guard to protect a user’s hands from the machine’s cutting edges.</p>
    <p id="b200-4" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[259,663,1154,896]]]'>Appellant then filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, requesting the trial court to rule that appellee was a “lessor-sellor under Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts 2d.” Although a court en banc denied the motion, the trial court certified the matter to the Superior Court, since the trial court had concluded that the controlling questions of whether § 402A extended to lessors was one as to which there was a substantial difference of opinion. After an affirmance by the Superior Court, we granted appellant’s petition for appeal and thereafter remanded the case to the trial court for further consideration, in light of our then-recently decided <em>Francioni v.

    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[260,1577,1153,312]]]'>Upon remand, the parties agreed to a trial <em>in limine, </em>limited to the issue of whether the lease in question was a commercial lease or a finance lease. The trial court concluded that the lease was a finance lease and that strict liability under 402A did not apply. The Superior Court affirmed and we granted appellant’s petition for appeal.</p>

    <p id="b201-7" data-blocks='[["BL_201.6",201,[169,1365,1148,805]]]'>It is beyond dispute that in Pennsylvania the imposition of strict liability has been premised upon the need to relieve consumers of a burden which may be intolerable to one upon whom caprice has placed it and to shift that burden to those whose business it is to traffic in commerce. Nor am I persuaded that those who facilitate the placing of goods in commerce by providing indispensable funds for the purchase and subsequent financial leasing of goods play a role any less critical to hazard creation than such others as job wholesalers. The circumstance that wholesalers, financial lessors, and (often) retailers have little or no opportunity to inspect goods in which they deal is inconsequential, since strict liability is imposed without reference to whether caution was exercised or disregarded, if <em>in fact </em>the product was defective.</p>

It is those parties-participant who have the capacity to spread the costs of injury over society at large and relieve those innocent victims of a defective product of what may be disastrous financial consequences. To afford a shield for institutions which play a vital and continuing role in product marketing would be to retreat from our basic and informing premise. Given the frequently indispensable role played in the marketing scheme by finance lessors, no justification can be advanced for affording the financial lessor the uniquely privileged position here urged by appellee.</p>

The availability of the lessor for redress, the incentive to safety, the possible prevention of the circulation of defective products, and finally cost-distribution for injuries sustained are all factors dictating 402A coverage no less for financial lessors than for commercial lessors, wholesalers, or retailers. Indeed I would expect that inclusion of finance lessors would enhance the likelihood of realizing these objectives, because of the greater number and diversity of interested parties.</p>
