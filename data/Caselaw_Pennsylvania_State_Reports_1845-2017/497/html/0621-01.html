While taking a shortcut through a field on his way home, appellant was approached by the victim who asked appellant if he had seen anybody in the field having intercourse. Without further discussion, appellant continued through the field towards his home. As he exited the field, appellant warned two acquaintances not to enter the field because “there is an old rapist down there.” After procuring some cigarettes and a knife from his home, appellant asked an acquaintance to accompany him back into the field. Before he entered the field, appellant requested the acquaintance to wait by the edge of the field until he returned. Appellant went into the field and was once again confronted by the victim. The two men struggled and appellant stabbed the victim several times, causing his death. The only weapon found at the scene belonged to the appellant.</p>
