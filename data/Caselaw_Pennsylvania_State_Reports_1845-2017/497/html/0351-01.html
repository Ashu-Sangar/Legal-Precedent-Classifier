Moreover, the observation of former Chief Justice Jones overlooks the fact that the two constitutional provisions in dispute can be construed as compatible, and thus must be so construed. As has been shown, Article V, § 13(a), provides a general rule that state-wide judges are to be elected at municipal elections, while Article VII, § 3, provides a specific exception authorizing the election of state-wide judges at general elections “as circumstances may require.”</p>

Article V, § 15, in pertinent part, relating to retention elections of Supreme Court Justices provides, <em>inter alia: </em>“If a justice ... files a declaration [of intent to seek retention] his name shall be submitted to the electorate ... at the <em>municipal election </em>immediately preceding the expiration of the term of office of the justice. ... ” [Emphasis added.] Under the holding of the majority in the instant case, petitioner, if elected in November 1982, would assume office in January 1983. His ten-year term of office would expire in January of 1993. If petitioner decided to seek retention under Article V, § 15 the <em>“municipal election immediately preceding </em>the expiration” of his term would have to take place in November 1991, over one year before the expiration of petitioner’s term. <em>See e.g., Commonwealth ex rel.

This attempted symmetry that began with the 1913 amendment to Article VII, § 3 (Courts of Common Pleas); the 1968 amendment to Article V, Schedule, § 2 (Superior Court); and the 1968 amendment to Article V, Schedule, § 3 (Commonwealth Court) would have been finally achieved but for today’s result.

It is obvious when the proper constitutional interpretive analysis is accepted, i.e., the constitution mandates throughout its provisions that judicial elections occur during odd-numbered years and that these provisions are not in conflict but rather in complete harmony, the majority’s attempt to reconcile “seemingly inconsistent” or “ambiguous” constitutional provisions becomes unnecessary.</p>
