On December 7, 1976, in an effort to substantiate his first complaint, appellant took the deposition of James Seif, Special Assistant to the Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, Richard Thornburgh (now Governor of Pennsylvania). As “Special Assistant,” Seif ranked immediately below the Assistant Attorney General. Seif not only organized the work of the Criminal Division and reviewed all mail addressed to the Assistant Attorney General, but also served as an advisor to the Assistant Attorney General and was familiar with personnel problems within the Division.</p>

Additionally, according to Seif, when Lame told him of appellant’s resignation, Seif responded, “Well, it’s a good thing he did, because they would have thrown his ass out of here if he hadn’t.” Seif said that his conversation with Lame was reflected in the statement in appellee’s April 1 article that if appellant had not resigned he would have been asked to do so. Seif disclaimed responsibility for the specific information that Tyler would have requested appellant’s resignation at the April 1 meeting.</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[158,1044,1146,416]]]'>On December 15, 1976, appellant filed a “Notice of Taking of Depositions” pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.Proc. 4007 (now 4007.-1).

The parties stipulated that the depositions would be taken on January 11, 1977.</p>

Appellee simultaneously filed motions for a protective order pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.Proc. 4012 staying appellant’s taking of depositions until the alternative petitions were resolved. According to appellee, a stay of the scheduled depositions until resolution of the alternative petitions was necessary because the scheduled depositions of its employees would require “prompt rulings” on a number of issues, including the scope of “privileged communications.” Although appellant filed answers opposing the alternative petitions, he did not answer the motions for protective orders. Depositions were not taken on the scheduled date.</p>

Accompanying appellee’s motions were the affidavits of the two employees of appellee that appellant had sought to depose, Anthony Lame and Janice Schaffer, and two other employees, John Severson and Robert Frump. Severson claimed to be the author of the “In Passing” column in the Sunday, April 4, edition of appellee’s newspaper which repeated the story on appellant’s resignation. Frump was named as co-author of the September 24 article on the Marston remarks.</p>

They attributed the false statements in the September 24 article to a misunderstanding on the part of Frump, the alleged author of the article.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Schaffer concluded her affidavit by stating her belief that, while he was in office, appellant had engaged in a pattern of conduct designed to deprive appellee of “access to news of legitimate and important public interest and concern.”</p>

When appellee filed its motions for summary judgment, it also filed “supplemental” motions for protective orders. In these supplemental motions, appellee alleged that its motions for summary judgment and affidavits demonstrated the absence of material issues of fact, and that the depositions of its employees which appellant had previously scheduled would “shed no further light on the issues . . . . ” According to appellee’s supplemental motions, “unless and until plaintiff can demonstrate that a material triable issue remains for disposition by the Court,” appellee should not be put to the “burden and expense of protracted discovery proceedings . . . . ” Appellant did not contest the allegations contained in appellee’s supplemental motions.</p>

He stated that, in a conversation with appellee’s reporter Schaffer that same day, he had told Schaffer that her sources were wrong, and that he had personally requested the scheduled meeting with Harold Tyler. Appellant also submitted the affidavit of his former assistant, J. Clayton Undercofler, Esquire. This affidavit states that appellant had scheduled the meeting with Harold Tyler before appellant announced his resignation. The affidavit further states that, on the date of the announcement of the resignation, Undercofler spoke with appellee’s reporter Schaffer. According to Undercofler, Schaffer told Undercofler that she had information that appellant had resigned because appellant was going to be fired by Tyler, and that the purpose of the meeting scheduled for April 1 was to fire appellant. Undercofler’s affidavit states that he told Schaffer that the story was untrue, and that the purpose of <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>the scheduled meeting was to discuss office matters. Undercofler states that he told Schaffer to call Tyler’s assistant Gray, who would confirm both that the scheduled meeting was to involve office matters, and that appellant was not going to be fired. A third affiant for appellant, former Assistant U. S. Attorney Joseph Fioravanti, stated that, on the morning of April 1, he had received a phone call from Schaffer. According to this affidavit, Schaffer told Fioravanti that Tyler’s assistant Gray had confirmed that appellant had called the April 1 meeting. According to the affidavit, when asked if Tyler expected to request appellant’s resignation, at the meeting, Gray said that he “could not” comment and that Schaffer would have to consult with appellant.</p>

Appellant stated that he had personally “participated in the decision making process concerning that investigation during the time that I served as head of the office,” and that in February or March of 1976 he had assigned Assistant U. S. Attorney William Winning to aid Fioravanti in the investigation. In an affidavit filed on behalf of appellant, Winning stated that he had attended the Marston press conference along with Janice Schaffer and other reporters.

Moreover, the record indicates that the spokesman for Tyler, who purportedly would have asked for appellant’s resignation the next day, had refused to comment. However, contrary to the assertion of appellant, neither the pre-publication denials nor the refusal to comment served to cast sufficient doubt upon the veracity of the April 1 publication to make the issue of actual malice a question for a jury. The refusal of Tyler’s spokesman to comment neither undermined nor contributed to the veracity of the report. Moreover, the denials of appellant and his assistant, when weighed against the information supplied by Seif, could reasonably have been dismissed as subjective statements not impeaching the integrity of the information supplied by the federal source.

However, appellee’s inclusion of the additional details beyond the scope of the information supplied by Seif does not assist appellant’s cause in establishing actual malice.

Reasonably viewed, the specific information that Tyler would have asked for the resignation at the meeting was not by itself defamatory. Rather, the information merely embellished the report that appellant would have been asked to resign if he had not done so.
