Respondent was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1966. During his tenure as a Congressman, respondent simultaneously practiced law in a partnership with three other attorneys.

This legislation was signed into law on June 24, 1975, by President Gerald R.

However, respondent contends that a close examination of the accounts of the law firms reveal that only a small part of the $34,900 could be traced to the hospital matter. Most of the money represented funds owed to respondent by the companion firm for other legitimate legal services. In fact, respondent places the blame for his unlawful receipt of funds on an accounting error of the partner who was responsible for the distribution of funds and who normally omitted all funds generated by federal representation from respondent’s share of the partnership draw.</p>

The fact that respondent proceeded to establish such an arrangement in the face of its dubious nature indicates to us at least an awareness on his part of the need for an abundance of caution in the administration of the firms.

This argument bears a resemblance to the case where an associate under the employ of the attorney subject to discipline was the one who actually prepared false contingent fees for which the attorney was held responsible. Just as we held therein, respondent is not relieved of culpability because he may not have “dirtied his hands with the manual task.” <em>In re Berlant Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/458/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="458 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="479722" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0439-01">458 Pa. 439</a>, 442, <a href="/citations/?q=328%20A.2d%20471" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="328 A.2d 471">328 A.2d 471</a>, 474 (1974).</p>

Nonetheless, he voluntarily engaged in the practice of law with a firm whose clientele required federal representation. In fact, respondent played a role in actively encouraging such clients to hire his firm for representation. In doing so, he walked a very narrow line between proper and improper conduct. The danger of receiving some federally prohibited funds was obvious, yet he completely delegated the responsibility to insure against that event to another attorney. The exact amount by which he benefitted is irrelevant to our imposition of discipline. Just as we do not discipline attorneys based on whether their schemes to defraud clients were successful or not, we are not now concerned with whether respondent received $100 or $34,900 in illicit funds.
