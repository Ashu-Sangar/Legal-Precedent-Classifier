The sole issue is whether the trial court properly instructed the jury on the “personal maintenance” deduction. A panel of the Superior Court was of the view that a new trial is necessary because the instruction unduly limited the scope of items includible within the deduction to “subsistence level expenses.” We hold that on the present record the court’s charge does not require a new trial.

We recognize that, in rejecting the accumulations standard, <em>Pezzulli </em>stated that there should be no deduction from gross earnings. However, this statement was dictum, as the plaintiff had expressed satisfaction with the trial court’s charge directing the jury to deduct the cost of maintenance from gross earnings. <a href="/pa/344/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="344 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="1211044" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0643-01">344 Pa. at </a>646 &amp; 649, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20A.2d%20659" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="26 A.2d 659">26 A.2d at </a>660 &amp; 662. In any event, the dictum in <em>Pezzulli </em>was repudiated by this Court in <em>Murray v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., </em><a href="/pa/359/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="359 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="473161" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0069-01">359 Pa. 69</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.2d%20323" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="58 A.2d 323">58 A.2d 323</a> (1948), where the “cost of maintenance” deduction was approved.
