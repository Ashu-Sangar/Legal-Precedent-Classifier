Appellant was the low bidder on this project, and on January 15,1978 appellant and PennDOT entered into a written contract in which appellant agreed to maintain the rest areas for a one year period in exchange for a lump sum payment from PennDOT not to exceed $73,000.00. The contract included the following provision:</p>

After PennDOT and appellant had concluded their maintenance agreement, Hazelton informed appellant that no bond would be issued. PennDOT then cancelled its contract with appellant, awarded a contract to the next lowest bidder, and on October 10, 1978, brought an action against appellant for the difference between appellant’s bid and the next lowest bid.</p>

Mr. Sharkey then obtained an extension of time for filing an answer. At the hearing held on the petition to open, Mr. Sharkey stated that when the complaint was filed, the eight-attorney firm of which he was a member was in the process of splitting into several smaller firms and that rigorous negotiations on the parent firm’s dissolution were continuing.
