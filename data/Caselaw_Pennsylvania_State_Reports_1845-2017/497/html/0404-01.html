In no. 984, on March 15, 1978, Jerald Sklar was convicted of murder of the first degree by a jury sitting in the Court of Common Pleas of the First Judicial District and now appeals from the judgment of sentence of life imprisonment for the murder of Edward Rauer. On April 8, 1978, Jerald Sklar <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>was convicted, in no. 987, of murder of the first degree by a jury sitting in the Court of Common Pleas of the First Judicial District and now appeals from the judgment of sentence of life imprisonment for the murder of Abraham Fishman. Post trial motions were denied in both cases. These appeals followed.</p>

Because the issues raised are identical in each case and are controlled by the same operative facts, our discussion of the issues here is dispositive of those issues in both appeals. The four issues raised are: (1) his statements to police should be suppressed because both the prosecution and the confessions were the fruits of a violation of federal immunity; (2) the lower court improperly denied Sklar’s motion to suppress because he was questioned for an unreasonable time, rendering his confessions involuntary; (3) his statements to police should have been suppressed because he did not voluntarily waive his right to remain silent; (4) his statements to police should have been suppressed because police obtained the statements by deceit. After a thorough review of the record, we find these allegations without merit and affirm.</p>

He had been killed by a blast from a shotgun at close range. For approximately four years, this murder went unsolved.</p>

Seiko was the beneficiary of a life insurance policy which Seiko and Rauer had on each other as partners in a taxicab business, and Seiko indicated to Sklar that it would be beneficial to him if Rauer were dead. Accordingly, Sklar contacted one James Brown and arranged for Brown to kill Rauer in exchange for $1,500.00. Seiko agreed to the price. Sklar also told Brown where he might find Rauer’s cab late at night and suggested that <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>Brown make it look like a robbery. Within two weeks of the formation of the murder agreement, Rauer was killed. Afterwards, Brown told Sklar that he “did the job” and made it look like a robbery. He got away by running to the house of a girlfriend or his mother, Sklar was not sure which. Sklar contacted Brown several times to reassure him that he would be paid, and ultimately Sklar received money from Seiko, hundred dollar bills wrapped in foil, and paid Brown. Seiko paid Sklar $400.00 and, as Sklar put it, his relationship with Seiko was “solidified.”</p>

Fishman died from these wounds in January of 1974, and for more than three years police were unable to find the persons responsible for his death.</p>
    <p id="b475-6" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[168,1309,1149,791]]]'>Sklar told police that Abraham Fishman was murdered by the same contract killer, James Brown, whom Sklar hired previously at Seiko’s request, to kill Seiko’s business partner, Edward Rauer. Later, Seiko asked Sklar to hire Brown to kill Fishman because Fishman was pressuring Seiko to repay a loan for at least $7,000 which Fishman had made to Seiko at exorbitant rates. In response to Seiko’s request, Sklar contacted Brown and showed him where the killing might be done. After Fishman had been shot, Brown told Sklar that he had shot Fishman in the back with a shotgun and that he had killed Fishman’s dog, but he had not had time to rifle Fishman’s pockets for money because Fishman was still conscious and the sound of the shots had attracted attention. When Fishman was discovered, he had $5156.00 in cash on his person.</p>

His plan, as he testified at trial, was to furnish bogus information to the United States Attorney with the expectation that the government would set him up in a small business in the West and would not discover that the information was false until Sklar was already established. In response to Sklar’s overtures, J. Clayton Undercoffler, III, United States Attorney, wrote to Sklar’s attorney, Daniel M. Preminger, as follows:</p>

While Philadelphia police questioned Sklar about this matter, in which he denied complicity and which was not pursued beyond the initial questioning, Sklar volunteered that he had information concerning the death of a Dr. Paul Fried, and asked to speak with homicide detectives. Sklar also announced that he had immunity from the federal government, but would not say what the immunity concerned. Sklar was not a suspect in any other crime. He was questioned by several police officers, all of whom gave him <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to questioning, and he ultimately furnished police with statements concerning the death of Dr. Fried, and the unsolved homicides, of Edward Rauer and Abraham Fish-man. Sklar was not arrested or detained during the questioning, and he volunteered these statements, as he testified at trial, in order to prod the United States Attorney into acting on his prior request for inclusion in the federal witness protection program.</p>
    <p id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.5",478,[269,1711,1154,365]]]'>Sklar’s first claim is that trial counsel was ineffective in not arguing that Sklar’s statements to police should be suppressed because both the prosecution and the statements were the fruits of information obtained by a violation of the federal government’s immunity agreement. As a corollary matter, Sklar argues that the trial court erred in not granting a motion for arrest of judgment or a new trial.</p>

This letter informed the district attorney for the first time that Sklar had voluntarily provided information concerning two homicides in which “Edie Rauer” and “A1 Fischer” were named as victims.

Sklar was arrested in the early morning hours of October 18, 1976 on a stolen auto charge. Shortly after he arrived at police headquarters, while being questioned with respect to that charge, Sklar volunteered that he had information concerning the death of Dr. Fried and requested that he be allowed to speak with a homicide detective. Accordingly, he was transported to the homicide division, where he was questioned at various times during the 18th through the 21st of October, 1976.</p>

After this set of warnings, Sklar gave information concerning Fried’s death. About 1:30 p. m.

Prior to questioning him about the burglary, police attempted to give Sklar another set of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, but Sklar declined, saying that they had done that before. When this statement was completed, Sklar then told police that he would tell them about “a couple other murders.” Prior to taking yet another statement concerning these “other murders,” police again gave Sklar <em>Miranda </em>warnings. At approximately 5:00 p. m., a statement concerning the Rauer murder was taken; at 7:20 p. m., after more <em>Miranda </em>warnings, a statement was taken concerning the Fishman murder. After this statement, Sklar was told that he was free to go. The next morning, Sklar was still in the police station, having voluntarily slept there because he had nowhere else to go, and he once again talked with police and once again received <em>Miranda </em>warnings.

      <em>Miranda </em>warnings were intended to insure that persons in the custody of police are not compelled to testify against themselves in violation of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Miranda v.

It was Sklar himself who perpetrated the deception that reduced his immunity to a nullity. A person who lies in the hopes of achieving immunity from prosecution perpetrates the fraud at his peril, and should not be shielded by his own deception when he claims that he did not listen to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings when they were given because he believed that his fraud had been successful. The United States Supreme Court has mandated that a specific form of warning be provided persons in police custody who are being questioned with respect to possible involvement in a criminal matter.

The record indicates that police did not immediately arrest Sklar because initially there was some doubt as to the status of his claimed immunity and later, after it was discovered that the immunity had been revoked, police determined that further investigation concerning Sklar’s statements was required before any arrest would be made. The record is not clear on whether Sklar was told prior to questioning about the homicides that he would not be arrested at that time, but there was police testimony that Sklar was never told that the district attorney’s office might choose not to proceed against him in order to get him to talk to police. It was well within the suppression court’s discretion to disbelieve Sklar’s self-serving claim that he was told that he would not be arrested. <em>Commonwealth v.
