Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder conviction. Appellant was also sentenced to a consecutive ten-to-twenty year prison term for the robbery conviction and a consecutive probationary term of twenty years for the burglary conviction.</p>
    <p id="b659-9" data-blocks='[["BL_659.9",659,[172,1350,1148,472]]]'>Appellant subsequently filed a direct appeal to this Court. All but one of the issues raised by appellant were without merit; however, this Court was unable to analyze appellant’s claim concerning the voluntariness of his confession because the suppression court had failed to make specific findings of fact as required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 323(i). We remanded for an evidentiary hearing so that the required findings of fact could be made. <em>Commonwealth v.

The court not only refused to allow appellant to challenge trial counsel’s effectiveness but also refused to conduct the new evidentiary hearing. Instead, the court made findings of fact based on the original suppression hearing. On appeal, we again remanded, directing the court to conduct a new suppression hearing and to allow appellant to challenge trial counsel’s effectiveness. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>Following the evidentiary hearing, the trial court again determined that appellant’s confession was voluntary. The court further decided that appellant had not been denied the effective assistance of trial counsel. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[263,551,1153,473]]]'>Appellant argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court erred in admitting his confession. Appellant claims that his confession was the product of an unlawful arrest as well as physical and psychological coercion, and therefore was involuntary. Further, appellant asserts that an unnecessary delay occurred between arrest and arraignment. Our review of the record compels our conclusion that appellant’s confession was involuntary and is entitled to a new trial. The facts, as found by the suppression court, are as follows.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[264,1041,1154,738]]]'>On March 7, 1969, Gaetano Piccirilli was shot and killed during an attempted robbery of his store in Philadelphia. The two black males involved fled immediately after the shooting. As a result of the police investigation, the authorities went to appellant’s home at approximately 8:00 p. m. on March 8, 1969. The officers informed appellant that they wanted to discuss the Piccirilli murder with him. Appellant, eighteen years old at the time, agreed to accompany the officers to the Police Administration Building. While en route, appellant was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. By the time appellant arrived at the Police Administration Building at 8:25 p. m., the officers assigned to interrogate appellant learned that Eugene Corbin had confessed to the Piccirilli slaying and, in doing so, implicated appellant.</p>
    <p id="b660-6" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[264,1796,1153,577]]]'>The initial interview of appellant lasted from 8:35 p. m. until 9:30 p. m. After being taken to the bathroom and given coffee, appellant was again interviewed from 9:35 p. m. to 10:50 p. m. During this period, appellant agreed to undergo a polygraph examination. He was first escorted to the bathroom and then subjected to a polygraph examination which lasted from 11:00 p. m. to 1:35 a. m. Following a short fifteen minute rest, appellant was again interviewed and examined by the polygraph examiner from 1:50 a. m. until 4:05 a. m. During the entire interrogation until this point, appellant had denied any involvement in the slaying.</p>

      <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>At 4:05 a. m., Corbin was brought into the room where appellant was being questioned. While being questioned by the officers, Corbin again orally confessed and implicated appellant. Corbin was then taken from the room at 4:15 a. m. Appellant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings which he waived. From 4:25 a. m. until 6:25 a. m., appellant dictated a full confession. Following a twenty-five minute rest, appellant read the confession into a tape recorder. Appellant’s mother was brought into the room while the confession was being taped. At 7:20 a. m., appellant was allowed to confer privately with his mother until 8:30 a. m. Appellant was arraigned shortly before noon, approximately eighteen hours following his arrest.</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.4",661,[179,1034,1147,574]]]'>The suppression court ruled that appellant neither requested the assistance of counsel nor indicated a desire to speak to any relatives who had been notified of his custody. Further, appellant did not request that the interviews be terminated, nor did he indicate a desire to remain silent. The court additionally held that the police made no threats or promises to induce appellant to confess, that no physical violence was used, and that the police at all times maintained a courteous and professional attitude toward appellant. Based on all of the above, the court found that appellant’s confession was voluntary.</p>

    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[274,613,1154,958]]]'>The Commonwealth’s evidence indicates that following the initial one hour interview at the Police Administration Building, appellant was moved to a room on the third floor of the building.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> That room, used by the Administrative Division of the Crime Lab during the day shift only, was completely deserted at night. Officers testified that the move was necessary to conduct the polygraph examination. According to their testimony, the regular polygraph room in the basement of the building was occupied by appellant’s co-defendant, Eugene Corbin. On cross-examination, however, it was discovered that Corbin’s examination was completed by 7:50 p. m., approximately forty minutes before appellant even arrived at the Police Administration Building. When asked why the portable polygraph machine could not have been brought to the regular homicide interrogation rooms, Officer James Melley testified, “it wouldn’t have been conducive, I don’t think.” [The laboratory was] “totally empty except for us.”</p>
    <p id="b662-6" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[276,1601,1153,367]]]'>Officer Melley also testified that a polygraph examination usually is completed in approximately twenty minutes. In this case, however, Melley testified that except for the periods when appellant was taken to the bathroom, the pressure cuff indicator, which is similar to the device used to record one’s blood pressure, was constantly attached to appellant’s arm.</p>

Appellant’s uncle, Leon Jackson, a Philadelphia police officer, was one of the first to appear, arriving at 8:30 p. m. He identified himself to the desk officer but was refused permission to speak with appellant. Appellant’s mother and aunt did not arrive at the Police Administration Building until shortly before 2:00 a. m., because one of the officers who had been sent to arrest appellant had remained at the house and refused to allow either woman to leave until that time. Upon their arrival, both identified themselves but neither was allowed to see appellant.
