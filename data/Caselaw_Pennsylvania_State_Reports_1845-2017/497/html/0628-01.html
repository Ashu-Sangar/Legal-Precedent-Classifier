Bornstein then initiated the present action by filing, a complaint in assumpsit, in which Bornstein alleged that it had “fully performed all the terms and conditions” of the contract. Macy and Springpenn answered the complaint by filing a petition for interpleader in which they noted that the contract had not been fully performed. They stated that, notwithstanding their demands, Bornstein has “refused to comply” with the requirement of Article XI that Bornstein “furnish satisfactory evidence that all of Contractor’s employees, subcontractors and suppliers of materials or equipment used in the work covered by this agreement have been paid in full,” and “execute and deliver to Owner a full and complete release of liens, signed by or on behalf of all persons who have had a part in supplying materials or equipment or performing any of the work covered by this agreement.” Macy and Springpenn further averred that claims inconsistent with those asserted by Bornstein had been made upon them by persons and firms who had “not been paid in full by Bornstein for the labor, materials or equipment which they furnished to the Project,” as well as by companies which had rendered services to Bornstein in connection with jobs “unrelated to the Project.” The trial court granted the petition for inter-pleader and added all known claimants as parties, directing them to file a complaint with the court if they wished to have their claims adjudicated.</p>

A panel of the Superior Court reversed on the theory that Bornstein had “substantially performed” the contract and thus was entitled to the withheld balance of the contract price. According to the Superior Court, Bornstein’s failure to satisfy Article XI of the contract (requiring proof of payment to all subcontractors as a prerequisite to Born-stein’s receipt of final payment) was an “immaterial” breach because the owners had no legal liability to the subcontractors for their unpaid claims. The court also rejected the trial court’s holding that the subcontractors had an interest in the fund both in equity and as third party beneficiaries of the construction contract. In the view of the Superior Court panel, the subcontractors were merely general creditors of Bornstein, whose claims were subordinate to the claims of Bornstein’s judgment creditor and assignee.</p>

The Superior Court reasoned that, once the project had been completed and no liens had been filed or could validly be filed against the project, see 49 P.S. § 1502 (1965) (liens must be filed within four months of completion of the work), the contractor’s promise to furnish the requisite release of liens and satisfactory evidence of payment to subcontractors was no longer material to the owner.</p>

To the contrary, an owner’s interest in developing and maintaining good relations with the subcontractors, as well as with others in the construction industry and in the community, may make the contractor’s compliance with the contractual obligation to pay subcontractors “material” to the owner at all times, even after construction has been completed.</p>

Article XI of the <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>agreement specifically provides that prior to final payment the contractor shall furnish the owner with not only a “full and complete release of liens,” but also “satisfactory evidence that all of Contractor’s employees, subcontractors and suppliers of materials or equipment . . . have been paid in full.” The remainder of the thirty-page contract is replete with provisions manifesting the owner’s concern with the selection, supervision and welfare of the subcontractors. The contract provides that the owner has the right to propose the names of subcontractors “for some of the principal parts of the work;” that “the employment of all subcontractors shall be subject to the approval of Owner;” that “for such parts of the work as under general construction practice are customarily sublet, Contractor shall, if so directed by Owner, sublet such parts of the work;” that “Contractor shall procure Owner’s written approval before entering into any contract for the purchase of major items of materials or before subletting any portion of the work;” and that “Contractor shall remove from the site of the work any employee not satisfactory to Owner.” Moreover, the contract provides that failure “to make prompt payment to subcontractors or for material or labor” is a “substantial violation” of the contract for which the owner may, after giving 15 days’ written notice, terminate the employment of the contractor, and for which the owner “shall have the right to retain out of any payment then due, or thereafter to become due to Contractor, an amount sufficient to pay such claim.” Articles VI, VII, XI and XII.</p>

Because Bornstein, as contractor, breached the contract by failing to provide assurance that the subcontractors had been fully paid, and because the final payment retained by the owner does not exceed the amount of the subcontractors’ claims against Bornstein, Bornstein has no right to any of the retainage.
