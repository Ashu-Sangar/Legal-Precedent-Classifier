    <p id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[144,1131,1149,689]]]'>The referee found, after several days of hearing including testimony by the claimant and the victim’s co-workers and supervisors, that the victim’s normal work, the special project known as “PMS4” and the treatise he was to deliver in California, <em>all </em>constituted stress and exertion arising from and relating to his course of employment. Dr. Kraft, the treating cardiologist, gave his unequivocal medical opinion that the victim’s heart attack was causally connected to the stress of his employment. These findings were amply supported by the record and amply support the referee’s conclusion that “there was a direct causal relationship between the unusual stress, strain and exertion of his employment and the fatal coronary attack....”.</p>

      <blockquote id="A1O" data-blocks='[["BL_187.6",187,[224,1717,1083,661]]]'>The terms “injury” and “personal injury” as used in this act, shall be construed to mean <em>an injury to an employe, </em>regardless of his previous physical condition, <em>arising in the course of his employment and related thereto, </em>and such disease or infection as naturally results from the injury or is aggravated, reactivated or accelerated by the injury: and wherever death is mentioned as a cause for compensation under this act, it shall mean only death resulting from <em>such injury and its resultant effects, </em>and occurring within three hundred weeks after the injury. The term <em>“injury arising in the course of his employment,” </em>as used in this article, shall not include an injury caused by an act of a third person intended to injure the employe because of reasons personal to him, and not directed against him as an employe or because of his employment; <em>but shall include </em>all other injuries sustained while the employe is actually engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of the employer, whether upon the employer’s premises or elsewhere....

Thus, for example, if the victim has a heart attack during the latter part of a several month leave of absence, location <em>might </em>be a very relevant indicator of whether the injury arose in the course of employment; conversely, where the victim has a heart attack in the subway on the way home after a particularly stressful day at work, the location would seem to be a <em>minimal </em>factor. In either case, the referee must determine whether the attack was causally connected to the work, i.e., whether the injury arose in the course of employment and was related thereto.</p>
