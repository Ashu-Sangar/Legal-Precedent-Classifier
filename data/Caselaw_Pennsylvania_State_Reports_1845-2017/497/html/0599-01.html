The sole issue in this case is whether the Commonwealth Court was in error in awarding counsel fees to the City.</p>
    <p id="b667-4" data-blocks='[["BL_667.4",667,[158,503,1149,631]]]'>This litigation began in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia at March Term, 1975, when the City of Philadelphia filed a complaint in assumpsit against Gould, a resident of New Jersey, alleging that Gould was obligated to pay a wage tax to the City because of his employment by the Department of the Navy, Naval Support Activities, at the United States Naval Base on League Island. The City served Gould pursuant to the Pennsylvania Long Arm Statute then in effect at 42 Pa.C.S. § 8301, <em>et seq., </em>and Gould challenged the court’s <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction under that statute. The challenge was made by way of preliminary objections filed on April 23, 1975.</p>

      <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>This dismissal notwithstanding, Gould’s appeal remained on the Commonwealth Court docket. The case was argued in April of 1979, roughly fifteen months after the United States Supreme Court dismissed the appeal in <em>Bullion, </em>and on June 1, 1979, the Commonwealth Court, after oral argument, entered an Order affirming the trial court’s dismissal of the preliminary objections. Additionally, the court awarded counsel fees to the City because it considered Gould’s tactics to be dilatory.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court observed that the facts of Gould’s case were identical with those in <em>Bullion, </em>and that the legality of service under the long arm statute was raised and disposed of there. Further, the court felt that since there had been no significant developments bearing on the application of the law to the issues raised in <em>Bullion, </em>which were the same as the issues raised by Gould, and since <em>Bullion </em>had been recently decided, Gould’s appeal was a dilatory tactic. We disagree.</p>

Under the plain meaning of this provision, Gould had a <em>right of appeal </em>from the adverse ruling below in <em>his case. </em>This right may not be abrogated simply because another, similar case has been decided by an <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>appellate court, particularly where this Court had never decided the issue on its merits.
