    <p id="b335-4" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[186,760,1145,744]]]'>A petition for review was filed in the Commonwealth Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief halting the implementation of Act 239.

It is contended that the constraints of this legislation deprived medically necessary care to the indigent. Preliminary objections were filed in the nature of a demurrer by the Department of Public Welfare, et al. (appellants herein).
