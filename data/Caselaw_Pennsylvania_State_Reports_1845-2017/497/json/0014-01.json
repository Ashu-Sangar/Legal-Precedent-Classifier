        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is an appeal, by allowance, from an order of the Superior Court, 262 Pa.Super. 268, 396 A.2d 748, affirming an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County which denied the petition of appellant Sandy Mitchell to withdraw his guilty plea. We conclude that the plea was entered to charges on which the defendant had already been adjudged not guilty, in violation of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy embodied in both the federal and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The order of the Superior Court, therefore, is reversed.\nOn March 20, 1976, Norristown police filed a written complaint charging appellant with simple assault, aggravated assault, terroristic threats, and recklessly endangering another person for the alleged beating of an acquaintance, Helen Gilbert. That day appellant was arrested. While in police custody, appellant allegedly threatened Gilbert in a telephone call made to Gilbert the following day. This alleged call formed the basis of a second complaint, filed on March 21, charging appellant with an additional count of terroristic threats.\nAt a consolidated preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth presented testimony of Gilbert and the police officer who had heard appellant make the allegedly threatening telephone call. Appellant was held for trial on all five charges. Informations on the charges followed.\nThe case was scheduled for trial on August 11, 1976, approximately five months after the filing of the complaints. Appellant did not appear, a bench warrant was issued, and appellant was apprehended.\nTwo months later, on October 14,1976, the case was called for trial. Acting upon the representation of appellant, counsel for appellant advised the court and the prosecuting attorney that alleged victim Gilbert had decided not to testify. After calls for the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses went unanswered, the court proceeded to find appellant not guilty.\nThereafter, the Commonwealth advised the court that Gilbert did wish to testify, and that she had not been present because the Commonwealth had assumed that the proceedings on October 14 would lead to a guilty plea. Three weeks after finding appellant not guilty, the court entered the following order:\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 4th day of November, 1976, the finding of not guilty on October 14, 1976, is hereby revoked.* Defendant is ordered to be relisted for trial.\nThe Court Administrator is ordered to relist these cases forthwith.\nBY THE COURT,\n/s/ Vincent A. Cirillo J.\n* The decision of October 14, 1976, was based upon a representation to the Court that the prosecutor did not intend to testify.\nOn November 2, 1976, eight months after the filing of the complaints, appellant pleaded guilty to all of the charges on which he had been found not guilty. The court placed appellant on probation for one year.\nShortly after the entry of the guilty plea, appellant was adjudged to be in violation of probation. The court then sentenced appellant to a term of imprisonment of eighteen months to five years.\nIn April of 1977, appellant commenced the present effort to obtain relief. After an evidentiary hearing, the court of common pleas denied relief on the ground that appellant had not been placed in jeopardy at the proceeding which led to the court\u2019s finding of not guilty. The Superior Court\u2019s affirmance was based upon similar reasoning.\nThe court\u2019s finding of not guilty constitutes a determination that, having no evidence to present when the matter was ready for disposition, the Commonwealth was unable to prove the charges against appellant. Because \u201c[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause forbids a second trial for the purpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding,\u201d Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 11, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), the court\u2019s finding of not guilty bars reprosecution.\nThat the court was misinformed regarding the victim\u2019s willingness to testify does not affect the finality of the court\u2019s finding of not guilty. \u201c \u2018[W]e necessarily accord absolute finality to a jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal \u2014 no matter how erroneous its decision ....\u2019\u201d Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430, 442, 101 S.Ct. 1852, 1860, 68 L.Ed.2d 270 (1981), quoting Burks v. United States, supra, 437 U.S. at 16, 98 S.Ct. at 2150. \u201cThe factfinder in a criminal case has traditionally been permitted to enter an unassailable but unreasonable verdict of \u2018not guilty.\u2019 \u201d Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 317 n.10, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788 n.10, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \u201c[Wjhen a defendant has been acquitted at trial he may not be retried on the same offense, even if the legal rulings underlying the acquittal were erroneous.\u201d Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54, 64, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 2179, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978). As Justice Rehnquist, speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court of the United States, has stated,\n\u201cthe law attaches particular significance to an acquittal. To permit a second trial after an acquittal, however mistaken the acquittal may have been, would present an unacceptably high risk that the Government, with its vastly superior resources, might wear down the defendant so that \u2018even though innocent, he may be found guilty.\u2019 \u201d\nUnited States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 91, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2194, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978), quoting Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 188, 78 S.Ct. 221, 223, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957). See, e.g., Borough of West Chester v. Lal, 493 Pa. 387, 391, 426 A.2d 603, 605 (1981) (corollary prohibition against Commonwealth appeals applicable even where acquittal based on \u201c \u2018egregiously erroneous foundation\u2019 \u201d). See generally J. Strazzella, Commonwealth Appeals and Double Jeopardy, 4 Pa.L.J. Nos. 39 & 40 (10/19/81 & 10/26/81).\nThe Commonwealth alleges that, at the time the court found appellant not guilty, appellant had not waived his right to a jury trial. Thus, the Commonwealth argues, the court was conducting a pre-trial hearing at which jeopardy had not attached.\nContrary to the Commonwealth's factual allegation, all that can be said on this record is that appellant did not execute the written waiver of his right to a jury trial contemplated by Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1101. There is nothing in our Rules or our case law even to suggest that the absence of a written waiver of the right to a jury trial works to divest a court of jurisdiction to adjudge the merits.\nIndeed, the Commonwealth\u2019s effort to ignore the significance of the finding of not guilty on the basis of the absence of a written waiver is utterly unpersuasive. Under Pa.R. Crim.Proc. 1100(a)(2), the Commonwealth was obliged to have commenced trial within 180 days of the filing of the complaints \u201c \u2018by a substantive, rather than a pro forma, event.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Kluska, 484 Pa. 508, 510, 399 A.2d 681, 682 (1979), quoting Commonwealth v. Lamonna, 473 Pa. 248, 260, 373 A.2d 1355, 1361 (1977) (Eagen, C.J., joined by Roberts, J., concurring). A mere preliminary calendar call would not have been sufficient to mark the commencement of trial. Commonwealth v. Lamonna, supra.\nAs of the date of the entry of a finding of not guilty, a \u201csubstantive event\u201d was essential. As of that date, 208 days had already elapsed since the filing of the first complaint against appellant, and 207 days had elapsed since the filing of the second. Although the periods of delay arguably were excludable because of appellant\u2019s previous failure to appear when the matter was first scheduled for trial, see Pa.R.Crim. Proc. 1100(d)(1); Commonwealth v. Cohen, 481 Pa. 349, 392 A.2d 1327 (1978), surely when the matter was called for trial a second time the court would not have permitted further delay. Thus, the absence of a written waiver demonstrates only that the court chose to dispense with the formality of a written waiver in reaching the merits and finding appellant not guilty. Whatever the propriety of the court\u2019s finding of not guilty, reprosecution is barred by \u201cthe most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence.\u201d United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 1354, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977).\nOrder of the Superior Court reversed, order of October 14, 1976, adjudging appellant not guilty reinstated, and appellant discharged.\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion.",

        "text": "NIX, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent.\nAs stated by the majority, appellant was acquitted of the instant charges on October 14, 1976. On November 4, 1976 the court entered an order revoking the October 14th finding of \u201cnot guilty\u201d and directing that the cause be listed again for trial. No double jeopardy claim was asserted in response to the November 4th order. On November 22nd appellant entered a plea of guilt to all of these charges. No double jeopardy objection was asserted. After the acceptance of the plea and an extensive hearing, a sentence of one year probation was imposed. Again, a double jeopardy complaint was not claimed. It was not until after the probation sentence had been violated and appellant resentenced to a term of imprisonment of 18 months to 5 years did appellant first contend the protections of double jeopardy had been ignored.\nThe majority fails to recognize the procedural posture in which appellant asserted his petition to withdraw the guilty plea. Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 321, a petition to withdraw a guilty plea following imposition of sentence must be filed within 10 days of sentencing. In the instant case, however, appellant\u2019s sentencing occurred prior to the September 21, 1977 effective date of that rule.\nUnder our case law in such circumstances, the timeliness of a petition to withdraw a guilty plea is determined by a \u201cdue diligence\u201d standard. Commonwealth v. Rosmon, 477 Pa. 540, 543 n.1, 384 A.2d 1221, 1223 n. 1 (1978); Commonwealth v. Bunch, 466 Pa. 22, 28 n. 6, 351 A.2d 284, 286 n. 6 (1976) . As the Superior Court correctly noted in the instant case, the Commonwealth did not assert appellant failed to exercise due diligence.\nThe second procedural requirement imposed upon appellant in his quest for relief is that when a petition to withdraw a guilty plea is filed subsequent to imposition of sentence, relief will be granted only where \u201cnecessary to correct a manifest injustice.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rosmon, supra, 477 Pa. at 543 n. 1, 384 A.2d at 1223 n. 1; Commonwealth v. Starr, 450 Pa. 485, 301 A.2d 592 (1973). Involuntariness of a guilty plea would clearly qualify as a situation in which the granting of relief would be necessary to correct a \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rosmon, supra.\nAppellant asserts that his guilty plea was involuntary because he was not appraised of his potential double jeopardy defense by either the judge at the guilty plea colloquy or his attorney prior to pleading guilty and thus any waiver of this defense was not \u201cknowingly, voluntarily or intelligently made.\u201d Commonwealth v. Sutton, 474 Pa. 582, 379 A.2d 107 (1977); Commonwealth v. Roundtree, 440 Pa. 199, 269 A.2d 709 (1970).\nHowever, there are two fatal flaws in appellant\u2019s contention that his plea was involuntary. First, this Court has never required a judge to specifically include in a guilty plea colloquy the statement that by pleading guilty a defendant waives his right to the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy or that a defendant has a right not to be placed twice in jeopardy. See generally Commonwealth v. Ingram, 455 Pa. 198, 316 A.2d 77 (1974).\nSecondly, it is well established that a plea of guilty constitutes a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects and defenses, Commonwealth v. Montgomery, 485 Pa. 110, 401 A.2d 318 (1979); Commonwealth v. Rice, 456 Pa. 90, 318 A.2d 705 (1974); Commonwealth v. Allen, 443 Pa. 447, 277 A.2d 818 (1971) and thus, by pleading guilty, appellant necessarily waived any objections based on double jeopardy. Our cases also require that the court, before accepting the plea must inform the defendant of the extent of this waiver in an on-the-record colloquy. There is no complaint that the instant colloquy was deficient in this respect. Thus, having been advised that the entry of the plea was a waiver of all defects, appellant cannot be heard to complain that his attention was not directed to a specific possible objection.\nAppellant, however, in addition to filing a petition to withdraw his guilty plea, filed a PCHA petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellant asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to inform him of a potential double jeopardy defense. Once again, both the facts and law belie this argument.\nThis Court has consistently applied a two-step analysis in determining claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, we must determine whether the issue underlying the charge of ineffectiveness is of arguable merit. If the underlying issue is found to be of arguable merit, the inquiry shifts to a determination of whether the course chosen by counsel has some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interest. Commonwealth v. Burton, 491 Pa. 13, 417 A.2d 611 (1980); Commonwealth v. Sherard, 483 Pa. 183, 394 A.2d 971 (1978); Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687 (1977); see also, Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967).\nAppellant contends that counsel was ineffective for not raising the issue of double jeopardy prior to the guilty plea proceeding. In order for this issue to be of arguable merit, appellant must have, in fact, been placed in jeopardy at the time the court entered its first order of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d In a case tried before a jury, jeopardy does not attach until the jury has been impanelled and sworn; and in a non-jury case, jeopardy does not attach until the accused has been subjected to a charge and the court has begun to hear evidence. United States v. Pecora, 484 F.2d 1289 (3d Cir. 1973); Commonwealth v. Smith, 232 Pa.Super.Ct. 546, 334 A.2d 741 (1975); Commonwealth v. Culpepper, 221 Pa.Super.Ct. 472, 293 A.2d 122 (1972). When the instant case was called for trial on October 14, 1976, Judge Cirillo asked the Commonwealth to call its witnesses. When no witnesses were present and thus no evidence presented or testimony heard, Judge Cirillo found appellant \u201cnot guilty.\u201d Clearly jeopardy had not attached, the issue of double jeopardy was not of arguable merit and, therefore, counsel was not ineffective.\nMoreover, assuming arguendo that the double jeopardy claim was of arguable merit, it. is clear that counsel for appellant had a reasonable basis for not raising this issue and this decision was designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests. Appellant\u2019s counsel testified at the PCHA hearing concerning the basis upon which he decided not to raise the double jeopardy issue.\nOne of the things we did discuss was whether or not the finding of Judge Cirillo was in fact, a not guilty finding so as to bring up the question of double jeopardy. I indicated to him that my research of the law led me to the conclusion that since there was never actually a trial, there was never a jury impaneled, we never signed a waiver of a jury trial, and there was not in fact a trial, and although the words spoken might have been \u2018not guilty\u2019 in my opinion this did not constitute a finding of not guilty. And I felt that if we brought this defense up at the time of the trial, there would be no possibility of a plea bargain, and that the case would then go on to trial, and I felt that he would then have to face the consequences. Mr. Mitchell felt, since he had no record and didn\u2019t want to take any chances of going to jail, that he would just plead guilty.\nN.T./PCHA, July 20, 1977, pp. 26-27.\nAs this Court has repeatedly stated:\nOur inquiry ceases and counsel\u2019s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interest. The test is not whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record. Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that trial counsel\u2019s decisions had any reasonable basis.

Burton, 491 Pa. 13, 19 n. 7, 417 A.2d 611, 614 n. 7 (1980).\nAppellant\u2019s claim must therefore fail because counsel was not ineffective in not raising the double jeopardy issue and, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, counsel did discuss the merits of this potential defense. In my judgment, the order of the Superior Court should be affirmed.",
