Appellant argues he is entitled to a new' trial because of the admission of certain \u201chearsay\u201d testimony and statements of the prosecutor during his closing argument. We have thoroughly reviewed the briefs and the record and find appellant\u2019s arguments are without merit. Therefore, judgment of sentence is affirmed.\nAffirmed.",
