        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia which dismissed the petition of appellant Russell Wright for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, \u00a7 1 et seq. Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s numerous allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the record supports the determination of the PCHA court that appellant failed to prove his entitlement to relief. Hence, we affirm.\nI\nAppellant was arrested in May of 1970 on charges of assault with intent to ravish and murder of the first degree in connection with the death of Lorraine Miles, a thirteen-year old. The victim died in March of 1970 as a result of a fall from the outside ledge of the living room window of her family\u2019s fourth-story apartment to the street below. Based on interviews with children living at the Miles residence, police determined that, just before her fall, the victim had been trying to avoid the advances of appellant, who had been living at the apartment.\nAppellant\u2019s trial counsel, John J. King, Esq., was appointed in the early part of July, 1970. Following a preliminary hearing, conducted on July 22, 1970, appellant was held for trial.\nSeveral continuances followed. In April of 1971, appellant filed a pro se \u201cApplication for Dismissal of Indictments\u201d alleging that his right to a speedy trial had been violated. Appointed counsel filed a brief in support of the application and argued the matter on appellant\u2019s behalf. The court denied relief and, after additional continuances, trial was set for July, 1971.\nOn July 14, 1971, at a hearing held before the commencement of jury selection, appellant asked the trial court to appoint new counsel on the ground that his existing counsel was unfamiliar with the case. Counsel then described his preparation for the case and counsel advised the court that, although he had asked appellant \u201ca number of times\u201d to supply him with a list of witnesses, appellant had failed to cooperate. After hearing counsel\u2019s version, and reviewing the history of the case, the court denied appellant\u2019s request and asked appellant to submit a list of witnesses who he believed would aid his defense. Appellant complied with the court\u2019s request. After appellant\u2019s list of witnesses had been read into the record, the court stated, \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s subpoena them.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s case against appellant was based largely upon the testimony of three of the children who had been living at the Miles residence. The children testified that, shortly before the victim\u2019s death, in an early hour of the morning, appellant had entered the apartment and reprimanded the children for not being asleep. He then ordered the victim to disrobe and to get into his bed, and slapped the victim after she refused to do so. The children further testified that, fearing for the victim\u2019s safety, they had fled the apartment building through a rear exit and sought to contact the police. The children stated that, upon returning to the building, they had observed appellant making a swinging motion toward the victim just before the victim fell. The Commonwealth also presented the testimony of Mrs. Fannings, a neighbor of the Miles family. Mrs. Fannings testified that, a few days before the victim\u2019s death, the victim had come to her residence because appellant had attempted to \u201cmess with [her].\u201d\nAppellant testified in his own defense, denying both that he had assaulted the victim and that he had caused the victim to fall. Additionally, appellant presented the testimony of several persons who detailed acts of violence which allegedly had been committed by the children who testified for the Commonwealth. Three of the persons named in appellant\u2019s list of witnesses, a Miss Cotter, an R. Neal, and a Mrs. Knox, did not testify.\nThe jury found appellant guilty as charged. Following the denial of post-verdict motions, the court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment for the murder and a suspended sentence for the assault.\nAlthough a notice of appeal to this Court was filed by appellant\u2019s trial counsel, the appeal was pursued by newly-appointed counsel. The brief filed by new counsel challenged the admissibility of portions of the testimony of the children, as well as the testimony of Mrs. Fannings relating to the victim\u2019s late-night visit a few days before her death. This Court affirmed the judgment of sentence, holding that appellant\u2019s challenges to the testimony of the children had not been properly preserved at trial, and that the testimony of Mrs. Fannings had been properly admitted for the limited purpose of proving that the victim had placed herself on the window ledge out of fear of appellant. 455 Pa. 480, 317 A.2d 271 (1974).\nII\nAppellant commenced the present PCHA proceeding by filing a pro se petition for relief. The court of common pleas appointed counsel unassociated with either of appellant\u2019s two previous counsel.\nIn an amended petition, new counsel alleged on appellant\u2019s behalf that trial counsel was ineffective in (1) failing to object to testimony of the medical examiner regarding the \u201cpossibility\u201d that the victim\u2019s vagina had been penetrated, (2) failing properly to object to testimony relating to previous sexual misconduct of appellant, (3) failing to seek a continuance despite counsel\u2019s alleged lack of preparation, and (4) failing to present witnesses who allegedly would have provided exculpatory testimony. In its answer, the Commonwealth contended that the first two allegations had been \u201cfinally litigated or waived\u201d within the meaning of section 4 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act. The Commonwealth denied the third allegation as \u201coutside the knowledge of respondent.\u201d It also denied the fourth allegation and demanded proof to substantiate the claim.\nAt the hearing on appellant\u2019s petition, held in February of 1979, appellant confined his evidence to the third and fourth allegations of ineffective assistance. Appellant testified that trial counsel had not spoken with him about his case until the day before trial. Appellant further claimed that, once he had had an opportunity to speak with trial counsel, he had advised counsel that he wanted \u201ccertain witnesses\u201d to be called. However, according to appellant, \u201cthe witness that I had wanted [trial counsel] to bring, he never brought.\u201d On cross-examination, appellant revealed that \u201cthe witness\u201d was Mrs. Knox, one of the persons who had been included on the list of witnesses prepared by appellant before trial and submitted to the court. Appellant claimed that Mrs. Knox would have testified that she had been raped by two of the children who testified for the Commonwealth. On further cross-examination, appellant admitted that he had not told trial counsel why he wanted Mrs. Knox to be called as a witness, but claimed that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a chance to tell [trial counsel] hardly anything.\u201d\nThe testimony of appellant\u2019s trial counsel, on behalf of the Commonwealth, was in harmony with the representations which trial counsel had made to the court shortly before trial, when appellant had sought new trial counsel. Counsel maintained that appellant had failed to comply with counsel\u2019s request for a written account of the episode and a list of witnesses. Counsel stated that, despite appellant\u2019s failure to cooperate, he had independently sought to \u201cbuild a foundation of the case\u201d from the notes of testimony of the preliminary hearing and available Commonwealth evidence. According to counsel, once appellant had provided a list of witnesses, he interviewed all persons available. Counsel added that he had afforded appellant every opportunity to participate in all aspects of the defense and, as in the case of appellant\u2019s pro se motion for dismissal of the charges, had pursued his client\u2019s wishes as fully as possible.\nIn the opinion in support of its order denying relief, the PCHA court concluded that all of appellant\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance had been either finally litigated or waived because of appellant\u2019s failure to raise the claims on his direct appeal. The court also credited trial counsel\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Thus, the PCHA court concluded that, even if not finally litigated or waived, appellant\u2019s challenges to trial counsel\u2019s preparation for trial were without merit. This appeal followed.\nIll\nSection 3(d) of the Post Conviction Hearing Act states that a person seeking post-conviction relief is to prove \u201c[t]hat the error resulting in his conviction and sentence has not been .. . waived.\u201d The Act further provides:\n\u201c[A]n issue is waived if:\n(1) The petitioner knowingly and understanding^ failed to raise it and it could have been raised ... on appeal . . . and\n(2) The petitioner is unable to prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise the issue.\u201d\n\u00a7 4(b). Failure to raise an issue gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the failure is \u201cknowing and understanding.\u201d \u00a7 4(c). In Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 331 A.2d 435 (1975), this Court unanimously held that a PCHA petitioner seeking to challenge the effectiveness of trial counsel for the first time in PCHA proceedings must either prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances justifying his failure to raise the claim on direct appeal, \u00a7 4(b)(2), or rebut the presumption that his failure to raise the claim on direct appeal was knowing and understanding, \u00a7 4(c). 460 Pa. at 99-101, 331 A.2d at 437-38.\nWe agree with the PCHA court that appellant\u2019s challenges to trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Commonwealth evidence relating to the possibility of penetration and to appellant\u2019s previous sexual misconduct must be deemed waived for purposes of the Act. In its answer to appellant\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief, the Commonwealth specifically contended that these two claims of ineffectiveness had been waived. Nonetheless, appellant failed to offer either any evidence of the existence of extraordinary circumstances justifying his failure to raise the claims at the earliest opportunity, or any evidence that would rebut the presumption that his failure to raise the claims previously was knowing and understanding. These claims of ineffectiveness, therefore, must fail.\nAppellant\u2019s contentions relating to trial counsel\u2019s preparation stand on somewhat different footing. Like his other contentions which the PCHA court properly deemed waived for purposes of the Act, these contentions were cognizable on appellant\u2019s direct appeal. However, unlike his other contentions, these contentions were directly challenged by the Commonwealth on their merits, both by answer and by evidence, without regard to the issue of whether the contentions had been waived. Based on the Commonwealth\u2019s responses to appellant\u2019s claims, it must be concluded that there was no dispute at the PCHA proceedings on the issue of whether appellant had waived his contentions relating to trial counsel\u2019s preparation for trial. Accordingly, we shall review only the PCHA court\u2019s determination that appellant failed to substantiate his claims that counsel was not properly prepared.\nAppellant premises his contention that counsel should have sought a continuance largely on his assertion that counsel failed to ask him anything about the case until the day before trial. Counsel, however, specifically testified to the contrary and attributed any delay in his receipt of appellant\u2019s version and list of witnesses to appellant\u2019s lack of cooperation. Counsel added that, while awaiting appellant\u2019s information, he had followed his practice of investigating all aspects of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. These assertions of counsel at the PCHA hearing were identical to the representations which counsel had made shortly before trial, when appellant sought the appointment of new counsel. As to his claim that trial counsel had failed to produce the testimony of witnesses favorable to the defense, it was only on cross-examination at the PCHA hearing that appellant revealed the name of the one person whom, in appellant\u2019s view, counsel should have presented at trial. However, the trial record indicates that efforts were indeed made to subpoena appellant\u2019s \u201ckey witness.\u201d Although trial counsel did not remember a discussion with appellant\u2019s witness, trial counsel testified that he had spoken to all available witnesses, and that he would have presented the testimony of any witness who would have benefited appellant\u2019s case.\nWe are satisfied that the PCHA court had ample basis upon which to credit the testimony of trial counsel over the testimony of appellant. Because the PCHA court acted well within its province as fact-finder, the determination of the PCHA court may not be disturbed. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Clayton, 496 Pa. 492, 437 A.2d 1147 (1981); Commonwealth v. Lutz, 492 Pa. 500, 424 A.2d 1302 (1981).\nOrder affirmed.\n. Appellant was also charged with burglary. The trial court sustained a demurrer to this charge.\n. Also appointed was Oscar Spivack, Esq. Spivack represented appellant along with King at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing, but withdrew his representation before trial.\n. PCHA counsel filed a supplemental petition alleging that two Commonwealth witnesses had recanted their testimony. Following the entry of the order of the PCHA court denying relief, this allegation was withdrawn by appellant\u2019s present counsel (appointed for purposes of this appeal).\n. We decline to excuse appellant\u2019s failure to present appropriate evidence solely on the basis of his unsubstantiated allegation that PCHA counsel was ineffective. This allegation, raised for the first time on this appeal, is sharply disputed by the Commonwealth, and must first be resolved in a proper evidentiary forum.\nAppellant also alleges the ineffectiveness of all previous counsel in several other respects. These allegations have not been considered by the PCHA court, and our disposition in no respect encompasses these allegations. See Commonwealth v. Rashed, 496 Pa. 26, 34 n.5, 436 A.2d 134, 138 n.5 (1981); Commonwealth v. Green, 494 Pa. 406, 408 n.1, 431 A.2d 918, 919-20 n.1 (1981).\n. We note that the record does not support the PCHA court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s claims of ineffectiveness were \u201cfinally litigated.\u201d Neither the trial court nor this Court ruled on the merits of the ineffectiveness claims. See Post Conviction Hearing Act, \u00a7 4(a); Commonwealth v. Hare, 486 Pa. 123, 404 A.2d 388 (1979).",
