        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Rockwell International Corporation is the prime contractor for the B-l bomber project. Appellant Crosby M. Kelly was Vice-President of Communications for Rockwell. They appeal from an order of the Superior Court which reversed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County dismissing a complaint in libel filed by appellee, the Thomas Merton Center. Appellee is a nonprofit Pennsylvania corporation, some of whose members actively campaigned against the United States government\u2019s proposed development of the B-l bomber.\nThe trial court granted relief to appellants on the ground that the challenged publication was not defamatory as a matter of law. In reversing, the Superior Court held that the article was capable of carrying a defamatory meaning. Because we agree with the trial court that the statements attributed to appellant are not defamatory as a matter of law, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.\nAppellee\u2019s complaint alleges that a newspaper article published by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on December 12, 1976, \u201cintended to convey, and did convey to the community at large, the impression that members of the Thomas Merton Center . . . were Communist sympathizers, associated with Communists or were in fact Communists and . . . was calculated to, and did, hold [Merton] up to public scorn, hatred, [and] ridicule.\u201d Appellants denied these allegations and were granted judgment on the pleadings.\nThe challenged publication follows in its entirety:\nB1 FOES LINKED TO SOVIET FUNDS\nBy the Associated Press\nA top official of Rockwell International, prime contractor for the B1 bomber, says he\u2019s convinced the Soviet Union is secretly funding opponents of the controversial weapons project.\n\u201cOh absolutely, oh sure,\u201d responded Crosby M. Kelly, vice president of communications, when asked during a lengthy interview if the Soviets were providing funds.\nSpeaking from his office on the 54th floor of Rockwell headquarters in Pittsburgh last Thursday, Kelly said the firm at one time began a study to establish the degree to which the Soviets are funding the anti-bomber campaign.\n\u201cWe called it off \u2014 and I want to propose that we pick it up again,\u201d he said.\nKelly offered no specific documentation for Soviet activity in the B1 controversy, but he said the Institute for the Study of Conflict in London supports his thesis in general.\nYesterday, when Kelly learned of The Associated Press\u2019 imminent story, he called from California to disclaim that he was speaking as a company official.\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty dramatic stuff. I have no documentation to establish proof of one dime of their funding,\u201d he said.\nBut Kelly did not deny that he believes Soviets are involved financially. \u201cSure, undoubtedly they are. I say that, but not from any position of authority.\u201d\nJamie Lewontin, coordinator of the Clergy and Laity Concerned, a New York-based group Kelly said was leading opposition to the project, called Kelly\u2019s position \u201claughable.\u201d\n\u201cI am convinced we\u2019re getting no funds from the Soviet Union,\u201d Lewontin said, adding that the organization received an average of $15 from individuals through a mail order appeal.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any (Soviet funding), it certainly isn\u2019t an appreciable amount,\u201d he added.\n\u201cI can\u2019t understand why he would say that unless it\u2019s to discredit us,\u201d responded Stella Smetanka, assistant director of the Thomas Merton Center here, another group which Kelly singled out.\nKelly, who calls himself an amateur student of Soviet affairs, said during the interview last week that the anti-Bl bomber efforts are being led by the Clergy and Laity Concerned and the American Friends Service Committee.\nTo sustain its complaint in libel, appellee must establish that the challenged publication is defamatory. Act of August 21, 1953, P.L. 1291, \u00a7 1, formerly 12 P.S. \u00a7 1584(a), now 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8343(a)(1). Under Pennsylvania law,\n\u201c \u2018[a] communication is defamatory if it tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.\u2019 \u201d\nBirl v. Philadelphia Electric Co., 402 Pa. 297, 303, 167 A.2d 472, 475 (1960), quoting Restatement of Torts \u00a7 559 (1938). Accord, Baird v. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., 446 Pa. 266, 285 A.2d 166 (1971); Corabi v. Curtis Publishing Co., 441 Pa. 432, 273 A.2d 899 (1971); Cosgrove Studio & Camera Shop, Inc. v. Pane, 408 Pa. 314, 182 A.2d 751 (1962); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 559 (1977). It is the function of the court to determine whether the challenged publication is capable of a defamatory meaning. If the court determines that the challenged publication is not capable of a defamatory meaning, there is no basis for the matter to proceed to trial. Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, \u00a7 614(1). Accord, Corabi, supra; Volomino v. Messenger Publishing Co., 410 Pa. 611, 189 A.2d 873 (1963); Cosgrove, supra.\nIn this case, the entire controversy centers on the interpretation of the accusation in the first paragraph of the article that the Soviet Union was \u201csecretly funding\u201d opponents of the B-l bomber. Joining this statement with the penultimate paragraph of the article, where Kelly is quoted as identifying the Thomas Merton Center as one of the groups opposed to the B-l bomber project, appellee reads the entire article to charge that the Thomas Merton Center was an agent of the Soviet government.\nIf these two paragraphs of the article constituted the entire story published by the Post-Gazette, the innuendo urged by appellee might be reasonable. However, \u201c[wjords which standing alone may reasonably be understood as defamatory may be so explained or qualified by their context as to make such an interpretation unreasonable.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, \u00a7 563 Comment d. Thus, we must consider the full context of the article to determine \u201cthe effect the article is fairly calculated to produce, the impression it would naturally engender, in the minds of the average persons among whom it is intended to circulate.\u201d Corabi, supra, 441 Pa. at 447, 273 A.2d at 901, quoting Boyer v. Pitt Publishing Co., 324 Pa. 154, 157, 188 A. 203, 204 (1936).\nHere, Kelly\u2019s allegations focus on the purported actions of the Soviet Union and not those of appellee. For example, Kelly responded \u201c[o]h, absolutely, oh sure\u201d when he was asked if \u201cthe Soviets were providing funds\u201d to opponents of the B-l bomber. Kelly, who described himself as \u201can amateur student of Soviet affairs\u201d also stated that Rockwell had once conducted a study to investigate \u201cthe degree to which the Soviets are funding the anti-bomber campaign.\u201d Futher, while Kelly admitted he could provide \u201cno specific documentation for Soviet activity\u201d he \u201cdid not deny that he believes Soviets are involved financially.\u201d The Thomas Merton Center is not even mentioned until the next to last paragraph in the article.\nMoreover, absent here is any statement by appellant Kelly that either alleges or can reasonably be read to allege that the Thomas Merton Center had knowledge of the purported funding. Indeed, even the coordinator of the organization singled out by Kelly as \u201cleading opposition to the project\u201d understood Kelly\u2019s remarks to mean that his group was merely the unwitting recipient of Soviet funds: \u201c \u2018I am convinced we\u2019re getting no funds from the Soviet Union... . If there\u2019s any (Soviet funding), it certainly isn\u2019t an appreciable amount.\u2019 \u201d\nAlthough it is true that a publication is defamatory if it ascribes to another \u201cconduct, character or a condition that would adversely affect his fitness for the proper conduct of his lawful business, trade or profession\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, \u00a7 573 (1977), the Thomas Merton Center is not clothed with any special status which would make the suggestion of unknowing receipt of funds harmful to its reputation. Our case law makes clear that Kelly\u2019s failure to charge or imply appellee\u2019s knowing participation in the purported Soviet funding is fatal to appellee\u2019s effort to establish that Kelly\u2019s statements are actionable. Thus, here this Court has held a letter actionable where the letter stated that the plaintiff had consciously participated in various communist organizations and had attended school at the Young Communist League. Matson v. Margiotti, 371 Pa. 188, 88 A.2d 892 (1952). See also Wolston v. Reader's Digest Ass\u2019n, 443 U.S. 157, 99 S.Ct. 2701, 61 L.Ed.2d 450 (1979) (plaintiff labeled \u201cSoviet Agent\u201d). On the other hand, in Clark v. Allen, 415 Pa. 484, 204 A.2d 42 (1964), the statement that a United States Senator\u2019s voting record reflected \u201ccommunist tendencies\u201d was held not to be libelous as a matter of law. The statement in Clark, read in the worst possible light, simply implied that Clark had unsuspectingly aided communism through his Senate votes.\nSo too, here, the challenged publication can at most be read to mean that the Thomas Merton Center was the unknowing recipient of Soviet funds. This article can not be rendered libelous \u201cby an innuendo which puts an unfair and forced construction on the interpretation of the publication.\u201d Sarkees v. Warner-West Corp., 349 Pa. 365, 369, 37 A.2d 544, 546 (1944). An innuendo must be warranted, justified and supported by the publication. Bogash v. Elkins, 405 Pa. 437, 176 A.2d 677 (1962). Because it is unreasonable to infer from the entire article that appellee was actively and knowingly aiding the Soviet Union, the statements attributed to appellant Kelly are not defamatory as a matter of law.\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed and judgment in favor of appellants is reinstated.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.",
