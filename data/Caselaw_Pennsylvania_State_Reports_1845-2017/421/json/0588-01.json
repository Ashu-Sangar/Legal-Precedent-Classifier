        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno,\nDavid L. Smith, the-petitioner in this case, seeking release on a writ of habeas corpus, is a lucky man. He shot a man in the face with a shotgun standing only 13 or 14 feet away and the sentencing judge before whom he pleaded guilty generally, sentenced him to the maximum penalty for the crime of voluntary manslaughter when he could, with the established facts and in full conscience, have found him guilty of murder in the second degree and imposed the sentence inherent to that crime.\nSmith alleges in his petition that his constitutional rights were violated in that he had no counsel at his preliminary hearing; that he was \u201ccoerced\u201d into signing a statement admitting homicide; and that when represented by counsel, the latter was incompetent. None of these averments has merit. The court below in denying the petition said: \u201cThis petition is the third filed by Smith concerning the same conviction. The allegations of this petition are the same as those in the other petitions, 6207385. A hearing was held on the first petition, which was denied. The order denying the second petition was accompanied by an opinion. This petition is denied for the reasons set forth in that opinion.\u201d\nAs to the petitioner\u2019s claim of constitutional invasion in not having counsel at his preliminary hearing on July 3, 1961, the record shows that when, nearly four months later, he pleaded guilty in open court, with a lawyer standing at his side, he acknowledged that everything he had stated to the police officers was the truth, that he had not been coerced, and he unbosomed himself as follows: \u201cSo, I said, U am not scared to tell the truth.\u2019 So he asked me a question and that is how the statement came about. They treated me real nice. I was not made to give it. I had the chance to read it, correct it to the best of my ability and I did this before I signed it. I did it. I was not advised \u2014 I was not told to do this or told to do that. I was only advised against it if I was lying, that they would find out, to just tell the truth. So I kept on telling the truth.\u201d\nWhatever Smith may have said at the preliminary hearing did not become a necessary or even relevant ingredient to the proof of his guilt. \u201cIt must further be observed that the relator pleaded guilty in open court and the circumstances of his extra-judicial confession need not concern us.\u201d Com. ex rel. Robinson v. Rundle, 409 Pa. 462.\nThe petitioner then claims that he really had no effective lawyer\u2019s assistance at his trial because his lawyer failed to call several witnesses to testify in his behalf. The record reveals that the testimony referred to would have had no material bearing on the case.\nHe also complains that his counsel, on the day of his hearing when he pleaded guilty, also represented the victim\u2019s brother in another courtroom. No further elaboration is made. This assertion standing by itself does not support a charge of conflict of loyalty. On the contrary, a reading of the record, particularly his counsel\u2019s plea for leniency, shows that the petitioner indeed had competent and effective representation.\nThe petitioner\u2019s entire argument for release is no more persuasive or convincing than was his statement at the trial that he really did not intend to kill his victim because he did not \u201cdeliberately aim\u201d his shotgun at him; he only fired it in his \u201cdirection.\u201d He was quite fortunate that the sentencing judge, out of compassion and mercy, aimed only generally in sentencing the petitioner, David L. Smith. Had the law hit a bull\u2019s eye, Mr. Smith would have to languish in prison for at least that period of time which customarily accompanies a sentence for second degree murder, instead of voluntary manslaughter.\nAffirmed.",
