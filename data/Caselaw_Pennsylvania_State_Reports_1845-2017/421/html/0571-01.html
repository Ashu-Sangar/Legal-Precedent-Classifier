Payillard.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> .. On February 17, 1965, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree. Defendant moved for a new trial which was denied by the lower Court, and the Court imposed a judgment of sentence of not less than five nor more than ten years, plus a fine. From this judgment of sentence defendant appeals to this Court alleging certain errors in the charge of the lower Court.</p>

Mrs. Hanft later observing the defendant parked by the side of the road, asked him whether he needed medical help for his companion. Defendant replied that he had a very sick woman and that medical help was certainly needed. Mrs. Hanft led the defendant to the office of Doctor Neilson Matthews and the woman, later identified as Doris, was carried into the doctor’s house. Doctor Matthews testified that when he examined Doris she was already dead, and told defendant that there was nothing he could do for her. Doctor Matthews testified that while waiting for the police to arrive, defendant told him that Doris had either been playing with or han<a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>dling the gnn and that it went off.

Defendant later stated to the police that Doris shot herself in the back of the neck and that the gun went off, but that he didn’t know what had happened. In a subsequent statement, which he made to the police, which was transcribed but not signed, he changed the version somewhat and stated that as he was driving he saw Doris raise the gun, he thought in his direction, and as he reached for it a struggle ensued and she shot herself. This statement was later introduced at the trial by the District Attorney.</p>
    <p id="b613-4" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[189,1218,1150,422]]]'>At his murder trial, defendant took the stand in his own defense and <em>testified </em>that parts of his previous statements to the police were not accurate, and, more particularly, he denied that he had grabbed the gun and denied that he had any knowledge of the shooting until he first heard the shot. Finally, the defendant produced evidence that on at least three prior occasions Doris had unsuccessfully attempted suicide.</p>

All these elements must concur and the absence of any one of them will involve in guilt. Even though the homicide is unintentional, it is not excusable where it is the result or incident of an unlawful act, such as pointing or presenting a gun, pistol or other firearm at another person in such a manner as to constitute an offense under the laws of the state, or unlawfully striking another with an intent to hurt, although not with an intent to kill, or driving an automobile at an unlawful rate of speed’: 30 C.

On the contrary, defendant’s testimony as to Doris’s death, if believed, would establish that Doris committed suicide. The Commonwealth’s evidence, if believed, shows either murder or suicide. Therefore, the issue of homicide by misadventure was not injected into this case at the trial by either the Commonwealth or the defendant. That being so, the failure to charge upon the subject was not error. Furthermore, to pile Pelion upon Ossa, defendant took no exception to the charge and did not request the Court to charge on a killing by misadventure.</p>

In <em>Frazier </em>I, defendant was tried on an indictment of murder and convicted of voluntary manslaughter even though the evidence showed murder and did not show manslaughter. As a result of trial error judgment was reversed and a new trial was awarded. Having been acquitted of murder, Frazier was indicted for manslaughter. At trial he demurred to the evidence, saying that the facts did not make out the crime of manslaughter. This Court, in <em>Frazier </em>II, reversed the grant of the demurrer by the lower court and held that one may be indicted for manslaughter and convicted of voluntary manslaughter even though the evidence shows murder and does not show manslaughter. Consequently, one may be convicted of voluntary manslaughter on evidence of murder only, on either an indictment for manslaughter or for murder. Since only the indictment differs the one crime must be included within the other.</p>

One of defendant’s statements to the police, introduced to impeach him, recounted that defendant saw the victim raise the gun, that he grabbed at it, and that the shooting occurred during <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>the struggle for the weapon.

This is particularly true since we have said: “[A] trial judge is not required to charge the jury on manslaughter where there is nothing in the testimony to reduce the grade of the crime below murder . . . <em>it is only in very clear cases, where there is no room for doubt, that this can properly be done </em>[citing cases].” (Emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth v.
