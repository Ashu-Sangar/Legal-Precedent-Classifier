    <p id="b663-8" data-blocks='[["BL_663.12",663,[202,1000,1149,197]]]'>In my view, the variance granted by the court below was grounded on a misapprehension of law and should be set aside and the case remanded for consideration under the correct standard.</p>
    <p id="b663-9" data-blocks='[["BL_663.13",663,[202,1217,1150,478]]]'>The record discloses that William J. Vogt and Helen M. Vogt, his wife, purchased the premises known as 558 Montgomery Avenue, Haverford, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania by deed dated January 29, 1959. At that time the building was not in conformity with the prevailing “R-4” zoning under which only “single-family detached dwellings” were permitted, having been converted into a three unit apartment house by a prior owner.</p>
    <p id="b663-10" data-blocks='[["BL_663.14",663,[201,1708,1152,643]]]'>On January 28, 1963, the Vogts were notified by the township to terminate the multi-family occupancy of the building. Thereupon, the Vogts applied to the zoning board of adjustment of the township for a variance to permit continued use of the premises as an apartment house. The board, relying on the decision in <em>Sheedy v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/409/0655-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="409 Pa. 655" data-case-ids="1883245" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0655-01">409 Pa. 655</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.2d%20907" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="187 A.2d 907">187 A. 2d 907</a> (1963), granted the variance whereupon H. Durston Saylor, his wife, and the Haverford Civic Association, the protestants in the proceedings, appealed the board’s order to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County.</p>

      <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>The court, relying on the record made in the proceedings before the board, concluded that <em>Sheedy </em>was not controlling and remanded the case for further testimony and a supplemental decision “upon the issue of whether or not the property is reasonably sale-able for single family dwelling purposes.” <em>Saylor v. Lower Merion Township, </em><a href="/citations/?q=83%20Montg.%20130" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="83 Montg. 130">83 Montg. Co. L.R. 130</a>, 136 (1963).</p>
    <p id="b664-4" data-blocks='[["BL_664.5",664,[185,839,1153,308]]]'>On remand, after hearing additional testimony, the board found that the Yogts had failed to establish that the property was not reasonably saleable as a single family dwelling and concluded in light of the opinion of the court of common pleas that the application for a variance should be refused.</p>
    <p id="b664-5" data-blocks='[["BL_664.6",664,[184,1166,1155,370]]]'>The Vogts then appealed and the ease came again before the court of common pleas which upon reconsideration concluded that the case was controlled by the decision in <em>Sheedy. </em>Consequently, the original decision of the zoning board of adjustment which granted the variance was reinstated. We granted appellants’ petition for certiorari under Rule <em>68y2.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b664-6" data-blocks='[["BL_664.7",664,[183,1548,1169,640]]]'>My examination of the record in the instant ease leads me to conclude that both the board and the court below failed to apply the correct standard in determining that the Vogts were entitled to a variance. Both appear to have treated the decisions in <em>Sheedy v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em>supra, and <em>Hasage v. Philadelphia Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/415/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="415 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1891903" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0031-01">415 Pa. 31</a>, 202. A. 2d 61 (1964), as establishing a separate category of variance law applicable to purchasers of nonconforming property. I do not agree; both <em>Sheedy </em>and <em>Has-sage </em>represent merely the application of traditional principles to specific factual configurations.</p>

See, e.g., <em>Ferry v. </em>Kownacki, <a href="/pa/396/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="396 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="1284853" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0283-01">396 Pa. 283</a>,<a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20456" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="152 A.2d 456">152 A. 2d 456</a> (1959); <em>Moyerman v.
