Both plaintiffs were registered nurses and were employed by defendants to serve as school nurses. On the date of employment of each plaintiff, neither had certification to act as a school nurse or to teach school. In the case of each plaintiff, a temporary professional employe’s contract to teach in the school district for a period of ten months was executed. Several months thereafter, the Department of Public Instruction issued to each plaintiff a State Standard Limited Certificate to act as a school nurse, which certificate was registered with the superintendent of defendant school <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>district. After more than three years of service the defendant board terminated the employment of each plaintiff effective at the close of the then current school year. At the time of termination, each plaintiff held a State Standard Limited Certificate to serve as a school nurse, but the district superintendent did not rate either plaintiff during the last four months of the first two years of employment, or thereafter, and he made no certification of any rating to the secretáry of the defendant board.</p>

The title of the amendatory act states, in relevant part, that it amends the Public School Code of 1949 by “. . . clarifying the term ‘professional employe,’” which term is defined in subsection (1). No mention is made of an intention to clarify the terms “substitute” and “temporary professional employe”, which are the subject matters of subsections (2) and (3) respectively. Section 554 of the Statutory Construction Act provides that the title of a law may be considered in its construction. Certainly, in this instance, the title of the amendatory act limits its scope and indicates that within its purview is to be included only subsection (1) of §1101 and not subsections (2) and (3).</p>

At the time of her employment, neither plaintiff was certified to serve as a school nurse. However, several months thereafter each plaintiff was issued by the Commonwealth a State Standard Limited Certificate, which authorized her “to act as a public school nurse in this Commonwealth for three years. . . .” While this certificate was still effective both plaintiffs received notice of dismissal. Certainly, at that time they were certified to act as school nurses, and had attained the status of professional employe as defined by the Code. More particularly, each was a temporary professional employe, as defined in §1101(3) and by their separate contracts of employment. As such, each plaintiff was protected by §1108 of the Code, which provides in relevant part: “(a) . . . . No temporary professional employe shall be dismissed unless rated unsatisfactory, and notification in writing, of such unsatisfactory rating shall have been furnished the employe within ten (10) days following the date of such rating. . . .” Other portions of §1108 provide <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>that each temporary professional employe shall be rated by the county or district superintendent at least twice yearly and that a temporary professional employe who has been certified as satisfactory during the last four months of the second year of service, shall become a full-fledged professional employe and be tendered forthwith a professional employe’s contract.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[218,787,1150,743]]]'>• It is on the basis of these latter portions of §1108 that the court below determined that neither plaintiff had attained the status of professional employe. The lower court, however, ignored the provision of §1108 prohibiting the dismissal of a temporary professional employe unless rated unsatisfactory. Neither plaintiff was ever rated unsatisfactory by the superintendent. In fact, the record reveals that the only rating received by either plaintiff was an excellent rating of 97.6 in the case of plaintiff Elias. Under the circumstances, we must conclude that the absence of ratings indicates satisfactory performance and that each plaintiff is entitled to a professional employe’s contract under §1108 of the School Code.</p>

Farrell School District Board of Directors, </em><a href="/pa/381/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="381 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1258924" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0561-01">381 Pa. 561</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20192" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="112 A.2d 192">112 A. 2d 192</a> (1955), wherein we held that a temporary professional employe cannot become a full-fledged professional employe until her work has been certified as satisfactory by the school superintendent, irrespective of the latter’s failure to rate her as required by §1108 of the School Code. However, the two cases are distinguishable because in <em>Maxioell </em>plaintiff prayed that the superintendent be commanded by the court to' rate her work satisfactory. Of course, that prayer went beyond the limits of mandamus because it is well-settled that in a mandamus proceeding the court cannot compel a public official to exercise his discretion in a manner which will produce a result which the court may deem <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>desirable. <em>Travis v. Teter, </em><a href="/pa/370/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="370 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="1234540" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0326-01">370 Pa. 326</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20177" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="87 A.2d 177">87 A. 2d 177</a> (1952). However, the rating requirement of §1108 of the Code must be enforced if we are to be fair to the temporary professional employe who aspires to the status of a regular professional employe. To hold otherwise would permit a school superintendent, by willful noncompliance with the statutory mandate of rating of and notice to the temporary professional employe, to effect the dismissal of such employe in blatant violation of the clear requirements of the School Code. Furthermore, it would seem sensible that an employe might conclude that her work was satisfactory if her superiors had expressed no dissatisfaction after two years of service. <em>Maxwell v. Farrell School District Board of Directors, </em>supra (dissenting opinion). Accordingly, we find that under §1108, the failure on the part of the superintendent to rate is tantamount to a satisfactory rating. By so holding, we do not limit the authority of a school board to dismiss a professional employe for incompetency or other cause set forth in the School Code. Proper procedures are therein established whereby the contract of an incompetent or otherwise undesirable professional employe may be terminated. Thus, even having acquired tenure, the professional employe is subject to a continuing rating system which is designed to improve the school system, adherence to which this Court actively encourages.
