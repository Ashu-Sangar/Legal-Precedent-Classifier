The complaint was filed by appellant against appellee oh Jánuary 15,' 1963,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> for damages resulting from the collision. On July 2, 1963, appellee filed an answer denying liability and further alleging as new matter that appellant was precluded from- bringing this action because she had previously received satisfaction of a verdict in a proceeding brought in Montgomery County by the same plaintiff against the personal representative of the deceased Frances Bischoff Nash. ■ Appellant filed a reply on July 29, 1963, contending that the verdict was .not. the result of .an adversary proceeding.-in Montgomery. County, but, rather, was an agreed verdict, and that satisfaction thereof did not absolve appellee. On July 30, 1963, appellee filed a motion, for judgment on the pleadings,- argument followed, ■ and briefs were submitted to the court. The. court below, in its opinion of -.

The new matter filed by appellee stated that appellant’s release of all claims made on December 28, 1962, thereby released not only the additional defendant but also appellee, the original defendant. The pertinent parts of the release read as follows: “I/we, being of lawful age, have released and discharged, and by this release do for myself/ourselves, my/our heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, release and discharge First Pennsylvania Banking &amp; Trust Co., Executor of the Estate of Frances Bischoff Nash, deceased <em>and any and all other persons and entities • (whether herein named or not) </em>of and from any and all claims,, damages, actions, causes of action, and suits of whatever kind, known or unknown, prior to and including the date hereof, and particularly for all injuries to person or damage to property resulting or to result, and especially the liability arising from an accident which occurred on or about the 16th day of June, 1959, at or near Lebanon, Pa.” (Emphasis ours)</p>

Appellant avers that on or about November 30, 1962, counsel for additional defendant forwarded a release to appellant’s counsel, which release specifically released and discharged “The First Pennsylvania Banking &amp; Trust Company, Executor of the Estate of Frances Bischoff Nash, Deceased, and Ethel C. Murks.” After receiving the release in <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>question, appellant’s counsel advised counsel for the additional defendant that the release was unacceptable in that it provided for a release of all claims against appellee, Ethel C. Marks. Counsel for the additional defendant then authorized appellant’s counsel to delete, by erasure, the name of Ethel C. Marks. On or about December 4, 1962, the appellant executed the release in question, after deleting, by erasure, the words “and Ethel C. Marks”. This release was then returned to the additional defendant’s counsel, and after receiving it, he advised appellant’s counsel that a new release of only the additional defendant would have to be re-executed, due to the erasure marks on the original release. He advised that such a release would apply only to the additional defendant, and to no other person. On or about December 28, 1962, appellant’s counsel forwarded the disputed release to counsel for the additional defendant, which at this time had been properly executed. Appellant contends that this release was intended to constitute a release of the additional defendant only, and no other person, and that the consideration for it was furnished solely by the additional defendant, and that appellee, Ethel C. Marks, did not, in any way, contribute, nor was she intended to benefit in any way from the release.</p>

In March, appellant filed an amended reply, averring that: “28. If the said release in its executed form did constitute a release of any other person or persons, such release was by mistake of both counsel and plaintiff and The First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, Executor of the Estate of Frances Bischoff Nash, Deceased.” The court below granted the motions of both Ethel C. Marks and the First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company for judgment on the pleadings. This appeal followed.</p>
