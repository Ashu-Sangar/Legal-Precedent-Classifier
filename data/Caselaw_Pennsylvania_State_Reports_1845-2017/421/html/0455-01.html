Wilson, sought to recover damages for personal injuries from the defendant-appellee, Penn Turnpike Shops, Inc., a corporation doing business under the fictitious name of Howard Johnson Restaurant. On January 13, 1960, appellant, a 51 years old truck driver employed by the Specter Freight Systems, Inc., was driving a heavily loaded diesel bound for Albany, New York, in an easterly direction, over the Pennsylvania Turnpike. There were two drivers on the truck, and appellant occupied the driver’s seat at Bedford, Pennsylvania, at 1:30 A.M. and drove until he reached the defendant’s turnpike restaurant at Bowmansville, Pennsylvania, at approximately 5:30 A.M., where he stopped to get a cup of coffee. During the night, the truck had been travelling through conditions described as raining and freezing, and the temperature hovered around the freezing mark. The road surface was wet but not frozen, and the bridge surfaces were icy. Appellant parked his truck in the parking <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>area outside the restaurant, which area was wet but not icy, and proceeded toward the entrance to appellee’s restaurant. Approximately 50 feet from the entrance, he stepped onto the concrete sidewalk where he took a couple of steps and slipped on a sheet of smooth, wet ice and catapulted into the air, landing on a picket fence which was near the walk. The extent of the injuries suffered was never disclosed at trial because the lower court granted appellee’s motion for compulsory nonsuit at the conclusion of the presentation of appellant’s evidence as to liability.</p>

So viewing the record, we find that appellant’s own testimony on direct examination indicated the road surface to be wet but not slippery, and that the icy condition was apparent only on defendant’s sidewalk. His own testimony further brought out that it was wet ice, and upon cross-examination, he testified as follows: “Q. So there was no obstruction in the form of a ridge or hill in the ice that caused you to fall? A. The ice was wet like ice. Q. No ridge — no hill in the ice- — is that correct? A. I did not see any hill in the ice. Q. And no ridge caused you to fall? A. I did not see any ridge. Q. Do you know what caused you to fall? A. The wet slippery ice.”</p>
    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[187,1387,1160,911]]]'>Appellant’s own testimony shows clearly that the cause of his fall was wet, slippery ice, devoid of any obstructions or ridges or elevations allowed to remain for an unreasonable length of time, and, as we set out very clearly in <em>Whitton v.

As such proof was wholly lacking in the instant situation, the lower court acted properly in entering a judgment of compulsory nonsuit. See <em>Puskarich v.

There was no evidence to show that proper signals were not given, and the positive testimony of witnesses produced by appellant showed that the car had a headlight; that it was not running at an excessive rate of speed, and that the decedent was not attempting to cross the street at the time of the accident. . . . Can this situation be cured by an amended statement <em>setting up an entirely different theory, charging a different kind of negligence </em>based upon different relations of the parties after the statute of limitations had become a bar? All of our cases hold that this cannot be done if a new cause of action be introduced by the amended statement.

      <em>cause of action, if any, was the negligent act or acts which occasioned the injury. </em>In the original statement the negligent acts relied on to sustain a recovery were recited in detail and with such circumstantiality, as to leave no doubt upon what ground a recovery was based. In the amended statement this ground is not merely shifted, it is entirely abandoned. It is not, therefore, a ease of adding to or amplifying the original statement within the rule recognized in some of our cases, but on the contrary a different theory is relied on, new grounds are set up and other acts of negligence entirely different are alleged. The relations and duties of the parties are entirely changed by the amended statement. In the original statement the standard of care was the duty owed by a street railway company to a person, not an intending passenger, at a street crossing. In the amended statement the relation of common carrier and passenger is set up, and the standard of care required in protecting an intending passenger while getting on the car is relied on. The two theories are entirely inconsistent and cannot be sustained on the ground that one is but an enlargement of the other/ . . . ‘There is no difficulty in defining the phrase “cause of action.” It obviously means what.this court in Martin v.
