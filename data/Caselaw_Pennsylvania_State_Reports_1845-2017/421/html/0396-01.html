Defendant was observed in the early morning of <em>Deeember </em>21, <em>1963, </em>by two police officers. Their attention was attracted to him because he was driving on the wrong side of the road. They were on a special mission at the time and did not stop. While returning from this mission, they saw defendant’s car parked on the berm of the road. When they pulled their .car alongside defendant’s car, they noticed two <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>persons sitting upright in the front seat of defendant’s auto. Both of defendant’s eyes were bulging out of his head and he was holding his handkerchief up to the right side of his face. The officers asked him if he was in need of medical assistance; he replied that he was all right, started his engine and drove off. The officers radioed the license number in order to identify the owner. When this information was received, they also discovered that police officer Frank Cummins was defendant’s brother. Officer Cummins was picked up and the three officers proceeded to the Briggs house, where Nancy Flowers lived and worked for Briggs as a cook and housekeeper.</p>

The lower Court found (1) that according to the weight of medical testimony at the time of the hearing (on the petition for habeas corpus), defendant was not feigning a loss of memory concerning the events and actions which took place on December 20th and 21st, 1963; (2) that only two of the five medical experts (three psychiatrists, a neurologist and a psychologist) expressed the opinion that defendant’s loss of memory would be permanent. The lower Court then held that under all the aforesaid facts defendant must stand trial because (a) he is admittedly sane and does not need or even seek hospital care, and (b) no legal authority or justification exists for postponing the trial or releasing a person charged with a crime who is sane bxit has no memory concerning the alleged criminal act, and (c) amnesia or circumscribed loss of memory is in the nature of an affirmative defense, comparable to that of insanity. For these reasons, the lower Court dismissed defendant’s petition. Although we do not agree with all of these reasons, the Order of the lower Court must be affirmed.</p>

Although the expressions differ, they all amount to the same thing. Cases abound with commonly used statements or testimony by a person accused of or convicted of murder that “I don’t remember anything”; “my mind went blank”; “I blacked out”; “I panicked and don’t remember what I did or anything that happened.” While the terminology of defendant’s state of mind and alleged lack of memory is different in this case from the expressions often used by persons accused of crime to prove their lack of memory, it has never hitherto been sustained by any Court, although similar language to prove lack of memory has, as above noted, been used for more than a century.</p>
