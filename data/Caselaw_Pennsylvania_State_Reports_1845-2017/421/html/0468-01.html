In 1951, the Mower property ánd the abutting public highway were incorporated into Monroeville Borough.

It concluded that the change of government from a township to a borough did not enlarge the scope of the public easement, nor diminish the abutting landowners’ rights, and for the new use or the taking the plaintiff was entitled to compensation under both the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions.</p>

It calls into focus the nature, wisdom and foundation of the pertinent law previously followed in this Commonwealth in determining if an additional servitude is imposed on an abutting landowner by the installation of facilities for the public benefit along a municipal public roadway.</p>
    <p id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.7",511,[211,2197,1149,208]],["BL_512.1",512,[188,390,1158,533]]]'>The heart of the difficulty in the problem presented lies in the common law and early Pennsylvania view concerning condemnation of land by municipalities. Thereunder, the condemnor did not acquire a fee simple <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>title in the land condemned in the absence of an express statutory provision that such was the case, but rather only the right to use and occupy the land for the purpose for which it was taken. Title to the subsurface remained in the condemnee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> There is no public record to show why or when the roadway involved was established. However, in 1915, Allegheny County took over the road and it is still under its jurisdiction. Hence the law of condemnation as it existed prior to the Acts of 1937 and 1949 (see footnote 1) applies.</p>
    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.5",512,[184,933,1158,476]]]'>Since under the early law, the taking of land by a municipality for public road purposes created only an easement in the public to travel thereover, the changes in the modes of travel and commerce created legal problems in connection with the question as to what constituted an additional servitude on the already established public easement. Our courts were first confronted with this dilemma in the latter part of the 19th Century.</p>
    <p id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.6",512,[178,1422,1158,481]]]'>In an effort to resolve the difficulty, distinct rules evolved. In <em>Sterling’s Appeal, </em>supra, this Court held that the laying of a pipeline under the surface of a public road in a township constituted the imposition of an additional servitude on the abutting land for which compensation must be paid. The Court specifically limited the ruling to roads located in townships, and refrained from indicating what its decision would be if the road were located in a city or borough.</p>
    <p id="b512-6" data-blocks='[["BL_512.7",512,[178,1911,1153,101]],["BL_513.1",513,[204,406,1151,862]]]'>A few years later in <em>MeDevitt v. Gas Co., </em>supra, this Court refused to allow damages to abutting land<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>owners where a gasline was laid underneath a city street. The Court emphasized that land located in a city is just as sacred as that in a rural area, but stated nonetheless that the location subjected it to a greater servitude without additional compensation. It is significant to note that the Court did not, as some later authorities indicate, examine the use contemplated for a city street when the land is first condemned, as opposed to that envisioned for the establishment of a rural public road. Rather the Court looked to what was, at the time of the decision, considered a reasonable use for a city street and found that sewers, gas and water lines, and other typical urban uses were not such as to require the payment of additional compensation. Unfortunately, an additional unsound argument of “damnum absqne injuria” was also included.</p>
    <p id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[201,1281,1152,1186]]]'>The distinct and different rules, governing the issue and recovery thus established, were preserved in <em>Duquesne Light Co. v. Duff, </em><a href="/pa/251/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="251 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1019632" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0607-01">251 Pa. 607</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.%2082" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="97 A. 82">97 A. 82</a> (1916). However, therein the Court fell into the error which has precluded the future development of public uses of roads in township areas. In <em>Duquesne, </em>supra, the Court reasoned that when land for rural roads is taken originally, the only use contemplated is public travel, and, therefore, any other use requires payment of additional compensation. Such reasoning leaves the situation with grave logical inconsistencies. <em>McDevitt v. Gas Co., </em>supra, ruled that city streets are not burdened by the addition of public utilities. In view of the reasoning in <em>Duquesne, </em>supra, the question naturally arises: What about city streets which were acquired and established while the area was still in a township. This is the specific problem in this case. Admittedly, if <em>Duquesne, </em>supra, is followed to a logical conclusion, then additional compensation is recoverable herein. However, as noted before, <em>Duquesne’s </em>conclusion was based on what we believe to be an incorrect premise.</p>

      <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>There is a textbook authority to the effect that in a case as here present, the test to be applied is the governmental character of the area when the pipeline is laid, not the character when the road was established. See, I Nichols, Eminent Domain, 476 (2d ed. 1917). The rationale is that the citizens consent to the additional servitude when they change the governmental nature of the area. See, <em>Palmer v. Larchmont Electric Co., </em><a href="/nys/39/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="6 A.D. 12" data-case-ids="3487164" data-case-paths="/nys/39/0522-01">6 App. Div. 12</a>, <a href="/nys/39/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="6 A.D. 12" data-case-ids="3487164" data-case-paths="/nys/39/0522-01">39 N.Y.

Also, a reading of all analogous Pennsylvania decisions clearly indicates that the political designation of the area involved when the use takes place is paramount in determining whether the act of the defendant imposes an additional servitude on the abutting land for which compensation is payable. For example, see, <em>Dempster v. United Traction Co., </em><a href="/pa/205/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="205 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="930005" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0070-01">205 Pa. 70</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20A.%20501" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="54 A. 501">54 A. 501</a> (1903).</p>

Being far removed from the scene, it is now impossible for us to make a correct assessment. However, it is clear that some of these decisions were based, at least in part, on the erroneous assumption that what was contemplated when rural roads were established was something different than when a city road was involved. On the contrary, when any public road is established, it is clearly for the purpose <em>of public travel and commerce. </em>When roads were established for public use generations ago, it is hard to believe that the multiple uses now made thereof were envisioned or considered.

Evolutionary changes must be considered in determining whether a burden is imposed on the servient tenement. See, Restatement, Property §479 (1944).</p>

The rural and suburban dweller has come to accept these conveniences as a way of life.
