In addition to a trust receipt security agreement, these loans were secured by DX or dealer titles which were <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>issued for each automobile financed. On each such title an encumbrance was noted in favor of Bank. One such automobile was sold by Dealer to a buyer (Buyer) who made a cash payment and executed a bailment lease security agreement obligating himself to pay the sum of $2,101.20 to Dealer in liquidation of the balance of the purchase price.</p>
    <p id="b651-3" data-blocks='[["BL_651.4",651,[174,780,1154,807]]]'>Dealer sold the bailment lease for $1775 to Associates Discount Corporation (Discounter), a company in the business of buying chattel paper from dealers. Discounter took possession of the bailment lease in the ordinary course of its business, paid Dealer for the lease by check, which check Dealer turned over to Bank with instructions to deliver the DX title covering the sold automobile to Discounter so that a new title could bo obtained. Bank refused to turn over the DX title to Discounter and instead used the DX title as a lever to induce Buyer to execute a second bailment lease in favor of Bank. Bank then required Buyer to make payments in liquidation of the second bailment lease to it rather than to Discounter under the bailment lease Discounter had purchased from Dealer.</p>
    <p id="b651-4" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[173,1601,1152,95]]]'>There is no evidence that any security agreements were ever filed or perfected.</p>
    <p id="b651-5" data-blocks='[["BL_651.6",651,[173,1709,1153,700]]]'>Bank urges upon us that the check for $1775 (which was drawn by Discounter and which was delivered by Dealer to Bank) was credited by Bank to other obligations owed by Dealer to Bank and therefore that it had a right to hold the title to secure the indebtedness of the Dealer due Bank arising out of the inventory-financed automobile. However, if the payments made by Buyer to Bank should have been made to Discounter and Bank has no claim to such payments, equity will declare Bank a constructive trustee of such funds to hold them for Discounter. <em>Dubin Paper Company v.

Equity will therefore deem Bank a constructive trustee for Discounter to the extent of the payments it received. Bank is such a constructive trustee regardless of whether or not it applied the proceeds of the chattel paper, namely, the check for $1775, to the specific security interest it had in the automobile or to the general account of Dealer, <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>or, indeed, regardless of whether or not it even obtained the said check.</p>
