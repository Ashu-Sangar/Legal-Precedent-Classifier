In requiring that the receipts there involved be allocated in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rule of Apportionment, we recognized that an element of harshness would be involved in the application of the statutory rules to those proceedings which would have been terminated but for judicial delay in the preparation of an adjudication. Thus, in <em>Brown Estate, </em>we held that where the state of the record on the date <em>Catherwood </em>was decided was such that no further action by the parties was anticipated, and all that was awaited was <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>adjudication by the court, the proceedings were not a pending audit within the meaning of <em>Catherwood.</em>

Such circumstances, in our view, place the proceedings within the range of the prospectivity ruling of <em>Catherwood. </em>Until and unless the record is complete and the matter ripe for adjudication, the audit is pending within the meaning of <em>Catherwood </em>and <em>Brown.</em>

Appellants predicate their res judicata contention on the application of the nonstatutory apportionment rule in prior adjudications of the trustees’ first and second partial accounts.

Their contention is predicated on the fact that the application of the rule was impliedly affirmed by this Court on a prior appeal. See <em>Arrott Estate, </em><a href="/pa/383/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="383 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1261930" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0228-01">383 Pa. 228</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.2d%20187" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="118 A.2d 187">118 A. 2d 187</a> (1955). In our view, that doctrine is presently in-apposite.</p>
      <p id="b322-6" data-blocks='[["BL_322.3",322,[186,1959,1158,444]]]'>That doctrine, in general terms, provides that when an appellate court has considered and decided a question submitted to it upon appeal, it will not, upon a subsequent appeal on another phase of <em>the same ease, </em>reverse its previous ruling even though convinced that it was erroneous. <em>Brown Estate, </em><a href="/pa/408/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="408 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1308392" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0214-01">408 Pa. 214</a>, 231, <a href="/citations/?q=183%20A.2d%20307" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="183 A.2d 307">183 A. 2d 307</a>, 315 (1962); <em>Reamer's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/331/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="331 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1184381" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0117-01">331 Pa. 117</a>, 122, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.%2035" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="200 A. 35">200 Atl. 35</a>, 37 (1938). The instant appeal, however, involving a distinct and separate fund from that involved in the prior appeal, and arising out of a subsequent accounting, is not the same case as that involves in the prior proceedings before this Court,</p>
