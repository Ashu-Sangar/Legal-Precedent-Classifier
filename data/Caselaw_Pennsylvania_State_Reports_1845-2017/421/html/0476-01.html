In Howlett Estate, supra [366 Pa.], the testator . . . created a trust with life estates to his children and then to a child’s issue, or, in default of issue, to surviving children and the issue of deceased children. During the term of the trust a son died leaving no natural born children but a daughter who had been adopted in 1897. Ruling that this adopted daughter of the deceased son was not entitled to take as ‘issue’, this Court stated (p. 297) : ‘ “Issue” is not synonymous with “children”. “Issue” means issue of the body, offspring, progeny, natural children, physically born or begotten by the person named as parent: [citing cases].’ ”</p>

The approach taken by the majority in construing the trust instrument which is the subject of the present dispute, in my view, <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>is an example of such adherence and of this Court’s failure to respond to the policy of equality which has otherwise marked the area of adoption and the rights of adopted children.</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[202,622,1158,1284]]]'>Whether an adoptee is comprehended by a given designation in a will or deed of trust turns on the “intention” of the testator or settlor. Absent an express direction in the instrument, however, a real intention is seldom discoverable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Yet, the majority, relying on such cryptic and unrevealing terms as “issue” and “children”, purports to find such an intention and a direction on the part of the settlor to exclude appellantadoptee from sharing in the instant trust estate. I disagree. In my view, there is no sound basis for concluding that the settlor, by employing those terms, intended to exclude adopted children from sharing in his bounty. It is far more likely, and more reasonable to assume, that the absence of an express direction with respect to the matter indicates that the settlor failed to advert to the possibility of adopted children, their inclusion or exclusion, and, accordingly, expressed no explicit direction one way or the other. Had he adverted to the question, and determined not to include adopted children as beneficiaries of the trust estate, it is reasonable to assume that he would not have restricted himself to the cryptic designations upon which the majority relies, but would have employed language which would have left no doubt as to his intent.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.6",522,[202,1926,1155,259]],["BL_523.1",523,[197,408,1150,423]]]'>Thus, in truth, we have no <em>real </em>expression of the settlor’s “intention” regarding the effect of adoption on the distribution of the trust income and' corpus and are confronted with the delicate task of filling “a casus omissi.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Traditionally, the result of this process has <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>largely represented “a union of judicially envisaged social desirability with conjecture as to what the conveyor probably would have intended had he thought about the matter.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> In the instant case, I am of the view that the relevant considerations dictate the conclusion that appellant was “intended” to be included and to benefit to the same extent as the settlor’s other great grandchildren.</p>
    <p id="b523-4" data-blocks='[["BL_523.6",523,[195,843,1152,1127]]]'>In speculating as to what the settlor would have intended had he considered the possibility of a subsequent adoption, the likelihood that he would have desired to benefit <em>all </em>those who stood in a close family relationship to the other objects of his bounty is no less than the likelihood that he would have ignored that relationship to discriminate in favor of his natural great grandchildren. The latter conclusion, the one adopted by the majority, places far more emphasis on the affinity of blood relationship over adoptive relationship than the universality of adoption and experience teaches us is justified. Thus, when the settlor made a gift to the “issue” of appellant’s adoptive father, I find no reason for concluding that he employed that general designation as an exclusionary term of art with reference to adoptive children. It would be equally plausible, as I consider the matter, to conclude that he employed the term as a general designation to embrace all those who stood in a parental-child relationship, whether formed by blood or the bonds of adoption, with appellant’s adoptive father.</p>

Thus, the sound approach, as I view the matter, would be to adopt a rule of construction which, <em>in the absence of a clear expression in the instrument of the settlor’s intention to the contrary, </em>would deem adoptees as embraced within such general designations as “issue” or “children”. Such an approach, while not limiting the right of settlors to freely dispose of their property as they see fit and to favor blood lines over adoptive relationships if they so elect, would resolve those cases in which no <em>explicit </em>intent is expressed in the most socially desirable manner.</p>
