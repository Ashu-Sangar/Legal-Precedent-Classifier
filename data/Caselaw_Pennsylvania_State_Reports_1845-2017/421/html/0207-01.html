Soon thereafter a dispute arose as to what, <em>if any, </em>interest Bertha W. Michael had in the real estate known as “King Farm.” The answer to this question turns on the construction of the language, above-quoted, contained in the deed of 1947. The court below held that the deed created a joint tenancy with right of survivorship between the two sets of husbands and wives.</p>

The lower court, predicating its decision on the use in the deed of the phrase “with right of survivorship”, held that there was a clear expression of an intended right of survivorship between the two couples. To further support its decision, the court found it significant that the phrase was not used twice in modification of each husband-wife-grantee designation, but rather was utilized after both couples had been named and had been designated severally as tenants by the entireties.</p>
