Not only does the record clearly manifest that these contentions are devoid of merit, but assignments of error of this nature should be raised by direct appeal and not in a collateral attack on the judgment through habeas corpus.

An examination of the record discloses that the statements in question were not mentioned during the Commonwealth’s case; that in the course of his own trial testimony, Jordan told of surrendering to the police shortly after the killing and voluntarily giving them a statement detailing the event; that on cross-examination, the district attorney attempted to question Jordan about the statements,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in an effort to show existing discrepancies therein with his trial testimony; that Jordan’s trial counsel did not question the voluntariness of the statements or object to their submission <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>to the jury, but did, in fact, urge the trial court to have the statements read in their entirety to the jury; that Jordan’s counsel offered to and did read one of the statements to the jury and the district attorney read the other. Under such circumstances, appellant’s belated complaint to the admission of this evidence at trial is valueless. See, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Blackshear v.
