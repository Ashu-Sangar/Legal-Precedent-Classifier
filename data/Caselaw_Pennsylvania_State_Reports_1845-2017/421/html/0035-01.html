In the case of after-acquired property, the execution, when docketed and indexed, shall become a lien upon such real property. In the case of real property which is then subject to the lien of the judgment, the execution, when docketed and indexed, shall continue such lien beyond the time it would otherwise have expired. Any lien obtained or continued solely as the result of the docketing and indexing of an execution shall continue only for a period of five years from the indexing of the execution.”</p>

      <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>beyond the fifth anniversary date of its entry. But, she contends that when the writ was stayed, the lien then lapsed in the absence of other revival process. In other words, that the lien of the judgment and the execution are one and the same. Our study of §7(a) of the Act of 1947 compels a different conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b79-3" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[214,722,1151,532]]]'>Prior to the Act of 1947, the general rule was that the lien of execution was not distinct from the lien of the judgment. See, <em>Cake’s Estate. Cake’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/186/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="186 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="989657" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0412-01">186 Pa. 412</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20A.%20568" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="40 A. 568">40 A. 568</a> (1898), and <em>Davis v.

However, the Act of 1947, supra, changed this rule and definitely drew a distinction between the lien of the judgment and the execution. Hence, even though the lien of the execution lapsed when the writ was stayed,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> it is our conclusion that this did not affect the lien of the judgment.</p>

For instance, it provides, inter alia, that “in the case of after-acquired property, the execution, when docketed and indexed, <em>shall become a lien upon such real </em>property.” (Emphasis supplied.) At common law, a preexisting judgment was not a lien on after-acquired real estate: <em>Gen. Pulaski B. &amp; L. </em>Ass. <em>v. P. Tr. Co., </em><a href="/pa/338/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="338 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1199935" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0198-01">338 Pa. 198</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.2d%20336" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="12 A.2d 336">12 A. 2d 336</a> (1940). But a lien could be created thereon by the issuance of a writ of execution and an accompanying levy. However, for the lien to attach, an actual seizure was mandatory: <em>Sherrard v. Johnston, </em><a href="/pa/193/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="193 Pa. 166" data-case-ids="910313" data-case-paths="/pa/193/0166-01">193 Pa. 166</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.%20252" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="44 A. 252">44 A. 252</a> (1899), and <em>Ross &amp; Co.’s and Elsbree’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/106/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="106 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="455710" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0082-01">106 Pa. 82</a> (1884). The Act of 1947 includes no such requirement. The lien now attaches immediately upon the issuance, docketing and indexing of the execution process. The execution and the lien are separate and dis<a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>tinct, even though the lien begins from the date the prescribed statutory process is filed.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[188,501,1157,257]]]'>In this connection, it should also be noted that the statute speaks of a “lien obtained or continued” and then in the same sentence proceeds to speak of “an execution”.
