However, in Pennsylvania, there is ah important difference in the rule of interpretation as applied to restrictive covenants on the use of land. It is this. Land use restrictions are not favored in the law, are strictly construed, and nothing will be deemed a violation of such a restriction that is not in plain disregard of its express words: <em>Jones v.

Also, as stated by Mr. Chief Justice Steen in the first cited case, at 272, in reference to land use restrictions: . . <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>[T]here are no implied rights arising from a restriction which the courts will recognize; that a restriction is not to be extended or enlarged by implication; that every restriction will be construed most strictly against the grantor and every doubt and ambiguity in its language resolved in favor of the owner.”</p>
    <p id="b585-4" data-blocks='[["BL_585.5",585,[190,729,1151,753]]]'>It is, therefore, established beyond argument that in order for A. &amp; P. to prevail, the restrictive covenant involved must by its expressed terms clearly indicate that the parties intended it to extend to and include after-acquired land. We cannot reach this conclusion. To rule that such is included would read into the covenant something that is just not there. It would enlarge and extend the restriction by implication which has been proscribed by decisions of this Court for many years. Further, even if we assume that an ambiguity exists, it has long been the law that the ambiguity in a restrictive covenant must be construed against the one to be benefited by the restriction. See, <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Kline, </em><a href="/pa/396/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="396 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1284924" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0397-01">396 Pa. 397</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20661" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="152 A.2d 661">152 A. 2d 661</a> (1959).</p>
    <p id="b585-5" data-blocks='[["BL_585.6",585,[191,1492,1149,632]]]'>In support of its position that the parties intended to include after-required lands within the restriction, A. <em>&amp; </em>P. emphasizes two parts of the covenant: the use of the words therein, “if, as and when the lessors develop the <em>adjoining </em>property for business purposes,” and, “no other supermarket . . . will be permitted to occupy space on the <em>adjacent </em>property owned by the Lessors <em>during the term of this lease or the renewals herein </em>granted.” (Our emphasis throughout.) It argues that this language lends itself to no other construction but that after-acquired lands were intended to be included.</p>
    <p id="b585-6" data-blocks='[["BL_585.7",585,[191,2146,1149,264]],["BL_586.1",586,[219,409,1158,373]]]'>As to the latter portion of the above recited language, A. &amp; P. argues that since the covenant could not possibly extend beyond the term of the lease, or its granted renewals, and the covenant specifically speaks of running during the term of the lease, or its granted <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>renewals, it must mean and deal with all lands owned and acquired during that period. This argument overlooks the fact that the parties could have stipulated a shorter period for the restriction to remain in force, and that a specific time limitation on the covenant was, therefore, necessary. We do not construe it to relate to, or to intend, what A. &amp; P. asserts.</p>
    <p id="b586-4" data-blocks='[["BL_586.5",586,[217,790,1157,806]]]'>Nor are we persuaded that the words “adjoining” or “adjacent” connote what A. &amp; P. urges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As noted before, at the time its lease was consummated, the Baileys owned land located on the southerly side of the highway, and separated thereby from that portion of the tract which included the land leased to A. &amp; P. This has since been developed, at least in part, for other business enterprises. It is reasonable to conclude that by the use of the words “adjoining” and “adjacent”, the parties intended to include this land within the restriction. At the very least, an ambiguity exists and, in such a situation, it must be resolved against A. &amp; P. See, <em>Kessler v. Lower Merion Township School District, </em><a href="/pa/346/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="346 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1216507" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0305-01">346 Pa. 305</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20A.2d%20117" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="30 A.2d 117">30 A. 2d 117</a> (1943), and <em>Witt v.

The lease agreement contained, inter alia, the covenant here in dispute which provided: “It is . . . understood and agreed between the Lessors and Lessee . . . that no other supermarket, grocery, meat or vegetable market will be permitted to occupy space on the adjacent property owned by the Lessors during the term of this lease or the renewals herein granted.”</p>

These cases are presently inapposite. The historical and logical bases for construing a restrictive covenant contained in a deed strictly against the grantor are not compelling in the construction of a covenant not to compete embodied in a lease agreement. In the latter context, the doctrines developed to preclude unreasonable restraint of trade function to protect against undesirable restrictions on land use by reason of such covenants.</p>

In a declaratory judgment, the court held that the covenant bound after-acquired property made part of the shopping center.

The release was conditionally obtained, but is presently inapplicable since the court below found that the conditions precedent to its effectiveness were not met.
