In this the court erred and its order dissolving the attachment may not be permitted to stand.</p>

At the time this amendment was added, a. tort was viewed as having been' committed at-the place where the. last act or injury occurred and the cause of action accrued: Cf. <em>Openbrier v.

There foreign attachment was sought to be employed to institute an action of trespass arising out of a motor vehicle accident in New Jersey. The trial court, granted' defendant’s motion, to strike, the- complaint and for. júdgmént of non pros. on. the ground that-foreign attachment did not lie for a tort committed outside of Pennsylvania.</p>

      <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>In affirming that action, this Court stated: “In view of the clear restriction of the writ of foreign attachment in actions ex delicto to <em>torts committed within the Commonwealth . . </em>. prior to the promulgation of Rule 1252, it was . . . not intended by this Court that Rule 1252 change or alter a rule of law ... so firmly established ....

Defendants, however, urge that the amendatory language, by adopting the phrase “acts committed” rather than “torts committed” outside the Commonwealth, was intended to restrict the scope of foreign attachment from that existing prior to Rule 1252. We do not agree. No more was intended by the amendment of Rule 1252 than to bring the provision into conformity with our decision in <em>Alpers v.

In affirming the dissolution of the attachment by the trial court, this Court made no reference to the amendatory language as restricting the scope of foreign attachment from that existing under prior statutory law. To the contrary, the Court stated: “[B]y subsequent amendment of Rule 1252 . . . jurisdiction to issue writs of foreign attachment in tort <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>cases is strictly limited to <em>torts committed within this Commonwealth.” </em>Id. at 366,<a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.2d%20522" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="194 A.2d 522">194 A. 2d at 526</a>.

L. 364, as amended, 15 P.S. §2852-1011B, and which places a defective instrumentality into the stream of commerce causing an injury in Pennsylvania, would be insulated from answering in our courts even though assets were available for attachment here. We reject such a construction. Since 1911,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> when the writ of foreign attachment was first authorized to issue in actions ex delicto involving foreign corporations, it has been the law of this Commonwealth that a foreign corporation with assets located in Pennsylvania not exempt from attachment may be compelled to appear and defend on the merits, or failing that, to make redress to the extent of those assets,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> for torts committed in Pennsylvania.
