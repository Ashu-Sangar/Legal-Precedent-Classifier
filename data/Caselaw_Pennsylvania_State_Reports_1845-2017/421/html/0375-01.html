    <p id="b416-10" data-blocks='[["BL_416.15",416,[196,1491,1159,793]]]'>Martin M. Clayton had been employed by National Electric Products Corporation (National Electric) in 1935. In May of that year, National Electric entered into a contract with The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (Equitable) for group coverage for its employees. This group coverage was of the type where both employer and employee contributed toward the payment of premiums. At its inception, this group coverage was for $8,000 and was subsequently increased to $15,000 on July 1, 1947. Mr. Clayton retired on February 1, 1949, having reached the age of 65, and, as the contract between National Electric and Equitable provided that retired employees could retain their group coverage, Mr. Clayton elected to do so.</p>

    <p id="b417-4" data-blocks='[["BL_417.5",417,[222,549,1149,702]]]'>Early in 1961, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers No. 1073 (I.B.E.W.), representing the employees of National Electric and H. K. Porter, requested H. X. Porter to make group insurance a part of its labor-management agreement. Prior to this time, group insurance had been outside the labor agreement. The union wanted a non-contributory group life insurance policy, that is, one on which IT. X. Porter paid the entire premium. Mr. Clayton, during his employment, had been a member of the I.B.E.W. and the union was particularly desirous that this non-contributory group life insurance be made available to retired employees.</p>
    <p id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.6",417,[220,1261,1150,417]]]'>Mr. Clayton received a letter dated May 17, 1961 (this letter had been sent to all retired employees) from TI. X. Porter informing him that an agreement had been reached between the union and the company, relative to group insurance for retired emplojmes, and that this agreement had been made part of the contract. The pertinent parts of the letter read as follows :</p>

    <p id="b419-6" data-blocks='[["BL_419.6",419,[213,951,1151,1350]]]'>Following the execution of the agreement with the union, II. K. Porter and Metropolitan entered into a new group insurance contract providing that effective June 1, 1981, retired employees would receive $5,000 non-contributory life insurance coverage. The material parts of the master policy stated: “Effective June 1, 1961, Group Policy No. 17303-G bearing date of June 1, 1961 and issued to H. K. Porter Company, Inc. is hereby endorsed to substitute for Section 4 of said Group Policy, the following: No employee shall contribute to the cost of the insurance hereunder .... Retired Employees— ... If an Employee is retired, . . . the amount of his Life Insurance shall be $5,000.00.” On June 16, 1961, Martin M. Clayton died, and Metropolitan tendered $5,000 in full payment to the beneficiaries under the $5,000 non-contributory policy executed on June 1st of that year. The beneficiaries accepted payment under the condition that accepting said payment would not prejudice any of their rights under the contributory policy, and, subsequently, filed a claim for the $15,000. The insurer refused to pay, alleging the contributory policy had been cancelled on June 1st, 1961, pursuant to written notice given on May 18, 1961, and that the contributory policy had been exchanged for the non-contributory one.</p>

We agree with the conclusions reached by the court below, and correctly stated: “The exhibits attached to the pleadings support the conclusion that Clayton, in writing, authorized the Union to bargain for him. His beneficiaries are therefore bound by what Clayton authorized it to do for him. Clayton, on May 22nd, 1961, in writing, agreed to accept. $5,000 insurance coverage ‘in full satisfaction of all claims.’ To us the meaning is clear and explicit. Perhaps the statement might have said of all claims under any other certificate of insurance. However, at that time, Clayton had no claim, and he had received previously written notice that the new policy was ‘in place of any company policy or policies you may now hold . . .’ He held only the $15,000 certificate. Under it he contributed. The new certificate' was non-contributory. Under the circumstances and the exhibits the only permissible conclusion is that Clayton accepted the $5,000 non-contributory policy in lieu of the policy to which he contributed a part of the premium.</p>

Whether or not a policy shall continue depends on their will. It is not within the power of the beneficiary to keep a group contract of insurance in force or to abrogate it. The insured employee or his beneficiary have no greater rights than are provided in the policy, certainly no vested right which would prevent cancellation by mutual agreement between the insurer and the employer, especially where reasonable notice of cancellation is given to the employee. A third party beneficiary in an ordinary contract is subject to the limitation of its terms as he has no greater rights under it than are provided in the contract itself: Restatement of the Law, Contracts, Sec. 140; Grim et al. v.

The employee refused to surrender his policy and continued to pay the employer the amount he had been paying under the policy, but the premiums were not forwarded to the insurance company. In affirming a judgment on a directed verdict for defendant, the court held that the employer was not the agent for the insurance company, and that the holders of the certificates issued thereunder had no vested right to <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>a continuation of such policy over the objection of the employer.”</p>

See 29A Am. Jur., Insurance, §1782, p. 856. We conclude appellants’ contentions that Mr. Clayton had neither authorized the union to release any interest in the original group policy, nor, himself, released any interest in the original group policy, to be without merit. Mr. Clayton had notice of what was going to happen on the 17th day of May and accepted this by his letter dated May 22nd. This was certainly sufficient notice of what was about to take place.</p>
