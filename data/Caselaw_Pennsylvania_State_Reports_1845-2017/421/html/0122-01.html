This is far from clear and definitive. Et al. may be an abbreviation of the Latin plural phrase “et alii” meaning “and others”, or of the Latin singular phrase “et alius” meaning “and another.” See, Black’s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951). Therefore, it cannot be asserted with any degree of reasonable certainty that the return shows service on one individual other than March and the corporation, or several, or who the other or others were.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Such a return of service cannot be sustained.
