Cox and Shuchman, availing themselves of the electoral machinery provided by law for such purpose, received a plurality of the votes cast by members of their own party, in their respective districts, for the party offices of party committeemen to represent such party electors in the party organization and, specifically, in the Executive Committee; the Executive Committee removed them and refused to accord recognition to them as the chosen representatives of the majority of the party electorate in their districts. In the posture in which this controversy now reaches us, Cox and Shuchman were removed not for anything which they had done as committeemen or in their representative capacity but by reason of that which it is alleged they <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>had done prior to their election and selection.

Today, however, the relationship between political parties, the government and the public has become such that, in many areas, the public interest is not only <em>directly </em>affected by political parties but such parties actually pérform <em>public </em>functions-imposed upon them by law. Insofar as’ a political party performs statutorily-imposed public functions and to the extent that its actions constitute state action, the internal organization of such political party is a matter of such concern to the public as to make it subject to constitutional limitations and judicial restraint. When the internal organization of a political party directly affects its performance of such public function then not only <em>may </em>the judiciary intervene but it <em>must </em>intervene.</p>

Judicial interference, even <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>with the internal organization of a political party, is justifiable if such internal organization may directly affect the performance of a public function and the public interest.

Moreover, mindful that the legislature has provided that there shall be a certification of what party officers are to be elected at a primary election by the chairman, that party electors are expressly given the right to select their representatives on the political committee at an election paid for out of the public treasury and conducted under official government auspices and that only such party committeemen shall be deemed elected who shall have received a plurality of the votes cast in a district by party electors, then, if after all this legislatively provided procedure, the Executive Committee of the ward is to have the right, under the guise of “control, direction and supervision” of the party committeemen, to nullify and ignore, without legal cause, the results of such election and selection of party committeemen, we reach a result patently absurd and unreasonable. A review of the legislation governing the manner of election of party committeemen clearly refutes such reading of the words “control, direction and supervision” and makes evident that the aim of this legislation was identical with that which the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>People ex rel. Coffey v.

By way of illustration: if a vacancy happens after a primary election in any party nomination, by reason of the death or withdrawal of the candidate, the committee of the party organization fills such vacancy by a substituted nomination (Election Code, supra, §979, as amended, 25 P.S. §2989) ; in the event of a special election to fill a vacancy in either the Congress or the General Assembly, a committee, caucus, or convention of the party is entitled to select the nominee of the party (Election Code, supra, §630, as amended, 25 P.S. §2780) ; in special emergencies, the party county chairman must be consulted before an appointment is made to fill existing vacancies in the legislature (Act of October 23, 1959, P. L. 1365, §7, 46 P.S. §145.7) and the judiciary (Act of October 23, 1959, P. L. 1369, §8, 71 P.S. §779.8). Appellants, quite properly, point out in their briefs a striking example of <em>direct </em>action by a political party in a public function in the case of the additional judgeships created in Philadelphia County by the legislature in 1964. Since these additional judgeships were created too late to be included in the voting at the primary election, under the statutory law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> the nomination of candidates for such judgeships was made by the several political par<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>ties in accordance with their party rules. The Democratic County Chairman and the Democratic County Committee named the candidates of that party for these additional judgeships. As appellants stated: “[Cox and Shuchman] [had] a right to participate in and cast their votes for the individuals comprising that committee [Democratic County Committee], and the plaintiff voters [Bentman and Evers] [had] a constitutional right to participate in that process in the same sense, i.e., by having the divisional committeemen [Cox and Shuchman] for whom they voted vote for the persons who [were] to make the selection of high public officials.” Appellants might well have argued the converse, i.e., that two persons who had not been chosen by the party electors but by the ward leader were given the right to vote and participate in the selection of high public officials.
