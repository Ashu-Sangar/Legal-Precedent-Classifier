It was the contention of the Commonwealth- that Thomas, DeMoss, Ellsworth ■ and Wilson, knowing that Mrs. Rossman was accustomed to carry on her person or have in. her apartment large sums of money, conspired to rob her; that it was Ellsworth-and Wilson who actually robbed and killed Mrs. Rossman; that,- with the stolén money, most of which was in' new $100 bills, in their possession, Ells-worth and Wilson then flew to Las'Vegas; Nevada, via the circuitous route of Tampa, Florida, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. During the night of July.6, 1955 — three days after the alleged robbery and homicide — the activities of- Ellsworth and Wilson, then engaged in making the <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>rounds of the gambling casinos in Las Vegas, aroused the curiosity of several of the security officers in the various gambling clubs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Ellsworth and Wilson, very shabbily dressed, were buying gambling chips with new $100 bills and, after a brief time spent at the dice tables, were cashing their chips and moving on to another casino. Believing that they were engaged in exchanging counterfeit money for “clean money”,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the security officers of the Sahara Hotel and the Dunes Hotel alerted the local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to watch and observe the activities of Ellsworth and Wilson; both police agencies responded by placing the two men under constant surveillance. The officers assigned to this task noticed immediately that Ellsworth and Wilson were pretending to be unacquainted by leaving a casino separately although rejoining each other a short distance from the establishment which they had left. At the Las Vegas Club, Ellsworth was observed purchasing $900 worth of chips with nine brand new $100 bills, all of “C” series with consecutive serial numbers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> After the club owner and its security officer had inspected the nine $100 bills and had satisfied themselves that they were not counterfeit, the owner directed the cashier to return to Ellsworth, when he cashed in his chips, the same bills that he had given the cashier when he purchased the chips. Shortly thereafter, Ellsworth handed to the <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>cashier more than $700 in chips and, upon noticing that she had returned to him seven of the $100 bills which he had used to buy the chips, he became visibly disturbed and hurried out of the club. Sergeant Dunn, of the Las Vegas police force, who had witnessed this chain of events, then followed Ellsworth outside and placed him under arrest “for suspicion or investigation of robbery.” Within a few minutes, Wilson appeared, having just exited from the Westerner Club. Wilson tried to walk past Ellsworth but Sergeant Dunn called him back and took him into custody. The time was then approximately 12:15 A.M., July 7, 1955.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

According to Sergeant Dunn, this initial search consisted only of a “patting” of the clothes of the suspects. It was not until Ellsworth and Wilson arrived at the police station — approximately two minutes after their arrest — that their pockets were searched and the contents removed (Search No. 2) : “Q. . . . Now, after you took these two men, after you told these two men they were under arrest for . . . suspicion of robberies did you say? A. Yes, sir. Q. Investigation of robberies.

The validity of this arrest was based upon the knowledge of the officers of recent burglaries in the area and their observation of the activities of the person suspected in entering an' apartment building, staying therein for a short time, and then moving on to the next apartment building. Before deciding to place him under arrest the officers questioned the • suspect for an explanation of his behavior, but it was only <em>after </em>the arrest that evidence was discovered linking the suspect to a specific mail theft. The officers’ suspicion of burglary was neversubstantiated. The Court, after stating its belief that the officers had “knowledge supporting a man of reasonable caution in the belief that defendant had committed burglaries”, said (p. 679): “That this is the law is fortunate, in view of the practical consideration that officers at the scene of. arrest are required to make, an immediate, decision on the totality of the circumstances there confronting them and a failure to act and the disappearance'of the suspect <em>before the di's-'covery of the crime </em>would probably render the<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> matter' moot.

      <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>A fortiori, the same practical situations are existent in the case at bar. Ellsworth, whose face had been recognized from an F.B.I. “wanted flyer”, was in possession of an inordinately large amount of money, mostly in new $100 bills, particularly unusual for a person as shabbily dressed as he was. He was obviously attempting to appear as if he was not in association with Wilson who also was in possession of a large sum of new $100 bills. If Sergeant Dunn had not arrested Ellsworth before ascertaining what <em>specific robbery </em>he had committed, in all likelihood Ellsworth would have been successful in changing the stolen money for “clean” money and in escaping to another state and, perhaps, even another country. To hold that the failure of Sergeant Dunn to connect Ellsworth with <em>a specific crime </em>frustrates the existence of “probable cause” would virtually eliminate the right of a police officer to arrest without a warrant. By way of illustration, to carry to its logical conclusion this argument of Ellsworth’s counsel would mean that an officer would not be able to arrest without a warrant a bank robber fleeing through the streets at 3 A.M., wearing a mask over his face and carrying a bag leaking $100 bills onto the street, unless the officer happened to know the specific bank which had just been robbed. We cannot believe that this is the present state of the law; we certainly do not believe that it ever should be the law. In our view, where, as in the case at bar, the circumstances are such as would lead a reasonably cautious person to believe that a certain person has committed a robbery, such person may be legally arrested without a warrant before the discovery of the particular robbery which he has committed.

We disagree. Search No. 2, which took place within five minutes of the arrest, was a more thorough check than Search No. 1 to ascertain exactly what, if any, weapons Ellsworth might have on his person.

Since this case must be retried, it may not be amiss to consider this contention. At Ellsworth’s trial, evidence was introduced relating to the circulation by Thomas of three new $100 bills bearing serial numbers which could be traced to money possessed by Mrs. Rossman before her death. There is no dispute that the circulation of these bills by Thomas occurred after the arrest of Ellsworth. Ellsworth asserts that this problem is exactly like the one presented on the first appeal to this Court <em>(Commonwealth v.

The evidence shows that the four were in a conspiracy to rob the bank in question and acted together in robbing it. Where this fact has been proved, it is always admissible to introduce facts, the purpose of which is to trace the stolen property and show the guilt of a co-conspirator, and such testimony is not open to the objection that <em>it is hearsay acts &lt;md declarations in accused’s absence after the termination of the conspiracy Ford v.
