Defendant-husband appealed to this Court from the order permitting the severance, which appeal we quashed in an opinion by Justice O’Brien, wherein he pointed out that defendant-husband should have filed preliminary objections to the amended complaint raising questions of jurisdiction.

Justice O’Brien in <em>J¡19 Pa. </em>so indicated when he said: “We held in that case [<a href="/pa/414/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="414 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1890407" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0548-01">414 Pa. 548</a>] that appellee’s claims to the personalty and real estate and the claim for maintenance were essentially distinct and therefore should have been brought and tried separately, their consolidation con<a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>stituting a misjoinder of causes of action. We therefore vacated the lower court’s determination on the real estate and personalty claims ‘without prejudice to plaintiff to commence a separate action.’ ” It is clear that our opinion in <em>J¡11¡- Pa. </em>terminated, absent any change in circumstances, the proceedings as to support. We there affirmed the lower court’s action in respect to the support order. It is equally clear that the proceedings pertaining to the real estate and personalty claims were terminated by our vacation of the lower court’s decree. In fact, the court below never had jurisdiction in the equity action for support to entertain or adjudicate any property rights existing between husband and wife. Only the obligation for support is at issue in an action instituted under the Act of 1907. Thus, by our decision in <em>Pa. </em>there remained no cause of action which the wife-plaintiff could sever from the action of support, since, we held (1) that no other property rights could be adjudicated in the support action, so that there was no action to sever, and (2) that the support action was terminated, so that nothing could be severed from it. Hence, the lower court is without jurisdiction in this action to entertain any further prayers seeking the adjudication of any right, save a modification of the support order.</p>
