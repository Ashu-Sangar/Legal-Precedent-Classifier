On January 5, 1965, a true bill of indictment was returned <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>by the Grand Jury on all of the charges set forth above. On September 8, 1965, defendant’s petition for a psychiatric examination was granted by the Court of Quarter Sessions. Thereafter, the Commonwealth filed an application for a neuro-psychiatric examination of the defendant. On January 7, 1966, the lower Court granted the petition of the Commonwealth and ordered the defendant to submit to such examination subject to the important limitation that he not be compelled to answer any questions propounded to him by those making the examination. From that Order defendant took this appeal.</p>

This Court decided in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Musto, <a href="/pa/348/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="348 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1220331" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0300-01">348 Pa. 300</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%20307" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="35 A.2d 307">35 A. 2d 307</a>, that such an examination does not violate a defendant’s right against self-incrimination, provided that, as in the present Order, he is not compelled to answer any questions propounded to him. In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Musto, Chief Justice Horace Stern, speaking for a unanimous Court said (pages 305-307) : “Realizing that an attempt would be made to prove defendant insane at the time of the murder, the district attorney obtained permission from the court to have alienists examine him in prison. His counsel found fault with this proceeding on the ground that it constituted a violation of defendant’s constitutional right not to be compelled to give evidence against himself. While the exact question thus presented has apparently not been ruled upon by either of our appellate courts, it has arisen in many other jurisdictions, and these have quite uniformly held that the constitutional immunity from self-incrimination does not apply to a compulsory examination to determine the prisoner’s physical or mental condition for the purpose of testify<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>ing in regard thereto, provided, of course, that he be not compelled to answer any questions propounded to him by those making the examination. The purpose of the constitutional provision is to prohibit the compulsory oral examination of the prisoner either before or at trial, — to prevent his being required to incriminate himself by speech or the equivalent of speech: Commonwealth v.

United States, <a href="/us/218/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="218 U.S. 245" data-case-ids="8286703" data-case-paths="/us/218/0245-01">218 U.S. 245</a>, 252, 253. ‘Not compulsion alone is the component idea of the privilege, but testimonial compulsion . . .

It is certainly true, as stated by the Superior Court, that ordinarily a defendant charged with crime does not have the right of appeal before his trial and conviction nor thereafter until final judgment and sentence. However, the Superior Court held that there may be exceptions to this rule, citing Superior and Supreme Court cases, inter alia, Commonwealth v.

The nature of the charges affects the public interest, and the grounds for appellant’s claim of immunity, provide the exceptional circumstance which justify us in entertaining the appeals in these eases.’.
