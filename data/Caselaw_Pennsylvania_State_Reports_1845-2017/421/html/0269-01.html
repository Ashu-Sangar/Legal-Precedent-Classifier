    <p id="b310-8" data-blocks='[["BL_310.11",310,[191,1155,1157,422]]]'>The plaintiffs contended that one of the defendants, a practicing physician, was negligent in not properly examining and timely diagnosing the decedent’s illness while he was under his care, and that due to this carelessness the condition was aggravated and resulted in death. That the evidence was sufficient to warrant submission of the question of liability to the jury is not questioned.</p>

Nevertheless, if you determine from the evidence that there was negligence, of course, then the presumption is overcome.” This was misleading, prejudicial and added unnecessary confusion to the case.</p>

See, 1, 2 Laub, Penna. Trial Guide §§163.3(14), 438.2-11 (1957). The plaintiff, to recover in such a case, has the burden of proving that the alleged wrongdoer did not exercise the care and judgment of a rea<a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>sonable man in like circumstances, and that his failure to do so caused the injury or loss complained of: <em>Grantham v. Goetz, </em><a href="/pa/401/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="401 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1294515" data-case-paths="/pa/401/0349-01">401 Pa. 349</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.2d%20225" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="164 A.2d 225">164 A. 2d 225</a> (1960), and <em>Donaldson v. Maffucci, </em><a href="/pa/397/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="397 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1286242" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0548-01">397 Pa. 548</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20835" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="156 A.2d 835">156 A. 2d 835</a> (1959). However, this does not mean that there is a presumption against wrongdoing on the part of a physician accused of malpractice. There is a distinct and important difference between stating that the plaintiff has the burden of proving the negligence asserted, and that the defendant-physician is presumed to be free from negligence. See, 9 Wigmore, Evidence §2491 (3d ed. 1940); <em>Waters v. Hew Amsterdam Cas. Co., </em><a href="/pa/393/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="393 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1279686" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0247-01">393 Pa. 247</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.2d%20354" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="144 A.2d 354">144 A. 2d 354</a> (1958); and, <em>Watkins v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/315/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="315 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1156742" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0497-01">315 Pa. 497</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20644" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="173 A. 644">173 A. 644</a> (1934). The effect of that portion of the charge under discussion could have left the jury with the impression that the plaintiffs in order to recover were required to go beyond proving some evidence of negligence, or a prima facie ease of negligence, which, of course, is not correct. It could also create the thought in the jury’s mind that defendants were entitled to the benefit of the probative force of such a presumption, even after the issue was given them for decision. This is equally incorrect. Presumptions are not evidence and have no probative quality. Prosser, Torts, 198, 199 (2d ed. 1955); <em>Waters v. New Amsterdam Cas. Co., </em>supra; and, <em>Watkins v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>supra.</p>
