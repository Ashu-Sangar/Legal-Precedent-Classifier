Ralston had been previously married and had one child and grandchildren. Testatrix had not been previously married and, at the time of her death, in addition to her husband, she was survived by one living brother, Bernard A.

    <p id="b142-4" data-blocks='[["BL_142.5",142,[191,509,1157,586]]]'>The instant controversy arises solely by reason of the first portion of testatrix’ will which reads as follows : “The following <em>bequests </em>are to be made to Robert S.

The Estate of Robert Ralston takes the position that Ralston became the legatee of such stock.</p>

Resort need not be had to any extrinsic circumstances for the language which the testatrix employed in this portion of the will portrays vividly what she intended. In the first place, testatrix expressly states that she was making for her husband not a <em>bequest </em>in the singular but <em>bequests </em>in the plural. She then provided for the first of such <em>bequests, </em>i.e., a life estate in a $25,000 trust fund with an assurance of a minimum of $100 monthly during his life. After outlining the terms of such trust generally, testatrix then significantly states “also”, i.e., in the sense of “in addition to”, she makes other bequests which consist of all her owned stock of A.T.&amp;T. Co. and 200 owned shares of Duquesne Light Co. The word “also” carries out the intent implicit in the use of the words <em>bequests </em>in the plural rather than the singular to be made to testatrix’ husband. Such bequests are followed by another bequest described in the clause “and anything <em>lie </em>may wish in the house”. To whom does the pronoun “he” refer? In describing the trust fund <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>terms testatrix provided that the event upon which the remainder interests in the fund would arise should be <em>“Ms </em>death” and such use of <em>“his” </em>unequivocally refers to testatrix’ husband and not her brother; otherwise the clause would not make sense. When later on testatrix employs the pronoun “he” in referring to the person who is to take “anything in the house”, testatrix employs the pronoun “he” to refer to that person to whom she made reference by the words <em>“his </em>death”. The use of the word <em>bequests </em>in the plural, the several pronouns and the word “also” renders clear beyond any question that the testatrix intended to provide for four bequests to her husband: (1) a life interest in the trust fund with a guaranteed minimum of $100 monthly; (2) all the common stock of A.T.&amp;T. Co.; (3) 200 shares of the Duquesne Light Co.; (4) anything in testatrix’ house which the husband wished.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
