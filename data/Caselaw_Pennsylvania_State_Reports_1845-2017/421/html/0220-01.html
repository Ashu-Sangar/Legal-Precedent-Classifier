Appellee further alleges that in October of 1963, he and appellants’ officials held a conference, at which time it was agreed that appellee should be granted his degree if he completed 9 additional credits of work prior to December 31, 1964. Appellee further alleges that he completed the courses with excellent results, and, at that time, appellant repudiated these latest requirements and insisted -upon a comprehensive written examination prior to its conferring a Master’s Degree in Business Administration upon him. ■ Appellee further avers that appellants’ refusal to confer this degree upon him has <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>put him to an extreme financial disadvantage and that he has no adequate remedy at law.

In <em>Witney v.

These principles were concisely summarized again by this court in <em>Strank v. Mercy Hospital of Johnstown, </em><a href="/pa/376/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="376 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1246152" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0305-01">376 Pa. 305</a>, 309, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20A.2d%20170" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="102 A.2d 170">102 A. 2d 170</a> (1954), where it was said: “. . . the test for determining whether a court has jurisdiction of the subject matter is the competency of the court to determine controversies of the <em>general class </em>to which the case presented for its consideration belongs, and the controlling question is whether the court had power ,to enter upon the inquiry, not whether it might ultimately decide that it was unable to grant the relief sought in the particular case. It was further held that the Act of 1925 was not concerned with matters going to the right of the plaintiff to recover on his cause of action but only with his right to have his cause of action heard and determined.

In the <em>Strank </em>case, <a href="/pa/376/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="376 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1246152" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0305-01">376 Pa. 305</a>, plaintiff sought credits which the Mercy Hospital of Johnstown refused to give; in the <em>Bryn Mawr College </em>case, <a href="/pa/376/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="376 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1246152" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0305-01">supra,</a> plaintiff sought to have a student reinstated; in the instant case, appellee seeks a Master’s Degree, which the appellant refuses to confer. We believe appellee’s distinction as to state aid to be without merit, for in all three cases, the asserted rights arose from a contractual relationship between the student and the institution. As we said in <em>Strank, </em><a href="/pa/376/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="376 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1246152" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0305-01">376 Pa. 305</a>,: “ ‘The word “jurisdiction” (jus dicere) is a term of large and comprehensive import and embraces every kind of judicial action, and hence every movement by a court is necessarily the exercise of jurisdiction. It includes jurisdiction over the subject matter as well as over the person. <em>In the sense, however, in which the term ordinarily is used, </em>jurisdiction may be concisely stated to be the right to adjudicate concerning the subject matter in a given case. . . 14 Am. Jur., Courts, §160 (emphasis supplied). In other words the law must make the court competent to entertain the particular controversy. Unless special statutory provisions have changed the rule, the use of mandamus is limited to the enforcement of rights and duties imposed by law, and, if the right or duty rests wholly on contract, the writ will not issue to enforce it: See 55 C.J.S., Mandamus, Sec. 56.”</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[173,2017,1168,365]],["BL_267.1",267,[194,397,1157,1934]]]'>Appellee, in his brief, contends that plaintiff has no available remedy except a writ of mandamus. He contends that an action in assumpsit for breach of contract would be “ridiculous” and that money damages would never be able to compensate appellee for the value of the degree he wishes to have conferred upon ..himself. He further contends in his brief that because <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>the University of Pittsburgh receives aid from the Commonwealth, that it is no longer a private institution, and on that basis can be distinguished from the Mercy Hospital of Johnstown and Bryn Mawr College. With these two contentions we cannot agree. We held in <em>Strank v. Mercy Hospital of Johnstown, </em><a href="/pa/383/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="383 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1261892" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0054-01">383 Pa. 54</a>, 57, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.2d%20697" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="117 A.2d 697">117 A. 2d 697</a> (1955) : “Under the Acts of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, §13, and February 14, 1857, P. L. 39, the courts of common pleas have the jurisdiction and powers of a court of chancery in all cases such as those in which they had theretofore possessed jurisdiction and powers under the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth, and also so far as relates to the affording of specific relief when a recovery in damages would be an inadequate remedy. They have jurisdiction not only for the prevention of acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the rights of individuals, but also for the enforcement of obligations whether arising under express contracts, written or oral, or implied contracts, including those in which a duty may have resulted from long recognized and established customs and usages, as in this case, perhaps, between an educational institution and its students. Moreover, it is the peculiar province of equity to afford relief where the measurement of damages in such cases cannot be formulated and applied in a suit at law because of their being necessarily speculative and indeterminate, and therefore the legal remedy is not adequate and complete: H. Daroff &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Vitullo, <a href="/pa/350/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="350 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="461124" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0501-01">350 Pa. 501</a>, 507, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20595" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="39 A.2d 595">39 A. 2d 595</a>, 598; Ritz v.
