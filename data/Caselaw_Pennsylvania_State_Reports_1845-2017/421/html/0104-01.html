These distributions consisted almost entirely of cash. Yet, no objection was made to the liquidation of the securities upon the filing of the first and partial account. The only objection raised was to the <em>amount </em>of the compensation sought, an objection which we do not deem to have embodied the challenge presently made. Likewise, although an additional $100,000 cash risk distribution was made to the residuary legatees prior to the filing of the second and final account, the objections filed to that account did not raise the failure of appellee to distribute in kind.</p>

    <p id="b151-7" data-blocks='[["BL_151.6",151,[206,1317,1150,524]]]'>Included among the securities held by the estate were 15,486 shares of Hercules Powder Co., Inc. These securities, inventoried at $988,200, constituted 40% of the asset value of the estate. Liquidated over a 7 month period in blocks of 200 to 300 shares, the sale of the Hercules holdings resulted in a gain of approximately $200,000 to the estate. It was in response to appellee’s claimed extensive efforts in the disposition of these securities that the additional compensation was awarded below.</p>

However, appellee’s own evidence establishes that he did not fully exhaust the possibility of disposing of the Hercules securities more promptly. Although inquiries had been received by appellee’s broker as to the availability of further shares of Hercules, appellee declined to sell at the market, even though a profit would have <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>been realized. By continuing to sell in small blocks, offered at prices slightly higher than the market, appellee sought to cause an advance in the price at which the securities could be sold. Thus, in the face of the testimony of appellee’s own expert that at one point in the process, when the inquiries were received, the estate’s remaining Hercules holdings could have been profitably liquidated, appellee continued to prolong the process of disposing of the securities.</p>

By prolonging the liquidation of the Hercules holdings in order to maximize the profit, appellee unnecessarily exposed the estate to losses in the event the market declined. His action in this respect was tantamount to an additional investment in the market and was improper.

In 1962, although the estate was in a 49% bracket for federal estate tax purposes and a 90% bracket for federal income tax purposes, appellee elected to claim certain administrative expenses on the estate tax return rather than on the income tax return. As a result, deductions available to the estate to reduce its tax liability were not properly utilized. Moreover, although the record indicates that cash distributions to the legatees were made in 1961, no effort was made to claim a deduction for such distributions on the estate’s federal income tax return for that year. As a result, excessive taxes were paid in 1961.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
