In May, 1950, the parties entered into a discussion regarding the sale of the timber from the plaintiff to the defendant, the latter paying first $2,500 and on June 17, 1950, $2,500 more, the plaintiff then transferring his interest in the timber to the defendant.</p>

This latter task was then assumed by his successor, who, after making a study of the record and evidence, filed an adjudication in which he summai’ized: “. . . the entire action reduces itself to the one simple question of whether or not the defendant made any misrepresentations to the plaintiff or paid an inadequate price at the time of the timber transaction between the parties in May and June, 1950. To be successful in this action, <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>the plaintiff must meet the burden of proof ih regard to the two main questions of fact: (1) serious inadequacy of price, and (2) Fraud, actual or constructive: Neill v.
