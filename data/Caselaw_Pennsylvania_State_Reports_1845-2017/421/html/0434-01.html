As he neared the top he felt that the blocks beneath his feet were loose. He took another step or two and began to descend. As he did, a concrete block fell from beneath him. He managed to catch himself by grabbing the top of the wall and attempted to get a toe hold in an effort to steady his balance. However the blocks gave way and he was <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>thrown to the ground. Minor plaintiff had observed other children playing on and around the building previously, but had never done so himself.</p>

Restatement 2d, Torts, §339, Reporter’s Notes. We believe that tlie new §339 represents a wise revision of the original section, and we hereby indicate our approval thereof and adopt it as the law of this Commonwealth, even as we formerly adopted the earlier section in 1949 in <em>Bartleson n. Glen Alden Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/361/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="361 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="476388" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0519-01">361 Pa. 519</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.2d%20846" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="64 A.2d 846">64 A. 2d 846</a> (1949).</p>
    <p id="b477-4" data-blocks='[["BL_477.5",477,[199,783,1151,424]]]'>All five requirements of §339 must be satisfied if a possessor of land is to be held liable. Clause (d) requires a weighing of the interests involved — -the cost of “childproofing” versus the danger of harm to children. Plaintiffs have not satisfied us that the utility to defendants of maintaining the partially erected wall without making it safe for children was overcome by the risk it presented to children.</p>
    <p id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.6",477,[195,1221,1153,1134]],["BL_478.1",478,[193,409,1154,99]]]'>Having concluded that clause (d) was not satisfied, we need not discuss the other clauses of §339. We wish, however, to indicate our disapproval of the Superior Court’s determination that the present case is controlled by <em>Dragonjac v. McGaffin Construction &amp; Supply Co., </em><a href="/pa/409/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="409 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1883261" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0276-01">409 Pa. 276</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.2d%20241" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="186 A.2d 241">186 A. 2d 241</a> (1962). In <em>Dragonjae, </em>minor plaintiff fell from the top of a newly erected wall which he had ascended. The risk which the child realized in that case was that of falling. So, too, in the present matter, minor plaintiff might have been held to have realized the risk that he might fall while climbing a wall, but not that the wall might crumble under him. In addition, in <em>Dragonjae </em>we stated that plaintiffs must fail because, among other reasons, “. . . the minor plaintiff <em>and Ms parents assumed the risk.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <a href="/pa/409/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="409 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1883261" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0276-01">409 Pa. at 280</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.2d%20243" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="186 A.2d 243">186 A. 2d 243</a>. This was an unfortunate statement because §339 makes no mention of the conduct of the parents, and, in no event, would a minor plaintiff be precluded from recovery in a personal injury action on the ground that his <em>parents </em>assumed the risk. In any <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>event, plaintiffs cannot prevail because every requirement for liability under §339 has not been satisfied.</p>
