As in the instant case, the sheets were in handwriting. The first page was titled “Last Will” and contained devises of realty, bequests of personalty, and a direction for the payment of funeral expenses. The second sheet contained another devise of realty and personal property. The third and final sheet, the only one to which the decedents’ signatures were affixed, provided for the disposition of the proceeds of life insurance, a bequest of personal property, and the combination of a safe. The papers were found in a sealed envelope near the bodies of the decedents — joint suicides. We there held that the separate sheets were entitled to be admitted to probate, concluding that they were sufficiently “ ‘connected by their internal sense, by coherence or adaptation of parts’ ” to constitute an integrated, testamentary instrument signed at the end thereof. <em>Covington Estate, </em>supra at 13-14, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20A.2d%20235" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="33 A.2d 235">33 A. 2d at 240</a>.</p>

Nor were the sheets verbally united by the completion on a successive page of a sentence or paragraph begun on the preceding page. In holding that the separate sheets were connected in their internal sense, so as to be entitled to probate, the majority relied on the fact that the sheets were admittedly in the hand of the wife and the signatures genuine; on <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>the complete absence of any suggestion of fraud; and on the fact that when read as an entirety, the sheets constituted a coherent and harmonious scheme of testamentary disposition, conjoined without contradiction, inconsistency or repetition.

In our view, <em>Baldwin Estate </em>is presently inapposite. The circumstances under which the writings there in dispute were discovered created a strong possibility that they were placed among decedent’s effects after his death. Under such circumstances, the possibility of the interpolation of spurious documents or memoranda of decedent’s inchoate intentions was sufficient to preclude probate of the writings. Moreover, when the writings were removed from decedent’s effects, they were dropped and their arrangement disturbed. Thus, it was impossible to determine whether the signed sheet came at the sequential end of the writings. Neither of these circumstances, nor other factors peculiar to <em>Baldwin Estate, </em>is here present.</p>
