Taking the charge as a whole (as we are bound to do in determining whether or not reversible error was committed in instructing the jury <em>(James v. Ferguson, </em><a href="/pa/401/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="401 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1294484" data-case-paths="/pa/401/0092-01">401 Pa. 92</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20690" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="162 A.2d 690">162 A. 2d 690</a>)), we believe that the points of law contained in the above requested instruction were sufficiently and adequately covered by other instructions requested by plaintiff and affirmed by the court. Plaintiff’s Point <em>5 </em>— which <em>was read to the jury </em>— in slightly different language, enunciated the same legal requirements as Point 6 as to the sufficiency of the <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>train’s warning in view of the train’s speed: “A railroad’s employees in charge of a train are bound to give <em>timely and sufficient warning </em>of the train’s approach to a crossing. Generally, the adequacy of a signal given when approaching a crossing depends on whether warning was given soon enough in view of <em>the rapid movement of the train, </em>but the adequacy of the signal may depend upon whether the signal was given too soon in view of the <em>retarded rate of speed of the train </em>and <em>in either event the question is whether the warning was timely, in view of all the circumstances </em>(Point 5) (Emphasis added). Plaintiff’s Point 4— <em>which was also read to the jury </em>— stated that, if an engineer apprehends that a person on or approaching a crossing will be in danger, “it is his duty to slacken the train’s speed and, if possible, to stop it in order to avert an accident.” Under the instant circumstances, the trial court did not err in refusing Point 6; <em>in essence, </em>such point was simply repetitive of legal concepts included in Points 4 and 5.</p>

A careful reading of plaintiff’s Point 6, supra, reveals that such point contained no such direct request to the trial court nor did any other point. Point 6 states that the lack of a flagman and gates should be considered on the issue of the reasonableness of the train’s speed but did not encompass the question of the breach of any independent duty of the railroad to provide for a flagman or gates.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Further<a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>more, the relevance of the absence of a flagman and/or gates to the determination of the reasonableness of the train’s speed is implicitly covered by plaintiff’s Point 5, supra, which was read to the jury as an instruction to consider the timeliness of the engineer’s warning, “in Anew of all the circumstances”.</p>

Defendant’s counsel objected to this argument and asked the court to instruct the jury that plaintiff’s counsel had the burden to compel defendant to produce “at the trial records kept in the regular course of the railroad’s business relevant to this case, including any speed tape, if the engine involved was so equipped ....” (Defendant’s Point 12) Plaintiff now argues that the trial court erred in reading this point to the jury.</p>

Plaintiff cannot shift to defendant the burden of the production of evidence the existence of which plaintiff has failed to establish, “(a) The party having the risk of non-persuasion ... is naturally the one <em>upon whom first falls this duty of going forward with evidence; </em>because, since he wishes to have the jury act for him, and since without any legal evidence at all they could properly take no action, there is no need for the opponent to adduce evidence”; 9 Wigmore, Evidence, §2487, p. 279 (3d ed. 1940). (Emphasis original). Plaintiff asserts that the following testimony of the defendant’s engineer on cross-examination &gt;vas sufficient to establish the <em>existence </em>
      <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>of a speed tape:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> “Q.

Did yon have a tachometer or other recording instrument in the cab of the locomotive? A. There was a speedometer on the engine, yes.” (A speedometer is different from a tachometer.)

Jur., Proof of Facts, Railroads, p. 37 (1961)), thereby shifting the burden to defendant to produce such a tachometer or explain why this particular train was not equipped with one. However, plaintiff did not request the court below to take judicial notice of such fact) she, therefore, cannot do so for the first time on appeal: <em>Platt v.

Substantially, Point 13 states that the jury could find contributory negligence on the part of the decedent if it found that he was sitting on the crossing in such a way as to be able to see an oncoming train and had sufficient time to remove himself to safety. Since “one who crosses a railroad at grade is under a duty not only to stop, to look and to listen before entering upon the crossing but also <em>to continue </em>to look and to listen while traversing the crossing” <em>(Riesberg v. Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad, </em><a href="/citations/?q=107%20Pa.%20434" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="107 Pa. 434">107 Pa. 434</a>, 441, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20575" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="180 A.2d 575">180 A. 2d 575</a>, 578), the affirmance of this was proper.

    <p id="b467-4" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[205,669,1153,1404]]]'>Next, the plaintiff assigns as error the trial court’s affirmance of defendant’s ninth point for charge which instructed the jury to disregard <em>as conclusions </em>Joseph Byrne’s testimony that the decedent’s car wheels were spinning on the approach to the crossing and that the car had stalled after reaching the crossing. The testimony of Byrne, who was not qualified as an expert, was definitely a recital of his own conclusion; he admitted, on cross-examination, that he could not see the wheels spinning but rather could only hear a screeching noise and that he only surmised the car had stalled “because there was no exhaust from the tailpipe”. Plaintiff submits that these conclusions are admissible as an exception to the opinion evidence rule because the facts of which Byrne had knowledge were incapahle of adequate description to the jury without accompanying opinions: Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence, §531 (4th ed. 1953). However, the application of this rule lies within the trial court’s discretion, and its ruling will not be reversed on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion: <em>Cooper v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/323/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="323 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1169621" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0295-01">323 Pa. 295</a>, 301, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20125" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="188 A. 125">188 A. 125</a>, 128.

If you find that the defendant’s engineer had actual knowledge that the automobile operated by Eugene Wilson was stopped on the <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>crossing for a sufficient length of time before the accident to give the engineer a reasonable opportunity to stop the train and avoid the accident, you may conclude that the defendant was guilty of wanton misconduct.

In this the plaintiff failed. Mr. Byrne testified that the decedent’s vehicle was on the track for about thirty seconds before being hit, but no evidence was presented concerning the actual prior knowledge of the peril, <em>nor did the testimony establish any facts from which knowledge could be inferred.” </em>(Emphasis added). It is readily seen that the trial court refused to charge on these points because of the lack of evidence that defendant’s engineer had <em>actual knowledge </em>of the peril in which decedent was placed.

Defendant, in this respect, points to two factors: First, the court, in its charge, eliminated from the jury’s consideration any question of contributory negligence in the suit for property damage to the automobile and yet the jury in that suit returned a verdict for defendant as it did in the. personal injury actions wherein contributory negligence was an issue, thus indicating as the basis for all three verdicts the absence of even ordinary negligence;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Second, the court did affirm and read to the jury plaintiff’s third requested point<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> which, in substance, in<a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>structed the jury that, if it found the circumstances were such that defendant’s engineer <em>should have known </em>of decedent’s perilous position and had an opportunity to stop the train in time to avoid the accident, then the jury could find defendant “negligent”.</p>
    <p id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.5",471,[217,672,1152,1020]]]'>A review of the record requires certain conclusions: (a) the court below should have affirmed the two requested points for charge and permitted the jury to pass on the question of wanton misconduct <em>as presented by these two </em>points; (b) the court, however, did <em>in effect </em>instruct the jury on circumstances which fundamentally would constitute wanton misconduct and did permit a finding of culpability if such circumstances were so found; (c) the verdicts of the jury clearly reveal that defendant was exonerated from liability because the jury found defendant was not guilty of <em>any </em>ordinary misconduct or negligence. Taking into consideration all the circumstances herein presented, we are convinced that whatever error the trial court committed in refusing to affirm plaintiff’s Points 1 and 2 was effectively cured both by the court’s affirmance of the third point and the verdicts of the jury. To grant a new trial on this ground certainly would not advance the interests of justice.</p>
