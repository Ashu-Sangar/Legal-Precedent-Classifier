    <p id="b97-7" data-blocks='[["BL_97.10",97,[210,888,1152,698]]]'>Plaintiffs filed an amicable action of ejectment and confession of judgment against the defendants. The power of attorney to confess the judgment was contained in articles of agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants’ predecessors in title who assigned the agreement to the defendants. Defendants filed a petition to strike the judgment which the lower court granted. The plaintiffs now appeal to this Court and maintain that the assignee or grantee of an interest in real estate is bound by the warrant of attorney that permits an amicable action of ejectment and confession of judgment even though the parties-defendants were not signators to the agreement.</p>

Wyoming Valley Nursery, </em><a href="/pa/384/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="384 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1263038" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0213-01">384 Pa.. 213</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=120%20A.2d%20303" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="120 A.2d 303">120 A. 2d 303</a> (1956) : “A warrant of attorney to confess judgment has a very special and significant status, xln assignment of a lease binds the assignee with all the terms and conditions thereof except a pro<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>vision for a warrant of attorney to confess judgment against the lessee; and, this is so even where the assignee formally agrees with the lessor to an assignment of a lease by endorsing thereon that he, the assignee, accepts it ‘according to its full tenor and effect.’</p>
