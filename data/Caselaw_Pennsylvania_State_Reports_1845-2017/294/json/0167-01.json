The referee entered an order \u201cThat claimant\u2019s petition to reinstate compensation agreement......be dismissed until such time as [he] returns to work and establishes a bona fide earning wage, at which time this agreement may be further modified either by agreement of the parties or by petition to the board.\u201d The board dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d an appeal from the above order, stating, \u201cThe referee has said that claimant\u2019s present earnings, $1.50 a week, are not sufficient evidence of his earning capacity and that claimant has not yet established his earning power within the meaning of the act.\u201d On appeal to the court below, the action of the board was affirmed, and claimant then filed the present appeal. The matter involved is one peculiarly for the compensation authorities; while there is no unbending rule governing such cases, we are not convinced of error in the disposition of the present application.\nThe order appealed from is affirmed.",
