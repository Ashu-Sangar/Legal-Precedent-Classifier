Exceptions to the conclusion, on behalf of heirs and next of kin of testator, were overruled and this appeal followed.\nWe agree with the court below that the bequest referred to is valid and that testator\u2019s desires, as indicated, should be carried out. To this end, however, the proceeding must be referred back to the court for the purpose of supplying a trustee to carry into effect donor\u2019s intent and for the additional purpose of taking testimony and definitely determining between the several claimants, representing \u201cFatherless Children of France,\u201d the proper person or persons or association entitled to possession of the fund, and making such other order as may be deemed necessary to fully carry out testator\u2019s intent as expressed in the clause of his will above quoted.\nDecree affirmed and it is ordered that the case be referred back to the court below for disposition in accordance with this opinion.
