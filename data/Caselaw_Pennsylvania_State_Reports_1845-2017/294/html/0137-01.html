    <p id="b162-9" data-blocks='[["BL_162.10",162,[267,1067,1152,853]]]'>In answer to plaintiff’s statement of claim, defendant filed an affidavit of defense in lieu of demurrer. On July-13, 1927, the court below made the following order: “It is adjudged that plaintiffs have not set out a good cause of action.” Plaintiffs petitioned for reargument, and this was granted November 16, 1927. On January 23d, the court below ruled: “after reargument we adhere to our opinion that the statement filed does not set out a good cause of action.” Plaintiff appealed to us from this order. Appellee has moved to quash, on the grounds that the only appealable order-was the original one of July 13, 1927, and the present appeal was not taken within three months from that time, as required by statute ; that an order for reargument does not stay the running of the statutory period: Barlott v. Forney, <a href="/pa/187/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="187 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="900329" data-case-paths="/pa/187/0301-01">187 Pa. 301</a>, 303; Henry’s Est., <a href="/pa/290/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="290 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1104467" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0537-01">290 Pa. 537</a>.</p>

It is obvious that neither order entered by the court below is a final one; to make either of these orders final, it would have to be followed by some such words as “and judgment is now entered for defendant”: Smith v. Phila. &amp; Reading Ry., <a href="/pa/286/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="286 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="1096443" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0055-01">286 Pa. 55</a>, 56. An appeal cannot be taken until after a final judgment has been entered in the case (American Trust Co. <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>v. Kaufman, <a href="/pa/279/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="279 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1083467" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0230-01">279 Pa. 230</a>, 233); upon the entry of such a judgment, plaintiff’s right to appeal will arise.</p>
