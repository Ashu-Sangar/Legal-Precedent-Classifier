Because of this, a vendee of the corporation subsequently sought, in the same proceeding, to obtain an order on the receiver to deliver possession of property which the vendee had bought from the corporation and paid for, but had left in its possession. Objection was made that the corporation was insolvent at the time the receiver was appointed, and hence the petitioning creditor had no paramount right to the property purchased. Testimony was taken, the court entered a decree that the corporation was insolvent at the time stated, and dismissed the petition. The defeated creditor appealed, but we affirmed: Shipler et al. v.

See also article on Res Judicata in 38 Yale Law Journal, pages 299, 303-4. Any other conclusion would result in an intolerable situation, for the adjudication of insolvency would decide nothing; the door would still be open to a collateral attack by each and every creditor, possibly resulting in the corporation being, at the same time, insolvent as to some creditors 'and solvent as to others; the equality of distribution sought by the appointment being thus wholly destroyed. The principle contended for by appellant would justify also a collateral attack on an adjudication of bankruptcy, which is not permissible: Sanger v. Upton, <a href="/us/91/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="91 U.S. 56" data-case-ids="5647484" data-case-paths="/us/91/0056-01">91 U. S. 56</a>.

      <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>The primary dispute between the parties is: Is the contract governed by the provisions of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act of May 12, 1925, P. L. 603, as plaintiff asserts, or by the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 722, as defendant alleges. We have no hesitancy in deciding that the former statute is inapplicable. It defines “goods’’ as meaning “all chattels personal, other than ......machinery attached or to be attached to real estate” ; and section 7, the only one which could possibly affect the situation here, applies only to “goods...... affixed to realty at the time of a conditional sale or subsequently [so] as to become a part thereof.” The contract, as above epitomized, shows that the machine in suit was “to be attached to real estate,” and hence the ^yord “goods,” as defined by the act, excludes this machine from the purview of that section. It follows that, as between the two statutes, the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 722, which does include machinery to be attached to the realty, is the only one which can have relevancy here. To construe them thus, is in accord with the rule that where two statutes are passed at- the same session of the legislature, they are to be so interpreted, if possible, as to avoid a conflict between them: White v.

Case, supra, a receiver appointed to represent creditors of an insolvent corporation had the rights of levying or attaching creditors.” This conclusion is not challenged; and from it and the well settled rule that a statute which alters the course of the common law will not be extended, by interpretation, to make any further innovation thereon than as expressly declared in or with reasonable certainty to be implied from the act itself (Kates’s Est., <a href="/pa/282/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="282 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1088423" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0417-01">282 Pa. 417</a>; Merrick v.

    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[245,460,1152,969]]]'>The Act of May 14,1925, P. L. 722, says that the contract or a verified statement thereof, <em>“shall </em>be filed.” A fair conclusion from this is that, unless otherwise provided, and so far as concerns the present controversy it is not, such filing must be within a reasonable time from the sale and delivery of the chattel, and a failure so to do by the conditional vendor, whose d'uty it is to file it and who seeks the protection of the act, will deprive him of its benefit. A further fair, if not a necessary conclusion, is that a taking by a conditional vendor, who never has given notice of his intention to retake, makes his act wrongful. In the present case, plaintiff never did file the contract, though a reasonable time so to do had expired long before the retaking, and no notice of the intention to retake was ever given. Plaintiff must, therefore, be held liable, and the only other matter we need refer to is its complaint regarding the measure of damages.</p>

Appellant contends (1) that recovery should have been limited to the balance due by the corporation to it, under their contract; or (2) to the sum for which it had expressed a willingness to resell the machine to the receiver. The contract price was “$8,525 f. o. b. cars, Beloit, Wisconsin.” The reductio ad absurdam of contention (1) is that if but $1 had remained due on the contract, appellant’s theory is that it could have wrongfully taken and kept a machine worth thousands of dollars and been liable for only $1. The i*eductio ad absurdam of contention (2) is that, for the wrongful taking and keeping of a machine worth thousands of dollars when in place, appellant could be held liable for only whatever fractional part of that sum it was willing to sell the detached machine, whether in good or bad condition, to a <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>receiver whose - sole duty was' to sell the existing assets and not to buy others.</p>
    <p id="b409-3" data-blocks='[["BL_409.4",409,[119,459,1154,314]]]'>So far as we are aware, one who wrongfully takes' the property of another, has always been adjudged to pay at least its actual value at the time and place of its taking: Duroth Manufacturing Co. v.

    <p id="b409-4" data-blocks='[["BL_409.5",409,[118,786,1154,915]]]'>In the light of our conclusions as above expressed, the other questions raised by appellant become unimportant. To avoid misapprehension, however, we should perhaps add that we have not overlooked the fact that the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 722, which we have held as the only statute which can possibly be relevant, has been repealed by the Act of May 12, 1927, P. L. 979, and that sections 1 and 7 of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act, have been amended thereby. In the present case, however, the contract was made, the receiver was appointed, and the rights of the parties became fixed, before the passage of the Act of 1927. Nor have we overlooked the fact that the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 722, may not be applicable to the facts appearing in this case. If it is not, then the common.law rule applies and plaintiff loses. Neither party raised this point, however, and hence we leave it undecided.</p>
