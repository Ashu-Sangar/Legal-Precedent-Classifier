The petition, heard by a referee at Pittsburgh, resulted in an award in her favor; but, on appeal, the workmen’s compensation board, against the protest of claimant, ordered a hearing de novo at Philadelphia. This hearing was fixed for the purpose of affording claimant an opportunity to cross-examine Dr. J. B. Carnett, who had been called in by the board as an expert to give that body his opinion as to whether the complaint of which deceased had died was due to the accident suffered by the latter while in the employ of defendant. Neither claimant nor defendant at<a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>tended or was represented at the Philadelphia hearing; nevertheless, without formally taking the testimony of Dr. Carnett, the board, acting on a written statement of his views, reversed the referee’s award. Claimant appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, and that tribunal entered an order sending the case back to the board “for further hearing and disposition.” The board then held a meeting at Pittsburgh, where additional testimony for claimant was introduced, but none by defendant. Thereafter, for the second time, the board referred the record to Dr. Carnett, arid, over plaintiff’s protest, ordered another hearing at Philadelphia. At this hearing, defendant was represented by counsel but claimant was not. Dr. Carnett was duly sworn; he produced a supplementary report, together with his former written opinion, and stated that he had not changed his views as there expressed. This marked the extent of the hearing. Immediately thereafter the board filed another adjudication, entering an order which disallowed the award of the referee. Claimant again appealed to the Common Pleas of Allegheny County, which tribunal, as showri by its second opinion, reluctantly affirmed the final decision of the board. Claimant then appealed to this court;</p>

L. 642, 662, 664, the compensation authorities are authorized to “fix a time and place for hearing .claims,” and likewise, for hearings de novo; but the whole tenor and purview of the workman’s compensation law dictates that the discretion to fix the place of hearing shall be used in such a way as not to defeat the humanitarian purposes of the statute. After properly assigning the petition to the district wherein the claimant lived, and starting the hearings there, it was ari abuse of discretion to set a hearing de novo over three hundred miles away, at the other end of the State, and the more so, in the face of claimant’s protest and known destitution.</p>

As is well stated in Skinner’s Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Law, page 207, “before the referee or board can base its findings upon facts ascertained from an independent investigation, the evidence of these facts should be submitted in the usual way, under oath, and the witness appear for examination and cross-examination.” Here, the expert, who was accepted by the board, as the most material witness in the case, and whose testimony concerned deductions drawn from the particular facts in the case and not from mere hypotheses, did not in any proper sense appear for examination and cross-examination, and therefore the judgment of the court below, approving the final action of the board in refusing to accept the award of the referee, must be reversed.</p>

Had the compensation authorities in the Carlin Case based, in whole or in part, a material finding on the advice of the expert called in by them, they would have been obliged to place such expert upon the stand, the same as any other material witness, so that he might be cross-examined by all parties in interest; for when an expert thus called goes beyond giving abstract scientific advice to enable the referee or the board to better understand the evidence before them, and applies his scientific knowledge to the underlying facts in a particular case, he becomes more <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>than a mere adviser to the compensation authorities and must be treated like any other witness subpoenaed by one of the parties.</p>

The widow was substituted as claimant, without objection on the part of defendant. After a hearing and a hearing de novo on this disability petition, the board made an award to the substituted claimant, covering compensation from the date when her husband stopped work, after the accident, to the date of his death, and also some items of incidental expense. In support of this award, the board found that, while the deceased had been injured in the course of his employment, and the disability was due to such injury, yet the sarcoma, or specific ailment, which caused 1ns death, was “due to natural causes and was not,caused by the injury.” The latter finding, however, had no proper place in the adjudication of a claim for disability during life; such being the case, the fact that the award was not appealed from- by either side does not make the finding in question res judicata.. Finally, it may be noted, in connection with the adjudication under immediate discussion, that the record there shows very plainly that the board’s conclusion, that the ailment from which the deceased died was not connected with the injury, rested on the advice of Dr. Carnett, rather than on any inherent weakness in or disbelief of the testimony produced by claimant. We say this because the board, although suggesting some points of weakness in claimant’s proofs, instead of standing on these as the basis of its decision, says that, not being “entirely satisfied'with the medical testimony..____concerning......the cause of death, [it] referred the record to Dr. J. B. Carnett as an impartial expert,” adding that Dr. Carnett, having given his opinion that “the sarcoma might possibly have been caused by the injury, but [that] it much more prob<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>ably was not,” and the board, being, content with that opinion, “Therefore” concluded “that the injury did not cause the sarcoma and did not cause the death.” If the opinion of this witness is to control, the present record shows no reason why he should not be produced at a hearing where claimant will have, what the workmen’s compensation law entitles her to, a fair opportunity to cross-examine him without undue inconvenience and expense to herself.</p>
