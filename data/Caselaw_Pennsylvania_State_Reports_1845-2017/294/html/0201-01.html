Exceptions to the conclusion, on behalf of heirs and next of kin of testator, were overruled and this appeal followed.</p>

To this end, however, the proceeding must be referred back to the court for the purpose of supplying a trustee to carry into effect donor’s intent and for the additional purpose of taking testimony and definitely determining between the several claimants, representing “Fatherless Children of France,” the proper person or persons or association entitled to possession of the fund, and making such other order as may be deemed necessary to fully carry out testator’s intent as expressed in the clause of his will above quoted.</p>
