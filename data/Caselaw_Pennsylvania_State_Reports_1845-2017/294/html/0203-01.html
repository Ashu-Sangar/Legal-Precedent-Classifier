The parties hereto, residents of Punxsutawney, Jefferson County, entered into a partnership in the spring of 1922, which continued until July 1, 1926, when dissolved by mutual consent. That there was a partnership is admitted; the vital question is as to what it embraced. D. E. Brown, the defendant, contends that it extended only to the coal brokerage business and to a lumber busi<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>ness; while W. F. Smith, the plaintiff, contends it also extended to some coal mining business and especially embraced an oil and gas operation in Indiana County. The last named was the nub of the case, as to which the evidence was very conflicting. On November 15, 1924, while the coal brokerage partnership business was in full operation, the defendant obtained from Dr. J. W. Morrow a written lease giving him the oil and gas rights in a tract of three hundred and nine acres situate in North Mahoning Township, on a royalty basis. While the lease was in defendant’s name, plaintiff insists and the trial court has found that it was in fact a part of the partnership business. This finding of fact, supported by the weight of the evidence, direct and circumstantial, cannot be disturbed. In an equity case the trial court’s findings of facts, on conflicting evidence, are as conclusive as the verdict of a jury: Garr et al. v. Fuls et al., <a href="/pa/286/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="286 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="1096479" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0137-01">286 Pa. 137</a>; Houghton et al. v.

In the instant case plaintiff did not consent to the taking of the lease in defendant’s name or know it had been so taken until about the beginning of this suit. The expressed intention of the lease was the production of oil or gas or both through the drilling of wells. These were to be financed by the issuance of thirty-two shares of stock of the assumed value of $450 each, for each well, in a company called “The Mudlick Oil &amp; Gas Company”; of which, sixteen shares were to pay for drilling the wells, four shares to go to Dr. Morrow, as his royalty, and the remaining twelve shares were to be equally divided between the plaintiff and defendant. The first well produced gas in paying quantities; the second was a dry hole and for the drilling thereof the partnership, as the trial court has found, <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>paid a shortage of $723.50; the third and fourth wells are productive and the fifth was being drilled at the time this case was heard.</p>

It must be conceded that coal oil and natural gas, while in the ground, are a part of the real estate (see Marshall v. Mellor et al., <a href="/pa/179/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="179 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="886987" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0371-01">179 Pa. 371</a>; Blakeley et al. v.

So far the contention is sound. Where a partner, however, has possessed himself of firm property, equity, regarding him as its trustee, will compel him to account, and that the property, although real estate, is so held, may be shown by parol: Ihmsen v. Huston, <a href="/pa/247/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="247 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1009414" data-case-paths="/pa/247/0402-01">247 Pa. 402</a>. In the case just cited, Mr. Justice Elkin, speaking for the court (p. 408), says: “We also agree that as between partners themselves or their heirs and personal representatives, where the rights of creditors are not involved, real estate may be shown by parol to be partnership property, notwithstanding the title be in one of them only, or in them all as tenants in common.” In Cundey v. Hall, <a href="/pa/208/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="208 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="998144" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0335-01">208 Pa. 335</a>, 341, Mr. Justice Mestkezat, expressing the opinion of the court, says: “It is unquestionably true that as between partners themselves real estate purchased with partnership funds and for partnership purposes is partnership property and it may be shown to be such, notwithstanding the deed was made to the individuals composing the firm as tenants in common. But that rule cannot be invoked here to defeat the claims made on this fund by the lien creditors of John H. Hall.” And in Warriner v. Mitchell, <a href="/pa/128/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="128 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="567102" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0153-01">128 Pa. 153</a>, 161, Mr. Justice Green, speaking for the court, after stating that as to purchasers and lien creditors real estate retains its character as shown by the record, says: “But it is just as <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>true that, as between the partners themselves, land which is treated as partnership property, especially if it be purchased and paid for with partnership money, is regarded as partnership property only, although the title be taken in the name of the partners individually. It is largely a question of intention; that intention may be shown by parol; it may be manifested in the acts and declarations of the parties”; citing authorities. And see Meason v. Kaine, <a href="/pa/63/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="63 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1018982" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0335-01">63 Pa. 335</a>; also Floyd v.

This rule applies only between partners; as to bona fide purchasers or lien creditors, it is otherwise, as above stated. See Stover v. Stover, <a href="/pa/180/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="180 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="888382" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0425-01">180 Pa. 425</a> ; Gunnison v.

A partner, who takes a lease in his own name, of property rented for partnership purposes, holds it as trustee for the firm; and the same is. true where he takes title to property bought for a like purpose: Lacy v. Hall et al., <a href="/pa/37/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="37 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="418927" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0360-01">37 Pa. 360</a>, 365; and see Abbott’s App., <a href="/pa/50/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="50 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="425187" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0234-01">50 Pa. 234</a>. What plaintiff seeks to recover in the instant case is his share of the profits realized from the oil and gas transaction; this he may do although the partnership agreement relating thereto was in parol: Howell v. Kelly, <a href="/pa/149/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="149 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="832552" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0473-01">149 Pa. 473</a>; see also McBride, Admx., v. W. Pa.
