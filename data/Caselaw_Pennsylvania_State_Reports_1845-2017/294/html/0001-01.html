In their brief, appellant’s counsel, — while necessarily admitting the wording of the certificates showing that they were to go to the state treasurer and not denying that there was evidence that when each certificate was issued one of the partners of Brown &amp; Stevens informed defendant’s president of their intention to place it with the state treasurer, — take the position that because there was no evidence that the bank had ever received notice or had knowledge that the certificates <em>had in fact </em>been de<a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>posited by Brown &amp; Stevens with the state treasurer, there was no notice to the bank of their actual assignment. Until such notice was received, the assignee’s rights were not fixed, they contend, and the bank had the legal right to continue to deal with Brown &amp; Stevens as the parties to whom it was indebted upon the certificates and could avail itself of any defenses, by way of set-off, which it had acquired against them before the receipt of notice of the assignment of the certificates, which it is alleged was not until March 25, 1925, when all of the indebtedness claimed to be set off had accrued. In support of their contention, appellant’s counsel cite Skobis v.

This is a correct statement of the law when applied to facts which it fits, but here we have the circumstance that the debtor issued its obligations for a specific purpose with notice of the use to be made of them, which it recognized in writing on the face of the certificates themselves. The court below found, with all the effect of a jury’s verdict, that, “at the time of the issuing of these two certificates of deposit respectively, the president of the defendant company was told of the purpose for which these certificates when issued were to be used.” The evidence fully justified this finding. The bank could not defeat the purpose by subsequently advancing money to the payees. In addition, upon the face of the instruments themselves the bank had ihdicated that the state treasurer was to hold them. Under these circumstances, notice to the debtor arose the instant it executed the certificates. Any subsequent dealings between the parties could not impress upon the documents so held by the state treasurer something other than their tenor imported.

That decision is in no way controlling. No question of assignment or notice thereof was raised in that proceeding. The question there decided was whether the defendant’s general right of set-off was defeated by the fact that, as between the payee of the certificate and other third parties, it had become impressed with a trust. In that case there was serious doubt as to the integrity of the transaction between Brown &amp; Stevens and the Cosmopolitan Bank and it was determined that, under the peculiar circumstances which existed between the two banks, they were not depositors with depositors’ preferential status at all.
