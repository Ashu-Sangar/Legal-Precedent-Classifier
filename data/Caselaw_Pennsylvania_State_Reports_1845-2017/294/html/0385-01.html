Underwood is, and, for the past fourteen years, has been the controller. To assist in the performance of his official duties he has a deputy, a bookkeeper, a clerk and a solicitor. Deeming additional help necessary, he, on January 16, 1928, presented to the salary board, consisting of himself and the county commissioners (see section 7 of the Act of March 31, 1876, P. L. 13, 15), a motion, as follows : “That an extra employee be added to the force in the office of the county controller, to be known as an investigator, at a salary of $150 per month, for the purpose of investigating justice of the peace’s dockets, final estimates, delivering checks to employees, looking after matters pertaining to bridges, books, etc., and such other duties as might be suggested by the county controller.” There being no second to this motion, the chair declared it lost. From this, the controller took an appeal to the judges of the court of common pleas, as authorized <em>by </em>statute: Section 7 of the Act of <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>March 31, 1876, P. L. 13, 15, which provides, inter alia, “if, after such decision [by the salary board] is made, any officer shall think that the number of his clerks or deputies is too few or the compensation fixed for either is too small as the same may have been determined by the board, he may appeal from the action thereof to. the judge or judges of the court of common pleas of the county in which he is an officer, who shall hear and determine such appeal as promptly as possible, and their decision thereon shall be final.” The judges, after testimony taken, and upon due consideration, reversed the action of the salary board and allowed the additional employed, as a “clerk.” Prom the order so made, the county commissioners brought this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[259,1118,1155,1238]]]'>The appeal was properly taken to this court; the jurisdiction of the Superior Court being statutory, does not embrace such case. The Act of March 2, 1923, P. L. 3, enlarges the jurisdiction of that court, to include, inter alia, “Any action, claim, distribution, or dispute of any kind in the common pleas, at law or in equity, whether originating therein or reaching that court by appeal or certiorari from some other court or tribunal, if the subject of the controversy be either money, chattels, real or personal, or the possession of or title to real property, and if also the amount or value thereof really in controversy be not greater than twenty-five hundred dollars, exclusive of costs.” This, as to the subjects of jurisdiction is a reenactment of earlier statutes (see Act of May 5, 1899, P. L. 248), <em>and it </em>has been uniformly held not to include such a controversy as is here presented: See Nixon’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/48/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="48 Pa.

As to the help he may employ, section 14 of the Act of June 27, 1895, P. L. 403, provides: “The controller shall appoint a deputy controller and such other clerks as may be necessary, Avhose salaries shall be fixed by the commissioners and the controller, as provided by section seven of Act of thirty-first of March, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six.” More recent legislation authorizes him to appoint a solicitor (see Act of April 4, 1919, P. L. 37), but nowhere is he given the right to appoint an “investigator.” The trial judge realized this, but sought to come within the statute by designating him a “field clerk.” This cannot be done. The word “clerk” as employed in the statute must be given its usual meaning, as one engaged in some form of clerical work, like bookkeeping, copying, transcribingj letter writing, tabulating, etc. What the controller desires in the instant case is, in effect, (a) a detective to investigate and see <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>if the facts are correctly stated in the transcripts of magistrates, so as to prevent the county being illegally, burdened with costs, (b) an engineer to keep a check on road work and other public improvements and (c) a messenger to deliver checks to those on the county pay roll. Whether any man would have the time or ability for all these varied duties is not clear; certainly they are not clerical. In Bedford v. Rosser et al., <a href="/pa/283/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="283 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1090567" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0345-01">283 Pa. 345</a>, we hold, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Sadler, that, under the same statutes, the words “clerks” and “deputies” do not include an engineer, although designated a “coal clerk.” This is decisive of the present controversy. Somewhat similar limitations of the word “clerk” are found in other cases. For example, in Maginnis v. Schlottman, <a href="/pa/271/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="271 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="295714" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0305-01">271 Pa. 305</a>, it is held that an assistant district attorney is not a clerk within the meaning of the Constitution, affirming same case in <a href="/pa-super/76/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="76 Pa. Super. 124" data-case-ids="8860363" data-case-paths="/pa-super/76/0124-01">76 Pa. Superior Ct. 124</a>, and in Mulholland v. Wood, Brown &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/166/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="166 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="864254" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0486-01">166 Pa. 486</a>, it is held that a person employed to sell goods on commission is not a clerk within the meaning of the statute giving a preference to claims for wages.</p>

In the performance of the latter he may summon witnesses and documents, hold hearings and take testimony. Whether, in addition, he should have investigators to cover the county and collect data, is not so clear. If so, it should be authorized by the legislature. The question here is what assistance the legislature authorized for the county controller, not what it might or should have authorized, or the extent of his jurisdiction.</p>
