On this assignment appellant complains because the record of another case, between the present defendant and appellee’s employer as plaintiff, was not accepted in evidence on the trial of the present cause. Appellant frankly states in his history of the case that the sole purpose of the offer was to show “that the issue in this [the present] case is res judicata” because of the judgment in the other case.</p>
