McCormick was elected treasurer of Coal Township, in Northumberland County, for the term of five years beginning on the first Monday of January, 1926. He died February 24, 1928, and three days later appellee was chosen by the board of township commissioners to fill the vacancy. Subsequently, the district attorney of the county filed a suggestion in the court below, which thereupon issued a writ of quo warranto, in the name of the Commonwealth at his relation, requiring appellee “to show by what authority he exercises the rights and duties of the office of treasurer of Coal Township.” Five reasons are specified therein why he should be ousted from the office, none of which relates, however, to the duties he is to perform if rightfully occupying it. Hence, to these five matters we will limit ourselves in reviewing the action of the court below in dismissing the writ: Norristown v.

From at least as early as 1828 (Keyser v. M’Kissan, <a href="/rawle/2/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="2 Rawle 139" data-case-ids="1820636" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0139-01">2 Rawle 139</a>) to as late as 1926 (Solar Electric Co. v.

Superior Ct. 495</a>, 498) the appellate courts of this Commonwealth have held steadily to the rule that “the acts of public officers de facto, coming in by color of title, [whether or not entitled de jure], are good so far as respects the public, but void when for their own benefit”; and it is equally well settled that attacks upon the right of such incumbents to serve, must be made by the Commonwealth, in a direct proceeding for that purpose, and cannot be made collaterally: Com. v. McCombs, <a href="/pa/56/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="56 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1009204" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0436-01">56 Pa. 436</a>; Goldsworthy v.

Here, the commissioner, whose vote was objected to, was, admittedly, an officer de facto, holding under color of title, and, up to the time he voted for respondent, no direct attack had been made on his right to serve as commissioner. “Confusion worse confounded” would necessarily result from any other rule than as above stated; for, if the officer was a sole incumbent, none of his acts could be sustained, and this would be so, also, if he were one of several and his vote was necessary to make a majority. Consequently, before any one could safely rely on the acts of a public officer under such circumstances, an examination would have to be made regarding his citizenship, his residence, his payment of taxes, etc., etc.,, and the inquirer would have to take the risk of whatever conclusion might be reached on each and all of these matters.</p>

Before he answered, however, he resigned the office of solicitor, and elected to retain that of treas-surer. There is no claim of a statutory inhibition, but only, as set forth in Johnston v. Hennan, <a href="/pa-super/68/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="68 Pa. Super. 45" data-case-ids="630960" data-case-paths="/pa-super/68/0045-01">68 Pa. Superior Ct. 45</a>, that the offices were incompatible because “his interests as tax collector, in the settlement of his accounts [as treasurer], may become antagonistic to those of the school district, which he would be called upon to advise as solicitor.” In DeTurk v. Com., <a href="/pa/129/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="129 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="568043" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0151-01">129 Pa. 151</a>, 160, which was a case where one of the two incompatible offices held by respondent was derived from the federal government and the other from that of the state, it was said: “If the titles to these offices were derived from a common source, it might well be held that an acceptance of the second office was an implied resignation of the first. This is the common law rule, and the current of authority in this country sustains it.” True, these statements were obiter dicta, but elsewhere the law on the point is well settled: see 22 R. C. L. 418; 29 Cyc. 1382; Attorney General v. Oakman, <a href="/mich/126/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="126 Mich. 717" data-case-ids="1542184" data-case-paths="/mich/126/0717-01">126 Mich. 717</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20Am.%20St.%20Rep.%20574" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="86 Am.

We have said — and probably necessarily so because of article XII, section 2 of the state Constitution — that if a statute declares incompatibility, the penalty fixed by it, if any, will always be enforced: Com. v. Allen, <a href="/pa/70/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="70 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1028156" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0465-01">70 Pa. 465</a>; Com. v.

If however, as here, the incompatibility is not determined by a statute, but arises solely by reason of the fact that the duties of the two offices are such that it would be against public policy to permit one person to hold both of them, then the incumbent may elect which he will retain, and if he does this before answer filed, as he did here, the courts will dismiss a writ of quo war<a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>ranto theretofore issued to test his right to the office he elected to hold: DeTurk v. Com., supra. So, too, if in good faith he contests the question of incompatibility, his election may be made after it is finally determined to exist, and if he then declines or neglects to make it, the court must “determine which [office] he should be compelled to relinquish”: Com. v. Haesler, <a href="/pa/161/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="161 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="854143" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0092-01">161 Pa. 92</a>, 97. In neither of the two cases last cited was respondent’s titles to the offices he held derived from a common source; and hence, especially in view of what is said in the first of them, the common law rule may still apply, whenever, as here, they are so derived. It is not necessary to decide the point, however; for, if it does apply, then appellee having accepted the office of township treasurer, his act in so doing is “an implied resignation and vacation” of the office of township solicitor; and if it does not apply then he had the right to elect, as he did, to hold the office of township treasurer. Under either rule, therefore, this point must be decided in his favor.</p>
