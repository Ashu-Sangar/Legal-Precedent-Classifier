A nominal rental was named with provision for the pay<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>ment of a royalty for each ton taken out, dependent in amount on the sale price of the product. The contract provided, in part, as follows: “It is understood and agreed that this agreement shall continue for a period of six months from the date hereof and no longer...... Failure to make these payments of rental on demand, shall be deemed an abandonment of this agreement. All royalties which shall hereafter become due under the terms of this agreement shall be deemed and taken for all purposes as rents reserved under the laws of this Commonwealth relating to the relation of landlord and tenant and the parties of the first part [the present defendants] are hereby given all of the remedies under existing laws for the collection of such rentals, including the right of distress on any of the property of the parties of the second part [the plaintiffs] in or on said premises.” Actual operations upon the property continued beyond the time fixed, and the lessees held over and carried on their mining operations until March 1, 1925, when work ceased.</p>

Payment was refused, and, as a result, the lessors issued a writ of distress to recover the unsatisfied rental, causing to be seized a steam shovel worth $12,000. To secure possession of it, a writ of replevin was issued by the lessees. A bond was given, and the machinery retained by them. In the issue framed, the landlords were named as defendants, and to the statement of claim an affidavit of defense was filed, asserting the indebtedness for the unpaid royalties to the amount already mentioned. A replication of plaintiffs was interposed making counterclaims for various sums in excess of the unpaid rent, and a trial was had, resulting in a judgment for the lessors for the full amount, which the court below refused to set aside, and plaintiffs have appealed.</p>

      <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>Before considering the real controversies raised, it may be well, in view of the arguments submitted here, to note that the original contract was a lease for six months with the right to remove a certain tonnage of coal, and not a sale of all of that material in place. It conveyed the right to the temporary use and occupation of the land for a determinate period, with the right to remove a limited amount of material. It was merely a lease, and the royalty due was rent, for which a distress might be had (Greenough’s App., <a href="/pa/9/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="9 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="960655" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0018-01">9 Pa. 18</a>), and not a sale , of all the coal in place, as in Sturdevant v.

Since the relationship created was that of lessor and lessee, and the term was less than three years, the statute of frauds has no bearing on the case (Sheets v. Allen, <a href="/pa/89/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="89 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1063278" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0047-01">89 Pa. 47</a>; Cole v.

The plaintiffs must therefore be treated as tenants, and the defendants as landlords, having the right under their lease to distrain, which privilege they exercised.

First, the claim is made that the parties agreed, in June, 1924, that “the defendants would pay the plaintiffs one-half of the increased cost of production” of coal <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>to be taken from another point on the same tract of land, which was to be used, in the proportion of 40% with that already leased for a fixed royalty under the agreement of February 22, 1923, so that the mixture thus secured could be more advantageously marketed, and it is averred the additional outlay amounted to a designated sum. This was not an alteration of the royalty to be paid under the lease, but a distinct undertaking to make certain payments if other coal was also mined and used. Second, the attempt is to set-off the cost of repairs to a railroad, which it is insisted defendants “had agreed to pay,” — a separate transaction; and, third, that the lessors had promised.to reimburse for the expenditure for labor incident to the putting out of a mine fire. The total of all of these claims is in excess of the amount due for royalties under the lease upon which the distress proceeding was based.</p>
    <p id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[123,1288,1154,903]]]'>It was testified, against objection on this ground, that it was understood these sums were to be deducted from accruing rent, but no such averment appears in the pleadings, and no effort to amend them to thus permit proof of a parol modification of the royalty requirement in the original lease was made, and the evidence as to other promises than the independent agreements to pay certain sums, as set forth, should have been rejected. It will be noted further that, after June, 1924, when the supposed additional oral contracts to make certain allowances to the lessees were stipulated for, they continued to pay on the original royalty basis, and first made the suggestion that there was any sum due to them by reason of the parol understandings when the property was abandoned in March, 1925, and the right to set them off against royalties overdue for previous months was then asserted.</p>

These statements as to the weight to be accorded to the proof are now complained of by appellants, and we think properly so. There was no attempt to establish a contemporaneous parol agreement, omitted by fraud, accident or mistake, but to prove a later understanding arrived at, and not to vary or contradict the original lease. “It is always competent for the parties to a written contract to show that it was subsequently abandoned, in whole or in part, modified, changed, or a new one substituted”: Holloway v.

The learned trial judge laid down too stringent a rule, and plaintiffs have just reason to complain of the instructions given, and, were it not for the fact that we deem the error harmless, since appellants were not entitled to a verdict under the evidence, a new venire would have to be granted.

The very words of the Defalcation Act make it inapplicable, for it is clear that the replevin is not an action commenced by the lessor, nor is it a suit based on a “debt, bargain or assumption” by the landlord, but rather on a tortious taking by him.

And it is further true that, under our system of administering the laws, an equitable defense may often be successfully made to a legal demand even when the latter is sought to be enforced in one of the ancient common law forms of action. But these principles must be understood and applied in the light of those other and fundamental ones which determine the suitor in the selection of an appropriate remedy, and guide and control the practice and procedure through which that remedy is made effective. It has been the aim of the law, during the ages through which it has been slowly evolved, to develop, not one remedy for all wrongs, but an appropriate remedy for every wrong. Although our legislature, in recent years, has made some changes in the procedure incident to an action of replevin, the nature and purpose of the action remain what they were a century ago.”</p>
