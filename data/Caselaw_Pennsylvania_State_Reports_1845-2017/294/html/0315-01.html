    <p id="b341-6" data-blocks='[["BL_341.8",341,[119,1010,1153,317]]]'>The plaintiff, Joseph, was injured at a grade crossing of defendant’s railroad on July 29, 1924, and suffered injury for which compensation was asked in the proceeding now before us for review. A verdict was rendered in his favor, which the court below refused to set aside, and from the judgment entered this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b341-7" data-blocks='[["BL_341.9",341,[121,1338,1154,1079]],["BL_342.1",342,[283,346,1155,317]]]'>Briefly stated, the salient facts shown by the record are as follows: Sado, the owner of an automobile, intended to drive to the Town of Morgan on a business trip. The plaintiff wished to reach the same point to deliver an electric sweeper to a customer, and Sado offered to take him along. The car was driven on an improved highway to a cross-road leading to their destination. The latter passed over the single-track railroad of the defendant. Reaching the diverging driveway, about nine in the morning, on the day in question, the automobile was turned practically at right-angles to the south, and onto the dirt thoroughfare. Knowing of the track in front, the automobile was stopped, according to plaintiff’s testimony, about ten feet from the first rail, and both driver and guest looked and listened, but neither heard nor saw a train approaching. It was then started forward, and though admittedly a view of the track to the west was unobstructed for from 525 to 600 feet, and the day was bright and clear, no engine or cars were observed. The grade to the crossing was steep, but the car, <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>traveling at five miles an hour, as was- testified, would not have required more than two or three seconds to reach the first rail. The train, moving at forty miles an hour, could not have arrived at the point of collision,, after coming within the line of vision, until practically eight or nine seconds had gone by.</p>
    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[277,676,1154,1009]]]'>Though beyond question within sight for the distance mentioned, the plaintiff, who was looking, as he stated, did not see the oncoming engine until it had reached a point from forty to sixty feet distant, or, as the driver said, 200 feet away. At that time the front wheels of the auto had just reached the first rail. Joseph then told Sado to “hurry up” for the train was coming, but the crossing was not cleared in time, and the accident happened. If the occupants of the car failed to observe the train, they were not looking, or had determined to run the risk of passing in front of it. Tlxe few feet from the place of stopping was on an eighteen per cent upgrade, and, with a car moving at not more than five miles an hour, it could have been brought to a standstill almost instantaneously, if cognizance had been taken of the apparent danger. Instead, the automobile went forward and had reached only the first rail, when both driver and passenger admit they observed the oncoming train.</p>

Though disputed, the testimony submitted to establish this fact in qxxestion was sufficient to carry the case to the jury to decide the controversy raised, and, if it were the only matter involved, the finding of a failure to give a proper signal and the verdict rendered could be sustained, but, under all of the facts presented, the apparent contributory negligence of the plaintiff made binding instructions for the defendant imperative. In our consideration of the case all of the competent testimony offered by the plaintiff must be regarded as disclosing the true <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>version of the occurrence. The claimant is likewise entitled to the benefit of all proper inferences which may be drawn therefrom in his favor (Grimes v. P. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/289/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="289 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1103349" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0320-01">289 Pa. 320</a>), and, in discussing the relative rights of the parties, the record has been examined with this principle in view.</p>
    <p id="b343-5" data-blocks='[["BL_343.5",343,[136,664,1158,1137]]]'>Appellant first raises the question as to whether Joseph must be considered as a guest of the driver Sado. It will be remembered that the latter had invited the former to accompany him on the journey, and there was no evidence that Sado was the agent of plaintiff to take him to the designated point, as in Hepps v. P. &amp; L. E. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/284/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="284 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="1091997" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0479-01">284 Pa. 479</a>, referred to by appellant, nor was there testimony to prove the parties were engaged upon a common purpose, so as to make the so-called “guest” rule inapplicable. To charge with contributory negligence on the ground that the party injured was engaged in a joint undertaking, something more must be shown than that the parties were riding together. It must further appear that the passenger had some voice in the control of the vehicle, so as to make it subject to common command, as well as possession. In itself, the mere acceptance of an invitation to ride for pleasure (or as an accommodation) does not ordinarily constitute a joint enterprise, because there is no equal right in governing the conduct of the undertaking: Alperdt v. Paige, <a href="/pa/292/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="292 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1109626" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0001-01">292 Pa. 1</a>, 6.</p>

He ordinarily is not concerned with the operating of the car and cannot be viewed as joining with the driver in its operation merely from the fact that he happens to be an occupant of the machine. He is, of course, not without responsibility in the matter and must be held accountable if he assumes the risk of a danger which he knows exists or remains silent in the face of a known danger and fails to warn the driver of its existence. When dangers, which are either reasonably manifest or known to an invited guest, confront the driver of a vehicle, and the guest has an adequate and proper opportunity to control or influence the situation for safety, if he sits by without <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>warning or protest and permits himself to be driven carelessly to his injury, this is negligence which will bar recovery: Minnich v.

Co., supra, p. 296: “It would seem that the rule to be deduced from the authorities is that the guest will be held responsible for his action or failure to act in the face of a danger of which he knew, or where it can reasonably be inferred that he must have realized the peril.” Joseph, in the present case, not only had opportunity to observe the oncoming train, but testified that he was looking out for it as the car approached the crossing. Though he must have seen it when more than 500 feet away, if his story is true, he did not do so until it was but 40 to 60 feet distant, and then expressly undertook to give the driver instructions to “hurry up.” This brings his conduct within the line of that condemned in Hill v.

P. R. R. Co., supra. Though obliged to look not only to the west but also to the east, and “he could not make both observations at one time, [yet] the head can be turned in the fraction of a second, and......it is time beyond a doubt that the merest glance, with attention, to the [west] would have shown [plaintiff] the approach of the train which subsequently struck [the] motor, almost immediately upon the entrance on the ......track”: Provost v.

It will not do for plaintiff to say that he did not see the engine until within from 40 to 60 feet, when the physical facts show this to be untrue, if attentive, as he claims.
