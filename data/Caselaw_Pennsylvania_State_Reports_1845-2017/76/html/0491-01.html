The next and the most important question for you to decide, is whether the defendant got this oil. If'it was delivered to him, did he get it ? did it belong to somebody else, and did he convert it to his own use. Unless the -defendant got that oil, it not being his, and converted it to his own use, took it, he could not he held liable in an action of trover, because it all turns on the wrongful conversion of the oil. That he took it, it not being his property — on that point, you have evidence on both sides. The evidence of the plaintiffs follows the three cars of oil down on to the siding of the defendant; and Mr. Creighton testifies that he had a conversation with Mr. Waring, in which Waring said that these three car loads of oil, referring to these missing cars, just made them whole; that they were three cars short. That is the testimony of the plaintiffs in brief, and that' testimony must satisfy you that the cars were put there by mistake, and that the oil was converted, taken and used up, by the defendant, it not belonging to him. On the other hand, Mr. Waring testifies that he did not get that oil, that he was at the works almost every day, or every day in the month, it is alleged to have been delivered: that he had bills of lading or consignments, and that none of these car numbers were on those bills; that although he may have gotten three cars, he did not get these.

Plead. 146. The talcing may have been lawful, hence the gist of the action lies in the wrongful conversion. Where one has the lawful possession of the goods of another, and has not converted them, this action will not lie until there has been a refusal to deliver them upon demand made. Ordinarily where such goods have been converted by the bailee, the law presumes it to be wrongful, and the action may be brought without a previous demand; but such presumption may be rebutted, showing a permission from the plaintiff to convert the property. So we may suppose a case of this kind: A. purchased a ton of wheat flour from B., a miller, B. delivers to A. a ton of wheat flour belonging to C., and A. converts it to his own use. Now it cannot be that B., as bailee of C., can maintain trover against A., without first explaining to him the mistake, and demanding of him a return of C.’s flour; for here the conversion is not wrongful, but permissive, there being nothing in the transactions which would lead A. to suppose that he had gotten any but his own property.</p>
    <p id="b496-8" data-blocks='[["BL_496.9",496,[276,1433,1156,429]]]'>This example will apply to the case in hand. The defendant offered to prove that he had received from the railroad company no more car loads of oil than he was entitled to. This, as we understand the offer, not by way of recoupment, which was not permissible, but to show that he received the oil in good faith, supposing it to be his own. By his subsequent offers, he proposed to prove, that if he received the oil in dispute at all, it was by a delivery from the plaintiffs’ agents; if there was an error, it was produced by the plaintiffs, and finally that the defendant received the property “at the instance and request of the plaintiffs.”</p>
    <p id="b496-9" data-blocks='[["BL_496.10",496,[276,1861,1150,86]]]'>The offers should not have been overruled. Had the proof therein proposed been produced, it is clear the plaintiffs had no case.</p>

We observe no error in the charge, or in the answer to the points. Under the evidence, as admitted, they were correct. A wrongful conversion of the oil in question by the defendant, would sustain the action, and if he, or the firm of which he was a member, knowingly took advantage of the mistake of the plaintiffs’ agents, and appropriated the property of another to the use of the firm, it wmuld be such a conversion. This is the substance of the charge, and is, so far as it goes, a sound exposition of the law.</p>
