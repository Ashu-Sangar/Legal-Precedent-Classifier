It becomes then of importance for the jury to determine what this malice is that constitutes a felonious killing murder. It is of two kinds — express malice or implied malice. It is express when the killing is the result of personal ill-feeling and hatred or enmity towards the party killed. Implied when the killing takes place under such circumstances of atrocity that show a wicked and malicious disposition in-the perpetrator, a heart wicked and depraved, bent upon mischief and void of social duty, as for instance, when the killing shows that it was done out of pure wantonness or recklessness, or that there was an absence of sufficient provocation [or it was done in the perpetration of some felony, in such case the law implies malice and the killing is murder. Manslaughter is defined to be the felonious killing of another without malice, either express- or implied, and is of two kinds, voluntary and involuntary. Yoluntary, as when one in the heat of passion, excited by reasonable provocation, kills another, and involuntary, when one in the perpetration of some unlawful act, not amounting to a felony, or the perpetration of a lawful act in an unlawful way by accident kills another.] In both kinds of manslaughter it will be readily seen that the malice which constitutes the essential element of murder is wanting. These are the distinctions which are made by the common law in all cases of felonious homicide, and there is a broad line of demarcation between <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>each grade of offence depending upon its greater or less degree of heinousness.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b331-6" data-blocks='[["BL_331.5",331,[228,452,1166,1815]]]'>“ But in Pennsylvania the law makes an additional distinction; it divides murder into two degrees — murder in the first, and murder in the second degree, both degrees still preserving the essential element which distinguishes murder from manslaughter, to wit: malice. The statute of this state upon this subject reads as follows: ‘ All murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison or by lying in wait, or any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditate'd killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration of or the attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery or burglary, shall be deeemed murder in the first degree, and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second degree.’ Therefore, before a jury could convict of murder in the first degree, they must first be satisfied from the evidence in the cause that the killing was done either by poison, or by lying in wait, or was done wilfully, deliberately and premeditatedly, or in perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate any of the felonies mentioned in this statute. Even if the circumstances of the killing should show that it was not done deliberately and premeditatedly, yet if it were done either in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate any of the felonies mentioned, the party would be guilty of murder in the first degree, for he would come within the very words of the statute. If the jury should be satisfied not only that the killing was thus done, but that it was also done with deliberation and premeditation, the offence would come doubly under the description of murder in the first degree, as defined in the statute, and the party might be considered in a sense as doubly guilty. The statute of Pennsylvania defines murder in the second degree in no other way than by saying that all murder which is not murder in the first degree is murder in the second degree. Therefore, while in murder in the second degree there is still the ingredient of malice as we have before explained: it either lacks the combined elements of wilfulness, deliberation and premeditation, or else was not done in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate any of the felonies mentioned. Murder in the second degree, while not perhaps capable of precise definition, may be said to be a felonious, malicious killing, in which the specific intent to take life is wanting. Then the deliberate, premeditated intention is not present, but the malice is, as when a person out of ill-will, not intending to kill, but only to inflict bodily harm, should kill another, here the intention to kill being wanting, the offence is reduced to murder in the second degree, and the malice or ill-will being present, constitutes the crime murder instead of manslaughter.</p>

The rule of law is this: That if the confession is voluntary, not drawn out,either by the influence of hope or fear held out to him, then it is properly in evidence, and its weight and importance to be considered by the jury. But if the confession is not voluntary, but has been drawn out either by the hope of favor or forced out by threats, then it is to be entirely rejected. The law does not permit confessions extracted in such a way to be given in evidence, for fear that, not being voluntary, they are untrue, and for the purpose of discouraging attempts at entrapping defendants into admissions of their own guilt. [We therefore call your attention to the evidence as to the fact whether these confessions were voluntary or not.] You have the testimony of the two witnesses who were present, as to what was said by way of evidence at the time the alleged confession to Kaereher was made. This is the testimony of Kaereher himself and the testimony of Ewing. Kaereher swears that he did not say to the prisoner that he had better tell, and words to that effect; that he had only told him he might as well tell now as any other time, and that he had been cautioned by Ewing in the presence of Brown that he should make no promises and hold out no inducements to the prisoner. Ewing’s testimony corroborates Kaereher’s in this, that he told Kaereher in Brown’s presence that he should make no promises. [If the jury should find that the expressions used were as Kaereher swears they were, or that, by reason of the caution given by Ewing, that the effect of any promise or threats was done away with in the mind of the defendant, then we think the confession of Bi’own was properly received in evidence, and should be given that weight with the jury to which they may think it entitled.] But <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>if, on the other hand, the jury should think that this was not the true state of the case, but that the defendant was told that it would be better for him to tell whose money it was, or who was along with him, or that he was told that he had better tell whose money it was, and who popped the old man over, and that he might get off, or they would let him go clear, as Mr. Bechtel swears Kaercher told him he had said to the prisoner, then we say to the jury that they are to disregard and throw entirely out of consideration any confessions so elicited by the flattery of hope held out to the defendant, except so much as may have been said by the defendant before the promise was held out to him, and also except as to that part of his confession which revealed the hidden place of the money over the door in his father’s barn, and which was found there by the officers in consequence of this confession. If, however, the jury should come to the conclusion that this confession was not elicited by any inducement or promises so held out, then it is properly to be considered by them as part of the evidence in the case. The Commonwealth does not claim that these declarations in confessions are true; on the contrary, they have produced witnesses here to prove their falsity in many particulars. [We are free to say to the jury that, had the evidence been clear that these declarations had been so elicited, either by promises held out or by threats made, we should have ruled them out, and not have permitted them to go to the jury as part of the evidence in the case. The jury must judge in the midst of the conflict of testimony from all the evidence in the case, whether the declarations to Ewing and Kaercher were voluntary or not. If not voluntary, as we have before explained them, they should not be considered by the jury as part of the evidence in case.] * * * “ It is always to be borne in mind that when a party is charged with a crime the burden is upon the Commonwealth to prove him guilty. If the Commonwealth fails in this, then the defendant is entitled to a verdict of- acquittal, for the presumption of innocence surrounds him until he is stripped of it by the evidence produced against him. It must further be borne in mind by the jury that the Commonwealth must prove him guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. If from the facts in evidence such doubt arise as to the guilt of the defendant, then the jury must give him the benefit of that doubt. The law does not seek the conviction of any person who may be innocent, and therefore it says if there is a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, then the jury must acquit. This doubt should be such an one as grows out of the facts and circumstances of the case; such an one as causes the mind honestly to hesitate in its belief in the guilt of a party. [There is but one count in the indictment, and that is a count for murder; the jury under that count may either acquit the defendant altogether, or they may find him guilty of murder in the first degree, <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>or murder in the second degree; and therefore, if you find him guilty at all, you will state in your verdict the degree of guilt.] We submit the case to you, feeling conscious that your verdict, whatever it be, will be according to the law and the evidence. The case has been long and tedious, and no doubt has tried your patience ; but we exhort you to give it cool, careful and prayerful deliberatign, and render your verdict accordingly. If you should be satisfied that the defendant is guilty, then, under the oath you have taken, it will be your duty to say so; if, however, you are not satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt of his guilt, then you should acquit the prisoner.” * * <em>*</em>

Kraemer, a farmer of reputed wealth, aged about sixty years, and his wife, were murdered on his farm in Washington township, Schuylkill county. She was found on the next morning lying across her bed insensible and partially undressed, but afterwards became conscious and able to state some of the circumstances of that night, and died on the 4th of March following. Her son, living away from home, who first found her, ran to give the alarm, and on his way discovered the dead body of his father lying at a distance from the house of about three hundred yards. Near him was found a heavy oak club covered with blood and hair. The wounds on the head of both husband and wife were such as this weapon would probably make, and were of a fatal character. The chest, bureau and desk in the house had been broken open, and evidenced that the perpetrator of the murders had been in pursuit of plunder. The only inmate of the house, beside Mr. and Mrs. Kraemer, was her mother, a lady so old, deaf, blind and helpless that she could furnish no information. All the circumstances evidenced that the murders and the search for money were contemporaneous and part of the transaction.</p>

Of the forty-six assignments of error, only a few present questions of substance. Many are unsubstantial, others are technical, and some are unsupported by the requisite evidence. We shSll notice those only we think deserving, and shall group many of them together.</p>
    <p id="b336-6" data-blocks='[["BL_336.6",336,[262,754,1158,1032]]]'>The first subject of remark are the objections to the jurors. In Dyott <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/whart/5/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Whart. 67" data-case-ids="8877346" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0067-01">5 Whart. 67</a>, it was held that after a prisoner stands mute, a plea of not guilty is entered for him and he participates in the trial and is convicted, the case falls within the provisions of the Act of 21st of February 1814, enacting that a trial on the merits, or pleading guilty on the general issue, shall be a waiver of all errors and defects in or appertaining to the precept, venire, drawing, summoning and returning of the jurors. This decision resulted from the language of the Act of 2Sd September 1791, relating to prisoners standing mute or challenging peremptorily more than the allowable number of jurors, that the trial shall proceed in the same manner as if the prisoner had pleaded not guilty, and put himself for trial on the country. We do not think this decision is applicable to a case where the prisoner makes his objections at first to the panel of jurors, and on their being overruled, takes a proper bill of exceptions; but the decision is strongly illustrative of the unwillingness of courts to sustain objections to the jury, grand or petit, after a full and fair trial on the merits. It is therefore sufficient to say, as to the first and eighth assignments of error to the refusal of the court to quash the array of the grand and the petit jurors, that the objections of the prisoner were squarely traversed by the Commonwealth by plea, while the bill of exceptions contains no evidence of their truth. We must presume the court had sufficient ground to refuse'the challenge.</p>
    <p id="b336-7" data-blocks='[["BL_336.7",336,[262,1786,1156,602]],["BL_337.1",337,[239,359,1154,305]]]'>The second, third, fourth and fifth errors raise the single question whether, upon a challenge to the polls of grand jurors, the prisoner will be permitted to examine them on their <em>voir dire </em>to support his objections. The court was willing to receive other proof. As to petit jurors, who try the prisoner, and therefore should be above all exception, the rule is to permit them to be examined on'their <em>voir dire </em>to prove objections to their competency. But the reason does not hold good as to the grand jurors, who do not try the prisoner, but merely inquire on the evidence of the Commonwealth alone, whether there is sufficient probable ground of the commission of the offence charged in the indictment laid before them. It would be impossible to conduct the business of the Courts of Quarter Sessions and' Oyer and Terminer, if every person indicted for an offence could claim the right of polling the <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>grand jurors on their <em>voir dire </em>in order to purge the panel. Indictments for murder may be found in the Quarter Sessions and certified into the Oyer and Terminer. A due regard for public policy, as well as for the interests of justice and the nature of the inquiry, forbids that grand jurors should be polled and tried in this manner. If the prisoner have evidence to purge the panel, let him produce it.</p>
    <p id="b337-6" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[238,662,1154,216]]]'>6th assignment. That a bill of indictment may be sent up to the grand jury by the attorney-general, or now, by the district attorney, with the sanction of the court, is shown in McCullough <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 17 P. F. Smith 30. It does not appear that the bill before us was sent up surreptitiously.</p>
    <p id="b337-7" data-blocks='[["BL_337.6",337,[236,877,1156,638]]]'>10th assignment. The 41st section of the Criminal Procedure Act of March 31st 1860, is a summary (say the codifiers) of the 144th, 145th, 146th, 147th and' 148th sections of the Act of 14th April 1834, which are left unrepealed: 1 Brightly, note c, p. 385; The venire awarded under 147th section makes no distinction between the bystander and persons in the county at large. Nor does the 41st section of the Act of 1860 make a discrimination. There is no ground, therefore, to support a distinction, and it certainly infringes no rule of right or of policy to hold that, under an order of talesmen, the venire must issue generally and not specially to summon the bystanders only, or specially for persons from the body of the county only. Under the Criminal Procedure Act, the sheriff may summon the talesmen from either or both. The expression, <em>tales de ciroumstantibus, </em>was evidently intended to include both.</p>
    <p id="b337-8" data-blocks='[["BL_337.7",337,[234,1525,1159,859]]]'>The 14th and 15th assignments relate to the evidence of finding the body of Daniel M. Kraemer three hundred yards from the house; the condition of the chest, bureau and desk, and the fact that a large sum in silver and gold was known to the prisoner to be in the house. That the commission of a distinct offence, even similar in character, cannot be given in evidence against the prisoner, was held in Shaffner <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, decided at Harrisburg in 1872 (22 P. F. Smith 60). But when two persons are murdered at the same time and place, and under circumstances evidencing that both acts were committed by the same person or persons, and were part of one and the same transaction or <em>res gestee, </em>and tend to throw light on the motive and manner of the murder for which the prisoner is indicted, the case is different. Such was the case here. The club found near to the husband being the probable instrument of the death of the wife also, and the motive, to wit, robbery, being one and the same, which led to the murder of both at the same time. Being parts of the same <em>res gestee, they, </em>together, tend to throw light on each other, and there is no reason that the truth should be thrown out by excluding the evidence objected to.</p>

When we consider that Kraemer was a farmer living in the country remote from a place of safe deposit, and was unused to the ways of men living in town; that it was a period of suspension of specie payments, when silver and gold seek hiding-places in the chests, drawers and desks of such men as he, and often remain hidden for years ; we cannot say the time when he and his wife received the coin was too remote, and its possession on the night of the murder impossible. The prisoner was the son of a neighboring farmer, and was without means of his own. The possession of coin and exchanging it for paper-money and purchase of clothing, on the next day, at Potts-ville, were significant circumstances, while the evidence of his identity as the person exchanging the coin in Pottsville, might require the testimony of many witnesses and many circumstances to make the proof complete. We discover no error in these assignments.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[265,1069,1152,169]]]'>23d assignment. The fact that a witness was examined in a certain prosecution is a matter independent of the record!

    <p id="b338-6" data-blocks='[["BL_338.6",338,[266,1239,1149,300]]]'>The most important question which arose in the trial was that to which the 28th, 29th and 30th assignments relate, to wit, the admissibility of the so-called confessions of the prisoner to John J. Kaercher. But we meet an insurmountable obstacle to its decision in the fact that the testimony of Kaercher, and of the witnesses called to show the influence used to obtain the confessions, has not been made a part of the bills of exception.</p>

We cannot say that he subsequently erred in submitting it to the jury on the evidence, to say whether any improper influence was. used, and in charging them, if there were any, that they should disregard the confessions. This did the prisoner no harm, and might, if true, have availed him much. It is proper also to add that the disclosures drawn from the prisoner were, rather deductions of certain specific facts than confessions of guilt. It is true that these facts were links in the chain of circumstances to convict the prisoner, and therefore his admissions were to be strictly guarded against any improper influence used to obtain them, but they stand lower in the degree of evidence than actual confessions of guilt. A damaging fact’ may be admitted without any intention to confess guilt.</p>

It was a question whether the prisoner was the guilty one who took the lives of this aged couple; but there was no question that the homicide was a foul and devilish murder, committed- for- the purpose of robbery.
