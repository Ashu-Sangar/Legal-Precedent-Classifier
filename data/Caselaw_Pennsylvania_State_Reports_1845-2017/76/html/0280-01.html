We cannot see that the case was helped by the offer to prove that the woman was induced to take, in lieu of money, a note upon her husband, for the note belonged to her as much as the cash would have done, had it been paid; and so far as he was concerned — as has been well said by the judge who tried the case — there was merely a change of creditors. In the case of Johnson <em>v. </em>Fritz, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20449" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Wright 449">8 Wright 449</a>, it was proved that the husband actually received part of the purchase-money paid to his wife, and hence it was held that he was estopped from claiming his curtesy in the land. For my own part, I think this case carries the doctrine of estoppel quite as far as it should go; nevertheless, did the offer come within this ruling, it would determine the question in favor of the plaintiff in error; but it does not. There is nothing in the offer which proposes to show <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>that the plaintiff derived any benefit whatever from the sale, and we cannot presume that he did.</p>
