The testator had made provision in part at least for his children during their minority, by directing that the annuity of $4500 to his wife, should be for the support of herself and the board of the children during their minority. Were the children at the termination of their minority to he cut off from all support until the death of their mother ? It will be observed that no provision was made for the clothing or education of the children during their minority by the bequest of the annuity to his wife. It was limited to the support of herself and the <em>hoard </em>of the children during their minority. It will be remembered also that two of these children were daughters, and little capable, probably, of providing a maintenance for themselves. Would it then in view of these facts be a safe construction of this devise to say that the testator intended that his children should have no clothing or education during their minority, and that they should not come into possession of the very large residuary estate which he left them until after the death of their mother, and only then contingent on their surviving her ? If he meant this, he is supposed to have foreseen the possibility of his wife surviving him nearly half a century; during which time his children would he wholly unprovided for, except for their hoard during their minority. To give this construction to the will, the words of it should he so direct and decisive, or so clearly referable to no other construction of it, as to enable the court to say with reasonable certainty that this was the intention of the testator.</p>

A few of the reasons leading to this conclusion are these. The word “ <em>then </em>” in the clause refers to no distinct time by grammatical construction or manifest intention. Its reference is to be discovered rather by the subject of the item, and the intention drawn from the whole will. Had the subject of the fifth item been wholly the same property devised and bequeathed to the widow for life, the subject itself would have indicated her death as the period of vesting in the children. But it is obvious that the property disposed of in the fifth item embraced the entire remainder of the testator’s estate. When he determined to settle his worldly affairs, he purposed to dispose of all his estate. He began by providing for his_ wife, and when he had finished that provision his mind evidently turned in the fifth item to making a provision for his children. They were very young; he himself was a young man, in good health, and with a prospect of much longer life than that which awaited him. It was natural he should think it would be years before his own death, while some of his children might die before him. His mind taking in the scope of these circumstances would naturally run forward to the distant period which rose to his view, and he would seek to settle his estate according to the circumstances as they thus appeared to him, by willing all the "remainder of his estate, not given to his wife, to those of his children who should be living at his death ; and therefore he devised and bequeathed this remainder to all of his children who should be then living. The sentence is evidently elliptical, not coming up to the fulness of his thought.</p>

The intent in the fifth item interpreted along with the sixth item, to provide an immediate estate for his children at his death, is inconsistent with an intent to suffer their estate to become ambulatory until the widow’s death, if that be the period referred <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>to by the word “then.” The expression “then” being obscure in reference, all the other considerations arise which give a preference to a vested estate instead of one that is contingent, and to furnish a substantial provision for the education and clothing of his children in addition to their boarding: otherwise his provision for them would be illusory, and a large amount of his estate left without any useful or proper disposition of it during the lifetime of his wife.</p>
