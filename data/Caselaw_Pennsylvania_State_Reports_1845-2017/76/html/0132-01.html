It need not be in writing — any information coming from parties interested, and whose duty it is to give it, and certain to a reasonable intent, will suffice. When the endorser lives elsewhere than at the place fixed for payment, notice by mail may be given. It may be given verbally and personally, or in writing, and left at his place of business or dwelling. If it can be shown that it was <em>actually </em>received by the endorser in due time, when in writing, there is no difficulty; but when this cannot be done, then rules have been established, which if complied with, are considered equivalent to notice, although notice may never have reached him. Actual notice dispenses with the ordinary formal requirements: Hallowell &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Curry <em>et al., <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20322" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Wright 322">5 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20322" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Wright 322">Wright 322</a>.

Could a purchaser, who had received notice of a trust, on Sunday, written or spoken, say, he knew it not, on account of the day, and therefore be discharged ? Now, it is found as a fact, that the teller told him that the envelope contained notice of the protest of the Leeds draft. He had knowledge of the fact, both verbally and in writing. That under our Sunday law, all contracts made on that day are to be considered as not made at all, is conceded, and had the 1st January 1871 (Sunday) been the last day the plaintiff had for giving this notice, it would have amounted to nothing, for he was not bound to open it on Sunday, and the authorities say it is to be considered as received on Monday: Parsons on Notes and Bills, ed. of 1873, p. 515, vol. 1, and he cites Wright <em>v. </em>Shaw-cross, 2 B. &amp; Aid. 501, note; Bray <em>v. </em>Hawden, 5 Maulé &amp; S. .68; Diblieux <em>v. </em>Bullard, 1 Rob. (La.) 66, where the notice was given on the 4th July. Martin, J., said it might be given on Sunday. ‘ If a holiday or Sunday intervenes it is not counted, but adds one more day of allowable delay. If notice is received on Saturday it need not be forwarded until by some mail on Monday, even if there is a Sunday mail.’ Then plaintiff had Monday, the 2d January 1871, to give the notice, and inasmuch as defendant was in possession of the envelope containing said notice (and was told so by the teller) on that Monday, he was duly notified that the draft was protested. Had a post-carrier delivered the envelope on Sunday it would suffice; but then that would be good on the ground that it was duly posted, and he bound, though he never received it. Nor do we rest our conclusions on the ground that he might have declined receiving the letter, and by receiving waived irregularity, because the statute was not his to waive. But we place his liability solely on the ground that on Monday, the 2d day of January 1871, that day being in good time, ho had in his possession a notice of the protest of the draft in suit, and knew that he had it. Had the envelope fallen from the clouds, or been carried to him in the mouth of a fish, like the tribute for Caesar, with the direct information from the teller of the bank, plaintiff, ‘this is the notice of the protest of the Leeds draft,’ he would have been fixed for the money, because the whole purpose of the notice is to inform him of non-payment.</p>

In Barker <em>v. </em>Hopkins, 7 Barr 472, a bond void because executed on Sunday, was used as an <em>admission </em>of liability, and Coulter, J., there says, a man may acknowledge the truth on Sunday, and he knew of no rule preventing its being given in evidence against him; that if a man writes a letter on Sunday, and sends it to his creditor,'who gets it on Monday, or <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>even takes it from the office on Sunday, he presumes that it would be competent evidence against the debtor. He further adds, “ We cannot carry the law so far as to say, that the admission of a previously existing debt, made on the Sabbath, is not good.” And in Uhler <em>v. </em>Applegate, 2 Casey 140, it was held that an agreement though made on Sunday, and void as an executory contract or agreement, yet the payment of the money afterwards, and its receipt by the obligee, constituted a new contract, which was binding on the parties. Defendant was not bound to open and read the notice on that Sunday; the law gave him until Tuesday, the 3d January 1871, to notify the parties to whom he would look for indemnity; but being in <em>possession </em>of the notice on Monday was all the law required, and how he came by it is not material, so that he had it. We are not unmindful of Stern’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20447" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="14 Smith &amp; H. 447">14 Smith 447</a>, where it was held that an order to the sheriff, given verbally on Sunday, to resume action on a suspended execution, did not create a lien on the defendant’s goods nor give precedence; and that the sheriff was not bound to receive such order on Sunday, for if he was, then he must keep his office open on that day. It is enough to observe that this order required the sheriff to <em>act, </em>and this he was not bound to do on Sunday. Rut had a written order been handed him on Sunday, which was in his hands on Monday following, and he knew its purport from the person handing it, could he have said that he was not bound to act ?

We are <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>not called upon to discuss the policy of these statutes, but the legislature in the unquestionable exercise of their constitutional power have enacted that one day in seven, the first day of the week, shall be a day of rest, when all worldly employment and business shall be intermitted. By the Act of 1705, § 4, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Smith%20%26%20H.%2025" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Smith &amp; H. 25">1 Smith 25</a>, no person or persons upon the first day of the week shall serve or execute or cause to be served or executed any writ, precept, warrant, order, judgment or decree, except in case of treason, felony or breach of the peace; but the serving of any such writ, precept, warrant, order, judgment or decree shall be void to all intents and purposes whatever. And the Act of April 22d 1794, § 1, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20177" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Smith &amp; H. 177">3 Smith 177</a>, imposes a penalty upon any person who shall do or perform any worldly employment or business whatever on the Lord’s day, commonly called Sunday (works of necessity and charity excepted). It was said in Stern’s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 450, that judicial business in civil cases, done on Sunday, is violative of the common law. The notice from the attorney of the party to the sheriff in that case was not an order within the letter of the Act of 1705, though it is so termed in the case. It was a mere notice to him to proceed according to his duty under the writ of execution already in his hands. It cannot, I think, be doubted that any other notice by party or counsel in the course of legal proceedings would be equally ineffectual. Nor would it be necessary that a suit should be actually pending. Notices are often required to fix the liability of a party. Thus notice to a magistrate before commencing a suit against him for any act done by him in virtue of his office surely could not be served upon him on Sunday. Nor would it matter that it would have been in time if served on the following day. To fix an endorser with legal liability, a notice of non-payment is required. It is a step in the legal proceedings, though before the commencement of the suit. The party was not bound to receive or notice such a communication. It is against the spirit of the Act of 1705, to permit it to have any effect. Besides it was a part of the worldly employment or business of the teller of the bank, directly violative of the Act of 1794, an unlawful act on his part, and fell within the prohibition of that statute.</p>

The mere taking of the notice from his hands in silence, though informed of what it was, cannot be construed into an agreement to accept it and a waiver of the irregularity. We must be careful not to open the door to exceptions which will fritter away the plain provisions of the law. Especially is it in the construction of written statutes that hard cases have made bad precedents. Thus wé have seen the Statute of Uses, of Frauds and Perjuries, and of Limitations, almost judicially repealed, by exceptions gradually introduced by construction. In such cases it is a safe rule, <em>obsta principiis.</em>
