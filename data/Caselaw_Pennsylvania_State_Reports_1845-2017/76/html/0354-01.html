He can certainly convey the fee simple, but it will be subject to the widow’s estate in dower; so that we answer that the executor cannot make an out and out title. It appears that there has been a sale to John Stouffer, for $3300. The only way to make an out and out title is for the widow to release her right of dower, and take a mortgage for a sum to be paid her annually, equal to the interest on half the purchase-money during her life.</p>

We answer, land; she has declined the provision by will, and as to her there is no will. She cannot be permitted to hold by the will to convert the land into money, thus obtaining an absolute estate in the proceeds, and yet nullify the will as to the provision made for her. Her election destroys the will as to her, and she must take just what the law would give her, had her late husband died intestate. There is no will, while she receives her share. She must take it in land, same as if no power to convert existed.</p>
