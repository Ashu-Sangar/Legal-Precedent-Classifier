However clearly the parol evidence might establish the fact that the McKinstry farm occupied and farmed by William Brown at the date of the will contained nine fields — and not eight, as described — the credibility of that evidence, and the application of it to the case, must be determined by the jury, under instructions as to its legal effect by the court.

That the testator describes the tract devised to the plaintiff as containing eight fields is a fact in the case bearing on the question of whether this ninth field was in the occupancy of Brown at the date of the will.</p>

In another clause of the will he speaks of the ‘ Stewart farm’ as including a portion of the McKinstry farm. Now it is not disputed among counsel that this 18-acre field, indeed, the whole of the ‘Old Wilkey field,’ was conveyed by McKinstry to Hoke. This field in dispute then was a part of the McKinstry farm, if these words — the McKinstry farm — were used by the testator to mean the tract bought by him of McKinstry. But the defendants contend and have tried to show that this field is part of a larger field called by the testator the ‘ Old Wilkey field,’ which though bought with the other lands from McKinstry, was not regarded by the testator as any part of the McKinstry farm, as he was accustomed to use fhe words‘the McKinstry farm.’ This position of the defendants has not been established very satisfactorily to me, but may have been established to your satisfaction, and if you find it to be sustained by the evidence the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>

This is a very strong point made by defendants. * * *</p>
    <p id="b202-7" data-blocks='[["BL_202.6",202,[276,1218,1155,816]]]'>“ The case turns very much upon the word ‘ occupy.’ That this field was, at the date of the will, <em>farmed </em>by William Brown, is not a matter of contention among the counsel, but was it then in a proper sense, occupied — held in possession — by him ? To farm land is not necessarily to occupy it. If, for instance, the testator or his tenant had had a crop growing in this field, ready to harvest, and Brown had been permitted to cut it only, and had been so engaged at the date of the will, it could be said he was, at the date of the will, farming the land, but it could not be said that he occupied it. So in the same way, the question arises whether one who merely puts a field in corn for one crop, though he farms the land, can be said to occupy it. If the testator, in your opinion, attached this field to the other lands leased to Brown, so as to make it a part of the farm occupied by him, and i.t was so attached to and made a part of that farm at the date of the will, then it was occupied by Brown. But if Mr. Hoke, without attaching it to Brown’s land, only permitted him to use it for a special and temporary purpose, then, though <em>farmed, </em>it cannot be said to hare been <em>occupied </em>by Brown.” * * *</p>

It has no other means of'identification. A devise of that part of the McKinstry farm containing eight fields, would not define the devise at all unless the McKinstry farm had but eight fields upon it in all.</p>

If he occupied and farmed more than eight fields and we confine the devise to eight, what fields shall they be? Neither court nor jury could determine this, for it would be to make a will not to interpret it. It is manifest that the two descriptions cannot stand together, and we must take that which will give the will effect, which is by giving the devisee the part of the farm occupied and farmed by Brown. This was necessarily a fact for the jury, and was fairly submitted.</p>
