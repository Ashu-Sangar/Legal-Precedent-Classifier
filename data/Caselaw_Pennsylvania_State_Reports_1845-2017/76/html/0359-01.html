John Emig, Sr., came to me and said I should write a deed conveying a farm that he had up the Hanover road, about seven miles above York, to convey that farm to his daughter Sarah Emig. I wrote the deed. He brought with him the deeds and all the papers that were necessary to give a full description of the farm. I did write the deed and made the description of the farm according to the papers he left me. When I had it written, I brought it down and gave it to him ; and I feel very sure that he took it home with him; he could read my writing, and this is a thing that occurred to me lately. Afterwards. he came to me, and I think I went to his house. My first impression was that he executed it at my office. When I went to his house, there he signed it and said it was right. He then lived up this street (Main street), on the south side, a few doors from Queen street, and Sarah, his daughter, kept house for him. Sarah was not in the room when he signed the deed. I am sure that I became a subscribing witness in it.* * * There was another Subscribing witness to this deed, but who it was I do not recollect.

I have been thinking a good deal over, how long or when it was that I wrote this deed, but the result of my thinking is tha't it was somewhere about 1850. I don’t recollect anything particular he, John Emig, said as to his intentions either at the time he brought-me the papers, or when he signed the deed, except that his directions were that I should write a deed to his daughter Sarah Emig. She was then not married yet, and he afterwards signed it and said it was right. This relates to 1850, and I think she was not married then. * * * The deed was written by me, as an absolute conveyance of the land, in fee simple, * * * to Sarah Emig, and embraced both tracts, as I have stated. I wrote it that way I think. I can’t say how it read. I wrote it as an absolute deed. I have no doubt of it. My impression is that John Emig, Sr., held the whole tract embraced in the deed, by two separate deeds to him. I had all the old deeds, papers, drafts and so on, and that enabled me to describe the land. * * * I mean that the deed in form was a conveyance to Sarah in fee simple.” * * *</p>

Nothing is more common than that a father speaks of a farm, .upon which he has placed a son or daughter, as the son’s or daughter’s farm, or of a house in which he permits a son or daughter to live as the son’s or daughter’s house. It is an every-day occurrence that a father speaks of having given a lot of ground to a son or daughter, when it is plain that there was no intention to transfer the ownership, and such language is not confined to parol gifts. When a father says I sold such a piece of real estate to my son or daughter, he generally means no more than that he agreed that the son or daughter might have it for a consideration; he does not' necessarily mean that his own dominion over it has ceased, and that a sale has been executed. Were courts to look at <em>the </em>language of parents expressed to others as evidence of title in children, it would annihilate domestic confidence, and it would doubtless, in most cases, be giving an effect to loose declarations that was never intended. That for these reasons no importance is to be attached by the jury to the loose and casual expressions of John Emig, that “the farm was Sarah’s,” that it “belonged to Sarah, ” or even if he gave or appropriated a part of the income to her as her own; and no declaration or act of John Emig’s would transfer the title to her and enable her to recover in this suit, except a deed duly executed and delivered to her for the farm.</p>

The evidence that Philip Smyser fell within the category of loss of memory and general mental incapacity from old age, was very ample. Nor was it necessary to have him in court for examination. It would have been a painful and improper exposure, and no rule of law requires it. Besides, he would not have understood the meaning of the subpoena— would not have attended, perhaps, voluntarily — and an attachment against him for contempt would have been entirely out of the question. It was abundantly proved, that at the time the deposition was taken he was in the possession of his memory and reason. It was therefore rightly received. »</p>

      <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>When this case was tried before the learned judge below on a former occasion, ho rejected all the offers of testimony, and directed a verdict for the defendant. The judgment was reversed in this court: Diehl <em>v. </em>Emig, 15 P. F. Smith 320. It was decided that the testimony thus offered and rejected would have made out a case for the jury. Upon a careful examination of the evidence returned with this record, we think that these offers were made good, and we see no reason to reconsider and overrule the decision formerly made. With the weight of the evidence, we have nothing to do. The court below, if dissatisfied with the verdict on that ground, should have sent it to another jury. Two verdicts the same wra.y would have been a good reason why the last should stand, even though against the opinion of the court. But it is a question which the law has wisely confided to the discretion of that tribunal. We cannot review it.</p>
    <p id="b374-6" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[286,1033,1164,948]]]'>If the testimony of Smyser was believed, a deed was written by the witness and executed by John Emig, conveying to his daughter Sarah, in fee simple, the farm in question. It was not necessary that the witness should be able to state from memory all the words of the deed. It was in the usual form as he stated, and he might have been cross-examined as to the particular parts in detail. Until some evidence w'as given to the contrary, it must be presumed to have been without any power of revocation. It is true, and it is perhaps a sufficient explanation of the fact that John Emig afterwards disposed of the property by will — that it is not an uncommon vulgar error, that every voluntary deed made without consideration is revocable by the grantor. John Emig may have changed his mind as to the gift of this farm to his daughter, and as it had not been put on record, supposed that the destruction of it would accomplish his purpose. There was evidence, however, not only that such a deed had been executed, but that it had been delivered. The testimony of Andrew Landis alone of the declaration by John Emig, that <em>“ </em>the farm was Sarah’s, he had given her the deed for the farm,” would have carried the case to the jury as far as that question was concerned. It was corroborated, however, by many other acts and declarations of the grantor.</p>
    <p id="b374-7" data-blocks='[["BL_374.6",374,[286,1981,1165,433]],["BL_375.1",375,[215,364,1156,867]]]'>Was there then sufficient evidence to account for the non-production of the deed ? Undoubtedly, in the first instance the onus was on the plaintiffs. There must be evidence to shift this onus before the judge could submit the case to the jury. It must be such too as a reasonable man might justly found an opinion upon, not a mere <em>scintilla. </em>There certainly was evidence from which, if the deed had been executed and delivered, the jury might reasonably infer that it had been handed by Sarah to her father for safe keeping. It is an undisputed fact that upon the occurrence of a fire in the neighborhood, John Emig procured a tin <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>box to keep his papers in. Elizabeth Zinn testified: “ The old man said, Sarah has given me all her writings, and I have put them in bank in my tin box. Mr. Emig said there had been a fire and then he had got a tin box made to put Sarah’s writings in and his too.” This was said at a time when, according to the witness, he was speaking of the farm. Michael Emig testified: “ I came to father’s once, after a fire had occurred in the alley ; then he said he had got a tin box made for himself and put his writings in it. Then he said, Sarah gave me her writings, too, and I put them in the box and put it in the bank, so that it wouldn’t burn.” This was entirely natural and probable, and if her writings generally were deposited in the box, the presumption would be that her unrecorded deed for the farm, no doubt the most valuable of them, would be put there with them. This point was submitted to the jury by the learned judge, with remarks upon the presumption against the destruction of the paper either by John Emig or his executors, of which certainly the plaintiffs in error have no reason to complain. The not examining Sarah herself, though she was in court, was a circumstance to be considered by the jury.</p>
