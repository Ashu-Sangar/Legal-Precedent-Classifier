Had this sale been in writing we would all agree that May had an equity which the judgment bound, and while it is conceded that the statute permits no greater estate than a lease at will in land to be created by parol, yet when a chancellor decrees specific performance of a parol sale of land, it must be because he finds about it that which takes the contract out of the operation of the statute, and if so taken out it becomes valid, recognised as a valid agreement, and if so, it must confer rights; and if it confers anything it cannot be less than an <em>equitable estate </em>in the land in the vendee, and this a judgment will bind. <em>* </em>* *</p>

Roth holds the legal title beyond all question, as appears by the deed of the 5th of August 1869, made by Maus at the request of May. If Roth ever paid any purchase-money it was not to Maus; because the proof is uncontradicted that May himself paid the $3000 purchase-money to Maus ; that he carried the deed to Maus and got the latter to execute it, thus conveying the legal title to Roth. * * * It is not shown that Roth ever paid a dollar to May; and it is a conclusion of law that where one man pays the money for land'and directs the conveyance tobe made'to another and no more is said, the law raises a resulting trust in favor .of him who pays the money; the law never presumes that a <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>man pays his money for another but for himself only. <em>* * * </em>The application of this principle to the ease in hand makes Roth a mere trustee for May, so that the aid of a chancellor was never needed to execute this parol contract, the parties consummated it themselves by this conveyance. * * *</p>

Maus did not dispute it. He received the purchase-money from May and executed the deed to Roth at May’s request and direction, and delivered it to May. When he did so the inchoate estate of May arising from the purchase and payment of the price, became complete, so far as it concerned Maus, who alone could set up the Statute of Frauds. May’s equity was liable to the execution of his creditors, and by the sheriff’s sale, made after the delivery of the deed by Maus, passed May’s title to the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale. May clearly could not deny, the effect of the sale upon the execution against him, if the deed had been made to himself instead of Roth. If the deed to Roth' made his title perfect, it enured to the benefit of May’s creditors. The only question now is, whether Roth can contest May’s title. <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>It is clear lie cannot, for he was not a purchaser and paid no purchase-money.

A resulting trust for May arose when he took the deed. Roth was a mere trustee of the title, and this title passed by the sheriff’s sale after-wards. Judgment affirmed.</p>
