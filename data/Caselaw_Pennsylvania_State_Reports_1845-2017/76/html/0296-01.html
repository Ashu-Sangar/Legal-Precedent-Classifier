A testator made bequests and devises to his wife, also, general pecuniary legacies to others; he gave to Zeigler “ during his natural life the interest of $2500, owing by the Sulouffs and secured by mortgage ; * *■ * and if the principal be paid in the life of Zeigler, I direct the same to be reinvested, .to secure the payment of the annual interest to him.” He also made a residuary bequest. The widow elected to take against the will. The balance on the executors’ account did not include the mortgage, which had some years to run. The Orphans’ Court decreed that one-half the balance of the personal estate as it appeared on the account should be paid to the widow as her share under the intestate laws; that all the legacies should be. paid from the remainder; that from a balance still remaining, the executor to retain $1250, that he might on the maturity of the mortgage, supply the half of it, to be taken by the widow and invest $2500 for Zeigler for life. <em>Held </em>to be correct.</p>

The auditor has a threefold objection to this position: First, it is not properly before him, the executor not having brought it into his account. Second, it is not due, and will not be until the 1st of April 1875; and third, the widow must take her share of that particular thing, and not her proportionate part, including this, of the whole fund. This is in the nature of a specific bequest. As far as the widow is concerned, the decedent died intestate. This cannot occasion loss to the residuary legatees, but must be deducted from the amount coming to the specific legatee, Seth Zeigler. It is clearly the intention of the testator to charge that fund alone, with the payment of its interest, to Seth Zeigler during his life.”</p>

Considering that with us both specific devises, specific legacies, and demonstrative legacies abate upon insufficiency of assets from payment of debts; Armstrong’s Appeal, 18 P. E. Smith 312; Barkley’s Estate, 10 Barr 387; ITallawell’s Estate, 11 Harris 223 ; unless the contrary purpose appears by the will, there is no sufficient reason why the estate of the testator should not be so marshalled as to carry out the intent; and the authority of the Orphans’ Court to do so is fully vindicated in the cases cited, particularly in Barkley’s Appeal, 10 Barr 387. With this power in the court, Seth Zeigler’s annuity can be preserved against the encroaches of the widow; and it does not follow that because one-half of the Sulouff mortgage must eventually go to her, that the testator’s purpose to provide for him is frustrated. By marshalling the fund his intention can be carried out, and 'the loss fall where he must have intended it should, on the residuary legatees.”</p>

The court further decreed that the executor retain in his hands the sum of $1250, to enable him, upon the maturity of Sulouff mortgage, to supply the deficiency which will then exist, by reason of the widow of testator being entitled to receive out of said mortgage the one-half thereof, to wit, $1250, so that he may be enabled to invest the sum of $2500, and pay the interest thereof annually to Seth Zeigler, as directed by the will of said testator, during the natural life of said Zeigler, and thus the purposes of the testator will be accomplished.

In the view which we take of the case, it is quite immaterial. The estate was amply <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>sufficient, after discharging all legal claims paramount to the will, including the claim of the widow under the intestate laws, to pay-all the legacies given in the will — general or specific. It is very clear that the residuary legatees can take nothing until all these prior claims are discharged. “All the rest and residue of my estate not heretofore bequeathed,” is all that they can demand. It appears to have been the idea of the auditor below that the widow, claiming her share of the personal property under the intestate laws, has a title to it specifically, just as she has to her share of the realty. This is a mistake. The 'election of the widow does not destroy the right of the decedent to make a will and appoint an executor. The entire personal estate, bequeathed or not, vests in the executor in trust for administration and distribution : First, to pay debts and other legal claims. The widow electing to refuse to take under the wTill, has such a claim, of which the decedent could not deprive her, as he might deprive his next of kin of all claim, and give the entire residue to strangers. Over that residue he has entire power; he can carve it out and distribute it as he pleases, and in what order he pleases. His general and specific legacies must first be paid, and then, if there is anything left, it goes to the residue. The widow had no right to the one-half of the Sulouff mortgage specifically. It was the duty of the executor to include that as well as all other assets in the inventory and appraisement. It is true he could not be required to distribute it until it was payable and received. If it was lost from the insufficiency of the security or any other cause, Seth Zeigler would get nothing, and the widow would lose one-half of that item in the inventory and appraisement. As against her, the executor would be bound to collect and distribute it as soon as due; the testator could not postpone it for the term of Zeigler’s life. Nevertheless, Zeigler would be entitled to receive the interest of $2500 during his natural life. “ If the principal be paid in the lifetime of Seth Zeigler, I direct the same to be reinvested by my executor to secure the payment of the annual interest to him.” It is clear to us that as long as the estate can do so, after discharging all debts and paying over to the widow her one full moiety of the balance, Seth Zeigler is entitled, by the clear intention of the testator, to receive his annuity for life, before the residuary legatees receive anything. The title of the widow is under and through the executor, just as it would be under and through the administrator, if there was no will. She could maintain no action against a stranger for any part of it. We think, therefore, that the learned court below was right in securing the payment of this annuity to Zeigler, in preference to the claims of the residuary legatees.</p>
