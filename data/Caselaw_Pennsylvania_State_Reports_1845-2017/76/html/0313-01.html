Afterwards Johnson was adjudged bankrupt and the United States court decreed the assignment null and void, ordered it to be delivered up, to be cancelled and all the estate passed to the assignee in bankruptcy; the previous acts of the voluntary assignees being validated. The assignee in bankruptcy sold Johnson’s real estate to Coover. Reeser not having proved his debt in bankruptcy issued execution on his judgment, levied on Coover’s purchase and issued a venditioni. The court below restrained Reeser from proceeding on his executions; the order was reversed, the invalidity of Reeser’s lien not being so clear as to justify it.</p>

Reeser against David Sponsler and William Y. Johnson. On the 17th of February 1869, William Y. Johnson and Samuel P. Johnson, who were partners, made a voluntary assignment of all their property, individual and partnership, to R. H. Thomas and William J. Stees, for the benefit of their creditors. On the 5th of March there was an award of arbitrators for $231.33 in the action of debt against Sponsler and William Y. Johnson. On the 19th of March 1869, proceedings in bankruptcy were commenced against the Johnsons, the voluntary assignment being one of the alleged acts of bankruptcy. During the pendency of these proceedings, the voluntary assignees sold some of the assigned property, real and personal. The Johnsons were adjudged bankrupts as of the 19th of March; and on the 22d of May, the register in bankruptcy assigned all the estate of the Johnsons to George Bitner, who had been chosen assignee in bankruptcy. Bills were filed in the Circuit Court of the United States by the petitioning creditor and the assignee in bankruptcy, to require the assignees, under the voluntary deed, to surrender the property conveyed to them, and deliver up their deed to be cancelled.</p>

On his judgment against Sponsler and Johnson, Reeser issued a fi. fa. on the 26th of September 1871; and on the 13th of November a levy was made on William Y.

We cannot set aside the levy, and the right of the creditor to sell any interest which he believes his debtor has in land, is admitted. The only exception seems to be where such sale would be contrary to law, and up to this time the only clear exposition of this exception is found in Hunter’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20194" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Wright 194">4 Wright 194</a>; Winch’s Appeal, 11 P. E. Smith 424, and Lyon’s Appeal, Id. 15; and these are all cases of attempts to sell a wife’s realty to pay her husband’s debts, which the Act of 1848 expressly forbids. Even then a clear and indisputable title in the wife must be established. The reason given for interference is that it is contrary to law. But to sell A.’s property to pay B.’s debts is no less so. Both are against law and equity, and in Stock-dale <em>v. </em>Ullery, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20486" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Wright 486">1 Wright 486</a>, the power to restrain acts contrary to either equity or law, is admitted. In Winch’s Appeal, the Supreme Court determine that under disputed facts as to title, there can be no interference; trial by jury is the remedy. Then the test must be this, that under a state of admitted facts the <em>law </em>draws its conclusions, and where it can assure, acts promptly by forbidding the thing to be done. No jury is needed; the facts are found and the law concludes. Now we have in this case all the facts admitted, and the only question of law arising is, has the plaintiff a lien on the land ? We hold that he has not. There is no need of a jury when this plaintiff proposes to sell Coover’s land to pay Johnson’s debt; it can only be by reason of a lien thereon; without a lien he has no right. To sell without a lien is contrary to law; the purchaser will get no title; the process of the court will be used for deceitful and illusory purposes. Bidders will be misled, the real owner of the land vexed and harassed to his hurt. Under these circumstances, we believe the ends of justice will be met by arresting the execution at this point, and we will do so.”</p>

It is true this case recognises the right of the court to enjoin against a sale of the real estate of the wife on an execution against her husband. It was supported on the express language of the statute absolutely prohibiting the property of a married woman from levy and sale for the debts and liabilities of her husband, and the unquestioned fact that the land was the exclusive property of the wife.
