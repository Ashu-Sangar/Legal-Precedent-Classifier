With respect to the latter there is no longer any dispute, it being conceded that the defendants are entitled to set off them; but it is objected to the note left for collection with the First National Bank, and which A. H. Reist, being an endorser, has paid for C. W. Kreiter, that it cannot be a proper subject of set-off in this case, which is a suit against two defendants, and the other was in no way responsible for this note, and the debt due from the plaintiff on that account is to the other defendant. [A set-off in general cannot be claimed by one of two or more defendants in the same suit for a debt due to one only, which, being this case, defeats the claim as to this note, if there be nothing to make it an exception to the rule— some superior equity in A. H. Reist’s claim over and above that of Isaac F. Bomberger.] [Again, the set-off must depend upon the condition of the claim at the time of the suit brought; it must have existed at that time. In this case A. H. Reist had not paid this note when the present suit was brought, but paid it more than a year afterwards.]</p>

Hence, as soon as the note was protested, June 10th 1871, and Reist’s liability as endorser became fixed and absolute, he was entitled to call upon the maker to exonerate him from such liability, and that even before demand was made upon him for payment: Beaver <em>v. </em>Beaver, 11 Harris 167. His right of set-off, as against any claim Kreiter had against him, may be said to have originated from this period. When, therefore, he paid the note on which he was endorser, May 20th 1873, he was, by force of his equitable status, put in the same position as if he had paid it at the time of protest. Again, as there is no evidence of the date of the assignment to Bomberger of the non-negotiable note drawn by Miller &amp; Reist, on which this suit is founded, and as Reist had no notice thereof previously to the service of the summons, January 25th 1872, as against him, it could be effective only from that date; for the rule is, that the period from which to determine the rights of the assignee and defendant is not the date of the assignment, but the time when the latter had notice: Northampton <em>v. </em>Balliet, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 311" data-case-ids="483362" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0311-01">8 W. &amp; S. 311</a>. It follows, therefore, that Reist’s equitable set-off having arisen before the assignment to Bomberger, he had the right to defalk his claim against the note in suit, and the court should so have ruled.</p>
