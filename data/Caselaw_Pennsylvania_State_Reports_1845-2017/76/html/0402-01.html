A mere naked verbal agreement by a purchaser at sheriff’s sale with his own money, that he will hold the premises in trust for the defendant, neither vests any estate in the defendant under the statute prohibiting parol declarations of trust, so that he has any claim to the money under the common count, nor being <em>nudum pactum, </em>gives any ground for an action.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b402-12" data-blocks='[["BL_402.9",402,[298,1742,1156,481]]]'>2. The plaintiff alleged that, owing a bank a debt secured by mortgage, the bank agreed with him to sell the land at sheriff’s sale, under the bond secured by the mortgage, and purchase it, and then sell as much as would pay the debt, repay-him any surplus and reconvey to him any unsold land; the bank so bought and sold part for more than enough to pay the debt, and did not give him the surplus, or reconvey the residue of the land. In an action of assumpsit to recover the surplus money and the value of the land sold, the court charged that if the jury found, that if it was understood by the parties that the sheriff’s sale was to be merely a process of increasing the security of the bank, or to enable plaintiff through the bank to make title to the land, or to enable the bank to sell part and pay the debt; or if it was the understanding the debt should survive the sheriff’s sale, the sheriff’s deed was only a mortgage and plaintiff might recover. <em>Held </em>to be error, no consideration for the alleged promise being adverted to in the instructions.</p>

He afterwards went to the bank and saw Mr. Coulton, who was treasurer and a trustee; he was “ the head man, the only man, excepting the president, the only official of any rank.” Plaintiff told Mr. Coulton his conversation with Mr. Burgwin, and asked him whether the bank would agree to, the conditions contemplated by Mr. Burgwin and himself. Coulton said the bank would. Coulton then stated to plaintiff many instances in which similar arrangements had been made with debtors of the bank. Persuaded by these conversations and promises, plaintiff allowed Mr. Burgwin to sell his property at sheriff’s sale. It was sold for $5300. Plaintiff testified further as to acts of the bank after the sale, tending to show that the hank still recognised his ownership of the land on the terms of the agreement.

The declaration contained two special counts and the common count for money had and received. It is essential to maintain this action that the promise or undertaking of the defendant should be founded upon a sufficient legal consideration — either some benefit to the promissor or some injury to the promissee. Nothing is clearer in principle or better settled by authority than that a mere naked verbal agreement by a purchaser at a sheriff’s sale, with his own money, that he will hold the premises in trust for the defendant — neither vests any equitable estate in the defendant under the statute which prohibits parol <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>declarations of trust — so that no claim to the money could exist in him under the common count — nor does it give any ground for an action, being a mere <em>nudum pactum. </em>The mortgagees had a legal right to proceed on their judgment-bond and to become the purchasers at the sale, if they were the highest and best bidders. There may have been in the-special count a sufficient allegation of consideration, and there may have been evidence of it given upon the trial, which might have been left to the determination of the jury. Upon these questions we do not feel called upon to express any opinion. The learned judge below evidently did not advert to these vital points in the ease in affirming, as he did without qualification, the first two propositions submitted to him by the plaintiff below. No consideration for the alleged promise is adverted to in either of these propositions. Sweetzer’s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 264, is not opposed to this, for there Chief Justice Thompson states in his opinion, and it was evidently the turning-point of the case, “ at the time of the sale it was made known to creditors that the property was simply being put in a shape to bring money on mortgage to pay Sweetzer’s debt. The master finds that at the sale the Jiffkins, Sherrerd and Sweetzer all represented that the sale was merely an arrangement for the benefit of Sweetzer.” In Danzeisen’s Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 65, the conveyance was without consideration upon a parol promise by the grantee to raise money by a mortgage of the land to pay the grantor’s debts, and the present Chief Justice says in the opinion : “Itis very evident that the deed was a mortgage or a trust <em>ex maleficio </em>would arise; for when the deed was delivered no consideration passed. Miller procured the estate without payment of any purchase-money, and therefore stood in no better situation in point of fact than one in whose name a deed is taken by another, who pays the purchase-money.” And again : “ It would be different had the deed been intended to enable Miller (the grantee) to raise money <em>by </em>a sale, for there Danzeisen (the grantor) would intend to pass an absolute estate, and to trust the promise of Miller to apply the proceeds to his use ; a breach of such a promise would not convert Miller into a trustee, and the case in principle would resemble that of Barnet <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 8 Casey 371.” In Boynton <em>v. </em>Housler <em>et al., </em>23 P. F. Smith 458, the purchaser on the day preceding the sale said, that “if they would not interpose or bid at the sale and have it bid off as low as possible, she (the widow of the party whose estate was sold) should have the homestead.”</p>
