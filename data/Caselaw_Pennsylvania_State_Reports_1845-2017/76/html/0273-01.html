The evidence was offered as a whole, and rejected as a whole. Hence if any part of it was inadmissible, there was no error in rejecting the whole: Sennett <em>v. </em>Johnston, 9 Barr 335. It is sometimes a little difficult to determine whether parol evidence should be received to contradict or vary the terms of a written instrument. It may be modified by parol evidence of what passed between the parties at the time of its execution, in cases of fraud, mistake or trust. Without proof or allegation of fraud, it has frequently been held that such evidence is not admissible to change or contradict the terms of a promissory note: Hoare <em>et al. v. </em>Graham, 3 Camp. 56; Moseley, Assignee, <em>v. </em>Hanford, 10 B. &amp; C. 729; Free <em>v. </em>Hawkins, 8 Taunt. 92; Hill <em>v. </em>Gaw, 4 Barr 493; Anspach <em>v. </em>Bast, 2 P.

It involves an inquiry into many and complicated partnership transactions. That this cannot be done in this form of action is well settled: Sennett <em>v. </em>Johnston, <em>supra; </em>Russell <em>v. </em>Miller, 4 P. F. Smith 164.
