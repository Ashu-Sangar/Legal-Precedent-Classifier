In an action by Reed against Mishler, evidence by him that it was an accommodation note, that he declined to endorse unless the proceeds went to his credit, and declined to sign under “ credit the drawer,” and endorsed with the understanding that the proceeds were to go to his credit, was inadmissible without notice to Reed of these facts when he discounted the note.</p>

Admitting all the facts offered to be proved, if Reed &amp; Henderson, when they discounted the note, had no knowledge that Mishler was to control the proceeds, they were bonfi fide purchasers of the paper for value, <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>and cannot be affected by the private understanding.between Frey and Mishler. The printed form of the note kept for general use was no notice to the plaintiffs, because the words “ Credit the drawer,” constituting a part of the printed form, were not subscribed by the payee. On the contrary, the fact that they were not subscribed, and that the note was turned over and endorsed by Mishler in blank, was evidence that the parties did not intend to use the note according to the form. If Mishler intended to control the proceeds, he ought to have endorsed the note specially to his own order or to the credit of his own account. But by his endorsement in blank he sent the note out into the channels of business, to be used by the bearer. The fact that the note is found afterwards in the possession of the maker before it has fallen due, affords no legal presumption that it has been paid and taken up. It is not presumed that the drawer paid it before maturity.
