After some unsuccessful efforts to adjust the dispute, the defendant erected a fence on his land for the entire line and a few feet from it.

The gap was closed, and the plaintiff requested defendant to let it remain till he got his crops in.

Notwithstanding this act, however, a man was not compelled to join in such fence, for if he chose he might build his own fence entirely within his own land, and the adjoiner cannot cross over, and connect therewith; and after adjoiners have thus united in the erection of a common division line fence, still if it afterwards be destroyed by flood, fire or decay, either party may recede within his own lines and build for himself. It would result from this, that whether, or not, when a common division line fence has been once established, and still exists, it is in the power of either party to build a new fence within his own lines — it is very certain that he cannot remove the existing fence, and place it within his own lines, without being guilty of a trespass, because he does not own it, except in common with his neighbor. In case of its destruction, each is permitted to do, what either could have done at the beginning, to wit, build his own fence upon his own land; but he <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>must build with his own materials, and cannot use any part of the line fence. However, it is beyond all peradventure, that where such adjoining owners themselves agree to divide the line fence between them for repairs, each taking a section thereof, the removal of any part thereof by one of them upon his own ground, would be a trespass upon the land of the other.</p>

But, if you find such an agreement was made between them in 1864, as proved by Thompson and Dunn, by which the repairs were so divided, still less could Smith remove this fence. So that in either aspect of the case, Smith committed a trespass when he did so, and set it back from the line upon his own ground. In no aspect did more than half this fence belong to Smith, and this, too, an undivided half, so that every rail that Smith removed belonged to the extent of one-half thereof to Thompson, and their removal was an undoubted trespass.</p>

These damages embrace the injury from the loss of the fence, thus transferred from the common ownership of both the adjoining owners, to Smith alone; also the injury to the crop of Johnson by the trespass of cattle, coming in through the gap, which the removal of this fence opened between the two farms, along the pike; in short, for all the direct and expected consequences arising from the wrongful act. True it is, however, that Smith is not liable for any damage or injury resulting from negligence on the part of Johnson in neglecting to repair the fence so as to close up the gap as soon as could reasonably be done — that is, if Johnson, after discovering that his fields of wheat and corn, or whatever else, were thereby exposed to the range of stock coming in, and trespassing, neglected to repair, or close it up, Smith should not be made to pay for such negligence. [But should you find that, as often as ■Johnson .did repair, Smith again destroyed it, and thus between these times stock got upon his crops, then Smith is clearly liable •to pay for such injury.] Again, the law in cases of this kind .adopts as the measure of damages, compensation quite equal to <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>the injury, loss and trouble sustained; but this rule yields to circumstances, so that, in cases of wanton, malicious and aggravated trespasses, attended with acts showing an intention to do great injury, and permits exemplary or punitive damages to be given; that is such damages as punish the trespasser by making him pay more than the mere sum, which makes good the injury to the suffering party. [The original act of Mr. Smith, in removing this line fence, in itself, if done under a misapprehension of his duty, believing he had the right to do so, does not indicate a malicious purpose; but his subsequent conduct in removing, or causing to be removed, all the means taken by Johnson to preserve his crop, such as cutting off or throwing down the rails which very harmlessly pointed, if at all, but slightly, over the line, is difficult to explain, and inclines the mind strongly to the belief, that his motives were not commendable.

But the facts show that the removed fence was not a partition fence by agreement between Smith and Thompson; it had always been the line fence between the two farms, and the utmost extent of the agreement proved by Thompson and Dunn was to fix each one’s part to be.kept up, [so that after all the question is simply one of damages.] How much shall the plaintiff recover for the injury he has sustained, as already explained.
