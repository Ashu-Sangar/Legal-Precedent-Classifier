The law looks with jealousy on every such bequest, and requires affirmative evidence on the part of the attorney that all was fair and perfectly understood; without that the bequest must fall. The jury must judge whether the matter, as also the situation of the estate, was perfectly understood by the testator. $1000 is given to the executors to carry on any contest which may arise concerning the real estate.

Whether that was so intended or not, is extremely problematical, as the witnesses prove that the conversation was about making Mr. Derr his attorney, and it is in proof, that both before and after its execution, he often spoke of intending to leave all the residue of his estate to his mother’s family, and of having so disposed of it, yet they are not named. We have rejected the residuary clause, as not being legally inserted and authenticated — done after the will was executed, without republication. Yet you must decide whether it was or was not inserted fraudulently. If so done, it would vitiate the instrument. If <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>honestly and fairly inserted as intended, it would have no such effect, hut would merely defeat the residuary clause, and cut out that part of the devise. Such would be the case even if the testator supposed that he was only making Mr. Derr his attorney, if the latter also intended to be made the attorney, as he certainly used no undue influence then, but merely said if they wanted him to act as attorney to insert his name, and declined doing ■ it himself. We are unwilling to think that such a fraud was practised as would vitiate the instrument. This more especially as the will was in possession of the testator for several years after. We might fairly infer that he had read and understood its contents from its long possession. The only fact which conflicts with that is the testator’s declarations to Mrs. Huber, the witness, that the Zimmermans had the residue of his estate. The questions of mental capacity and fraudulent alteration are for your consideration. The will ought not to be set aside <em>in toto </em>on slight grounds, especially where the subscribing witnesses, and many others, say that his mind was good. The insertion of Mr. Derr’s name by a third person, not interested, should scarcely be considered such a fraud as would vitiate the whole will, especially if done in presence of the testator; but we have already stated that it is not so authenticated as to render the devise of the residue valid. We might be led to infer from other circumstances that the testator did not know the residue of the estate was given to Mr. Derr by the will, but that he was merely to act as his attorney, as he proposed to give it to Doctor Gloninger, and when he declined the gift, wanted to bestow it on his infant son.</p>

M. Derr.’ The law looks with extreme jealousy on all bequests made to those who stand in a confidential relation and are instrumental in procuring its execution, and requires something more than mere formal proof of its signature. There should be evidence not only that it was fully known and understood by the testator, but also that ■ it was his own spontaneous wish, uninfluenced by the person making or dictating the instrument. This applies most emphatically to those standing in the relation of attorney and client, as there is none more confidential. It has even been applied to physician and patient, clergyman and parishioner; in short, to all who are supposed to have great influence over the mind of the testator. In one case large bequests- were made to the attorney who drew the will, and to the physician and clergyman who were -present at its execution, and it was held void as to all, although they were gentlemen of the highest character for probity. Under this principle the jury may feel themselves obliged to reject the bequest of $500 to Mr. Derr, as it would seem that he prepared the will or directed its preparation.]</p>

If there should be no litigation, there would be no application of the fund or any part of it. In a contest, no more would be allowed out of the $1000 than a fair compensation for services. The appointment of the executors stands in the same situation; they are under the control of the Orphans’ Court, and there is no good reason for vacating the office because one of them is the attorney who prepared the will. The jury can find one part of the will good, and vacate or nullify other parts, as they consider right under the evidence, according to the principles we have laid down.

    <p id="b252-8" data-blocks='[["BL_252.12",252,[270,1564,1157,260]]]'>The jury having found in favor of this will and against the defences of mental incapacity, undue influence and fraud, we are relieved from the necessity of considering many of the alleged errors, both in the reception and rejection of evidence, and the answers to the points and the instructions of the charge, which relate exclusively to those subjects.</p>
    <p id="b252-9" data-blocks='[["BL_252.13",252,[269,1823,1158,249]]]'>The principal, indeed the only matter of which, in view of the verdict of the jury, this plaintiff in error has any right to complain, is the binding direction given by the court to the jury under the whole evidence, that the residuary bequest to the plaintiff in error must be rejected as not having been legally proved as a part of the will of the testator.</p>
    <p id="b252-10" data-blocks='[["BL_252.14",252,[271,2080,1156,252]]]'>The will was duly proved to have been executed in the presence of the two subscribing witnesses, but with a blank for the name of the residuary legatee. This blank was afterwards filled, and the question presented is whether the act of filling up that blank was so proved by two witüesses as to make it in law a part of the will.</p>
    <p id="b252-11" data-blocks='[["BL_252.15",252,[315,2338,1113,47]],["BL_253.1",253,[205,375,1163,782]]]'>There is no difficulty in regard to the rule of law upon the <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>subject. That has been well settled and repeatedly applied in the prior determinations of this court. It was fully considered and discussed in Carson’s Appeal, 9 P. F. Smith 493, in which the former cases are cited. That principle is well generalized in the language of Mr. Chief Justice Gibson in Hock <em>v. </em>Hock, 6 S. &amp; R. 47: “ Proof of execution must be made by two witnesses, each of whom must separately depose to all facts necessary to complete the chain of evidence, so that no link of it may depend on the credibility of but one. When the evidence is positive there can be no difficulty, for the witnesses then attest the simple fact of execution itself; but where the evidence of one or both is circumstantial, each must make proof complete in itself, so that if the Act of Assembly were out of the question, the case would be well made out by the evidence of either. Circumstantial proof cannot, therefore, be made by two or more witnesses alternating with each other, as to the different parts of the aggregate of circumstances which are to make up the necessary sum of proof; the evidence of each not going to the whole.”</p>
    <p id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[199,1155,1169,1256]],["BL_254.1",254,[278,361,1168,1203]]]'>The rule is a simple, intelligible one, but the difficulty in this, as it has been in other cases, is in its application. It is not easy for the mind to divest itself of the influence which facts sworn to by one witness have in corroborating the evidence of another, especially of supplying what is a mere <em>vacuum </em>— a failure or uncertainty of memory in another. This difficulty is well illustrated by the evidence in this case. The evidence of Mrs. Huber was direct and positive that her son, George Rise, wrote the name in the blank in the presence of the testator and by his express direction. Striking out the entire testimony of Mrs. Huber, is there sufficient evidence from other witnesses in the cause which would justify the submission of that fact to the jury ? George Rise was unable to testify that he had inserted the name by the direction of the testator or in his presence. “This name,” said he, “is my writing. I cannot tell at whose instance I put it in; was done at Greenawalt’s or Derr’s office. I know I wrote it in; can’t say when or who present. If at Derr’s office, he present; if at Greenawalt’s house, he present. If at his house, my mother present; witnessed a bond; I was called on purpose to witness the bond. I never gave a thought to the other transaction.” The only other witness present was Lydia Frantz. She could not recollect having seen George Rise there. She left after the first execution of the will. “ I think I went home to tea.” The circumstance of the execution of the bond would of course be material, but that it was done at the same time with the writing in the will depends solely upon the credibility of Mrs. Huber. Lydia Frantz does not remember it. What other circumstances then have we in the case ? There is undoubtedly evidence of repeated declarations by the testator that Mr. Derr was his residuary legatee, though some <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>evidence was given of declarations to the contrary. It is clear that they go for nothing: Hock <em>v. </em>Hock, 6 S. &amp; R. 47 ; Clark <em>v. </em>Morton, <a href="/rawle/5/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="5 Rawle 235" data-case-ids="1824604" data-case-paths="/rawle/5/0235-01">5 Rawle 235</a>. Nor is the circumstance that the will continued four years from its date in the possession of the testator sufficient. Had there been no subscribing witnesses, and the will been proved by the testimony of two witnesses to the handwriting of the testator, it would perhaps have been sufficient primá. facie. The presumption may be that it was perfect when the testator subscribed to it. But the subscribing witnesses were there and must be called, and their testimony showed that the will was not perfect when he executed it. We are thrown back then upon the testimony of Mrs. Huber, as to when the blank was filled, and whether by the authority and at the instance of the testator. It' might well be that, believing his instruction to have been followed, he had kept .the will in his possession without further examination. It does not appear that he ever had the will in his hands after its execution. Even Mrs. Huber fails to prove that, but rather shows the contrary. “ After the will was executed, he asked me to take it ‘home with me. I took it home; kept it from December till some time in March. I took it back, gave it to his mother, and she put it in his desk; was found there after his death.” Adopting Chief Justice Gibson’s language in Hock <em>v. </em>Hock: <em>“ </em>Strike out Mrs. Huber’s testimony, and how will the case stand ? There would be a very material link wanting to connect the testator’s declarations with the paper in question. It is said these two witnesses mutually strengthen and support each other. So much the worse. Each must be competent to the whole proof without aid borrowed from the other.”</p>
    <p id="b254-6" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[279,1566,1160,170]]]'>We are of opinion, therefore, that’ the learned judge below committed no error in the binding direction which he gave to the jury to reject the residuary bequest as no part of the will of L. T. Calvin Greenawalt.</p>
    <p id="b254-7" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[278,1743,1159,261]]]'>As to the contention that no separate issue was directed as to the fifth item of the will, and the jury was not, therefore, empowered to find that to be no part of the will, as perhaps may be inferred from Hoxworth <em>v. </em>Miller, 7 Barr 458, it is sufficient to observe that no such point was made in the court below, nor has it been specifically assigned for error here.</p>
    <p id="b254-8" data-blocks='[["BL_254.6",254,[1057,2001,333,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
