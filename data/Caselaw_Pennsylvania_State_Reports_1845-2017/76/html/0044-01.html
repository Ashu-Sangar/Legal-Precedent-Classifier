Wilder, a justice of the peace, against Leonard, the plaintiff, for $72. Leonard appealed from this judgment and duly entered his appeal in the Court of Common Pleas. In October 1858, the appeal then pending, an execution was issued by the justice and delivered to the defendant Dillon a constable. He, with Davis, the plaintiff in the execution, and the other defendants, by authority of the execution, went to the premises of Leonard to levy on his personal property. Dillon levied on the five colts and sold them under the execution.</p>

And where want of jurisdiction does not appear upon the face of the writ, we are of the opinion that the officer is not bound to examine into the validity of the proceedings or the regularity of the process. In this case, although the judgment was appealed from, and the justice issued the execution without authority, yet as the writ was regular, and nothing appeared on its face to indicate a want of jurisdiction, we think ’the constable can claim the benefit of the execution under which he acted, and justify himself in making the levy and selling the property of the plaintiff. [Neither was he bound to regard the notice given to him by the defendant in the execution that the appeal had been taken.] Had notice been received from the justice that the judgment was appealed from, and the execution revoked or superseded, and the constable had then proceeded with the execution of the writ, he would have rendered himself liable as a trespasser. Nor was the liability of the constable affected by the service of the writ of certiorari upon him. The writ was not directed to the constable, but to the justice who issued the execution. The service of it upon the constable was a nullity. If service of it was made upon the justice, it would have been his duty to notify the constable, and to revoke or supersede the execution in his hands. In the absence of such revocation or <em>supersedeas </em>from the justice, it was the duty of the constable to proceed with the execution of the writ. * * * Under the evidence and the law we say, that G-eorge Dillon, the constable, is not liable to the plaintiff for levying upon and selling his property, under and in pursuance of the mandate contained in the execution issued upon the judgment of John Davis. But whilst the constable is not liable, John Davis, the plaintiff in the judgment before the justice and one of the defendants in this action, would not be exempt from liability, but would be responsible for all damages which the plaintiff may be entitled to recover, and as to him the jury can render a verdict for the plaintiff, for an amount which will fully compensate him for the loss sustained by the seizure and sale of 'the colts. What amount of damages is the plaintiff entitled to recover ? As a general rule, the measure of damages in an action of this kind is the value of the property taken and interest thereon to the time of trial; but the jury are not confined to the actual damage sustained; they may go beyond that, if the evidence shows that the taking of the property was attended with circumstances of aggravation or outrage. If Davis, the plaintiff in the judgment, knew that the appeal had been taken and entered, and proceeded regardless'of it <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>to enforce the collection of his judgment by execution, the jury may take that into consideration in determining the amount of damages to which plaintiff may be entitled, being careful to limit themselves within reasonable bounds.</p>
