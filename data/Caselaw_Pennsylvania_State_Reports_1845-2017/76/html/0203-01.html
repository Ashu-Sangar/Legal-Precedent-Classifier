Reed’s, one of Bickell’s, and an indebtedness of Anspach’s own of an unknown shape, which notes, with interest then due, made $14,466.60, and took instead the obligation of John Anspach (obligation “A”), for that sum, secured by $8000 of U. S. bonds and two builder’s mortgages of $3000 each, given by Daniel Haviland, of Philadelphia, to John M. Bickell, which, with the interest due on them that day, and the accrued interest on the bonds and $286.44 of cash that day paid by Anspach, were regarded as precisely securing the obligation. On the 11th April 1863, Anspach and McLellan again met for the same purpose, when the assignee surrendered the four notes of Repplier &amp; Bro., and five notes of Anspach, Reed &amp; Co., making, with interest computed, $18,330.54, and received in exchange the obligation of John Anspach (obligation “B”), secured by 205 shares of .Locust Mountain Coal and Iron Company stock at $10,250, and three other similar builder’s mortgages, made by same parties, of $3000 each, as collaterals. On that day also the assignee returned to Anspach the $8000 U. S. bonds, held by him since 16th Feb. 1863, as collateral to obligation “ A,” and received for them $8135.22. A controversy arises touching the date and manner of Anspach’s payment for these bonds, which will be hereafter noticed, Davis (the assignee’s attorney in Philadelphia) continuing his collections from McCoy, Linn &amp; Co., until by his remittance of $2000, on 20th February 1864, he closed the account of McCoy, Linn &amp; Co., and Anspach having paid the interest on the mortgages and the dividends on 205 shares of Locust Mountain stock for the year 1863, and also having made one payment of $4000, on general account, on 22d February 1864. The assignee obtained as the next payment, on 31st March 1864 three drafts of $5000 each, from Anspach, at thirty, sixty and ninety days, on his general account, which drafts the assignee discounted, and which were met by Anspach.

The ‘ financial account’ of Anspach was then, for the first time, taken up by name, and a formal statement of it — the balance of $88,426.28 and interest — made, and such credits as were due Anspach on this account, admitted. The 205 shares of Locust Mountain were then surrendered to Anspach and their value, $10,250,-added to the balance due by Anspach on his financial account stated, making the sum of $28,085.69. Paying the $85.69 in cash, Anspach gave the assignee four drafts, payable at three, four and five months, for $7000 each, and thus closed this part of his account. He also paid the assignee in cash $502.19, the estimated discount on the drafts, thus making them of their face value in cash.</p>

But Mr. McLellan then found that they were laid on lots in Philadelphia, on which there were no buildings newly erected, as Anspach had told him there were, and that the lots besides were encumbered by a prior mortgage to their value. Mr. McLellan accepted these mortgages upon the mere assertion of Anspach that they were valuable ; the properties about to be improved by the erection of' five new tenement-houses. He did not visit the premises before taking the mortgages or inquire into their condition and value, but, sometime after he became the holder of these mortgages, visiting the locality with Mr. J. A.

After holding the mortgages over two years, at the suggestion of his attorney, he went on the ground with a plot of the square and discovered the deception, the lots mortgaged to him being adjacent to those built on, but themselves unimproved.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Recurring now to the general line of the, assignee’s conduct, we find him during this same period collecting other moneys due the fund from its debtors, and paying by instalments from day to day, the debts due the certificate-holders, the depositors, and the banks. * * * Believing, as was the case, that a large saving to the fund and to the partners, who were liable to pay any deficiency of assets, could be made by purchasing certificates at a discount for ready money, the stockholders gave their promissory notes, beginning in April 1862, for in all $12,500, which notes were discounted and the proceeds used, at first by the assignee and afterwards by Judge Kimmell as the agent of the partners, in the buying up of the certificates and deposits. * * * These cer'tificates and deposits, purchased by the assignee or agent, were in all cases assigned to them by the holders. When the funds arising from these stockholders’ notes were expended, the buying up was continued with the proper funds of the association, both by the assignee and Judge Kimmell, until the majority of the certificates and deposits were in the hands of the assignee and agent. * * * The stockholders never lifted any of these notes given by them, but constrained the assignee to redeem five of them, the sixth remaining unpaid this day in the Bank of Chambersburg; three of the five notes were received by the assignee from John Anspach, into whose hands they had fallen as cash upon his indebtedness, and two of them from William G. Reed, also as cash upon his indebtedness to the fund.</p>

      <em>“ </em>It will be remembered also that among the collaterals in hand when the assignee was appointed, were the lands in Schuylkill county; these lands, by operation of law, because of the deeds from Anspach to Reed and the deed of assignment, instantly vested in the assignee upon his acceptance of the trust, and the endorsement by Reed of all of the Anspach notes in the fund. Although the assignee never read the deed of assignment, nor did Reed turn over to him the deeds for the lands, yet both the assignee and the stockholders knew of the lands and that they belonged to the fund as collaterals. Mr. Reed had recorded both deeds 21st February 1861, in Schuylkill county. The assignee, in May 1862, with several of the partners, visited the land at Anspach’s invitation, met him there, and were shown the lands by him. A colliery, then in operation on the lands, was seen by them. Although the visit convinced them of the great value of the lands, yet they returned home disheartened because of the discredit thrown by two persons whom they' accidentally met while there, upon Anspach’s title to the land, and Mr. McLellan’s assurance that he had been advised by counsel that the title was not good. The assignee, prior to this visit, consulted F. W. Hughes, Esq., of Pottsville, and had been told by him that Anspach had no title to the lands, and his counsel, Mr. Davis, of Philadelphia, had also so advised him. Upon what information Mr. Davis based his opinion, the auditors have no means of now telling. Mr. Davis was not called as a witness, but the opinion of Mr. Hughes, who was offered by the exceptants, was based on a casual conversation with Mr. McLellan, who exhibited to him no papers, but led him to take up the belief that the lands inquired of were those well known in Schuylkill county as the £ Deborah Grant tract,’ to which Anspach in fact had no title, and touching which Mr. Hughes says he must have said he had none. But the auditors find that the deed to Reed expressly designates the land conveyed as the then £ Wm. Kichner ’ tracts, and whether the deed was given to the assignee or not, by Reed, so that he might learn this fact from it, the deed had been recorded in Schuylkill county, in which the assignee was when he saw the lands, and was readily accessible to him as a lawyer and the assignee. To this land the auditors find as a fact that Anspach had, in the language of Mr. Hughes, an indisputably good legal title. Mr. Hughes further says that, being intimately acquainted with these lands, he having been concerned in the compromise, as attorney for the Foulkes and others, and adversely to Anspach, which quieted Anspach’s title to these lands, he would have told Mr. McLellan that Anspaeh’s title was indisputable, had Mr. McLellan correctly informed him what lands had been vested in him under the deed of assignment. After this visit, seemingly with the assent of the stockholders, the assignee took no further steps to follow the lands. <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>He never recorded his deed of assignment in either Schuylkill or Columbia counties, but after the settlement of 18th June 1864, at the request of Anspach, told and advised Mr. Reed to reconvey both tracts to Anspach, which Reed did by his deed of 21st of July 1864, and the lands passed from the fund.” * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b218-6" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[284,557,1150,92]]]'>The auditors then referred to the assignee’s first account and the auditor’s report on it. They proceeded:—</p>

The claims against the fund were of three classes: 1st, certificates; 2d, weekly deposits, 3d, debts due banks. Deducting a preferred debt and the expenses from the balance in assignee’s hands, he had upwards of sixty per cent, to distribute to creditors. * * * Upon nearly all partial payments had been made at various times ; many of them had subsequently been bought up at a discount, and were held for the fund; many were still in the hands of the owners. The auditor, accordingly, computed interest on the face of all claims to November 1st 1864, and on all partial payments to same date, computed dividends on full claims and reported (1st) the amount of claims to November 1st 1864; (2d) dividends thereon; (3d) the partial payment with interest; (4th) balances of unpaid dividends. Such of the dividends as were due to actual holders, the confirmation of the report made it the duty of the assignee to pay out; the dividends upon such of the certificates and deposits as were in his own hands and Judge Kimmell’s constructively remained in his own hands, though in fact paid out before the filing of the report. The sum of these remainders of dividends went over into his second account, there to be claimed credit for in the name of the certificates. In this portion of the business, the auditors think the assignee acted with great improvidence. In his first account, he had, after giving dates of receipt to all other moneys received, charged himself with a large sum, $76,345.57, as received from John Anspach without date, yet forgetting that his <em>cestui que trusts </em>and creditors who were so largely interested would desire, and were entitled to receive the fullest light, he presented a second account in which he not only charged himself, in gross, without date, with the sum of $20,639.49 as received from Mr. Sharpe’s report, but in the long account footing up over $70,000 on each side, and concluding with a balance in his own favor, he does not insert a single date on either side, to the many scores of items. This account was filed 22d December 1868, and shows a balance in his favor of $799.41. Yet further to complicate the matter, during the period between 1864 and 1868, namely in 1867, the assignee had suggested to the stockholders, in response to their inquiries, when and how the trust would be ended, the propriety of their assessing themselves in sufficient sums to meet the deficiency as it then appeared. Having, with his counsel, made a calculation of the amount required, he reported to them that five <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>times the amount of their stock would be required of each for that purpose, with the assurance that an ample margin had been allowed by him, that a surplus would finally result and be returned proportionately to them. Many assented, and in the fall of 1867, gave to the assignee cash, or promissory notes or judgments, to the amounts of their assessments. Upon these notes and judgments various sums were subsequently paid by the givers to the assignee portions of them yet remain uncollected, but standing in th assignee’s name as collectable assets of the fund. Now, when the account of 1868 was filed and a balance shown in the assignee’s favor, many debts of the fund being yet unpaid, the assurances of 1867 were recalled; the assignee then said that he had been mistaken in his calculation in 1867, and that the assessments as collected, were insufficient to pay the indebtedness.” * * *</p>

Its value was not great. The other tract was of smaller size, but being undoubted coal-land, developed in working order, was deemed of great value. This tract was held by the cashier in trust for the fund as well as himself. William G-. Reed, the cashier, however, when on the witness-stand, said that presently after his discovery of the embarrassed condition of the fund, that John Anspach was its chief debtor; that in Anspach’s hands were most of the moneys of the fund, and that because of Anspach’s insolvency, they could not be recalled for the purpose of adding to the strength of the securities held by the fund. He (Reed) individually endorsed each and every obligation given to the fund by Anspach, thus pledging his own private estate to meet the assumed deficiency, and passing to the fund whatever interest he had in the title to the other tract of Anspach land which he had been holding for his own security. This being done, the assignee was entitled to demand and receive both tracts in their entirety. The testimony fails to show clearly when the assignee first began to move in the securing of these benefits or lands. He swears that he never received from Reed, cashier, either of the deeds for these lands. Reed, however, while admitting that for a time he did retain the custody of the deed which was meant to protect himself also, says that he gave the key of the safe, which contained all the papers of the fund, to the assignee, and thus, he thinks, turned over the deeds to him. Whether the assignee received the deeds or not, the fact that lands — woodland and coal-land — in Schuylkill county were held by the fund as collaterals, was then and before then well known <em>to </em>the directors and assignee. The assignee acted upon this knowledge, and, upon the invitation of Anspach, went to Schuylkill county, accompanied by several stockholders of the fund, to inspect the lands. The company was met by Anspach, who took them on the tract of coal-land, and from the elevation of the coal-breaker thereon erected, pointed out to them the tract encircling them as the one he had conveyed in trust to the fund.</p>

A man named Wood, known in former years to the visitors as a resident of Franklin county, was also met by the visitors, and he also cast doubts upon Anspach’s title. These declarations of Brock and Wood disheartened the companions of the assignee, and brought them to the conclusion that the tract, though plainly valuable, was yet to be of no benefit to the fund because of the insufficiency of Anspach’s title to it. They reported to Anspach the speeches of Brock and Wood, and were answered that, although there was some dispute, he thought his title good. Anspach had previously, by letter to the assignee, of 28th April 1862, represented the tract as a very valuable one in itself and to <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>the fund, saying that about 20,000 tons of coal had already been shipped. The assignee also swears.that prior to this visit he had consulted F. W. Hughes, a lawyer, long resident in Pottsville, in extensive practice, and familiar with the titles to coal-lands in Schuylkill county, about Anspach’s title, and had been advised by Hughes that Anspach’s title was worthless; that O. W. Davis, his counsel in Philadelphia, had also advised him to the same effect. With this advice, touching the validity of the title to these lands, and the information upon the value of the lands themselves, the party returned to Chambersburg and told the result of their inquiries to such of the stockholders as met them. Those at home seemed to fall in with the opinion of the visitors that nothing was to be expected from Schuylkill lands. No further steps were taken by the assignee in the matter. The lands v?ere left to remain from that time (May 1862) as before, in the hands and management of John Anspach, until after the settlement and adjustment between Anspach and the assignee on 18th June 1864, when Anspach gave the drafts for $28,000 to the assignee, and apparently wound up or arranged the last of his indebtedness. Then the assignee informed Reed he had settled finally with Anspach; that his (Anspach’s) indebtedness was secured, ar.d that he (Reed) should reconvey the Schuylkill lands to Anspach. Reed did this by deed of 21st July 1864.</p>

From this testimony it appears, first, that the assignee, when consulting F. W. Hughes, Esq., did so casually, exhibited to Hughes no papers or deeds, and in their brief interview so described the lands as to give Hughes the impression that the lands in question were those familiar to Schuylkill county men as the ‘Deborah Grant’ tract, to which in fact Anspach had no title.</p>

Upon it also was a breaker, built by Anspach at a cost of $60,000, and belonging to him, thus making Anspach’s interest in the tract worth in Í862 over $70,000; that all of these facts were well known to Mr. Hughes, who, as counsel for the Eoulkes and others, in opposition to Anspach, had arranged the compromise by which Anspach quieted his title to the tract. Says Mr. Hughes, ‘ had the consultation been a full and explicit one, these facts would have been communicated to the assignee, and he been informed that to this tract Anspach had an indisputably good title;’ the title of Anspach moreover was recognised by the Basts, who leased from him and paid him royalty during the years 1862,1868,1864. The assignee also testifies that he did not at any time record his deed of assignment in Schuylkill or Columbia counties, and therefore never officially entered those counties in quest of these lands.

The latter piece was valuable coal-land, with a mine in working order, and costly improvements thereon in Schuylkill county. These lands had previously been conveyed by Anspach to William G-. Reed, the cashier of appellant, the one to secure the appellant for advances made by it at various times to Anspach ; the other, to protect Reed, both as cashier, and for liabilities which he had individually incurred to the appellant, by endorsement and otherwise, for Anspach. Having discovered the embarrassed condition of the appellant and of Anspach, Reed had, previous to April 1862, endorsed every obligation held by the appellant against Anspach, and also transferred to the appellant all the interest he had in the tract of land which he had been holding for his own security.</p>

Within two weeks after the appellee’s appointment, his attention was called, by letter from Anspach, to the value of these coal-lands. He was then informed that 20,000 tons of coal had been shipped from one of the properties. He was invited to go upon the ground, and personally to examine the property. About two weeks thereafter he went to the mines in company with Anspach and some of the stockholders of the plaintiff. He went on the coal-breaker. Standing upon it, the surrounding lands were pointed out to him as those which Anspach had conveyed. He was satisfied of their value. But while on the ground they casually met two persons, one of them a stranger, the other previously known to them. Both of these persons cast discredit on Anspach’s title. The appellee afterwards consulted F. W. Hughes, a well-known lawyer of Pottsville, and at some time with O. W. Davis, his counsel in Philadelphia, in regard to the title. Each of them advised him that Anspach’s title was worthless.</p>
    <p id="b229-6" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[191,1113,1163,640]]]'>The deeds from Anspach to Reed were recorded in Schuylkill county in 1861. A deed in partition .conveying the lands to Anspach had been recorded there in 1858. The appellee made no examination of the records. He had never examined the deed of assignment. He remained in ignorance of the name of the tract on which the mines were located. He neither read any of the title-papers, nor, so far as it appears, did he inquire of any person the names of the tracts conveyed. He appears to have assumed, what the deed expressly denied, that the land conveyed was1 covered by the Deborah Grant survey. He submitted no title-papers to either Mr. Hughes or Mr. Davis» The testimony fails to show that he gave to Mr. Davis any information calculated to guide him in his investigations, or that Davis reported the specific investigations he had made, further than, he had gone into the county where the lands were situated.</p>

That nothing was said to him which led him to suppose the William Kichner tracts were the subject of inquiry.

The auditors therefore say, “ the assignee in fine seems to have suffered himself to be dissuaded from following up the lands by the loose declarations of irresponsible parties accidentally met, the hasty assertions of a lawyer given upon incorrect data furnished by the assignee himself, and the crude, ill-considered opinions of unqualified laymen.”</p>

    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[294,538,1162,347]]]'>The appellee further justifies his action in regard to the land, from the fact that some of the active stockholders of the plaintiff went upon the ground with him, and they also came to the same conclusion he did, in regard to Anspach’s title. A majority of the auditors found that this fact showed concurrent negligence on the part of the plaintiffs, and therefore refused to surcharge the appellee with any proceeds of the lands. The court confirmed the report.</p>
    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[293,882,1164,1341]]]'>Both court and auditors appear to have overlooked the fact, that none of the stockholders in any manner participated in the consultation which the appellee had with his counsel. There is no evidence that any of the stockholders had any information as to Anspach’s defective title, or that the appellee supposed they had any information, other than that which was acquired when they were on the premises together. This was manifestly so insufficient and unreliable that the appellee was not justified in predicating his final action either the facts there communicated, nor the opinion of any person known to have been formed on those facts. The appellee concedes the inadequacy of all the information there obtained, to lead to an intelligent opinion, by his endeavor to show that he afterwards consulted with a lawyer in regard to Anspach’s title. He did not then rely on any opinion those stockholders formed or expressed. A lawyer himself, he knew the necessity of getting the opinion of a lawyer familiar with land-titles. He well knew the value of a lawyer’s opinion depends on the fulness and entire accuracy with which the facts are communicated to him. The means of ascertaining the name of the tract on which the mines were located, were easily within his reach. His duty clearly required him to ascertain that fact and to communicate it to the lawyer whose opinion.he asked. We cannot see how any person, in the exercise of common prudence and care, would have done less. His failure so to do, united with his notice to Reed that the debt against Anspach was paid, thus causing him to reconvey, were such a dereliction of duty as clearly to constitute supine negligence and make him liable for the loss which the appellants thereby sustained. The learned judge, therefore, erred in not surcharging the appellee with such portion of the value of these lands as will equal the residue of the indebtedness due from Anspach to the appellants.</p>

This appears to have been done with the assent of the stockholders, and in some cases with their active co-operation. We therefore feel unwilling to say there is any error in the conclusions to which the court have arrived, other than as to the action of the appellee in relation to the coal-lands. The decree, therefore, should be so far modified as to surcharge the appellee with a sum equal to the residue of the debt due from Anspach to the appellants, and the residue of the decree be confirmed. .</p>
