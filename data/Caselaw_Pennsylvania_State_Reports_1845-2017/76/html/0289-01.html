It is very certain that the parties did not intend to make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, but the instrument operates as such according to adjudicated cases; therefore it cannot operate as a fraud. Also it could not tend to delay, hinder or defraud creditors, as there was no property out of which the creditors could be defrauded. The personal property in existence was all sold by the sheriff, independent of the deed of assignment. All of the iron now in controversy was created by the assignees with their own money or credit; no part of it belonged to Middleton, and the real estate had liens on it by mortgages and judgments to its full value, and nothing done by these parties prevented the creditors from selling it when they thought proper.”</p>

    <p id="b295-8" data-blocks='[["BL_295.9",295,[231,1177,1159,813]]]'>So far as the assignment sought to prefer a certain class of creditors in the property assigned, its provisions cannot be enforced. The assignment must be held to inure to the benefit of all the creditors in proportion to their respective demands: Act of 17th April 1843, § 1. It is not invalidated by this attempted preference : Law <em>v. </em>Mills, 6 Harris 185; Worman <em>v. </em>Wolfersberger’s Executors, 7 Harris 59. The other clause in the assignment, stipulating that the assignees shall carry on the business of manufacturing and selling iron, “ so long as the creditors may determine it to be to their interest to do so,” is clearly invalid as against the creditors of the assignor who did not assent thereto: Sheerer <em>v. </em>Lautzerheizer, <a href="/watts/6/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="6 Watts 543" data-case-ids="1846046" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0543-01">6 Watts 543</a>. Its effect, however, was not to hinder or delay such creditors. They were at liberty to proceed and sell any of the property assigned, with like effect as if the assignment had not been made. The assignment does not indicate any fraudulent intent. In law, however, it bound no creditor who did not assent to its terms. Hence the plaintiff had an undoubted right to seize in execution against Middleton any of the property covered by the assignment.</p>
    <p id="b295-9" data-blocks='[["BL_295.10",295,[230,1990,1152,215]]]'>The iron subsequently manufactured by the defendants stands upon a different footing. It was never the property of Middleton. It was the product of the capital and labor of the defendants. The fact that it was made at the furnace of the assignor did not give him any right of property therein.</p>
    <p id="b295-10" data-blocks='[["BL_295.11",295,[230,2204,1149,87]]]'>The charge of the court, and answers to the points submitted, contain a correct exposition of the law.</p>
