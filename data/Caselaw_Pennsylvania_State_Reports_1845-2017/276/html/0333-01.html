To overcome the presumption raised, the plaintiff has attempted to show by parol evidence that the execution of the papers was induced by the representations of the defendants that the notes should not be payable on demand, as expressed thereon, but should be paid out of the profits of the Kedward Dyeing Company, and out of them only, and consequently no personal liability of the plaintiff should exist.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b358-8" data-blocks='[["BL_358.8",358,[307,1745,1146,370]]]'>To sustain this contention, if permitted, it is necessary for the plaintiff to show by evidence which is clear, precise and indubitable, that such representations were the inducing cause for the execution of the notes, and this evidence must be by two witnesses, or by one witness and corroborating circumstances equal to a witness, because the defendants deny that any such agreement was made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b358-9" data-blocks='[["BL_358.9",358,[307,2127,1145,209]],["BL_359.1",359,[203,297,1150,1242]]]'>The first question, therefore, is, Was there sufficient evidence to justify a chancellor in sustaining the plaintiff’s contention? It is clear that no representations were made at the time of the execution of the papers. <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>At most, it was testified that during the conversations which took place prior to the execution of the papers, between the plaintiff and defendant, Robert W. Gilmore, the latter made the representations, and that Walter J. Gilmore was the agent of Robert, and knew of these representations and made his advances on the same basis. The plaintiff testified to the statement having been made by Robert, and that it was the inducing cause for the execution of the papers. Charles Gilmore’s testimony does not establish any such representations to plaintiff by defendants, but gives his general understanding as to what the arrangement was as to both himself and plaintiff. This is based principally by both plaintiff and Charles Gilmore upon the fact that Robert and Walter had money, and plaintiff and Charles had little, and that obligations for the money given could not be met by them, and therefore, they would have to be paid out of the profits of the company. This may be a reason upon which to found a conclusion such as plaintiff reached, but it is not, in our judgment, sufficient to supply the additional witness required, although no demand was made by defendants upon plaintiff for the payment of the notes, or interest thereon, for almost three years.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b359-3" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[202,1547,1147,87]]]'>On these grounds, we think the bill should be dismissed.</p>

If the contention of plaintiff is sustained, the only way the notes can be paid is out of the profits of the Wm. Kedward Dyeing Company. If there were no profits, the defendants could not recover their money. Does this destroy the notes? It is contended by defendants that t'he limitation of the payment of notes to a special <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>fund, can only be supported where there is such a fund, and the obligor has control over it. On the other hand, the plaintiff contends that as defendants had the money, and the plaintiff the experience, the joint venture was made upon the basis of each contributing what he had, trusting to the success of the business for a return for their contributions. Otherwise, if a failure, plaintiff would be individually liable for the amount of the notes he gave, and would also lose his services. It appears, however, that each member of the corporation received a weekly salary of fifty dollars, which, it may be assumed, was for the services they rendered. Upon the authority of Second National Bank of Reading v. Yeager, <a href="/pa/268/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="268 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1061548" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0167-01">268 Pa. 167</a>, we are of the opinion that the defendants’ view should be adopted, upon the ground that the agreement alleged would, if sustained, destroy the notes, and not vary them.</p>
