Defendant alleged certain latent defects in plaintiff’s work, but tbe latter contended that tbe trade acceptance precluded tbe setting up of these matters as a defense; tbe court below took tbei view that, since “tbe trade acceptance is still in tbe bands of tbe person to whom it was issued,” tbe affidavit of defense was sufficient to prevent judgment. On appeals like tbe present, this court never reverses unless clear and controlling error plainly appears (Commercial Motors Mfg. Corp. v. Stephenson, <a href="/pa/274/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="274 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1073091" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0171-01">274 Pa. 171</a>); and this We do not find.
