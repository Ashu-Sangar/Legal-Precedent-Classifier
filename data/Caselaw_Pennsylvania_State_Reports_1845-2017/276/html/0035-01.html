It recovered judgment against the copartnership and its members individually in New York and issued a foreign attachment in the Common Pleas of Allegheny County, under which the interest of Kaufman, the appellant, in certain real estate, was attached. He entered an appearance de bene esse for the purpose of challenging the jurisdiction of the court to maintain the writ, on the ground that he possessed no property within its reach, the real estate returned by the sheriff as attached having been conveyed by him to his wife some months prior to the issuing of the attachment in payment of an indebtedness, so he alleged, due by him to her. The property attached consisted of an undivided interest in real estate in the possession of tenants who were also served with the process and summoned as garnishees. The position of plaintiff is that this conveyance made by defendant to his wife through a third person for a nominal consideration was fraudulent and that, as to it, appellant has an interest in the property which is attachable. Appellant set up that he had incurred the indebtedness of his wife prior to the time the deed was made, and that it exceeded the value of the property, and therefore he had no interest in it.</p>

She testified in her husband’s behalf that she had loaned money and securities to him to an amount exceeding $30,000 — greater than, the value of the property conveyed to her; in plaintiff’s favor it was shown that in written statements signed by appellant shortly before the execution of the deeds -and intended to disclose his true financial condition, no mention was made of any indebtedness to his wife. It also appeared that in bankruptcy proceedings carried on against him subsequent to the time when it was alleged he had borrowed a considerable part of the money from his wife, he did not list her among his creditors. No notes or other evidences of indebtedness were given by the husband to the wife for the major part of the alleged debt.

Every creditor can test the bona fides of such a conveyance; hence, when it appears it was made after the debt to plaintiff arose, the latter has the right, after a sheriff’s sale of the husband’s interest, to contest the wife’s title in ejectment and the jury in that proceeding is the only one which could or should be allowed to pass on that dispute. If the wife desiies to assert her rights prior to the sheriff’s sale, her remedy lies at her hand under the doctrine announced in Hunter’s App., <a href="/pa/40/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="40 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="477694" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0194-01">40 Pa. 194</a>. It was admitted defendant was a nonresident of the State'; this being so, the question whether the writ would lie turned on his ownership of property within the jurisdiction of the court at the time it was issued: Mindlin v.

Page, <a href="/pa/63/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="63 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1018905" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0108-01">63 Pa. 108</a>, 123; Owecka v.

L. 1045, concerning fraudulent conveyances and which would seem to be a codification of the law on that subject, was passed after <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>appellant conveyed his property to his wife, it has a persuasive bearing on the question we are considering. It provides in section 9 that where a conveyance is fraudulent as to a creditor he may “disregard the conveyance and <em>attach </em>or levy execution upon the property conveyed.”</p>
    <p id="b64-4" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[300,611,1150,1725]],["BL_65.1",65,[145,274,1151,697]]]'>The second appeal is from the refusal of the court below to quash the writ of attachment because of the alleged defective return of service by the sheriff. This motion was not made until after the trial on the issue raised by the plea to the jurisdiction and the verdict in plaintiff’s favor. The basis for the motion is that the return is defective in not stating a material fact, that the garnishees, upon whom the writ was served, were tenants of the real estate <em>holding under the defendant. </em>The Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 581, section 49, prescribing how writs of foreign attachment shall be levied in the case of real estate, makes it the duty of the sheriff to leave “a copy of the writ with the tenant or other person in actual possession <em>holding under the defendant in the attachment </em>and to summon him as garnishee.” The sheriff’s return is that he served the writ “on the tenants in possession of the within described real estate” but it did not set forth that they were “holding under the defendant.” If the motion to quash the writ on this ground had been made at once, it might have prevailed, but it was not so made. Application to -set aside proceedings for irregularity should be made as early as possible: Poor v. Colburn, <a href="/pa/57/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="57 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="1010449" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0415-01">57 Pa. 415</a>; First Nat, Bank v.

Defendant could not hold back what should have been a preliminary move by him until he chanced a verdict: Daley v. Iselin, <a href="/pa/212/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="212 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="941854" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0279-01">212 Pa. 279</a>, 286. Furthermore, the record shows defendant had cured the defect in the sheriff’s return. In his affidavit filed in support of the plea to the jurisdiction, he averred that the leases with the tenants of the property had been transferred to his wife by operation of law as the result of the conveyance to her and “that said garnishees are lessees of the several <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>pieces of real estate described in, and attached by the said writ; that they were served and their names inserted in the said writ as garnishees by the sheriff, because they were respectively in possession of the several pieces of real estate described in and attached by the said writ which, as defendant has been advised and represents, is the method of service of said writ as prescribed by law.” Having admitted service on the garnishees in the manner prescribed by law, appellant could not attack the sheriff’s return as being faulty. He is in the same position as any other defendant would be with a defective return on the record, but admitting the validity of the service.</p>
    <p id="b65-3" data-blocks='[["BL_65.4",65,[137,983,1158,1297]]]'>For another reason not adverted to by counsel on either side, the writ could not be quashed. The garnishees entered a general appearance and moved for a .dissolution of the attachment; the rule was discharged. By their appearance they were in court, as was the property attached through service on them. With the record in this shape, defendant could not be heard to move to quash the writ, at least on the ground that the sheriff’s return was defective, because, by their appearance, the garnishees admitted they had been properly served. In Pottash v. Albany Oil Co., <a href="/pa/274/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="274 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1072944" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0384-01">274 Pa. 384</a>, 391, we said the garnishee, “Being in court by his general appearance, he could not object to the return day of the process which brought him there, it being a matter of indifference how he got there. But this did not affect his right, and does not here, to take any proceedings which one in court could properly take.” As to defendant this is a proceeding in rem; the garnishees having come into court, and brought the res in with them by their appearance, could not set up that there was a faulty return, nor can the defendant whose status in the proceeding is fixed by service on them; their bringing the property into court by appearance put it in court for all purposes so far as appellant is concerned, if he had any interest in it.</p>
