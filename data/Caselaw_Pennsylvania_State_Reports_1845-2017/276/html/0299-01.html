Ball, in its answer, asserts that the second codicil revoked the devise contained in the will to the petitioners, and that its effect was to vest the title to the whole of the. estate in the respondent.' The case hinges on the meaning of the words, in the second codicil, “my estate which is not part of the trust estate provided for in the first codicil shall be held in trust for the benefit of my son Arthur.” The respondent claims that this refers to the entire estate of the testator, except that part of the testator’s mother’s estate which Arthur had conveyed to him, while the petitioners claim that these words refer merely to Arthur’s share of the testator’s estate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[179,973,1150,916]]]'>We are clearly of opinion that the second codicil, by it's express terms, was intended to affect only the share of the testator’s estate which in his will he devised to his son Arthur, in fee. His language appears to be explicit. He says, “I order and direct in regard to my son Arthur,” and proceeds to establish a trust for him, having in the first paragraph of the codicil expressly ratified and confirmed the will in other respects. The obvious intention of the testator with regard to his son Arthur, was, at first, in his will, to give him his one-fourth share of the estate in fee. His first codicil dealt with Arthur’s share of his grandmother’s estate, conveyed to the testator by Arthur, and this after the death of. the testator’s wife he gave to Arthur and his wife for life, with remainder to their children. Then, in the second codicil, desiring to make a further change with regard to Arthur., and him alone, the testator established a trust for him.</p>

A codicil is intended to change the provisions of the prior will; that is its function; but the will continues, except so far as it is changed by express language or necessary implication, and in other respects the codicil is to be read and construed as part of the will. Cassidy’s Est., <a href="/pa/224/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="224 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="963105" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0199-01">224 Pa. 199</a>; Sigel’s Est., <a href="/pa/213/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="213 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="943441" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0014-01">213 Pa. 14</a>, and Schattenberg’s Est., <a href="/pa/269/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="269 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1063596" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0090-01">269 Pa. </a><a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a><a href="/pa/269/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="269 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1063596" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0090-01">90</a>, are in point. If the testator had intended to give his entire estate to Arthur or in trust for him, there would be no apparent reason for the testator’s apprehension that Arthur would interfere or “attempt to prevent the proper execution of this will or its codicils.” There would be no motive for him to do so, and it will be noted that the testator says, “the proper execution of this will,” which reference would be meaningless if, as it is contended, the provisions of the will as to the three other children were abrogated in favor of Arthur. And in this connection it will be noted that the testator provides in case of Arthur’s interference that “the above share shall be divided between the brothers and sister of said Arthur.” This use of the word “share” in the singular number shows very clearly that Arthur’s interest was only of an aliquot part of the estate, not the whole of it. And finally, if the testator, in his second codicil, had intended to devise the entire estate in trust for Arthur, there would be no reason for his recital of the fact that the indebtedness of Arthur had been satisfied as of the date of the codicil.</p>
