I do hereby make, constitute and appoint my wife, Anna Schwartz, to be executrix of this my last will and testament.”</p>
    <p id="b55-4" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[178,1100,1153,417]]]'>Appellants contend that Anna Schwartz took a fee, under section 9 of the Act of April 8, 1833, P.

We agree with the court below that Anna Schwartz took only what' the will, in plain words, gave her, — a life estate.</p>

Keppler, <a href="/pa/173/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="173 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="875865" data-case-paths="/pa/173/0181-01">173 Pa. 181</a>, chiefly relied on by appellants, a devise to a husband, “while he lives,” of the “whole income” of his wife’s estate, was construed to vest a fee in the devisee, under the Act of 1833; but there are material differences between the will then before the court and the one at bar, likewise in the circumstances attending the making of the two wills, all of which may be considered, in order to arrive at the present testator’s true intent, and to determine whether that case is controlling here. There, as pointed out at the beginning of Mr. Justice Mitchell’s opinion, the testator expressly disposes of “all such estate as it hath pleased God to intrust me with”; here, no such expressed intention appears. There, the testatrix gives “the whole income” of the estate to the devisee “while he lives,” without expressly saying, in connection with the devise, anything about the corpus; here, he in terms limits the devisee’s enjoyment of the corpus to a life estate. There, a person other than the devisee is appointed executor, and the husband, as devisee, is given “the right to sell any or all of the property” belonging to the testatrix; here, the devisee and the executrix are the same person, and, as previously suggested, the power of sale, in all probability, was intended for the executrix, so that' testator’s real property might be handled to the best advantage of both the devisee and the adopted son, who is the ultimate heir. There, the power of sale is absolute in <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>
      <em>form; </em>here, it is coupled with the words, “if she can get good prices,” which have a significance, so far as the present will is concerned, as hereinbefore said. On the whole, we feel that Kiefel v. Keppler is not a controlling authority in this case.</p>
