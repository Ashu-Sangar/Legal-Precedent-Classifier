That proportion of what? In effect, defendant says “of $16.67,” and would supply these figures so that it would read “for that proportion of $16.67 not exceeding $16.67.” To say the least, this would be a most awkward form of expression. Plaintiff would have the word “of” read “thereof.” This would make the phrase intelligible and state a proportion as it would then read “for that proportion <em>thereof </em>[of the full average daily profit previous to the fire] not exceeding $16.67 which the profit so prevented from being realized bears to the full average daily profit previous to the fire.” If the effect of the fire had been to entirely prevent the insured from carrying on his business, the company was to be liable “at the rate of $16.67 per day.” That is to say, if the lost profits amounted to that sum, then it was to be paid. It is difficult to comprehend why if the “buildings and machinery are so disabled as to prevent the full daily average profit yielded......previous to the fire from being realized” and where the partial loss amounted to $16.67 or more, that that sum should not be paid just as it would be required to be if the “insured shall be entirely prevented from carrying on the business.” When by the subsequent explanatory or intent-declaring clause the company endeavors to make clear the obligation assumed, it says, “The intention of this policy is that the insured shall be indemnified for actual loss of profits,” <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>and lie would not be so indemnified if Ms actual loss of profits equalled or exceeded $16.67 per day unless be was paid that sum.</p>

This is especially true when there are other indications as to what the intention was, as, for example, the prior conduct of the parties, as in Potthoff v. Safety Armorite Conduit Co., <a href="/ad/143/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="143 A.D. 161" data-case-ids="2489251" data-case-paths="/ad/143/0161-01">143 N. Y.

Supp. 994</a>, where a proposed form of contract which had been rejected clearly showed what the intention was, that particular form of contract having been rejected, not because of any objection to its form of stating the matter which was later the subject of controversy but because of other avowed reasons.</p>

For example, in Williamson v. McClure, <a href="/pa/37/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="37 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="418944" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0402-01">37 Pa. 402</a>, where there was an agreement to deliver bonds in a certain event, it was held that no delivery need be made even though the specified event had occurred, in the absence of a previous demand by the party entitled. The court looked to the “relation of the parties.” And in Hathaway v. Power, 6 Hill (N. Y.) 453, although premises attempted to be conveyed were described as being 160 acres, it was held they passed although there were actually 185 acres. In Edwards v. Jefferson Standard Life Ins. Co., <a href="/nc/173/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="173 N.C. 614" data-case-ids="11271344" data-case-paths="/nc/173/0614-01">173 N.

E. 695</a>, an instrument signed by two persons was held to be an assignment of the interest of both although the singular person had been used in the body thereof in describing the person affected thereby. In Pacific Surety Co. of California v. Toye, <a href="/mass/224/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="224 Mass. 98" data-case-ids="44297" data-case-paths="/mass/224/0098-01">224 Mass. 98</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20N.E.%20653" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="112 N.E. 653">112 N. E. 653</a>, the amount of the yearly premium on a bond was inserted, although a space in the instrument obviously prepared for the insertion thereof had been left blank, where the words and figures “Premium $5.00” were on the margin and oral evidence of the amount and promise to pay had been admitted without objection.</p>
    <p id="b555-3" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[165,917,1155,972]]]'>But even where the instrument as it reads is not ambiguous, words have been added and substituted where it was thought proper expression of intention required them. Thus, in Dodd v. Mitchell, <a href="/ind/77/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="77 Ind. 388" data-case-ids="1945360" data-case-paths="/ind/77/0388-01">77 Ind. 388</a>, the word “yearly” was inserted in a lease so as to change the price per acre named from a five year period to a yearly rental. In Killian v. Harshaw, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20N.C.%20497" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="29 N.C. 497">29 N. C. 497</a>, an entire clause was read other than as it was written because as written a party was liable to pay the same amount to two persons, while the court thought that no possible double payments had been intended. In Jackson v. Topping, 1 Wendell (N. Y.) 388, “and” was read “or” even where it worked a forfeiture. And in Holmes v. Parker, <a href="/ill/125/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="125 Ill. 478" data-case-ids="2935878" data-case-paths="/ill/125/0478-01">125 Ill. 478</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20N.E.%20759" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="17 N.E. 759">17 N.

Plaintiff was permitted to testify that the elements which entered into the loss of “fixed charges” he sustained, were interest on the money on the burned portion of the plant, which he placed at $750, also the wages of the superintendent and of certain men whose services it was necessary to retain until the build<a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>ing was ready for use, these being estimated at $3,815. Allowances for none of these could be made under the terms of the policy, which so far as recovery for fixed charges is concerned limits the insured to be reimbursed for <em>“fixed charges due, to the disablement of power plant and or power machinery, </em>causing cessation of the operation of the plant in whole or in part.” The “fixed charges” for which reimbursement is to be made are those due to the disablement of the power plant or power machinery, causing cessation of the operation of the plant; this could not include loss of interest, wages of a superintendent or of employees. In addition to this, it is manifest that in any proper statement of an account to show loss of profits, interest and wages paid would have to be considered, so that a specific allowance for them would necessarily duplicate defendant’s liability.</p>
