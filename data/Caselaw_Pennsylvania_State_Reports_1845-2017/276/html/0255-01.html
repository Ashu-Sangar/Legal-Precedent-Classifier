When we read the charge carefully, however, it will be seen that the words now objected to are used as explanatory of what the judge meant by the word “convinced,” which precedes them. The thought the judge desired to convey evidently was this: when the jurors came to consider defendant’s plea, they had to be convinced by the weight of the evidence of the truthfulness of the defense so far as it concerned defendant’s belief that, at the time he fired the shot, he was in danger of great bodily harm, and that, if there was a doubt in their minds, as to this, such doubt tended to show they were not convinced. There is not a word said at this point in the charge to indicate any specific measure of belief as essential to an acquittal; on the contrary, the excerpt now complained of occurs at a place where the trial judge was telling the jury the manner in which they should consider the evidence, not where he was directing them as to the result of such considerations. This being the fact, even <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>though the instructions in question may lack in explicitness, we are not convinced they contain misstatements of law harmful to appellant, without which he is not in a position to complain under his general exception to the charge, that being the only exception going to the matter under discussion.</p>
    <p id="b284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[264,650,1146,312]]]'>Finally, after reading the evidence, we feel that substantial justice was done defendant; for, on the proofs presented, he might have been convicted of murder in one of its degrees. While none of the assignments is in proper form, we have considered all and find no merit in any of them.</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[263,974,1144,313]]]'>The judgment is affirmed, and it is ordered that the defendant appear in the court below at such time as he may be there called and that he be by that court committed until he has complied with the sentence or any part of it which had not been performed at the time the appeal in this case was made a supersedeas.</p>
