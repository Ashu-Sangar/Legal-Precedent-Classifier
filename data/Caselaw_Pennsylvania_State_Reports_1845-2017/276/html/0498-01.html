      <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>Appellants contend that, from the will itself, without regard to rules of construction, it is evident testator intended the estate in question to pass to his descendants, whoever they might be, on the death of his last child; and, to sustain this position, they argue that when, in the eighth paragraph of his will, testator forbade his children, and their “heirs, executors and administrators,” from making any claim “other than what I have so <em>hereinbefore </em>devised and given them,” he showed his intention to limit their interests to life estates. Standing alone, these words might lend some force to appellants’ contention; but the claims to which testator refers are demands either against himself or his estate (“against me or my estate”), and the gifts to be forfeited, if such demands should be made, are “legacies and bequests hereby by me <em>before </em>given”; then, later in the same sentence, the will provides that, if any child make such claim, ‘the share which he, she or they <em>would have inherited </em>or taken, shall be divided and distributed among my other children aforesaid.” When read together, these provisions cannot be said to show clearly an intent of testator to deprive any of his children of an interest in the principal of his residuary estate, which is not mentioned or disposed of till the following (9th) paragraph of the will; and, even if we view it otherwise, considering, that the forfeited interests go to enlarge the shares of his “other children,” it would look as though testator considered these legatees as having vested interests. The 8th paragraph probably was intended to apply to the dispositions theretofore made, not to the principal of the residuary estate; also, testator (who, the will shows, had financial dealings with his children) probably had in mind, when he drew the 8th paragraph, claims against his estate of an adverse nature. Be these points as they may, however, the paragraph under discussion does not throw sufficient light on the question here involved to control the interpretation of the will.</p>

There the testator devised real estate to a trustee for the use of his son William, for life, and after the latter’s decease, in trust for his children and the lawful issue of deceased children, and, for want of such child or children or lawful issue, then in trust for the use of his (testator’s) “right heirs” forever, and the question arose as to whether testator’s “right heirs” were the “persons who were his heirs at his death......or those who were his heirs at the death of his son William.” In holding the former class took the estate, we said it is a “well settled” rule of the construction that “a devise or bequest to heirs, or heirs at law, of a testator,......will be construed as referring to those who are such at the time of the testator’s decease unless a different intent is plainly manifested by the will.” This rule has been frequently followed since: see McFillin’s Est., <a href="/pa/235/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="235 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="984846" data-case-paths="/pa/235/0175-01">235 Pa. 175</a>, 177; Tatham’s Est., <a href="/pa/250/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="250 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1017024" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0269-01">250 Pa. 269</a>, 276; and Groninger’s Est., <a href="/pa/268/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="268 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1061559" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0184-01">268 Pa. 184</a>, 188.</p>
