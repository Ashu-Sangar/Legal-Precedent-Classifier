This plan was carried out; an agent of defendants, sent to the field to examine the property, made a report on it, closing with the words “we [appellants] would unhesitatingly recommend the immediate development of the property and building a mill thereon.” The report did not show, and plaintiffs did not know, until subsequent to the judicial sale hereinafter referred to, that defendants were interested in the tract, the syndicate, or either of the companies; and the character of the report was isuch as to lead to the belief they were only acting as mining engineers, though, as stated, the fact' was otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[289,1220,1153,966]]]'>The report was delivered to a promoter, employed to ,solicit subscriptions to stock of the proposed company, (and was in fact used for that purpose, being shown by him to all of the plaintiffs (except William McK. Reed), none of whom “had any experience in or knowledge of t'he mining of lead and zinc ore.” Much of the evidence taken in the court below, and its findings are to the effect that a number of the statements made therein were calculated to mislead the proposed subscribers, and did mislead plaintiffs, who, by reason thereof paid for certain shares of stock of the proposed corporation, the property of which was later sold at judicial sale, realizing nothing for the stockholders; hence plaintiffs now claim to recover back the amount’s they paid for it. Appellants expressly admit that “in so far as any representations contained in t'he report may have been untrue, there can be no doubt of the soundness of the court’s conclusion.” Upon this basis we shall consider the appeals.</p>

It is unnecessary to consider these contentions ; other státements therein, also found to be untrue, were clearly as to matters of fact, with ample evidence to support them, notably that “twenty-six holes have been drilled upon this property......[which] show a consistent mineralized zone within the property, with assays running up to seven per cent and better. None of the drill holes were blanks, as all of them showed ore in goodly quantity”; the report adding, apparently in order to make certain that these statements would be accepted as true, “Inasmuch as the drilling was done under the supervision of our own engineers, we can guarantee their absolute correctness and authenticity.” So also the untrue allegation that the twenty acres “is surrounded on all sides by highly proven and developed properties,” was not only an averment of fact', but was calculated, in the strongest way possible, to deceive proposed subscribers, who knew that if on all sides of a given tract are “highly proven and developed” mining properties, the tract itself, in all human probability, would also be underlaid with the same kind of minerals. The court' below is criticized for quoting this statement without its context, which averred mills constructed or being constructed in a number of directions from the twenty-acre tract. But even if this is so, it does not necessarily determine that the tract “is surrounded on all sides by highly proven and developed properties,” especially as the alleged mills do not appear on properties to the north or northeast.</p>

So, also, if we eliminate the other findings which it is alleged had no evidence to support them, the judgments will stand. Unlike an appeal from a general verdict of a jury, without specific answers to questions submitted, we can here determine that in these false statements alone there was ample basis for the conclusion reached.</p>

The court below found that what was done in these respects was in “furtherance of the general object for which the representations complained of were made, and to give effect t'o those representations, and contributed to do so.” As these were facts or inferences which could be drawn from the evidence, we must accept them as true: Jamison v. Collins, <a href="/pa/83/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="83 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1050830" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0359-01">83 Pa. 359</a>; New York &amp; Penna. Co. v.

Of course a mere concealment of rele<a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>vant facts is not a legal fraud, as Bokee v.

Moreover, even if neither the evidence nor the findings on .these points were relevant to the issues raised, as we have already shown, no harm could be done to defendants thereby.</p>

This was not alleged as a defect in the court below, is not indicated in the assignments of error, and hence cannot be considered. Besides, while it is true there was no direct finding on the point, some of the representations were of such a character that defendants’ agent must have known of their falsity, and, this being so, defendants are liable thérefor, because the knowledge was acquired during the course of the agency: Griswold v.

Herein his case fails. He was not one of those whom defendants sought to influence. His testimony shows only that he relied considerably on his own knowledge of defendants, with whom he had been acquainted for about 25 years; that Mr. Gillespie spoke to him about the report, not in detail, but to the effect that defendants had made a wonderful report and he had checked it up with a number of men connected with them. This testimony is not supplemented by any other evidence on the point, and hence, since the representations were not made by defendants to him, or intended by them to be communicated to him, he cannot recover against them as for a deceit.</p>

Testimony to this extent was entirely wanting in this case.”</p>
