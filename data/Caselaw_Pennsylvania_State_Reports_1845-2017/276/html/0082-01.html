On the morning of May 3, 1920, plaintiff’s husband, Harry C. Riley, while at work for defendant as a clerk, complained of pain in his left chest and about three hours later coughed up blood, but continued at his work until evening. On returning home, Riley made light of his wife’s suggestion that he looked ill; but after supper he called on the <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>family doctor to whom he related his symptoms and also stated that while lifting an adding machine (weighing from forty to fifty pounds) that morning at his work he felt something give way in his left chest, followed by the pain to which we have referred, and later that evening made a like statement to his wife. The hemorrhages continued until Riley’s death therefrom twelve days later. No one saw the deceased lift the adding machine on the day in question, but he had sometimes done so on former occasions, and, while he told those about him in the office that morning, including the plant’s physician, of the pain and later of the appearance of blood, he said nothing about the adding machine or of any strain or accident. The referee rejected the claim for lack of proof, but the compensation board allowed it; the court of common pleas reversed the decision of the board, to whom the record was returned for a rehearing, where, after taking additional evidence, the claim was again allowed, but was again rejected and judgment entered for defendant by the court of common pleas; hence this appeal by plaintiff.</p>

This she sought to do by his declarations made to the doctor and also to herself, over ten hours after the accident; while in the meantime he had worked many hours, talked with many people, including his wife, ate his supper and gone to the doctor’s office. There is no ground upon which such declarations were competent as evidence.

Furthermore, <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>there is no evidence Riley met with any accident while in such employ; the mere fact of a pain in the chest, or of coughing up blood, does not prove an accident; all the medical evidence is to the effect that those symptoms might result from an injury or from a natural cause. True, the symptoms indicate a hemorrhage of the lungs, but that does not prove an accident; it often results, and in this case may have resulted, from tuberculosis, or the erosion of an artery, or a ruptured blood vessel, quite probably the latter. An enlarged blood vessel, or aneurism, not infrequently forms in the lungs of a man of the age (35 years) and apparent good health of Riley and will cause a pulmonary hemorrhage when ruptured, but, as such rupture may result from a natural as well as from an accidental cause, its occurrence does not prove an accident. The medical evidence is that while an aneurism is often ruptured by some extra strain, it does at times occur without such strain and even in sleep. There was no autopsy held; so, conceding that death was caused by pulmonary hemorrhage, there was nothing to support a finding that the hemorrhage was caused by an accident; this, in connection with the lack of any competent evidence of an accident, necessitated the rejection of plaintiff’s claim. It is the duty of the common pleas to ascertain whether there is evidence to support the findings- of the board and if, on such findings, the law has been properly applied; Kuca v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co., <a href="/pa/268/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="268 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1061509" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0163-01">268 Pa. 163</a>; Stahl v.

Here the controlling finding of the board was properly rejected by the court below because not supported by any competent evidence. True, the cause of death may be shown by circumstances (Flucker v.

      <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>The provision in sec. 427 of article IV of the Act of June 26, 1919, P. L. 642, 666, that, “If such court [of common pleas] shall sustain the appellant’s exceptions to a finding or findings of fact and reverse the action of the board founded thereon, the court shall remit the record to the board for further hearing and determination,” is to afford the claimant a full opportunity to prove every fact favorable to the claim, but that object is attained when the record has been once remitted, and the common pleas is not called upon to continue remitting the record on subsequent appeals, nor was the failure to do so in the present case error; see Kuca v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co. supra.</p>
    <p id="b109-3" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[250,987,516,42]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
