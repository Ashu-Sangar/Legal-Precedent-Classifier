By section 13 of the Act of July 27, 1842, P. L. 441, 446, it is provided: “That the board of revision in each county shall, on receiving the returns of assessors, proceed to examine and inquire whether the same have been made in conformity with the laws of this Commonwealth, and whether all property to be valued for taxation, for state and county purposes, has been valued at a sum or price not less than the same would bring after full public notice, at a public sale, supposing each separate lot or piece or tract of land, with the improvements, or the personal property of each individual, company or corporation only were to be sold. They shall receive and consider the written communication of any taxable inhabitant of the county, relative to any property which such taxable inhabitant shall beliéve to have been reduced too low, and on the day appointed for determining whether any property has been reduced too low...... they shall proceed to raise the price or valuation of any [such] property,......and may adjourn from day to day until the whole of such valuation shall have been revised, raised, and equalized.”</p>

It necessarily follows that they are vested with a reasonable discretion, in adopting such necessary and appropriate methods as will enable them to perform t'he duty imposed upon them, being re<a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>sponsible, of course, for any abuse of the power. It is clear, therefore, that it cannot be said, as a matter of law, and appellants do not aver it as a fact, that the employment of those who know what' the properties would bring separately “after full public notice, at a public sale,” is not a reasonable method of obtaining the necessary information.</p>
    <p id="b273-3" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[184,673,1149,970]]]'>It must be presumed, — omnia prsesumuntur rite esse acta, — and this bill avers nothing to the contrary, that defendants selected only disinterested and fit persons, to aid them in reaching a proper valuation of the various properties, as to some of which expert knowledge was required, notably in valuing the underlying coal, which could only be done after it' was known what was the quality, depth, continuity of seams, and facility for marketing it; facts which could be properly considered only by those fully acquainted with the subject, who had made, inter alia, a close study of mining operations, if there were any, and of bore-hole records, if there were not. So, also, it must be presumed, in accordance with the same maxim, that the commissioners, in valuing the properties, would consider the evidence produced by appellants and any other interested party, as well as the information obtained from the valuers, and would do their whole duty to the best of their ability.</p>

The only motive averred in the bill, for pursuing the course complained of, is that it was done for the purpose of “obviating the said irregularities” of the local assessors. This is not an objectionable reason; and even if it be true that the report' of the valuers was accepted in its entirety, this furnishes no reason for defeating or delaying the assessment, since by accepting the report the commissioners necessarily adopted the valuation as their own (Jermyn v. City of Scranton, <a href="/pa/186/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="186 Pa. 595" data-case-ids="989662" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0595-01">186 Pa. 595</a>, <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>601), and became personally responsible for all the results flowing from so doing.</p>

It follows, since the bill does not aver the absence of power, or a disregard of the Constitution or laws in the assessment, that equity is without jurisdiction: Banger’s App., <a href="/pa/109/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="109 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="542246" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0079-01">109 Pa. 79</a>; Pittsburgh, etc., Railway Co., v.

L. 133, and hence, as alleged, the valuations are illegal, must also fail; if for no other reason, then because the time for determining whether the fact was so, had not arrived when the bill was filed. The assessment was not then completed, and it must be presumed, since there is no averment to the contrary, that if, subsequently, it appeared too great a revenue was provided for, either that the county commissioners would reduce the rate, or would make a proper application to the court under the provisions of the statute.</p>

We have <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>neither power nor inclination to thus extend the jurisdiction of equity in this class of cases. When, as here, there is a duty to assess, and the means employed by defendants are legal, the only remedy open to one who alleges his property has been valued too high, is to follow the statutory method by appealing from the assessment. Any other conclusion might clog, if it did not stop, the wheels of government. Moreover, since the court may, under proper circumstances, consolidate the appeals, the trials need not be too numerous, and the difficulty and cost would be little, if any, greater at law than in equity.</p>
