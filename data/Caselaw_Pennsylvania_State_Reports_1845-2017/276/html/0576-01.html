    <p id="b599-10" data-blocks='[["BL_599.10",599,[156,1371,1151,428]]]'>The second question submitted by appellant is: “'Wh ere defendant fails or refuses, while under cross-examination, to answer material questions, should the. court, without request, strike out the evidence of defendant on direct examination?” This must be answered in the negative; appellant, at trial, not only failed to move to strike out the evidence now objected to, but likewise failed to protect himself in any other appropriate way.</p>
