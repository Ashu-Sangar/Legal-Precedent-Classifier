    <p id="b319-9" data-blocks='[["BL_319.18",319,[181,1288,1150,796]]]'>This is a workmen’s compensation case. The defendants, Smedley &amp; Mehl, were engaged in the lumber and coal business at Ardmore and David Rodman, the deceased, was their general superintendent for many years. In addition to supervision at the lumber yard, Rodman went out to collect bills, adjust complaints, get supplies for defendants, etc., so his work frequently took him away from the employers’ premises. On the afternoon of May 26, 1921, he mounted an out-going truckload of lumber and rode to Lancaster Avenue, where, in attempting to alight, he fell and was killed. His widow was awarded compensation, by the referee, which was affirmed by the compensation .board and court below; hence, this appeal by defendants and the insurance carrier.</p>

There was, however evidence, tending to show the deceased frequently got shaved at a barber shop near where he fell, and appellants earnestly contend that his death resulted while in pursuit of this purpose of his own. The referee might have so found, but it cannot be said there is no evidence to support the opposite conclusion reached by him. It is clear Rodman had not quit work for the day and while he did not disclose the purpose for which he left the yard, that might have been found from the circumstances: see Flucker v. Carnegie Steel Co., <a href="/pa/263/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="263 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1047525" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0113-01">263 Pa. 113</a>; also Zelazny v.
