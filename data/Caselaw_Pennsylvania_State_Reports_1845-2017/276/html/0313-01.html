    <p id="b336-7" data-blocks='[["BL_336.11",336,[288,896,1149,315]]]'>In this action of criminal conversation the trial judge entered a nonsuit because the statement of claim averred defendant had sexual intercourse with plaintiff’s wife “on or about September 7th, 1921,” while the proofs showed the intercourse did not take place on that date, but on August 26th or 27th.</p>
    <p id="b336-8" data-blocks='[["BL_336.12",336,[291,1220,1148,968]]]'>In Gardner v. Madeira, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Yates%20Sel.%20Cas.%20466" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Yates Sel. Cas. 466">2 Yates 466</a>, a criminal conversation action, tried before the Supreme Court at nisi prius, plaintiff declared that defendant on the first of January, 1796, and at divers other times from thence until the first of November following had unlawful relations with his wife. The plaintiff could not establish any improper “freedoms” (so the report says) between defendant and his wife within the times declared for, and then proposed to show other acts of lewdness subsequent to November 1st. The court determined that it would be a surprise to defendant not to confine the proofs to the times laid in the first instance; that “after laying a reasonable ground to infer an improper connection between the parties within the limited period, the court will be more liberal afterwards, in receiving other evidence of indecent conduct at different times, tending to show the criminal views and acts of the parties.” Following this ruling, the plaintiff suffered a nonsuit.</p>

It cannot be said that August 26th or 27th is so far removed from September 7th as not to be “on or about” it within a fair license in pleading. In a suit of this kind, the gravamen of the action is the adultery of the wife. If the proceeding was in the criminal court, the date laid in the indictment as in the statement and proof of another date within the statute, the defendant could be convicted: 2 Corpus Juris 22; Com. v.
