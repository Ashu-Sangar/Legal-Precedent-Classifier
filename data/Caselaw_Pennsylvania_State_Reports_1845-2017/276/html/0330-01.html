L. 521, and May 4, 1921, P. L. 341, is not supported by the authorities, nor is it agreeable with just principles of taxation. The grantor in the deed parted with her title before the passage of either of these acts of assembly. She reserved no right of revocation, nor did she retain the right of control, for her power exercisable jointly with the trustee to change investments is a very different thing; the terms of the trust were unchangeable. The deed was not executed with any int'ent to defraud the Commonwealth or to evade the law, nor was it made in such contemplation of death as to bring it within any applicable decision. As soon as the deed was executed, Freeman had a vested right in the property, only defeasible in case of his death (which has not occurred), when it would pass under his will, and his prospective right would have passed by his assignment to others: Serrill’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=15%20W.N.C.%20470" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="15 W.N.C. 470">15 W.

Had she added to the corpus, her transfer of fresh assets would be simply equivalent to making a new assignment of them in trust. This clause in the deed was obviously inserted to save the trouble of drawing another deed, but did not in any way affect the rights which had already passed.</p>
