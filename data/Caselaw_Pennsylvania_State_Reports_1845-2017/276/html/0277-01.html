L. 415, 422, appellees (as proponents of testator’s will, which had been lodged with the register of wills of Delaware County, pending proof of execution and probate), presented a petition to the orphans’ court of that county, asking it to require the register “to certify to the said court the entire record pertaining to the probate of the will.” The court accepted the petition and fixed a date for a hearing; whereupon the register, after notice of the action of the court, and without taking any evidence, not even the testimony of the subscribing witnesses, acted favorably upon a caveat filed by appellant, and sent the will to the court of common pleas of the county, with his precept directing an issue devisavit vel non to be there formed to determine whether or not the will was valid. This action by one who is clerk of the orphans’ court (Constitution of <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>Penna., article V, section 22), which prevented him from obeying its order, if it subsequently granted the prayer of the petition, would (if he was intentionally flouting the court’s authority, which we have no reason to believe) have been perilously near, if it was not actually, a contempt of court.</p>
    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[253,647,1150,747]]]'>In accordance with section 21 (a) of the act, proponents thereupon appealed to the orphans’ court from the decision awarding an issue, and then filed a petition in the court of common pleas and obtained a rule to show cause why the record should not be returned to the register, for transmission by him to the orphans’ court. The court of common pleas heard argument, made the rule absolute and directed the record to be so returned; therefrom the present appeal was taken by contestant only. Save as stated, proponents filed no paper in and sought no action by the court of common pleas. Subsequently, upon order of the orphans’ court, the register sent the entire record to it, and there the issue raised by the caveat is now pending.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[251,1406,1148,684]]]'>Appellant’s claim is that by section 17 of the act the register had power to grant an issue, despite the provisions of section 18; which power, since he took no evidence on the subject, was unaffected by section 21 (a). Appellees dispute both of these contentions, and particularly allege that the register’s award of an issue devisavit vel non under section 17, is, under section 21 (a), appealable to the orphans’ court, as of right, and no action of the register could deprive them of it. We sustain proponents on both these points. Section 17 is not a dominant section; on the contrary, when due application is made, it is subordinate to and controlled by each of the others.</p>

    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[297,1101,1149,1070]]]'>So, also, when the register has acted, and has granted an issue to the common pleas, section 21 (a) provides that “appeals may be taken to the orphans’ court,” from “all decisions granting an issue devisavit vel non”; and hence, when such an appeal is taken, this wholly defeats the prior action of the register in granting the issue. We find nothing in the statute which sustains appellant's argument that, when no evidence has been- taken by the register, his award of an issue is not a “judicial” act, and therefore section 21 (a) does not provide for an appeal. The act was passed to prevent1 the register, who was not required to be learned in the law, from awarding or refusing to award an issue because of ignorance, indolence, prejudice, favoritism, or for any other'nonjudicial reason ; hence it provided that in every “stage of the proceedings,” he should be under the control of the orphans’ court; if he has not acted, that court may take the record from him (section 18), and, if he has rendered a decision, any party interested may appeal therefrom to that court: section 21 (a).</p>
    <p id="b304-6" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[297,2183,1147,208]],["BL_305.1",305,[205,335,1150,914]]]'>The remedy provided by the latter section is at least as much needed where testimony has not been taken, as where it has been; and for that reason <em>“all </em>decisions granting an issue devisavit vel non” were expressly made <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>subject to an appeal. We construe “all” to mean “all,” unaffected by the word “judicial” appearing in the prior clause; and would do so even if it were admitted, which it is not, that the award of an issue, without taking evidence, is a ministerial and not a “judicial” act, while, if evidence is taken, it is “judicial.” This attempted distinction has no basis in the statute, and would pro tanto defeat its purpose. Indeed, if the word “judicial” is to have any bearing upon the question, we could only conclude that as “all decisions granting an issue devisavit vel non” are made appealable,; this is a legislative definition that “judicial” includes all such “decisions.” The cases cited by appellant have no relevancy since the passage of the Act of February 28, 1905, P. L. 26, now substantially reenacted in section 21 (a), supra; and the ingenious argument of her counsel, founded upon them, necessarily falls with them.</p>
