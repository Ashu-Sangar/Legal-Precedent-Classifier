Appellants\u2019 answer does not dispute the fact of compliance, but alleges the appeal should not be quashed, because to do so might thereafter \u201csubject [them] to the charge of violating the command of the court,\u201d as appearing in the peremptory writ. This, however, cannot be so. When a litigant obtains an order of the court, based on a fact averred by him, he is forever estopped, while the order remains in effect, from asserting, as against his adversary, anything differing from the fact so averred: Edwards\u2019 App., 105 Pa. 103; Garber v. Doersom, 117 Pa. 162; Donnelly v. Public Service Commission, 268 Pa. 345, 350. It follows that the general rule applies and the appeal should be quashed: Winston v. Ladner, 264 Pa. 548.\nAppeal quashed.",
