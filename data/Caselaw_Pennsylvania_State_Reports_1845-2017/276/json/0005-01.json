        "text": "Per Curiam,\nIn this case a final hearing was had on a bill in equity for an injunction. The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, on November 3, 1920, filed a formal adjudication, which, after stating, as conclusions of law, that \u201cthe pleadings and evidence do not make a cause cognizable in equity,\u201d and \u201cthe bill should be dismissed,\u201d ends thus: \u201cIn our opinion, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy is by action at law; if counsel for plaintiff so desires, we will certify the cause to the law side of the court, otherwise a decree dismissing the bill will be entered.\u201d On December 9, 1920, it was ordered that the \u201ccase be certified to the law side of the court for trial.\u201d Then the records show an order from the attorney for defendants, to the prothonotary of the court below, as follows: \u201cEnter final decree in the above case as provided for under Equity Rule No. 65.\u201d This rule directs that, \u201cIf no exceptions be filed, all objections shall be deemed to be waived and a final decree entered by the prothonotary as of course\u201d; but no such decree appears. Next, we find an order, dated February 14, 1921, that, on motion of the \u201cattorney for plaintiff,\u201d the case is certified \u201cto the common pleas side of the court for a jury trial as per order filed November 3,1920.\u201d Finally, in November 23, 1921, the court below, acting by both its president judge and the chancellor who had filed the adjudication, entered an order which directs that \u201cthe orders heretofore made, certifying this case to the law side of the court, be revoked and set aside, and the decree nisi, that the bill should be dismissed, be also revoked and set aside, as inadvertently made, and the case be reinstated for further hearing.\u201d In connection with this last-mentioned order, which is the one before us on the present appeal, the court below states the chancellor\u2019s attention had not been drawn to the fact that defendants\u2019 answers failed to set up any objection to jurisdiction in equity, and the omission to realize that no such objection had been made, accounts for the transfer of the cause to the other side of the court.\nThe revoked orders, avowedly, were irregular attempts to follow the Act of June 7, 1907, P. L. 440, which provides that, if want of jurisdiction in equity is not \u201cexplicitly\u201d raised, by \u201cdemurrer or answer,\u201d it shall be deemed to have been waived by both parties and the cause shall proceed to final hearing as though trial without a jury had been agreed upon; and, when the question of jurisdiction is properly raised, \u201cIf the court shall decide that the suit should have been brought at law, it shall certify the case to the law side of the court',\u201d \u2014 not that it \u201cshall dismiss the bill\u201d and certify the case. Here, while certain references are made in the adjudication to the dismissal of the bill, no actual decree to this effect appears on the record and the case is still pending. All the above-recited orders and decrees are interlocutory and unappealable; hence appellee\u2019s motion to quash must prevail.\nThe appeal is quashed at cost of appellants.",
