Where defendant fails or refuses, while under cross-examination, to answer material questions, it is plaintiff\u2019s duty to move to strike out the evidence of defendant on direct examination, and to protect himself in other appropriate ways, if he desires to raise the question on appeal; it is not the duty of the court to strike out the evidence, without request.\nArgued Februray 12, 1923.\nAppeal, No. 70, Jan.
