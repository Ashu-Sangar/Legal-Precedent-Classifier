        "text": "OPINION\nJustice TODD.\nThis matter comes to us upon Appellant\u2019s interlocutory appeal from an order of the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas. In this capital case, the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania held that Appellant Scott Wayne Blystone was entitled to receive a new sentencing hearing after concluding that his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and develop penalty-phase mitigating evidence in the form of institutional records and expert mental-health evidence. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, and Appellant presently awaits a new penalty-phase hearing following the completion of discovery.\nThroughout the course of counsel\u2019s current mitigation investigation, Appellant\u2019s mother, Norma Blystone, has consistently refused to divulge certain information regarding Appellant\u2019s childhood\u2014which Appellant deems \u201ccritical\u201d\u2014unless she is assured that the information she provides will not be made public. In an attempt to provide Mrs. Blystone with such assurances and to obtain this additional information from her, Appellant filed a motion in the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County for limited courtroom closure and temporary sealing of transcripts with respect to Mrs. Blystone\u2019s testimony, any expert testimony addressing the information Mrs. Blystone reveals, and any closing arguments referencing such testimony. The trial court denied the motion, and Appellant has filed an interlocutory appeal from that order pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 313. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that our Court lacks jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s interlocutory order denying Appellant\u2019s closure motion, and, accordingly, this appeal must be quashed.\nI. Background\nThe facts underlying Appellant\u2019s conviction are set forth more fully in this Court\u2019s opinion resolving Appellant\u2019s direct appeal, see Commonwealth v. Blystone (\u201cBlystone I\u201d), 519 Pa. 450, 549 A.2d 81 (1988); however, a brief recitation of those facts is necessary to provide context to the instant matter. On September 9, 1983, at approximately 12:00 a.m., Appellant was driving with his girlfriend and two others, when he picked up a hitchhiker and later robbed and murdered him, shooting him in the back of the head. Appellant was charged with first-degree murder, robbery, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and conspiracy to commit robbery. Following a jury trial in the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas, he was found guilty of each of the aforementioned crimes.\nDuring Appellant\u2019s penalty-phase hearing, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel elected not to offer any mitigating evidence. Ultimately, the jury found one aggravating circumstance\u2014that Appellant killed the victim in the perpetration of a felony\u2014 and it sentenced Appellant to death pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv) (\u201cThe verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d) and no mitigating circumstance.\u201d). Appellant also received a consecutive sentence of 10 to 20 years imprisonment for his robbery conviction. Appellant appealed his judgment of sentence, and, on October 17, 1988, this Court affirmed. Blystone I.\nThereafter, on October 12, 1995, Appellant, represented by new counsel, filed a petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), raising various claims of ineffectiveness of trial counsel, trial court error, and constitutional violations. Relevant to the instant matter, Appellant asserted, inter alia, that his counsel was ineffective for failing to offer mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his capital trial and, more specifically, for failing to interview his family about mitigating evidence concerning his childhood. During the ensuing PCRA hearing, Appellant offered a variety of mitigation evidence that he claimed was available to counsel at the time of trial, including testimony from, inter alia, his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Blystone; Dr. Patricia Fleming, a clinical psychologist and neuropsychologist; and Dr. Alec Whyte, a psychiatrist, as well as affidavits from Mr. and Mrs. Blystone; Appellant\u2019s sisters, Cynthia Gaye Guthrie and Julie Ann Dice; and others.\nAppellant\u2019s father, Norman Blystone, testified that Appellant frequently acted out and that he used corporal punishment to discipline Appellant approximately once or twice a week beginning when Appellant was seven or eight years old until his early teenage years. N.T. Hearing, 11/3/1995, at 100-03. Mr. Blystone described that he used various methods of disciplining Appellant, including whipping him with a belt, slapping him with his hands, and kicking him. Id. at 104. Additionally, Mr. Blystone stated that Appellant\u2019s prior counsel did not discuss mitigating circumstances with him prior to Appellant\u2019s trial and did not ask him to aid with obtaining his son\u2019s school, military, or medical records. Id. at 94. Mr. Blystone\u2019s affidavit contained similar information, stating that he \u201cwas the disciplinarian in the family,\u201d and that he punished Appellant more than his other children. Affidavit of Norman Blystone, 10/5/1995, at 3.\nMrs. Blystone stipulated that she would testify to the same information as Mr. Blystone. N.T. Hearing, 11/3/1995, at 126. Additionally, with respect to Mr. Blystone\u2019s use of corporal punishment, Mrs. Blystone testified that there were times that she tried to stop Mr. Blystone from using such punishment on Appellant and that there were times that she felt that Mr. Blystone\u2019s actions in disciplining Appellant were excessive. Id. at 127. Mrs. Blystone explained that, when she felt that her husband was being excessive, she would try to talk to him about it, which sometimes developed into an argument; however, she claimed that, \u201cmost of the time,\u201d she was successful in getting her husband to stop. Id. at 128. Additionally, Mrs. Blystone stated in her affidavit that her husband was the family\u2019s disciplinarian, that he was \u201cvery stern\u201d with Appellant, and that he punished Appellant more than the other children, and did so with his belt or his hand. Affidavit of Norma Blystone, 10/5/1995, at 2.\nThe affidavits of Appellant\u2019s sisters similarly revealed that Mr. Blystone set the rules in the house, disciplined the children, and was \u201cvery strict.\u201d Affidavit of Julie Ann Dice, 10/5/1995, at 1. The affidavits further described that Appellant \u201cgot the most whippings,\u201d \u201ccouldn\u2019t learn from being punished,\u201d and \u201ccouldn\u2019t stay out of Dad\u2019s way.\u201d Affidavit of Cynthia Gaye Guthrie, 10/5/1995, at 2.\nDr. Fleming testified that she diagnosed Appellant with organic brain damage, bipolar mood disorder, polysubstance abuse, and borderline personality disorder, N.T. Hearing, 11/14/1996, at 46, 48, 63, 54, based upon her clinical interviews and psychological testing of Appellant, Appellant\u2019s life history, and her review of Appellant\u2019s Department of Corrections, hospital, and navy records. Id. at 19\u201421, 27. Specifically, Dr. Fleming explained that Appellant developed bipolar personality disorder, in part, because he was \u201ctruly abused physically over a long period of time,\u201d the abuse was \u201cinconsistent, it was irrational, and not based on fact,\u201d and, thus, \u201c[Appellant] did not know how to deal with the world\u201d and \u201cwithdrew.\u201d Id. at 49.\nDr. Whyte testified that, based upon his interview with Appellant, his review of affidavits from Appellant\u2019s mother, father, and other family members, and his review of Appellant\u2019s correctional institution records, navy records, and hospital records, id. at 69-70, he diagnosed Appellant with borderline personality disorder, bipolar mood disorder, and organic personality disorder. Id. at 74-76.\nAdditionally, Appellant introduced various institutional records, including a Mayview State Hospital competency evaluation report diagnosing Appellant with antisocial personality disorder, Department of Correction Records from Appellant\u2019s previous incarceration in Maryland documenting Appellant\u2019s good behavior in prison and various health issues, and records from the Navy recommending Appellant be discharged due to the severity of his personality disorder.\nOn January 4, 1996, the PORA court denied Appellant\u2019s petition, specifically finding, with respect to Appellant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to prepare mitigation evidence, that trial counsel interviewed Appellant and his family regarding potential mitigating evidence and discrediting testimony from Appellant\u2019s family to the contrary. Appellant appealed, and this Court affirmed, concluding, inter alia, that Appellant\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence because Appellant refused to allow mitigating evidence to be presented on his behalf. Com monwealth v. Blystone (\u201cBlystone II\"), 555 Pa. 565, 725 A.2d 1197, 1205-06 (1999).\nAppellant subsequently filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, and supplement thereto, with the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, again alleging that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and introduce available mitigating evidence. Relying upon the PCRA court\u2019s credibility determinations, the district court rejected Appellant\u2019s contention that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and develop lay-witness mitigation testimony; however, the district court found that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel was indeed ineffective for failing \u201cto investigate and present expert mental health mitigation evidence and mitigation evidence of his good conduct in prison and lack of future dangerousness if sentenced to life in prison.\u201d Blystone v. Horn, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40922, *116 (W.D.Pa. filed Mar. 31, 2005). Thus, the district court granted the writ of habeas corpus with respect to Appellant\u2019s death sentence on March 31, 2005, and found that he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing. The Third Circuit affirmed on December 22, 2011. Blystone v. Horn, 664 F.3d 397 (3d Cir.2011).\nThereafter, the sentencing court appointed Appellant new counsel for the penalty-phase hearing. In preparation for the hearing, Appellant\u2019s counsel began conducting discovery and investigating potential mitigation witnesses, including Mrs. Blystone. Mrs. Blystone indicated the existence of dysfunction and trauma within Appellant\u2019s family during the interview, but, fearing that her husband would grow upset if she revealed the information, she refused to divulge specific details unless she was assured the information would not be made public. Mrs. Blystone was similarly evasive when interviewed by Dr. Leslie Lebowitz, a psychologist appointed by the court to evaluate the mitigating impact of Appellant\u2019s traumatic upbringing, again refusing to reveal additional information about the dysfunction and trauma within Appellant\u2019s family unless Dr. Lebowitz could promise her that it would not be made public.\nAs a result of Mrs. Blystone\u2019s refusal to cooperate, Appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion for limited courtroom closure and temporary sealing of transcripts, seeking closure of the courtroom during Mrs. Blystone\u2019s testimony regarding Appellant\u2019s traumatic upbringing, during expert testimony discussing the same, and during closing arguments referring to such evidence, as well as seeking the temporary sealing of the related transcripts until Mrs. Blystone and her husband passed away. In support of closure, Appellant asserted that Mrs. Blystone \u201chas considerable information concerning abuse suffered by [Appellant] at the hands of his father\u201d which she would not reveal \u201cabsent a guarantee that the media and the public (and, by extension, her husband) will not be privy to the details of her testimony.\u201d Closure Motion, 7/9/2014, at 7. Appellant claimed that his right to present all available mitigating evidence and, thus, his right to a fair trial, outweighed the public\u2019s right to access criminal proceedings under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 7 and 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and that closure was narrowly tailored to the objective of eliciting Mrs. Blystone\u2019s testimony because the closure would be limited to Mrs. Blystone\u2019s testimony, and expert testimony and closing arguments addressing that testimony. Appellant also maintained that there were no reasonable alternatives to closure available which would address Mrs. Blystone\u2019s concern about her husband learning of the substance of her testimony.\nAdditionally, Appellant\u2019s counsel submitted an affidavit from Dr. Lebowitz with the motion, which detailed Mrs. Blystone\u2019s lack of cooperation and opined that \u201c[a]lthough [Dr. Lebowitz] cannot be certain of the precise nature of the information,\u201d she is \u201cconfident that it relates to [Mrs. Blystone\u2019s] perspective on the dysfunction that has marked this family over the course of fifty years, and it may include other, as-of-yet undisclosed anecdotes of abuse and dysfunction that she has witnessed.\u201d Declaration of Leslie Lebowitz, P.H.D., 1/27/13, at 3.\nThe trial court ultimately denied Appellant\u2019s motion, concluding the motion \u201cwas not sufficient to warrant an Order overcoming the presumption of openness of trials\u201d articulated in Commonwealth v. Fenstermaker, 515 Pa. 501, 530 A.2d 414 (1987). Trial Court Order, 3/19/2014, at 1. In support of its decision, the trial court noted that the motion did not aver that Appellant attempted to subpoena Mrs. Blystone or use other means to gain her cooperation, nor did it suggest there would be any risk to Mrs. Blystone\u2019s life or physical safety if she testified. Additionally, the court highlighted that Appellant filed the motion months before trial and before discovery had been completed, rendering the motion premature. Appellant presently appeals the trial court\u2019s interlocutory order pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 313(b), asserting the trial court erred in denying his closure motion.\nII. Jurisdiction\nBefore we may entertain the merits of Appellant\u2019s underlying claim, we must first determine whether this Court has jurisdiction to consider the appeal under Pa.R.A.P. 313(b). Although the Commonwealth has not raised a question regarding our jurisdiction over the trial court\u2019s interlocutory order denying closure, we may nevertheless raise the issue of jurisdiction sua sponte, Commonwealth v. Shearer, 584 Pa. 134, 882 A.2d 462, 465 n. 4 (2005).\nIt is well settled that, generally, appeals may be taken only from final orders; however, the collateral order doctrine permits an appeal as of right from a non-final order which meets the criteria established in Pa.R.A.P. 313(b). Commonwealth v. Wright, 621 Pa. 446, 78 A.3d 1070, 1077 (2013). Pa.R.A.P. 313 is jurisdictional in nature and provides that \u201c[a] collateral order is an order [1] separable from and collateral to the main cause of action where [2] the right involved is too important to be denied review and [3] the question presented is such that if review is postponed until final judgment in the case, the claim will be irreparably lost.\u201d Pa.R.A.P. 313(b). Thus, if a non-final order satisfies each of the requirements articulated in Pa.R.A.P. 313(b), it is immediately appealable. Wright, 78 A.3d at 1077. However, we \u201cconstrue the collateral order doctrine narrowly\u201d so as to \u201cavoid \u2018piecemeal determinations\u2019 \u201d and protracted litigation. Rae v. Pa. Funeral Dirs. Ass\u2019n, 602 Pa. 65, 977 A.2d 1121, 1129 (2009).\nWith respect to the first prong of the collateral order doctrine, an order is separable from the main cause of action \u201cif it can be resolved without an analysis of the merits of the underlying dispute.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 624 Pa. 405, 86 A.3d 771, 781 (2014). Stated differently, an order is separable if it is \u201centirely distinct\u201d from the underlying issue in the case. Id. at 782. Although we tolerate a degree of interrelatedness \u201cbetween merits issues and the question sought to be raised in the interlocutory appeal,\u201d the claim must nevertheless be \u201cconceptually distinct from the merits of plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d Pridgen v. Parker Hannifin Corp., 588 Pa. 405, 905 A.2d 422, 433 (2006) (quoting Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 314, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995)).\nAs to the second prong, for purposes of Rule 313(b), a right is important if \u201cthe interests that would go unprotected without immediate appeal are significant relative to the efficiency interests served by the final order rule.\u201d Williams, 86 A.3d at 782. Additionally, \u201cthe order [must] involve[ ] rights deeply rooted in public policy going beyond the particular litigation at hand,\u201d and \u201c[i]t is not sufficient that the issue is important to the particular parties involved.\u201d Id.\nUpon review, in the present case, regardless of whether the order is separable from the main cause of action, and regardless of whether Appellant\u2019s right to investigate and present mitigating testimony from his mother at his capital sentencing hearing may be deemed important for purposes of Rule 313(b), we find that Appellant\u2019s claimed need for closure to vindicate this right will not be irreparably lost if review is postponed until after the sentencing hearing; thus, his claim fails the third prong of the collateral order doctrine. This case is unlike, for example, an interlocutory appeal of an order directing the discovery of privileged material, the prototypical example of a collateral order. See, e.g., Williams, supra; Commonwealth v. Harris, 612 Pa. 576, 32 A.3d 243 (2011); Ben v. Schwartz, 556 Pa. 475, 729 A.2d 547 (1999). In such cases, we have noted that \u201c[o]nce putatively privileged material is in the open, the bell has been rung, and cannot be unrung by a later appeal\u201d because the disclosure of such material \u201ceffectively destroy[s]\u201d any privilege. Harris, 32 A.3d at 249. By contrast, Appellant may challenge the trial court\u2019s order denying his closure request on appeal after final judgment, and, should we determine that the trial court erred in denying closure, we could vacate the judgment of sentence and order a new sentencing hearing at which Appellant would be entitled to introduce the testimony from Mrs. Blystone in partially closed proceedings. In short, his claimed right will not be irreparably lost. Thus, because any error by the trial court in denying Appellant\u2019s closure motion is fully remediable after final judgment, it does not satisfy the third prong of the collateral order doctrine.\nAccordingly, as Appellant has not satisfied the final prong of the collateral order doctrine, we are constrained to conclude the trial court\u2019s order is not appealable under Pa.R.A.P. 313(b). Thus, because we lack jurisdiction to consider the instant appeal, we find the appeal must be quashed.\nAppeal quashed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nJustices BAER and STEVENS join the opinion.\nChief Justice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\n. We have jurisdiction over direct capital appeals pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(4). Additionally, \u201c[a]n appeal authorized by law from an interlocutory order in a matter shall be taken to the appellate court having jurisdiction of final orders in such matter.\u201d Id. \u00a7 702(a).\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546.\n. Appellant merely cites Pa.R.A.P. 313(b) in his jurisdictional statement as the basis for our jurisdiction over this matter, but does not otherwise offer any argument as to how, specifically, the trial court\u2019s interlocutory order satisfies Pa.R.A.P. 313(b). The Commonwealth does not challenge this basis for jurisdiction.",
