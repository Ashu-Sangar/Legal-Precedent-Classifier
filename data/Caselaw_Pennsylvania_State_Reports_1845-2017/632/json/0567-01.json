The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n(1) Whether the Pennsylvania conflict of interest law is unconstitutionally vague on its face, and whether as applied in this case the trial court improperly expanded the definition of \u201cprivate pecuniary interest\u201d to include \u201cintangible political gain,\u201d thereby threatening the constitutional rights of all elected officials in Pennsylvania.\n(2) Whether the restitution ordered in this case was improper[ ] because the Commonwealth cannot be a victim under the subject criminal statutes.",
