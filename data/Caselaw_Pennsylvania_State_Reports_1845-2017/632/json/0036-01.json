        "text": "OPINION\nJustice TODD.\nIn this direct appeal, we address questions regarding the constitutionality and severability of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(a)\u2014 which imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of two years total confinement upon a defendant for a conviction if a delivery or possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance occurs within 1,000 feet of, inter alia, a school\u2014in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alleyne v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). In that decision, the United States Supreme Court held that, under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt any facts that increase a mandatory minimum sentence. In the matter sub judice, the Commonwealth concedes that certain provisions of Section 6317 are unconstitutional in the wake of Alleyne. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth submits that those provisions are severable, and, thus, the statute is capable of application once the violative provisions are excised. While we do not question the legislature\u2019s wisdom or the necessity of severe penalties for those dealing in illegal drugs near our Commonwealth\u2019s schools, for the reasons that follow, we are constrained to conclude that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alleyne renders Section 6317 unconstitutional and, further, that, in light of clear legislative intent, severance of the violative provisions from the statute is not permissible. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the trial court, which held Section 6317 to be unconstitutional and that its violative provisions were not severable.\nThe factual and procedural background of this matter is as follows. On March 27, 2013, the Pennsylvania State Police filed a criminal complaint against Appellee Kyle Hopkins charging him with various violations of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 780-101 et seq. The charges arose from three incidents, which took place over three days in April 2012, during which Appellee sold heroin to a confidential informant in Kennett Square Borough and New Garden Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. One sale allegedly occurred in a school zone. Appellee was held for court on all charges, which included three counts of Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30); three counts of Criminal Use of a Communication Facility, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7512(a); three counts of Possession of a Controlled Substance, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(16); and three counts of Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(32). Approximately two weeks later, the Chester County District Attorney\u2019s office filed a criminal information charging Appellee with the 12 counts noted above.\nAnticipating the Commonwealth would seek the mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317, on October 31, 2013, Appellee filed a Motion for Extraordinary Relief contending Section 6317 was unconstitutional. Judge David Bortner of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County held a hearing on November 14, 2013. Five days later, the Commonwealth filed an amended criminal information to include notice that the Commonwealth sought the mandatory minimum sentence required by Section 6317. The trial court, however, granted Appellee\u2019s motion on December 17, 2013, declaring Section 6317 to be unconstitutional in its entirety.\nThe trial court reasoned that it was bound by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alleyne, which held that facts which increase the mandatory minimum sentence are an element of the offense which must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. The court opined that Section 6317(b) placed facts determining the applicability of the mandatory minimum sentence in the hands of the sentencing court and that such determination was based upon the preponderance of the evidence in violation of Alleyne. Trial Court Order, 12/17/13, at 1 n. 1. The court also rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that the Alleyne defect could be cured by adding a special interrogatory to the verdict slip. Id. Six days later, the Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal to our Court.\nBefore our Court, the Commonwealth raises the following issue for our review:\nWhether the trial court erred in concluding that 18 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 6817, titled, \u201cDrug-Free School Zones\u201d, is unconstitutional in its entirety, based upon Alleyne v. United States, where those provisions of \u00a7 6317 that do not comply with Alleyne are clearly severable from the remainder of the statute?\nCommonwealth\u2019s Brief at 5.\nBefore considering the arguments of the parties, we set forth a brief background of the law informing this appeal. As discussed more fully below, in 2013, the United States Supreme Court rendered its decision in Alleyne, in which it held that any fact which increases a mandatory minimum sentence is an \u201celement\u201d of the crime, and not a \u201csentencing factor,\u201d and, thus, must be submitted to the jury pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nThe focus of the Alleyne challenge in this appeal is Section 6317 of the Crimes Code, entitled \u201cDrug-free school zones\u201d\u2014a statutory provision first enacted in 1997, which sets forth a mandatory minimum sentence of two years total confinement if delivery of, or possession with intent to deliver, a controlled substance occurs within 1,000 feet of a school, college, or playground. Section 6317 states in full:\n(a) General rule.\u2014A person 18 years of age or older who is convicted in any court of this Commonwealth of a violation of section 13(a)(14) or (30) of the act of April 14, 1972 (P.L. 233, No. 64), known as The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, shall, if the delivery or possession with intent to deliver of the controlled substance occurred within 1,000 feet of the real property on which is located a public, private or parochial school or a college or university or within 250 feet of the real property on which is located a recreation center or playground or on a school bus, be sentenced to a minimum sentence of at least two years of total confinement, notwithstanding any other provision of this title, The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act or other statute to the contrary. The maximum term of imprisonment shall be four years for any offense:\n(1) subject to this section; and\n(2) for which The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of less than four years.\nIf the sentencing court finds that the delivery or possession with intent to deliver was to an individual under 18 years of age, then this section shall not be applicable and the offense shall be subject to section 6314 (relating to sentencing and penalties for trafficking drugs to minors).\n(b) Proof at sentencing.\u2014The provisions of this section shall not be an element of the crime. Notice of the applicability of this section to the defendant shall not be required prior to conviction, but reasonable notice of the Commonwealth\u2019s intention to proceed under this section shall be provided after conviction and before sentencing. The applicability of this section shall be determined at sentencing. The court shall consider evidence presented at trial, shall afford the Commonwealth and the defendant an opportunity to present necessary additional evidence and shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence if this section is applicable.\n(c) Authority of court in sentencing.\u2014There shall be no authority for a court to impose on a defendant to which this section is applicable a lesser sentence than provided for in subsection (a), to place the defendant on probation or to suspend sentence. Nothing in this section shall prevent the sentencing court from imposing a sentence greater than that provided in this section. Sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing shall not supersede the mandatory sentences provided in this section. Disposition under section 17 or 18 of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act shall not be available to a defendant to which this section applies.\n(d) Appeal by Commonwealth.\u2014If a sentencing court refuses to apply this section where applicable, the Commonwealth shall have the right to appellate review of the action of the sentencing court. The appellate court shall vacate the sentence and remand the case to the sentencing court for imposition of a sentence in accordance with this section if it finds that the sentence was imposed in violation of this section.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317.\nWhile the present challenge is to the constitutionality of Section 6317, it is axiomatic that, even if certain provisions of a statute are deemed to run afoul of the federal or state Constitution, portions of the statute which are not so offensive may retain their viability through judicial severing of those sections from the sections that are unconstitutional. The General Assembly has expressed its intent with respect to the constitutional construction of statutes, and specifically sever-ability, in Section 1925 of the Statutory Construction Act. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925. Section 1925 provides:\nThe provisions of every statute shall be severable. If any provision of any statute or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the statute, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, unless the court finds that the valid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision or application, that it cannot be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds that the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925. With this legal background in mind, we turn to the arguments of the parties.\nThe Commonwealth first traces the evolution of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s case law regarding the constitutional necessity that a jury must consider any fact which increases the penalty for a crime. Offering the presumption that legislative enactments are constitutional, and that a statute will be found to be unconstitutional only if it clearly, palpably, and plainly violates the Constitution, the Commonwealth nevertheless concedes that Alleyne impacts Section 6317\u2019s proof at sentencing provision. In sum, the Commonwealth divides Section 6317\u2019s provisions into two categories\u2014procedural and substantive\u2014and contends that Alleyne calls into question only the procedural aspects of the statute. Thus, the Commonwealth\u2019s core position is not that, when held up against the mandate of Alleyne, the statute is constitutional in toto, but, rather, as only certain limited procedural provisions of the legislation run afoul of Alleyne, Section 6317 is severable and the substantive provisions remain viable.\nThe Commonwealth, noting public policy favors severability, points to the Statutory Construction Act, which offers the presumption of severability, unless either (1) the \u201cvalid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision or application, that it cannot be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one;\u201d or (2) the \u201cremaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed\u201d in accordance with the intent of the legislature. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925. Building on this provision, the Commonwealth reasons that, with the removal of the \u201cfact finding provisions\u201d from the statute, the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are complete and capable of being executed consistent with legislative intent.\nSpecifically, the Commonwealth suggests that subsection (b) of the statute and the proviso in subsection (a)\u2014\u201cthe sentencing court finds that\u201d\u2014which places fact finding in the hands of the sentencing court are all that need to be severed from the statute to render it constitutional under Alleyne. The Commonwealth maintains, consistent with the presumption in favor of severability, that this minor excising of the procedural provisions allows the remaining substantive provisions to be capable of execution in accordance with legislative intent. Related thereto, the Commonwealth claims that to find a lack of severability would be to assume that the General Assembly would not have passed the mandatory minimum sentencing if it knew juries would determine operative facts, and stresses that the laudable goal of the statute was to protect the children in our communities from the evils of the illegal drug trade.\nIn further support of its severability argument, the Commonwealth urges that special or specific verdicts, which would be required to satisfy Alleyne, should not be rejected by our Court, as disapproving comments concerning special verdicts are either dicta, citing Commonwealth v. Samuel, 599 Pa. 166, 961 A.2d 57, 63-64 (2008), or contained in plurality decisions, citing Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 614 Pa. 664, 39 A.3d 977 (2012). The Commonwealth adds that the Pennsylvania Criminal Procedural Rules Committee has made proposals to standardize the practice of special verdicts in light of Alleyne, by suggesting amending Pa.R.Crim.P. 648 to allow for special verdicts. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 33-38 (citing Pennsylvania Bulletin, Volume 43, Number 44, November 2, 2013, at 6490-92). Thus, the Commonwealth concludes that the trial court erred in finding Section 6317 unconstitutional in its entirety, and contends that those provisions of the statute that do not comply with Alleyne are severable from the remainder of the statute.\nAppellee responds that Section 6317 is triggered by a factual determination that the drug-related offense was committed within 1,000 feet of a school. Appellee explains that, under Alleyne, proof of the fact which brings about a mandatory minimum sentence must now be considered an \u201celement of a distinct and aggravated crime,\u201d for which an accused has the right of a jury trial, application of the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as well as other protections. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 7 (citing Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2162-63). Appellee further contends that, as this determination is now an element of the offense, an accused is entitled to a specific legal and factual allegation both in the complaint and in the information or indictment whenever the Commonwealth seeks a mandatory minimum sentence under Section 6317. According to Appellee, however, the legislature unambiguously provided in Section 6317 that this factual determination was not to be treated as an element of the crime and was to be determined at sentencing.\nMore specifically, Appellee maintains severability is not permissible as the remaining statutory provisions standing alone are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with legislative intent. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 14-15 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925). Appellee points to six ways in which the provisions of Section 6317 are unconstitutional:\n(1) \u201cThe provisions ... shall not be an element of the crime.\u201d Subsection (b);\n(2) \u201cNotice of the applicability of this section shall not be required prior to conviction.\u201d Subsection (b);\n(3) \u201cThe applicability of this section shall be determined at sentencing.\u201d Subsection (b);\n(4) \u201cThe [sentencing] court ... shall determine ... if this section is applicable.\u201d Subsection (b);\n(5) \u201cThe court ... shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence if this section is applicable.\u201d Subsection (b);\n(6) \u201cIf a sentencing court refuses to apply this section where applicable, the Commonwealth shall have the right to appellate review of the actions of the sentencing court. The appellate court shall vacate the sentence and remand the case to the sentencing court for imposition of a sentence in accordance with this section if it finds that the sentence was imposed in violation of this section.\u201d Subsection (d).\nId. at 9-10.\nThus, Appellee submits that, if the mandatory minimum is executed in accord with legislative intent, it would violate notice, burden of proof, jury trial, and double jeopardy protections afforded by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Related thereto, Appellee stresses that our Court should not supplement or rewrite statutes, as the legislative power of the Commonwealth is vested in the General Assembly, Pa. Const. art. II, \u00a7 I, not in the judiciary, and the only way Section 6317 could be cured of its constitutional deficiencies under Alleyne would be if our Court substituted provisions to effectuate the statute, which would be contrary to the plain expressions of the General Assembly.\nAppellee develops that the remaining, non-violative provisions of Section 6317 merely offer an intent on the part of the legislature to have a mandatory minimum of two years for drug offenders who commit their crimes near schools, while all of the procedural provisions for executing the statute are unconstitutional, and, thus, the substantive provisions \u201care incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with legislative intent.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 14-15 (quoting 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1925). Similarly, Appellee rejects the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that the use of special verdicts could cure the constitutional defects in the statute, as our Court in Samuel rejected a request for mandatory minimum special verdicts. See Samuel, 961 A.2d at 64 (\u201cThe proposal of special verdicts in criminal trials to determine what issues the jury actually resolved has been almost universally condemned.\u201d). Moreover, Appellee offers that, in any event, even with the use of special verdicts, the notice and appeal provisions, as noted above, are also unconstitutional, and would not be cured by special verdicts.\nFinally, Appellee argues that severability fails under Section 1925 of the Statutory Construction Act, and, specifically, under its alternative basis that \u201cthe valid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision or application, that it cannot be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the valid one.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 20-21 (quoting 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925). According to Appellee, it cannot be presumed that the legislature would have enacted a mandatory minimum sentencing provision to protect children from drug offenses committed near schools if it was forced, as it is under Alleyne, to treat the factual determination as an element of the offense, as evinced by the low standard of proof on the Commonwealth to establish the necessary factual predicate post-conviction\u2014preponderance of the evidence. Appellee posits that, given a choice of a mandatory minimum post-conviction sentencing statute being transformed into an aggravated criminal offense, with the full panoply of pre-trial (specific notice in charging document), trial (proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a jury), and post-trial (double jeopardy) protections, the legislature may have opted for sentencing guidelines as adequate and preferable for enhancing sentences for drug offenses committed near schools. Thus, ultimately, Appellee urges our Court to conclude that the unconstitutional mandatory minimum sentence statute is not severable.\nAmicus Defender Association of Philadelphia, in support of Appellee, also sets forth various provisions of Section 6317 that it believes are violative of Alleyne. It elaborates that Section 6317(b) is unconstitutional as it permits the finder of fact, in determining the applicability of the mandatory minimum sentence, to \u201cconsider evidence presented at trial, [and] shall afford the Commonwealth and the defendant an opportunity to present additional evidence.\u201d Amicus\u2019 Brief at 12-13, 18-19. According to Amicus, as Alleyne instructs that Section 6317 deals with an aggravated crime, evidence of the crime must be presented at trial and not after, and, therefore, as Section 6317 provides for consideration of evidence after trial, it is violative of Alleyne on this basis as well.\nOur review of the constitutionality and severability of a statute raises pure questions of law; thus, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. In Interest of F.C. III, 607 Pa. 45, 2 A.3d 1201, 1213 n. 8 (2010). Further, statutes enjoy a presumption of constitutionality, and such enactments will not be struck unless they clearly, plainly, and palpably violate the Constitution. Commonwealth v. Omar, 602 Pa. 595, 981 A.2d 179, 185 (2009). With our standard and scope of review in hand, we turn to resolution of the issues before us.\nThe Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that an accused has the right to trial by an impartial jury. U.S. Const. amend. VI. The Constitution mandates that a criminal conviction must \u201crest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime\u201d in question beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 510, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995). Since the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986), however, judges have been able to find \u201csentencing factors\u201d at post-conviction hearings without running afoul of the jury-trial guarantee. Id. at 81, 85-86, 93, 106 S.Ct. 2411. Thus, legislatures were able to differentiate between elements of a crime and sentencing factors in drafting criminal codes. In McMillan, the Court found that a fact was not an element of the offense simply because it created or increased a mandatory minimum sentence, and, thus, that Pennsylvania did not violate the Constitution with its imposition of mandatory minimum sentences based upon a trial court\u2019s determination, by a preponderance of the evidence, that various defendants \u201cvisibly possessed a firearm\u201d while committing certain felonies. McMillan, 477 U.S. at 80-93, 106 S.Ct. 2411.\nIn Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), however, the United States Supreme Court held that any fact that increases a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum\u201d is an element for the jury, regardless of the legislature\u2019s designation. Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. While Apprendi spoke to increasing a statutory maximum sentence, two years later in Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), a sharply divided high Court reaffirmed McMillan\u2019s conclusion that a fact that increases only a mandatory minimum sentence still constitutes a sentencing factor, and, thus, was not mandated to be determined by a jury.\nEleven years later, however, in Alleyne, the Supreme Court overruled Harris and McMillan, reasoning that \u201cApprendi applies with equal force to facts increasing [a] mandatory minimum.\u201d Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2160, 2163. In that case, Allen Ryan Alleyne was charged with various federal crimes including \u201cusing or carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924. That crime carried a five-year minimum sentence if it was found that the defendant \u201cused\u201d a firearm in the commission of the crime, but a seven-year minimum sentence if the defendant was found to have \u201cbrandished\u201d the firearm in the course of the crime. The jury determined that Alleyne used the firearm, but did not indicate whether he brandished the firearm in the commission of the crime. The district judge concluded, consistent with Harris, that he could employ a preponderance of the evidence standard and found the weapon had been brandished. Thus, the judge sentenced Alleyne to a seven-year mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\nOn appeal, in an opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the high Court reasoned that, under the Sixth Amendment, \u201c[a]ny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2155. A mandatory minimum sentence increases the penalty for a crime, and, thus, the Court held that \u201cany fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury,\u201d Id. As the judge in Alleyne found \u201cbrandishing\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence, which increased the penalty to which Alleyne was subjected, and as such fact was an element which had to be determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court vacated and remanded the matter for resentencing consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict. Id. at 2163-64.\nIn arriving at this conclusion, the Court overruled Harris and McMillan, finding the \u201cdistinction between facts that increase the statutory maximum and the facts that increase only the mandatory minimum\u201d was untenable in light of the Court\u2019s earlier decision in Apprendi and the Sixth Amendment. Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2155. The Court offered that the \u201cfacts increasing the legally prescribed floor aggravate the punishment,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe core crime and the fact triggering the mandatory minimum sentence together constitute a new, aggravated crime, each element of which must be submitted to the jury.\u201d Id. at 2161 (emphasis original); id. at 2162 (\u201c[w]hen a finding of fact alters the legally prescribed punishment so as to aggravate it, the fact necessarily forms a constituent part of a new offense and must be submitted to the jury.\u201d). The Court further opined, with respect to concepts of notice, that \u201c[d]efining facts that increase a mandatory statutory minimum to be part of the substantive offense enables the defendant to predict the legally applicable penalty from the face of the indictment\u201d and \u201cpreserves the historic role of the jury as an intermediary between the State and criminal defendants.\u201d Id. at 2161.\nThus, in Alleyne, the United States Supreme Court extended its Apprendi line of cases, overturned its prior decisions in Harris and McMillan, and concluded that, when a factual determination is necessary for the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence, the facts must be considered an element of a new, distinct aggravated offense. Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2161-63. Moreover, as an element of the offense, the factual determination must be specifically alleged in the charging document, and the defendant has a right to have that fact determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 2160-61. The Court, however, drew an important contrast between facts triggering a sentencing minimum and those used in applying sentencing guidelines, emphasizing what the Constitution did not require. The Court stressed that factfinding which increases a statutory minimum \u201cis distinct from fact-finding used to guide judicial discretion in selecting a punishment \u2018within limits fixed by law.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 2161 n. 2. Thus, the high Court clarified that its decision did not impact \u201cthe broad discretion of judges to select a sentence within the range authorized by law.\u201d Id. at 2163.\nIn the matter sub judice, and as noted above, the Commonwealth concedes that certain procedural provisions of Section 6317 are unconstitutional in the wake of Alleyne. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth argues that those provisions are severable, and, thus, the statute is capable of application once the violative provisions are excised.\nGenerally speaking, \u201cunless otherwise specified the individual provisions of all statutes are presumptively severa-ble.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 574 Pa. 487, 832 A.2d 962, 986 (2003). As noted above, the legislature has spoken with respect to its intent regarding severability of statutes in Section 1925 of the Statutory Construction Act. Section 1925 provides that the provisions of a statute shall be severable, but that this presumption is rebutted when either (1) the valid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with the void provisions that it cannot be presumed the legislature would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the voided ones; or (2) the remaining valid provisions standing alone are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accord with the intent of the General Assembly. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925.\nAccordingly, we must first review Section 6317 and determine what provisions of the mandatory minimum sentencing statute are violative of Alleyne and then consider whether the statute, applying Section 1925, can survive without those provisions in accord with the intent of the General Assembly.\nInitially, Section 6317(a) provides that, \u201c[i]f the sentencing court finds that the delivery or possession with intent to deliver was to an individual under 18 years of age, then this section shall not be applicable and the offense shall be subject to section 6314 (relating to sentencing and penalties for trafficking drugs to minors).\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(a) (emphasis added). The Commonwealth concedes that this provision, placing in the hands of the sentencing court a factual determination regarding application of Section 6317, is unconstitutional and must be severed from the statute. This provision, like other provisions in 6317(b) discussed below, is inconsistent with Alleyne\u2019s dictate that a fact which may increase a penalty must be submitted to a jury, and, for our purposes, evinces an intent on the part of the legislature to make mandatory minimum sentencing independent of a charged offense.\nFurther, and foundationally, the General Assembly was clear that the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of Section 6317 were not intended to constitute an element of a crime, and, thus, part of an offense: \u201cThe provisions of this section shall not be an element of the crime.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(b). The United States Supreme Court in Alleyne, however, effected a sea change in this area of the law. Under Alleyne\u2019s mandate, the mandatory minimum sentencing provision found in Section 6317, together with the core crime, is deemed to be an aggravated offense of drug trafficking with the required fact\u2014here, proximity of the drug activity to a school\u2014constituting an element of the offense. See Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2155 (\u201cAny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); id. at 2162 (\u201cWhen a finding of fact alters the legally prescribed punishment so as to aggravate it, the fact necessarily forms a constituent part of a new offense and must be submitted to the jury\u201d). Thus, Alleyne transforms the proximity sentencing factor of Section 6317 into exactly what the General Assembly expressly did not intend\u2014a proximity requirement constituting an element of a new aggravated offense.\nRelated thereto, Section 6317 provides that \u201c[n]otice of the applicability of this section to the defendant shall not be required prior to conviction, but reasonable notice of the Commonwealth\u2019s intention to proceed under this section shall be provided after conviction and before sentencing.\u201d 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6317(b). This post-conviction notice provision further l-eveals a legislative intent that the mandatory minimum sentence was not to constitute a brand-new crime, as that would require pre-trial notice. This too is now unconstitutional in light of Alleyne\u2019s de jure designation of a new aggravated crime and the concomitant requirement of notice in the charging documents of this new offense. Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2161 (\u201cDefining facts that increase a mandatory statutory minimum to be part of the substantive offense enables the defendant to predict the legally applicable penalty from the face of the indictment\u201d).\nFurther, given Alleyne\u2019s designation of a new aggravated offense, Section 6317(b)\u2019s mandate that \u201c[t]he applicability of this section shall be determined at sentencing\u201d is now void. Related thereto, Section 6317(b) provides \u201cThe court shall consider evidence presented at trial, shall afford the Commonwealth and the defendant an opportunity to present necessary additional evidence and shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence if this section is applicable.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(b). Thus, the statute not only mandates that the sentencing court shall determine applicability of the mandatory minimum, but that it will do so upon evidence offered both at trial and at sentencing, and by a preponderance of the evidence standard, all of which violate Alleyne\u2019s requirement that such factfinding is to be treated as an element of a new aggravated offense, determined by a jury, and by a reasonable doubt standard.\nFinally, Section 6317(d) offers that, \u201c[i]f a sentencing court refuses to apply this section where applicable, the Commonwealth shall have the right to appellate review of the action of the sentencing court. The appellate court shall vacate the sentence and remand the case to the sentencing court for imposition of a sentence in accordance with this section if it finds that the sentence was imposed in violation of this section.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(d). As Alleyne has rendered factfinding for purposes of Section 6317 to be elements of a new offense and, thus, a determination for the jury, the Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal that fact finding granted by subsection (d), raises serious double jeopardy concerns.\nIn sum, as detailed above, we find that numerous provisions of Section 6317 are unconstitutional in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alleyne. After Alleyne, these aspects of the statute\u2014that the provisions are declared not to be elements of the offense, that notice is not required prior to conviction, that factfinding is conducted at sentencing, that the sentencing court performs factfinding, that the applicable standard is preponderance of the evidence, and that the Commonwealth has the right to appeal where the imposed sentence was found to be in violation of the statute\u2014 are now infirm. However, the other provisions\u2014specifying the proximity of the drug transaction to a school, and requiring the age of the offender to be over 18\u2014do not offend the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in Alleyne. Thus, we turn to consider whether the statute can survive without those invalid provisions, with principal focus on the legislature\u2019s intent. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925; Saulsbury v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 413 Pa. 316, 196 A.2d 664, 667 (1964) (\u201cIn determining the severability of a statute or ordinance, the legislative intent is of primary significance.\u201d).\nInitially, we emphasize that, as a general overarching matter, based upon our review of Section 6317, the General Assembly has unambiguously expressed its intent regarding the nature of this mandatory minimum sentencing statute: it is a sentencing statute\u2014the provisions of the statute are not to constitute elements of an offense, notice of its application need not be provided prior to sentencing, and factual determinations triggering its application are to be determined at sentencing. Cf. Samuel, 961 A.2d at 63-64 (addressing two-strikes sentencing statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9714(g), and unanimously finding that plain language of statute indicated that sentencing court, and not the jury, must determine whether crime in question was crime of violence; that jury determination would render statute contradictory by redefining the crime with added elements; and that it is the legislature that is charged with defining elements of crimes). Yet, virtually every provision of Section 6317 enacted by the legislature to effectuate this intent runs afoul of the notice, jury trial, burden of proof, and post-trial rights of the accused after Alleyne. These provisions are elaborate, express, and detailed, and are no mere add ons, but, rather, are prominent and central features of the statute. Cf. Commonwealth v. Williams, 574 Pa. 487, 832 A.2d 962, 986 (2003) (finding severance permissible, as constitutionally infirm portions of Mean\u2019s Law II were an \u201cadd-on\u201d to the integrated legislative scheme set out in remainder of statute, formed a distinct program, and, absent such provisions, enforcement of the statute was possible). In contemplating the significant rights that come with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s marked transformation of sentencing factors into elements of a new aggravated offense, and the resulting evisceration of essential aspects of Section 6317, we find that the unoffending provisions of the statute\u2014the proximity and age requirements\u2014 standing alone, are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with legislative intent. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925. By operation of Alleyne, Section 6317 has been stripped of all the features that allow it to function as a sentencing statute.\nCritically, the legislature\u2019s expression in Section 6317 that the mandatory minimum sentencing triggers are not to be elements of a crime are clear expressions that the General Assembly did not intend to promulgate in Section 6317 a new aggravated offense. To effectuate the remaining provisions of Section 6317 would require a wholesale reconceptualization of the statute. In short, it cannot be stressed enough that the legislature intended that Section 6317 be a sentencing provision and not a substantive offense. It is for this foundational reason that the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed substantive/procedural conceptualization of the statute is inapt.\nThe Commonwealth asserts the employment of special verdicts\u2014or, as expressed at oral argument, the finding of a general verdict with special interrogatories addressing proximity and age\u2014as a way to cure the constitutional deficiencies in the statute. We disagree. First, nothing in Section 6317 suggests the legislature contemplated such an approach. Second, special verdicts would not cure the notice and appeal provisions of Section 6317 noted above. Specifically, as, under Alleyne, the factual determinations of proximity and age pursuant to Section 6317 would be elements of a new aggravated offense, the complaint and information/indictment would have to set forth related allegations. See, e.g., Pa.R.Crim.P. 504, 560. This notice requirement could not be remedied by the use of special verdicts. Furthermore, were special verdicts utilized, the provision affording the Commonwealth an appeal would be problematic, as it would suggest the appellate court could de novo reassess a jury\u2019s determination with respect to proximity and age.\nMoreover, in our pre-Alleyne decision in Samuel, our Court, in addressing a two-strikes mandatory minimum sentencing provision virtually identical to Section 6317, rejected special verdicts as a possible tool to allow a jury to render a factual determination for purposes of sentencing. Specifically, the appellant, Eric Samuel, was sentenced after the Commonwealth sought application of the mandatory two-strike provision in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9714. Samuel, 961 A.2d at 59-60. The Commonwealth asserted that a conviction for the burglary of Jamaal Garnett\u2019s home constituted a second strike under the statute because the evidence at trial revealed that, when appellant committed the burglary, Garnett was home, in a building adapted for overnight accommodations, which satisfied the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the two-strike statute. Samuel argued that, because the information did not specify that a person was present during the burglary, and the jury was not specifically asked to render a factual determination in this regard, the burglary conviction could not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and should not count as a second strike. Id. Nevertheless, the sentencing court made the factual finding that Garnett was home when Samuel entered the premises, and, thus, that his burglary constituted a crime of violence. Id.\nOn Samuel\u2019s appeal to our Court, we placed particular emphasis on the statute\u2019s verbiage, like that in Section 6317 before us, that its mandatory provisions were not elements of the crime and that the statute was not to be applied until sentencing. Thus, we opined that the plain language of the statute indicated the legislature\u2019s intent, and that the sentencing court, and not the jury, was to determine whether the crime was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d by the preponderance of the evidence. Samuel, 961 A.2d at 63. Further, we eschewed an interpretation that the burglary-related crime of violence was required to be charged in the information, or necessitated a specific jury finding, as improperly redefining the crime of burglary would be in contradiction to the statutory language mandating that the provisions of Section 9714 shall not be an element of the crime. Id. Of particular relevance to our analysis in the instant matter, we further rejected Samuel\u2019s position, concluding that it would require the jury to issue a special verdict with individual interrogatories, noting that this would be contrary to the statutory language that notice of application of the mandatory minimum sentencing was not required prior to conviction, that there was no allowance for special verdicts in criminal trials, and that \u201c[t]he proposal of special verdicts in criminal trials to determine what issues the jury actually resolved has been almost universally condemned.\u201d Samuel, 961 A.2d at 64; see also Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 614 Pa. 664, 39 A.3d 977, 987 (2012) (plurality) (\u201c[T]here is no authority for special verdicts in criminal trials.\u201d).\nIt is beyond our province to, in essence, rewrite Section 6317 to transform its sentencing commands, whether by utilizing special verdicts or otherwise, into a new substantive offense, contrary to the express legislative intent to the contrary. Thus, we find the unoffending portions of the statute, standing alone, without a wholesale rewriting, are incomplete and incapable of being vindicated in accord with the legislature\u2019s intent. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925.\nOur decision in Commonwealth v. Mockaitis, 575 Pa. 5, 834 A.2d 488 (2003), sharpens the point. In that matter, our Court considered a challenge to a statute which delegated to sentencing courts the responsibility of ordering installation of ignition interlock systems on motor vehicles as a condition precedent to restoration of operating privileges by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (\u201cDepartment\u201d) for serial DUI offenders and of certifying to the Department that such systems had been installed. The trial court found these provisions to be unconstitutional on the basis of equal protection, separation of powers, and procedural due process. We agreed with the lower court that the statute\u2019s delegation to the judiciary of executive functions was unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Id. at 499-502.\nOur Court, however, went on, sua sponte, to consider whether the statute was severable, and concluded that the statute did not need to be struck in its entirety. In so holding, we explained that, in accordance with legislative intent, recidivist DUI offenders were still required to seek restoration of operating privileges by applying to the Department for an ignition interlock restricted license, and, thus, an administrative agency was available to effectuate the remaining portions of the statute. We stressed that\nthe Department\u2014the administrative agency that properly should discharge the executive function that [the statute] delegated to the judiciary\u2014may employ the remaining valid portions of [the statute] to effectuate the legislative requirement that serial DUI offenders, who can have their driving privileges restored after an automatic one-year suspension, may do so only after securing an \u2018ignition interlock restricted license\u2019 which allows an offender to operate a motor vehicle only if it is equipped with an approved ignition interlock system.\nId. at 490. Here\u2014unlike in Mockaitis where there already existed a process in place to execute the remaining valid portions of the statute which was consistent with legislative intent\u2014the General Assembly has made clear that the provisions of Section 6317 are not to be elements of the crime and no substitute process can fix that.\nIn conclusion, we hold, as detailed above, that numerous provisions of Section 6317 are constitutionally infirm under Alleyne. Moreover, the remaining provisions of Section 6317, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being vindicated in accord with the intent of the General Assembly. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925. Because of the significant provisions found to violate the Constitution, which clearly express the intent of the legislature that Section 6317 is a mandatory minimum sentencing statute, and not a substantive offense, we find the remaining unoffending provisions of Section 6317 are incapable of being severed, and we will not judicially usurp the legislative function and rewrite Section 6317 or create a substantive offense which the General Assembly clearly did not desire. Rather, we leave it to our sister branch for an appropriate statutory response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alleyne. See Commonwealth v. Kirkner, 569 Pa. 499, 805 A.2d 514, 516-17 (2002) (\u201cThe statute cannot be modified by judicial discretion, no matter how well-intentioned the trial court might be.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Wright, 508 Pa. 25, 494 A.2d 354, 357 (1985) (\u201c[U]nder our system of jurisprudence the legislature is charged with the responsibility of defining the elements of crimes.\u201d); see also Commonwealth v. Mazzetti, 615 Pa. 555, 44 A.3d 58, 67 (2012) (per curiam) (finding, in context of Commonwealth being precluded from seeking mandatory sentence at revocation of probation where it did not seek the mandatory sentence at the original sentencing proceeding, \u201c[t]his Court may not supply omissions in a statute [Section 6317]\u201d (internal quotation omitted)); Commonwealth v. Dixon, 53 A.3d 839, 846 (Pa.Super.2012) (in concluding that a daycare does not constitute a school for purposes of Section 6317, noting that a court has no authority to insert words in the statute not provided by General Assembly).\nFinally, and importantly, our decision today in no way impacts the ability of the Commonwealth to convict and sentence those dealing in illegal drugs near our Commonwealth\u2019s schools\u2014it merely limits the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence for those offenders until our legislature acts to address the constitutional requirements imposed by the United States Supreme Court in Alleyne.\nThe order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County is hereby affirmed.\nFormer Chief Justice CASTILLE and former Justice McCAFFERY did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice SAYLOR and Justice BAER join the opinion.\nJustice EAKIN flies a dissenting opinion.\nJustice STEVENS flies a dissenting opinion.\n. Our Court has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from final orders of the courts of common pleas holding a statute unconstitutional. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(7) (\"The Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of the courts of common pleas in ... [m]atters where the court of common pleas has held invalid as repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, or to the Constitution of this Commonwealth, any treaty or law of the United States or any provision of the Constitution of, or of any statute of, this Commonwealth, or any provision of any home rule charter.\u201d).\n. As discussed further below, Samuel addressed Section 9714 in a pre-Alleyne context.\n. While Samuel was decided prior to the United States Supreme Court's decision in Alleyne, it nevertheless is instructive, not only with respect to assessing the legislature\u2019s intent that the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions were not to be elements of a crime, but, also, as to the disfavor of special verdicts in criminal trials.\n. The Commonwealth contends our Court's recognition in Samuel that special verdicts are disfavored in criminal trials is dicta. We disagree. Special verdicts, as noted above, were deemed to be a requirement for Samuel to obtain relief, and, thus, our Court\u2019s rejection of Samuel\u2019s suggestion of the use of special verdicts was necessary to our repudiation of his position. More importantly, we recognize that, in the post-Apprendi landscape, courts are reconsidering the proscription against special verdicts in criminal matters, see, e.g., Jacobs, 39 A.3d at 988 (Saylor, J., concurring); but, while the Commonwealth points to proposed amendments to the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure which would, if adopted, allow for special verdicts to comply with Alleyne, such rules, even if adopted, are tangential to discerning the severability of provisions contained in a statute with an express, detailed, and expansive procedure, and, more importantly, in estimating legislative intent.\n. Indeed, Appellee offers that the legislature may view the alternative of revising the sentencing guidelines to reflect such enhanced sentencing as an adequate and preferable option. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 21. In this regard, the United States Supreme Court in Alleyne was clear that facts that influenced judicial discretion did not have to be submitted to the jury and that \"broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial fact-finding, does not violate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Alleyne, at 2163; see also Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 481, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (\"[N]othing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise discretion\u2014taking into consideration various factors relating both to offense and offender\u2014in imposing a judgment within the range prescribed by statute\u201d) (emphasis original); United States v. Cassius, 777 F.3d 1093, 1097 (3d Cir.2015) (reasoning trial court\u2019s finding of larger drug quantity used solely as a sentencing factor to assist in determining defendant\u2019s sentence within prescribed statutory range permissible under Alleyne); United States v. Freeman, 763 F.3d 322, 336 (3d Cir.2014) (same); United States v. Ramirez-Negron, 751 F.3d 42, 49 (1st Cir.2014) (same).\n. In concluding the statute is severable, the dissenters focus almost exclusively on the General Assembly\u2019s \u201cmanifest\u201d intent in enacting Section 6317\u2014to impose \"mandatory minimum sentences upon those who sell drugs in a school zone,\u201d Dissenting Opinion (Stevens, J.) at 72, 117 A.3d at 269, and \"enhanced penalties for drug sales near our schools,\u201d Dissenting Opinion (Eakin, J.) at 64, 117 A.3d at 264. There is no controversy over the legislature\u2019s goal in passing Section 6317 or its wisdom in imposing mandatory minimum sentences on those who sell drugs near our schools. However, the intent behind the legislature's passage of Section 6317 is relevant only in the context of the discrete severability analysis under 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925.\nWith respect to that analysis, as noted above, the United States Supreme Court in Alleyne held that any fact which increases a mandatory minimum sentence is an element of the crime which must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014i.e., the core crime and the fact triggering the mandatory minimum sentence together constitute a new aggravated crime, and the triggering fact must be charged in the indictment as an element of that new crime. Thus, any severability analysis must take into account this transformation of a mandatory minimum sentencing provision into a substantive offense\u2014 with the proximity of the sale of drugs to school property being an element of that crime. Here, the General Assembly could not have been clearer that it did not intend to create a new offense, with its attendant notice requirements, when it stated that the provisions of the mandatory sentencing statute \u201cshall not be an element of the crime.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(b). Nowhere in either dissent is this critical statement of the legislature\u2019s intention mentioned, or accounted for. Nor do they address how special verdicts would account for the notice requirements that are explicit in Alleyne\u2019s mandate. Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2161 (\"Defining facts that increase a mandatory statutory minimum to be part of the substantive offense enables the defendant to predict the legally applicable penalty from the face of the indictment\u201d). The dissenters\u2019 position\u2014effectively converting the remaining valid provisions of the sentencing statute into elements of a new substantive offense\u2014is in direct conflict with the General Assembly\u2019s unambiguous intent that these provisions are not to be an element of the crime. While the legislature may rightfully \"still want enhanced penalties for drug sales near our schools,\u201d Dissenting Opinion (Eakin, J.) at 64, 117 A.3d at 264, the General Assembly made it equally and abundantly clear that it did not want them to be a substantive offense. Thus, it is for the legislature, not this Court, to devise a response consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in Alleyne.",

        "text": "Justice EAKIN,\ndissenting.\nBecause I find the invalid provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317 are severable, I disagree that all of \u00a7 6317 is now rendered unconstitutional.\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925 provides that every statute is presumed severable unless one of two exceptions applies. Functionally, both exceptions depend upon legislative intent. See id. The first exception asks what the legislature would have done in the absence of the void provisions; the second exception asks whether the remaining provisions can effectuate the General Assembly\u2019s intent.\nIn answering these questions, the majority frames its analysis narrowly, focusing on the statute\u2019s procedural language; respectfully, such an approach does not answer the questions of \u00a7 1925. What was the purpose of the enhanced sentence for drug sales near schools? It was clearly to create drug-free zones in areas with a high density of children. What was the purpose of the procedural methodology enacted therewith? To ensure the enhanced penalties were respected and enforced. If there is any other reasonable or logical explanation for the statute\u2019s framework, we have yet to hear it.\nThe procedure provided for offends Alleyne v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), of this there is no doubt, and no quarrel from the Commonwealth. The initial question asked by \u00a7 1925 is \u201cwhat would the legislature have done in the absence of the void provisions?\u201d That is, would the legislature still want enhanced penalties for drug sales near our schools? Obviously it would\u2014that was the whole purpose of the statute in the first place. It is the manifest goal. The procedure to achieve it was not the goal; the procedure, if anything, reinforced the legislative desire to ensure the increased penalties were not pushed aside.\nThe majority suggests we cannot presume the legislature would have enacted the substantive provisions absent the procedural provisions, as it had the alternative of enhanced sentencing guidelines and chose another course. See Majority Op., at 61 n. 5, 117 A.3d at 262 n. 5. Abjuring the general discretionary nature of sentencing guidelines, the legislature enacted a most definitive, strident procedure, that included removal of the power of a court to ignore the increased penalty or impose anything less, and codifies a Commonwealth appeal for refusal to apply it. Does this reflect a desire to assure the substance is obeyed, or a desire to elevate process over substance? Establishing sentencing guidelines would not ensure the imposition of a minimum sentence\u2014a situation that the General Assembly repeatedly indicated it wanted to prevent. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(a) (establishing minimum sentence \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of this title, The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act or statute to the contrary\u201d); id., \u00a7 6317(c) (\u201cSentencing guidelines ... shall not supersede the mandatory sentences provided in this section.\u201d); id. (\u201cThere shall be no authority for a court to impose on a defendant to which this section is applicable a lesser sentence than provided for in subsection (a)[.]\u201d).\nIn other words, the legislature wanted to remove any discretion concerning the minimum sentence. To propose it would have reinserted discretion into the equation simply because Alleyne renders the procedural provisions infirm suggests the General Assembly \u201cwould want those \u2018possessing a firearm while trafficking drugs[ ]\u2019 to serve higher sentences if it can be found by a judge by a preponderance, but not if the element is ... found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Commonwealth v. Newman, 99 A.3d 86, 106 (Pa.Super.2014) (en banc) (Mundy, J., concurring) (alteration in original). Respectfully, such a conclusion is absurd. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1). Given the legislature\u2019s repeated references for the mandatory minimum to trump any provision to the contrary, common sense tells us we can safely presume it would have enacted the substantive provisions absent the statute\u2019s procedural language, had it been prescient enough to anticipate the Alleyne decision.\nAs for the second exception, the remaining provisions still effectuate the legislative intent of establishing drug-free school zones. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317. The majority states special verdicts would not cure \u00a7 6317's notice and appeal provisions, id., \u00a7 6317(b), (d). See Majority Op., at 54-55, 117 A.3d at 259-60. Yet, as found by the majority, those provisions are per se infirm under Alleyne. See id., at 258-59.\nCiting Commonwealth v. Samuel, 599 Pa. 166, 961 A.2d 57 (2008), the majority emphasizes Samuel\u2019s discussion of the legislative intent underlying a similar mandatory minimum statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9714. However, I find Commonwealth v. Belak, 573 Pa. 414, 825 A.2d 1252 (2003), more analogous to the instant matter because it addressed \u00a7 9714's severability, rather than whether the facts constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 9714. Examining the second severability exception in Belak, we stated: \u201cIn enacting section 9714, the legislature sought to punish violent recidivists, and [the valid provision] can accomplish that goal without reference to the invalid [provision].\u201d Id., at 1257. I would employ a similar approach here, focusing on the General Assembly\u2019s intent to create drug-free zones in youth-centric areas\u2014an intent which the substantive provisions can still effectuate.\nThe majority further notes Samuel\u2019s negative discussion of special verdicts, see Samuel, at 64, remarking that the proposed amendment to Pa.R.Crim.P. 648, which would standardize the use of special verdicts for Alleyne purposes, is \u201ctangential\u201d to a severability analysis. Majority Op., at 59 n. 4, 117 A.3d at 261 n. 4. A closer examination of the Committee Report reveals using special verdicts to comply with Alleyne has become \u201c \u2018commonplace.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 38 (citation omitted). The proposed amendment would not create a new process\u2014a process already exists. Hence, as the amendment aims to clarify, not create, a process that effectuates \u00a7 6317\u2019s intent, I disagree that the amendment is tangential to the question of severability. As for the majority\u2019s reliance on Samuel\u2019s discussion of special verdicts, we must remember Samuel cited a footnote from a 40-year-old plurality decision for the proposition that special verdicts are \u201cuniversally condemned\u201d within the criminal context. Samuel, at 64 (citing Commonwealth v. Campana, 452 Pa. 233, 304 A.2d 432, 438 n. 27 (1973) (plurality opinion)). As Samuel was decided pre-Alleyne, I do not find its discussion of special verdicts convincing or dispositive. See Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 614 Pa. 664, 39 A.3d 977, 988 (2012) (Saylor, J., concurring) (citation omitted) (questioning policy of categorically prohibiting special verdicts in criminal context).\nFinally, the majority distinguishes the present case from Commonwealth v. Mockaitis, 575 Pa. 5, 834 A.2d 488 (2003), wherein we concluded the second severability exception did not apply because there was a pre-existing process, ie., seeking restoration of driving privileges from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, to effectuate the legislative intent of preventing DUI recidivists from operating a vehicle without a limited license. Id., at 502-03. At the outset, this rationale seems sound; however, citing to other provisions within the Vehicle Code, we further stated in Mockaitis that \u201cenforcement of the legislative purpose will still occur in the ordinary course of enforcement[.]\u201d Id., at 503 (citations omitted). I see no difference here. Execution of the legislative purpose to develop drug-free school zones by imposing a mandatory two-year minimum would still occur in an ordinary manner, i.e., by utilizing our existing Rules\u2014the execution of which does not require the creation of a new procedural framework. See Newman, at 105 (observing numerous criminal statutes are executed in ordinary manner despite absence of proof-of-sentencing mechanism).\nAgain, the law asks two straightforward questions when considering severability: what would the legislature have done in the absence of the void provisions, and can the remaining provisions effectuate the General Assembly\u2019s intent? Would the legislature have wanted increased school-zone penalties if its procedural plan was void? Of course it would\u2014the procedure was the tail, not the dog. Can the valid portion of the statute effectuate that intent? A procedure that complies with Alleyne is simple, in place, and would achieve the legislative purpose. Accordingly, I would hold the invalid provisions are severable, and respectfully dissent.\n. The presumption applies unless:\n[(1)] the court finds that the valid provisions ... are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provisions] or application, that it cannot be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one; or [ (2) ] the court finds that the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent, the void provisions; the second exception asks whether the remaining provisions can effectuate the General Assembly\u2019s intent.\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925.\n. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Dixon, 53 A.3d 839, 844 (Pa.Super.2012) (\u201cThe legislature clearly intended to segregate children from drugs where they learn and play and, to promote that policy, it created drug-free zones[.]\u201d); Commonwealth v. Campbell, 758 A.2d 1231, 1237 (Pa.Super.2000) (\"It is our finding that the General Assembly\u2019s goal and purpose was to protect the children of our communities from the ravages and evils of the illegal drug trade that pervades our country.\u201d).\n. The majority would make much of the legislature not wanting enhancement to create a new crime or add an element to the crime. I cannot subscribe to the notion that this is a \"critical statement of the legislature's intention[.]\u201d Majority Op., at 62-63 n. 6, 117 A.3d at 263 n. 6. Respectfully, those provisions are about process, not substance.\nWhat the legislature wanted was a result, and it tried to accomplish it by a process later held to be violative of the federal constitution. But the process it enacted was not the aim of the statute; that process was to facilitate achieving the manifest aim, which is substantive. The intent of the legislature was not to pass a law such that it does not create a new crime or element. These provisions to avoid additional hurdles to the statute\u2019s true purpose\u2014these were not provisions that themselves had anything to do with drug-free school zones, which was the purpose of the law. This is why they are severable, not reasons why they are not.",

        "text": "Justice STEVENS,\ndissenting.\nOur legislature seeks to protect Pennsylvania school children from drug dealers engaging in nefarious activities near neighborhood schools and playgrounds. Without mandatory sentences, my concern is that there will be inconsistent sentencing for drug dealers who operate near school property, thereby frustrating the mandatory sentencing penalty put in place by our duly elected legislators.\nReasonable minds can disagree. I respectfully offer this Dissent in support of the constitutionality of mandatory sentences.\nThe legislature, with the approval of the governor, created a mandatory sentencing scheme to deter and punish those who sell drugs within 1000 feet of school property. Such a policy is a legislative prerogative.\nWhile the majority decision does not affect the ability of the Commonwealth to arrest and prosecute drug dealers near our neighborhood schools, my concern is that the sentencing of those drug dealers may become inconsistent throughout Pennsylvania because individual trial judges in different counties will not have the mandatory sentence requirement by which to abide.\nI respectfully dissent from the learned majority\u2019s decision to strike the entirety of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317. In doing so, the majority finds our mandatory minimum sentencing scheme constitutionally infirm in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alleyne v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). For the reasons that follow, I would reverse and uphold the constitutionality of that statute.\nWhen evaluating the constitutionality of any statutory provision, there is a strong presumption in the Commonwealth that our legislature\u2019s enactments do not violate the constitution. Commonwealth v. Williams, 557 Pa. 285, 304, 733 A.2d 593, 603 (1999). A substantial burden of persuasion is, therefore, placed upon an individual challenging the constitutionality of a statute. Id. All doubts must be resolved in favor of sustaining the statute\u2019s constitutionality. Hayes v. Erie Ins. Exch., 493 Pa. 150, 155, 425 A.2d 419, 421 (1981). Accordingly, a statutory provision will be found unconstitutional only if \u201cit clearly, palpably and plainly violates the constitution.\u201d Id.\nWhen a court with sufficient authority declares a portion of a statute unconstitutional, however, public policy favors sever-ability. Commonwealth v. Mockaitis, 575 Pa. 5, 28, 834 A.2d 488, 502 (2003). It is well settled law that when a portion of a statute is declared unconstitutional, the entirety of the statute is not ineludibly unconstitutional. Rothermel v. Meyerle, 136 Pa. 250, 20 A. 583 (1890). Unconstitutional provisions should, therefore, be severed from the remaining valid provisions whenever possible to uphold the legitimacy of the statute. Id. The legislature has codified this longstanding principle in 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925, which provides;\nThe provisions of every statute shall be severable. If any provision of any statute or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the statute, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, unless the court finds that the valid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision or application, that it cannot be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds that the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925. See Stilp v. Commonwealth, 588 Pa. 539, 905 A.2d 918 (2006). Severance is disfavored only when the invalid provisions are so essentially and inseparably connected with the remaining provisions of the Act that the remainder of the statute is incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent. Commonwealth v. Williams, 574 Pa. 487, 527, 832 A.2d 962, 986 (2003). This leaves this Court with the duty of examining whether the enacting legislature would have enacted the statute had it known the particular provision in question was unconstitutional. Annenberg v. Commonwealth, 562 Pa. 581, 596, 757 A.2d 338, 347 (2000).\nHere, the Alleyne decision, in effect, invalidated certain aspects of Section 6317. The Commonwealth, however, aptly notes that Alleyne's effect concerns only the procedural provisions of Section 6317. The United States Supreme Court did not, in any way, affect the statute\u2019s substantive provisions, the portions that clearly demonstrate the primary legislative intent in enacting this statute. The Pennsylvania Legislature chose to make the sale of controlled substances within 1,000 feet of a school zone subject to a mandatory minimum sentence in order to shield the children of this Commonwealth from the execrable effects of the drug trade. This legislative policy has been continually recognized by the courts of this Commonwealth.\nFor example, in Commonwealth v. Marion, 981 A.2d 230, 243 (Pa.Super.2009), appeal denied, 605 Pa. 697, 990 A.2d 729 (2010), the Superior Court considered the legislative intent in enacting Section 6317, and, in doing so, relied upon its prior holdings in Commonwealth v. Drummond, 775 A.2d 849, 857 (Pa.Super.2001) (en banc), appeal denied, 567 Pa. 756, 790 A.2d 1013 (2001), and Commonwealth v. Campbell, 758 A.2d 1231, 1233-34 (Pa.Super.2000), which stated that:\n[T]he General Assembly\u2019s goal and purpose [in enacting Section 6317] was to protect the children of our communities from the ravages and evils of the illegal drug trade that pervades our country. Through the enactment of [S]ection 6317, it attempted to fortify the barrier that segregates the places where our children frequent from the illegal drug scene. A strict reading of the statute exemplifies the General Assembly\u2019s intent....\nDrummond, supra at 856-57 (quoting Campbell, supra at 1236-37 (citations and quotation marks omitted)); Commonwealth v. Williams, 955 A.2d 386, 390 (Pa.Super.2008). The dim view with which the General Assembly beholds drug trafficking, clearly illustrates its intent to enable the imposition of an appropriate punishment upon those who sell drugs within a school zone, by ensuring that those individuals are separated from society.\nWith that background in mind, I cannot agree that our legislature would not have enacted Section 6317 if it had known that a jury was required to make the requisite fact-finding, which would trigger a mandatory sentence, rather than a sentencing judge. In so holding, the majority does not address the statute\u2019s manifest intent. While these procedural aspects were certainly important to the legislature in its enactment of the statute, there is nothing of record to assume that they were so germane that but for their incorporation, the legislature would not have enacted the statute. Indeed, the driving force behind the particular statute in question was primarily to impose higher sentences upon those who sell drugs in school zones, in order to keep drugs away from our children. Such is a legitimate, constitutional, legislative decision.\nThe remaining portion of the statute, along with the constitutional jury requirements articulated in Alleyne, provide more than enough guidance to allow Section 6317 to function in accordance with its primary legislative intent. Excising the now invalid portions of the statute does not render Section 6317 incapable of being enforced. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement that any fact that increases a mandatory minimum sentence is an element of an enhanced crime, and must be submitted to the jury, coupled with our rules on severability dictate that we should simply submit the requisite fact to the jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt. This would achieve the manifest goal of our legislature, imposing mandatory minimum sentences upon those who sell drugs in a school zone.\nBy doing so, this Court would not be infringing upon the power of the legislature. Rather, we would be doing precisely what the legislature would have intended, upholding a valid provision of its statute in accordance with its rules of statutory construction. Furthermore, we would be following the constitutional pronouncement as echoed by our United States Supreme Court in the Alleyne decision by allowing the jury to make the specific fact-finding. The majority aptly notes, however, that use of special verdicts in criminal cases has seemingly been disfavored in this Commonwealth. To support this contention, my colleagues rely on this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Samuel, 599 Pa. 166, 961 A.2d 57 (2008).\nIn Samuel, we noted that, unlike in civil cases, \u201cwhere there is specific authority for special verdicts ... there is no such provision in criminal trials.... \u201d Id. at 177, 961 A.2d at 64. Further, the Samuel court, quoting Commonwealth v. Campana, 452 Pa. 233, 247 n. 27, 304 A.2d 432, 438 n. 27 (1973) (plurality), vacated on other grounds, 414 U.S. 808, 94 S.Ct. 73, 38 L.Ed.2d 44 (1973), went on to state that \u201c[t]he proposal of special verdicts in criminal trials to determine what issues the jury actually resolved has been almost universally condemned.\u201d This sentiment has been echoed most recently by this Court in Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 614 Pa. 664, 39 A.3d 977 (2012) (plurality opinion). The value of this authority, however, is suspect, as the quoted language from Samuel is dicta, which relies on, Campana, a plurality opinion.\nFurthermore, courts seem to be rejecting an unyielding position regarding the use of special verdicts. For instance, in Jacobs, then Justice Saylor, writing a concurring opinion, which was joined by then Chief Justice Castille, stated:\nFinally, at least in the post-Apprendi landscape, and in matters which are governed by the decision, serious arguments are being made to the effect that the courts ought to reconsider the policy against special jury findings. See, e.g., Meghan A. Ferguson, Balancing Lenity, Rationality and Finality: A Case for Special Verdict Forms in Cases Involving Overlapping Federal Criminal Offenses, 59 DUKE L.J. 1195, 1208 n. 85 (2010) (collecting decisions reflecting the use of special verdict forms in the wake of Apprendi). Therefore I would refrain from continuing to suggest an inflexible position on the subject.\nId. at 681, 39 A.3d at 987. Additionally, federal courts have, for some time, been employing special interrogatories in criminal cases to aid the jury when tasked with determining specific facts. See e.g. United States v. Pe\u00f1a-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 30 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that district courts are vested with discretion to employ special verdict forms in criminal cases where a count alleging using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence lists both a regular firearm and a machine-gun); United States v. Sims, 975 F.2d 1225, 1235-36 (6th Cir.1992) (holding that if the jury returns a guilty verdict, the court may submit special interrogatories to the jury, requiring that it specify which category of weapons it found the defendant was using or carrying.); United States v. Smith, 938 F.2d 69, 70 (7th Cir.1991) (holding that special verdicts, while generally not favored in criminal cases, were permitted in situations where the defendant\u2019s offense turns on factual findings).\nMore relevant to the instant discussion, however, these processes have been implemented in situations where the jury is tasked with making specific findings, which were formerly classified as sentencing factors, in the post-Apprendi landscape. Federal prosecutors often will charge in their indictments, factors that increase the applicable statutory maximum sentences. Thirtieth Annual Review of Criminal Procedure: United States Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals 1999-2000, 89 Geo. L.J. 1045, 1049 (2001). Moreover, federal prosecutors have developed jury instructions and verdict forms to be used in submitting those factors to the jury for determination. Id. Because the decision in Alleyne turned on similar legal principles to the Apprendi decision, a similar procedure should be implemented in our present scenario.\nAt least one Pennsylvania trial court implemented such a procedure under the Alleyne posture, by presenting a special verdict to the jury. See Commonwealth v. Valentine, 101 A.3d 801 (Pa.Super.2014). While the Superior Court in that case found the procedure was in err, it is precisely what the Superior Court decided was proper in Commonwealth v. Watley, 81 A.3d 108 (Pa.Super.2013), appeal denied, 626 Pa. 684, 95 A.3d 277 (2014) regarding Apprendi. In Watley, the Superior Court relying on Commonwealth v. Johnson, 910 A.2d 60 (Pa.Super.2006), and Commonwealth v. Kearns, 907 A.2d 649 (Pa.Super.2006), found that specific jury findings relative to the charge for which the defendant is being sentenced are necessary where Apprendi is implicated. As such, the same procedure, as applied in Apprendi situations, is precisely the appropriate remedy in the present scenario, which will uphold the validity of the legislature\u2019s enactment. Further, our Criminal Court Rules Committee should address as rapidly as feasible an appropriate amendment.\nThe majority\u2019s decision invalidates the entirety of our mandatory minimum sentencing scheme. I urge our General Assembly to do whatever it takes to reaffirm through appropriate legislation its foregoing intent, i.e. the disapproval of the illegal drug trade that has for decades ravished all too many communities and families throughout the Commonwealth.\nI would find the mandatory sentencing scheme is constitutional.\n. The United States Supreme Court invalidated the portions of our mandatory minimum sentencing statutes that place requisite fact-finding in the hands of the sentencing court for the sentencing court to determine by a preponderance of the evidence.",
