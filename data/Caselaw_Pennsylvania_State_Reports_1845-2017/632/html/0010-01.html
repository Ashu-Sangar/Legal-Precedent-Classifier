We hold that Section 306(b)(3) notice is required where the employer is seeking to modify existing workers’ compensation benefits based on medical evidence establishing that the injured employee is able to return to work in some capacity. Because the injured employee in the case before us had not yet received workers’ compensation benefits when the offer of alternative employment was rendered, the employer had no duty to provide notice of ability to work pursuant to Section 306(b)(3). Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Pastorius Elementary School (Pastorius Elementary) from November 24, 2008 to March 3, 2009. The second graders in Claimant’s classroom engaged in significant misbehavior, including using profanity and engaging in physical violence, which prevented Claimant from teaching effectively and required her to speak louder than the classroom noise. After completing an assignment on March 3, 2009, the children became unruly and vandalized the room by knocking over desks and chairs, tearing down educational charts, and later ripping down a window shade. Claimant thereafter felt dizzy, could not eat, and suffered from tension headaches, heart palpitations, and nausea.</p>

Claimant informed Dr. Baugh of her symptoms <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>and indicated that the anxiety arising from her employment was more than she could bear. As a result, a representative from Dr. Baugh’s office called Employer and advised that Claimant would not be returning to work due to the school’s overly stressful environment.</p>

Claimant returned to Pastorius Elementary a few weeks later, but stayed only four days, unable to continue working under the stress. Notably, on May 29, 2009, Employer issued a notice of compensation denial, rejecting Claimant’s contention that she suffered a work-related injury due to excessive stress on the job.</p>

Germane to the issue before us, at the time Employer offered Claimant the alternative employment at the Jay Cooke School, she had not yet filed a claim petition; thus, no depositions of medical experts had been taken by either party. When school began in September of 2009, Claimant did not begin employment at the Jay Cooke School. Claimant maintained that she was unable to return to teaching because she was still under treatment for the job-related maladies that arose from her stressful working environment at Pastorius Elementary.</p>

She asserted that these injuries rendered her totally disabled. Consistent with its prior notice of compensation denial, Employer filed a timely answer denying all of the material averments in Claimant’s petition.

Claimant acknowledged that Employer assigned her to the Jay Cooke School in June of 2009, and that she visited the facility, finding it to be a quiet school with excellent teaching. She reiterated, however, that she was not able to return to teaching in the fall of 2009 because she was still being treated for the stress-related injuries incurred from teaching at Pastorius Elementary.</p>

She noted that Claimant had previously been diagnosed with lupus, but had been in remission for the past three years. While Claimant also had a previous history of fibromyalgia and a vocal cord injury, she had no symptoms from such conditions at the time she began teaching for Employer. Dr. Baugh’s medical opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, was that the stressful work environment at Pastorius Elementary exacerbated Claimant’s preexisting conditions of lupus and fibro-myalgia, and caused her to suffer from muscle spasms, headaches, insomnia, and vocal cord injury. Deposition of Dr. Baugh, Mar. 9, 2010, at 17-19.

Deposition of Dr. <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>Lamprakos, Aug. 4, 2010, at 53.

Acknowledging that Claimant’s oral ulcers, nasal ulcers, and the increased hyperpigmentation on her face were indicative of lupus, Dr. Lamprakos found no evidence linking the reemergence of lupus to stress, although he conceded it was possible. <em>Id. </em>at 78.</p>

The WCJ also credited Claimant’s testimony that the stressful work environment caused her symptoms of heart palpitations, headaches, dizziness, and nausea and reduced her voice to a whisper. Finding portions of Dr. Baugh’s testimony credible, the WCJ concluded that Claimant suffered an injury in the nature of muscle tension dysphonia from voice overuse. The WCJ further credited Dr. Baugh’s opinion that as a result of the stressful work environment, Claimant sustained an exacerbation of her preexisting lupus, as demonstrated by her oral ulcers, nasal ulcers, and increased hyperpigmentation of the face.

Thus, the WCJ awarded her benefits as of that date. Significantly, however, the WCJ found that Dr. Baugh’s testimony did not establish that Claimant was generally disabled from working as a teacher, but only that she was disabled from working in a classroom with children who have behavioral <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>problems like those in her class at Pastorius Elementary.

The WCAB concluded that because there was no evidence that Employer provided Claimant with Section 306(b)(3) notice of ability to return to work, the Employer did not meet the threshold burden required to modify benefits. Alternatively, the WCAB held that the suspension of Claimant’s benefits was improper because there was no evidence presented that Claimant had ever been released by Dr. Baugh to return to work as a teacher at the Jay Cooke School in September of 2009.</p>

Notwithstanding this muddled procedural history, it is significant that the employer in <em>Allegis Group </em>never issued a notice stopping temporary suspension. Thus, the claimant was receiving benefits at the time the light duty job offer was tendered, and the employer was seeking to change the status quo of such benefits, i.e., suspend them. The court held that “[u]nder these circumstances, Section 306(b)(3) clearly requires Employer to issue a notice of ability to return to work based on its receipt of new medical evidence.” <em>Allegis Group, </em><a href="/a2d/882/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="882 A.2d 1" data-case-ids="8915082" data-case-paths="/a2d/882/0001-01">882 A.2d at 5</a>.

Thus, like Claimant herein, there had been no determination of the claimant’s entitlement to workers’ compensation benefits at the time the job offer was tendered. In due course, the WCJ found that the claimant sustained a compensable injury and granted benefits, but suspended those benefits as of the date of the written job offer, concluding that the claimant was capable of performing the light-duty position.

In addressing the claimant’s evidentiary challenge to the WCJ’s finding that he was capable of performing the light-duty position offered by the employer, the Commonwealth Court opined that the employer failed to satisfy Section 306(b)(3)’s notice requirement. Without providing any analysis regarding why a notice of ability to work was required prior to a determination of a <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>compensable injury, the court merely cited the statutory language of the provision and summarily concluded there was no evidence of compliance.</p>

She argues that where an injured employee has met her burden of proving entitlement to disability benefits in a claim petition proceeding, the burden shifts to the employer to prove a change of status through competent evidence.
