Milano, Chester, and Appellant conversed and drank alcohol until the early morning hours of December 15. Witnesses testified that, during this time, Appellant seemed coherent, was able to walk without swaying or stumbling, and was not slurring his speech. At some point, Appellant and Chester began taunting Milano because they thought he might be homosexual. In spite of the taunting, Milano agreed to give Appellant and Chester a ride home. Traveling in Milano’s car, they eventually proceeded to a wooded area, stopped along the side of the road, and exited the vehicle. Chester struck Milano, causing him to fall to the ground. Appellant pinned Milano down and killed him by slashing his throat repeatedly with a box-cutter. Appellant and Chester ran to the home of a friend, Rich <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>Griscavage. On arriving at Griscavage’s residence, Chester said they had gotten into a fight and “the dude is dead.” Appellant told Chester to “shut up.” Griscavage gave Appellant a ride home on his motorcycle.

For his guilt-phase strategy, Appellant stipulated that he participated in murdering Milano, but not that he acted with specific intent. Thus, the only question for the jury was whether Appellant acted with a specific intent to kill so as to make him guilty of first-degree murder. As to this issue, Appellant advanced a diminished-capacity defense, which negates specific intent so as to mitigate first-degree murder to third-degree murder. <em>See Commonwealth v.

To support the defense, Appellant presented the testimony of multiple experts who indicated that Appellant had a high blood-alcohol content (“BAC”) at the time of the killing and that this, together with brain damage resulting from head injuries sustained during Appellant’s life, impeded Appellant from forming the requisite intent to kill. The experts also developed that, given the amount of alcohol Appellant ingested prior to the killing, he may have been acting in an “alcoholic blackout,” where he could function normally but later have no recall of the time period in question. Two of the experts related that Appellant told them shortly before the retrial that he had no memory of the killing. <em>See Laird, </em><a href="/pa/605/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="605 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="3699023,3699165" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0137-01,/pa/605/0137-02">605 Pa. at 148</a>, <a href="/pa/605/0137-02" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="988 A.2d 618" data-case-ids="3699165,7291244" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0137-02,/a2d/988/0618-01">988 A.2d at 624</a>.</p>

Counsel argued that the publicity was especially damaging because certain advocacy groups were promoting the view that Appellant was motivated to kill Milano by his perception of Milano’s sexual orientation. The Commonwealth responded that the publicity was not excessive and the mere existence of some pretrial publicity did not justify a change of venue. The common pleas court denied the motion but stated that counsel would be permitted to renew it and place any supporting evidence into the record at <em>voir dire. </em>To minimize any further exposure counsel and the Commonwealth entered into an agreement—which the court approved by order issued from the bench—that neither side would speak publicly about the case before trial.

It highlights that the two newspaper articles mentioned above are the only media stories of record. <em>See </em>Brief for the Commonwealth at 93 <em>&amp; </em>n.11. The Commonwealth notes, moreover, that in the three days of jury selection, only a fraction of the 160 panelists stated they had any familiarity with the case, and virtually all of them were stricken, either for cause or via peremptory challenges. The Commonwealth adds that only a single individual—Juror 12—was seated who had indicated any familiarity with the case, and that such familiarity was limited to a suggestion by his co-worker that the underlying facts were “gruesome.” Further, the Commonwealth observes that Juror 12 testified he would put aside what his coworker said and rely solely on the trial evidence and the court’s instructions. As such, the Commonwealth argues that Appellant’s claim lacks arguable merit, counsel acted reasonably in not renewing the motion to change venue, and Appellant has not established a basis to presume prejudice or find actual prejudice.</p>

Gardener testified at the retrial that Appellant: drank alcohol at Chester’s residence, <em>see </em>N.T., Feb. 7, 2007, at 42, 46; drank alcohol at the bar later on, <em>see id. </em>at 48; and was “coherent” upon arriving at his apartment after the killing, <em>id. </em>at 63.

Appellant acknowledges that, in cross-examining Gardener, counsel showed her a transcript of her 1988 trial testimony in an attempt to refresh her recollection, and Gardener testified at the retrial that she had testified truthfully in 1988 when she described Appellant as “drunk” upon his arrival at his apartment after the killing, <em>see id. </em>at 57-58. Appellant complains, however, that counsel failed to: (a) confront Gardener with a statement she gave to police in which she stated that, when Appellant returned to his apartment, he “mumbled” that Chester was alright and then “staggered” into the bedroom; or (b) impeach her with her alleged motive to testify favorably for the Commonwealth by minimizing the amount of alcohol Appellant had consumed.

Phillips testified at the retrial that, when he arrived at the bar that evening, Appellant and Chester were sharing a 64-ounce pitcher of beer and that he (Phillips) refilled the pitcher twice. <em>See </em>N.T., Feb. 5, 2007, at 210. Phillips also stated that, in addition to the beer, he served one shot of liquor to Appellant, and Appellant threw an empty shot glass across the bar in anger. Appellant faults counsel for failing to elicit that, at the preliminary hearing in January 1988, Phillips testified that he had brought a total of four pitchers of beer to Appellant and Chester, and had served Appellant two or three shots of liquor. Appellant takes particular exception in this regard because, at the time of the events, Phillips was the bar owner’s son and he had become the owner by the time of the retrial. Thus, Appellant posits that counsel should have presented evidence that Phillips had a motive to downplay the amount of alcohol he served Appellant because he was concerned about his business incurring civil liability. Although counsel did attempt (unsuccessfully) to introduce into evidence a civil complaint filed by Milano’s parents against the Edgely Inn, Appellant offers that there was other evidence of motive that could have been proffered. In particular, he identifies a statement that Jolanda Thompson gave Joe Stark in which Thompson related that James Phillips, Sr., the owner of the bar in December 1987, had asked her not to say that Chester was drunk that night because Chester was underage.

The court reasoned in particular that, even to the extent the material in Stark’s reports may have been somewhat helpful, Stark credibly testified at the PCRA hearing that he was not reachable when counsel was preparing for the retrial because he was experiencing personal problems and was not maintaining an office, returning phone calls, or responding to contacts. <em>See </em>PCRA Ct. Op. II, <em>slip op. </em>at 23; <em>see </em>also N.T., May 23, 2012, at 43-44, 46-47 (reflecting Attorney Kerrigan’s PCRA testimony that he had tried unsuccessfully to contact Stark). The PCRA court also rejected the premise that Gardener could have been confronted with evidence of motive or bias, particularly since Appellant failed to establish a connection between Gardener’s status as a Florida probationer and a supposed motive to falsify her testimony. More generally, the court recounted that counsel testified his strategy was to demonstrate extreme intoxication by adducing testimony concerning Appellant’s alcohol ingestion from as many witnesses possible. The court reasoned, in this regard, that counsel elicited substantial testimony along these lines and “argue[d] in closing that Appellant was extremely intoxicated at five times the legal limit with a BAC of 0.45 percent.” PCRA Ct.

It bears noting, in this latter respect, that counsel called an expert toxicologist, Gary Lage, PhD, to testify concerning Appellant’s BAC on the night of the murder. Dr. Lage observed that Appellant drank for more than seven hours that evening, from 7:00 pm until after 2:00 am. <em>See </em>N.T., Feb. 8, 2007, at 26. In view of Appellant’s physical characteristics and the number and types of beverages he ingested—and when during the evening he ingested them—the expert estimated that Appellant’s BAC during the early morning hours of December 15, 1987, was approximately 0.45 percent. <em>See id. </em>at 28, 57-58. Dr. Lage explained that this was significant because the effects on the brain become severe, and a coma can develop, when a person’s BAC reaches the range of .40 to .50 percent. <em>See id. </em>at 30.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">10</a>

If counsel had been able to impeach Gardener, moreover, it is unclear how this would have aided his case, since Gardener’s testimony confirmed that Appellant had ingested a significant amount of alcohol and that he was “drunk.” Finally, even if the Stark report on Jolanda Thompson had been available, the relevant portion only pertains to what Phillips’ father said to her (Thompson), and not to Phillips himself.

Appellant also asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to require that these experts read the transcript of his first trial so they would be prepared to answer cross-examination questions about how Appellant could have been operating in an alcoholic blackout when he acted to conceal evidence shortly after the incident and was able to testify about the events at his first trial.</p>

The court observed that Appellant benefit-ted from the testimony of four experts: Dr. Lage, who, as noted, estimated Appellant’s BAC at 0.45 percent; Dr. Dee, who testified that Appellant had sustained brain damage from several head traumas, including an early-1980s skull fracture, and that intoxication would exacerbate the effects of the brain injury to the point where Appellant was unable to plan and carry out a homicide; Dr. Fox, who testified that Appellant could not have formed a specific intent to kill; and Dr. O’Brien, who stated that Appellant’s level of intoxication would seriously impair any person’s functioning and cognition, but when brain damage is added to the picture the effects would become worse.

Based on these sources, Dr. Fox stated that, at the relevant time, Appellant was suffering from a number of psychiatric impairments, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of his abusive childhood (in which his father gave him alcohol as a young boy, beat him arbitrarily, and sexually abused him), ADHD, and organic brain disorder resulting from repetitive head injuries as well as fourteen years of drug abuse and alcohol dependency.

For example, the Amendment precludes prosecutors from suggesting to the jury that it does not bear the final responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the accused’s death. <em>See Caldwell v.

He does not suggest that the trial court’s instructions were faulty in the sense that, by themselves, they precluded the jury from affording complete consideration to his mitigating evidence. Rather, he asserts that the prosecutor’s unfinished question, as recited above, prevented the jury from giving full effect to the mitigating evidence offered by that expert. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 27 (arguing that the Commonwealth “discouraged the jury from finding the mitigating factors identified by Dr. Dee”). He additionally proffers that the court’s curative instruction—as well as its subsequent more general jury charge regarding expert testimony—did little to remedy the problem. In this regard, Appellant references <em>DePew v.

Further, the prosecutor commented to the jury on a subsequent conviction of [DePew’s], unsupported by any evidence in the record, and then after being admonished by the trial judge, who had previously warned against mention of such[,] told the jury that no such conviction existed. The prosecutor then exhibited and commented on a totally irrelevant photograph depicting [De-Pew] next to a marijuana plant.

It may seem at first that a due process argument was litigated on direct appeal, since a claim of prosecutorial misconduct is often a particularized due process claim based on the right to a fair trial. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

However, prosecutorial misconduct may also be grounded on other asserted violations. <em>See Commonwealth v. Reid, </em><a href="/pa/627/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="241" data-cite="627 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="4353006" data-case-paths="/pa/627/0078-01">627 Pa. 78</a>, 126— 27, <a href="/pa/627/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="242" data-cite="99 A.3d 427" data-case-ids="4353006,6915640" data-case-paths="/pa/627/0078-01,/a3d/99/0427-01">99 A.3d 427</a>, 456 (2014). Here, the prosecutorial-misconduct allegation considered on direct appeal related to the principle that it is improper for prosecutors to express their personal beliefs on questions that are exclusively for the jury, including witness credibility. <em>See Laird, </em><a href="/pa/605/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="243" data-cite="605 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="3699023,3699165" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0137-01,/pa/605/0137-02">605 Pa. at 179-80</a>, <a href="/pa/605/0137-02" class="citation" data-index="244" data-cite="988 A.2d 618" data-case-ids="3699165,7291244" data-case-paths="/pa/605/0137-02,/a2d/988/0618-01">988 A.2d at 643</a>. Such precept has often been explained by reference to codes of professional responsibility as they relate to the prosecutorial function, rather than by reference to due process as such. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Grant, </em><a href="/pa/479/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="245" data-cite="479 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1742093" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0074-01">479 Pa. 74</a>, 81, <a href="/pa/479/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="246" data-cite="479 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1742093" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0074-01">387 A.2d 841</a>, 844 (1978). Hence, we will address the present due process argument on its merits rather than invoking the rule that a new theory cannot be raised during post-conviction proceedings in support of the same ineffectiveness claim that was litigated on direct appeal. <em>See, e.g,, Commonwealth v.
