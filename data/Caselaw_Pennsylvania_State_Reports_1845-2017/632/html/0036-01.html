In that decision, the United States Supreme Court held that, under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt any facts that increase a mandatory minimum sentence. In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>the Commonwealth concedes that certain provisions of Section 6317 are unconstitutional in the wake of <em>Alleyne. </em>Nevertheless, the Commonwealth submits that those provisions are severable, and, thus, the statute is capable of application once the violative provisions are excised. While we do not question the legislature’s wisdom or the necessity of severe penalties for those dealing in illegal drugs near our Commonwealth’s schools, for the reasons that follow, we are constrained to conclude that the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Alleyne </em>renders Section 6317 unconstitutional and, further, that, in light of clear legislative intent, severance of the violative provisions from the statute is not permissible. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the trial court, which held Section 6317 to be unconstitutional and that its violative provisions were not severable.</p>

      <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>The Commonwealth first traces the evolution of the United States Supreme Court’s case law regarding the constitutional necessity that a jury must consider any fact which increases the penalty for a crime. Offering the presumption that legislative enactments are constitutional, and that a statute will be found to be unconstitutional only if it clearly, palpably, and plainly violates the Constitution, the Commonwealth nevertheless concedes that <em>Alleyne </em>impacts Section 6317’s proof at sentencing provision. In sum, the Commonwealth divides Section 6317’s provisions into two categories—procedural and substantive—and contends that <em>Alleyne </em>calls into question only the procedural aspects of the statute. Thus, the Commonwealth’s core position is not that, when held up against the mandate of <em>Alleyne, </em>the statute is constitutional <em>in toto, </em>but, rather, as only certain limited procedural provisions of the legislation run afoul of <em>Alleyne, </em>Section 6317 is severable and the substantive provisions remain viable.</p>
    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[218,1234,1155,741]]]'>The Commonwealth, noting public policy favors severability, points to the Statutory Construction Act, which offers the presumption of severability, unless either (1) the “valid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision or application, that it cannot be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one;” or (2) the “remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed” in accordance with the intent of the legislature. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1925. Building on this provision, the Commonwealth reasons that, with the removal of the “fact finding provisions” from the statute, the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are complete and capable of being executed consistent with legislative intent.</p>
    <p id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[219,1998,1154,364]],["BL_100.1",100,[265,304,1155,461]]]'>Specifically, the Commonwealth suggests that subsection (b) of the statute and the proviso in subsection (a)—“the sentencing court finds that”—which places fact finding in the hands of the sentencing court are all that need to be severed from the statute to render it constitutional under <em>Alleyne. </em>The Commonwealth maintains, consistent with the presumption in favor of severability, that this minor excising of the procedural <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>provisions allows the remaining substantive provisions to be capable of execution in accordance with legislative intent. Related thereto, the Commonwealth claims that to find a lack of severability would be to assume that the General Assembly would not have passed the mandatory minimum sentencing if it knew juries would determine operative facts, and stresses that the laudable goal of the statute was to protect the children in our communities from the evils of the illegal drug trade.</p>

Appellee posits that, given a choice of a mandatory minimum post-conviction sentencing statute being transformed into an aggravated criminal offense, with the full panoply of pre-trial (specific notice in charging document), trial (proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a jury), and post-trial (double jeopardy) protections, the legislature may have opted for sentencing guidelines as adequate and preferable for enhancing sentences for drug offenses committed near schools. Thus, ultimately, Appellee urges our Court to conclude that the unconstitutional mandatory minimum sentence statute is not severable.</p>

The United States Supreme Court in <em>Alleyne, </em>however, effected a sea change in this area of the law.

This post-conviction notice provision further l-eveals a legislative intent that the mandatory minimum sentence was not to constitute a brand-new crime, as that would require pre-trial notice.

The Commonwealth asserted that a conviction for the burglary of Jamaal Garnett’s home constituted a second strike under the statute because the evidence at trial revealed that, when appellant committed the burglary, Garnett was home, in a building adapted for overnight accommodations, which satisfied the definition of a “crime of violence” for purposes of the two-strike statute.

There is no controversy over the legislature’s goal in passing Section 6317 or its wisdom in imposing mandatory minimum sentences on those who sell drugs near our schools.

Thus, any severability analysis must take into account this transformation of a mandatory minimum sentencing provision into a substantive offense— with the proximity of the sale of drugs to school property being an element of that crime. Here, the General Assembly could not have <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>been clearer that it did not intend to create a new offense, with its attendant notice requirements, when it stated that the provisions of the mandatory sentencing statute “shall not be an element of the crime.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 6317(b).

The dissenters’ position—effectively converting the remaining valid provisions of the sentencing statute into elements of a new substantive offense—is in direct conflict with the General Assembly’s unambiguous intent that these provisions are not to be an element of the crime. While the legislature may rightfully "still want enhanced penalties for drug sales near our schools,” Dissenting Opinion (Eakin, J.) at 64, 117 A.3d at 264, the General Assembly made it equally and abundantly clear that it did not want them to be a substantive offense.

Abjuring the general discretionary nature of sentencing guidelines, the legislature enacted a most definitive, strident procedure, that included removal of the power of a court to ignore the increased penalty or impose anything less, and codifies a Commonwealth appeal for refusal to apply it. Does this reflect a desire to assure the substance is obeyed, or a desire to elevate process over substance? Establishing sentencing guidelines would not <em>ensure </em>the imposition of a minimum sentence—a situation that the General Assembly repeatedly indicated it wanted to prevent. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 6317(a) (establishing minimum sentence “notwithstanding any other provision of this title, The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act or statute to the contrary”); <em>id., </em>§ 6317(c) (“Sentencing guidelines ... shall not supersede the mandatory sentences provided in this section.”); <em>id. </em>(“There shall be no authority for a court to impose on a defendant to which this section is applicable a lesser sentence than provided for in subsection (a)[.]”).</p>

As for the majority’s reliance on <em>Samuel’s </em>discussion of special verdicts, we must remember <em>Samuel </em>cited a footnote from a 40-year-old plurality decision for the proposition that special verdicts are “universally condemned” within the criminal context. <em>Samuel, </em>at 64 (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Campana, </em><a href="/pa/452/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="452 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="575302" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0233-01">452 Pa. 233</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=304%20A.2d%20432" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="304 A.2d 432">304 A.2d 432</a>, 438 n. 27 (1973) (plurality opinion)). As <em>Samuel </em>was decided <em>pre-Alleyne, </em>I do not find its discussion of special verdicts convincing or dispositive. <em>See Commonwealth v. Jacobs, </em><a href="/pa/614/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="614 Pa. 664" data-case-ids="4206308" data-case-paths="/pa/614/0664-01">614 Pa. 664</a>, <a href="/pa/614/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="39 A.3d 977" data-case-ids="4206308,7315551" data-case-paths="/pa/614/0664-01,/a3d/39/0977-01">39 A.3d 977</a>, 988 (2012) (Saylor, J., concurring) (citation omitted) (questioning policy of categorically prohibiting special verdicts in criminal context).</p>

At the outset, this rationale seems sound; however, citing to other provisions within the Vehicle Code, we further stated in <em>Mockaitis </em>that “enforcement of the legislative purpose will still occur in the ordinary course of enforcement[.]” <em><a href="/pa/575/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="834 A.2d 488" data-case-ids="630448,9080480" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0005-01,/a2d/834/0488-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/pa/575/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="834 A.2d 488" data-case-ids="630448,9080480" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0005-01,/a2d/834/0488-01">at 503</a> (citations omitted). I see no difference here. Execution of the legislative purpose to develop drug-free school zones by imposing a mandatory two-year minimum would still occur in an ordinary manner, <em>i.e., </em>by utilizing our existing Rules—the execution of which does not require the creation of a new procedural framework. <em>See Newman, </em>at 105 (observing numerous criminal statutes are executed in ordinary manner despite absence of proof-of-sentencing mechanism).</p>

Can the valid portion of the statute effectuate that intent? A procedure that complies with <em>Alleyne </em>is simple, in place, and would achieve the legislative purpose. Accordingly, I would hold the invalid provisions are severable, and respectfully dissent.</p>

In so holding, the majority does not address the statute’s manifest intent. While these procedural aspects were certainly important to the legislature in its enactment of the statute, there is nothing of record to assume that they were so germane that but for their incorporation, the legislature would not have enacted the statute. Indeed, the driving force behind the particular statute in question was primarily to impose higher sentences upon those who sell drugs in school zones, in order to keep drugs away from our children. Such is a legitimate, constitutional, legislative decision.</p>
