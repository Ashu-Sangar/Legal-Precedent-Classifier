On May 25, 2011, following civil service testing and ranking, the City established a promotional list for the positions of Fire Captain and Fire Lieutenant that was set to expire by operation of law on May 25, 2013 (hereafter, the May 2011 list), two years from the date it was established. The City thereafter promoted 35 employees into the position of Fire Captain and 78 into the position of Fire Lieutenant from the list, leaving 82 individuals on the list for the position of Fire Captain and 140 on the list for Fire Lieutenant.</p>

The City, however, declined to fill these vacancies through utilization of the May 2011 list. Instead, on May 3, 2013, the Director of Public Safety announced at a City Council hearing the City’s decision to await the expiration of the May 2011 list by operation of law in three weeks’ time, and to fill the vacancies with the top-ranking candidates from the next promotional list. This new list was to be established following civil service testing and ranking after May 25, 2013.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Director of Public Safety explained that the City wanted to allow the May 2011 list to expire because the candidates who remained on the list were ranked near the bottom, and the City would prefer to choose the highest ranked candidates from a new list.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Following oral argument, the court entered an order granting the Union peremptory judgment in mandamus and directing the City to fill vacancies for the positions of Fire Captain and Fire Lieutenant prior to May 25, 2013. The trial court relied on Section 7-401 (e) of the Home Rule Charter to hold that vacancies must be filled by promotion at the first possible opportunity rather than at the City’s discretion. Finding no impediment preventing the City from doing so, and specifically finding that the vacancies at issue were already “budgeted,” the trial court found that peremptory judgment in mandamus was appropriate to compel the performance of the ministerial act of immediately promoting candidates from the promotional list, and to vindicate the Union’s clear legal right to this relief.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The City further argued that mandamus relief was inappropriate because the Fire Commissioner has discretion to decide whether or when to promote candidates and, therefore, the promotion process does not involve a ministerial act by the City or a clear legal right to relief for the Union.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[267,767,1153,634]]]'>The Commonwealth Court agreed with the City, reversed the trial court’s order, and remanded to the trial court to dismiss the Union’s complaint. <em>Philadelphia Firefighters’ Union v. City of Philadelphia, <a href="/a3d/78/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="78 A.3d 16" data-case-ids="7301995" data-case-paths="/a3d/78/0016-01">78 </a></em><a href="/a3d/78/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="78 A.3d 16" data-case-ids="7301995" data-case-paths="/a3d/78/0016-01">A.3d 16</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2013). Examining Sections 7-401(e) of the Home Rule Charter and 9.021 of the Civil Service Regulations, the Commonwealth Court interpreted them to mean that promotion from the promotional list is the required method of filling vacancies (unless the vacancy is filled by demotion, transfer, reinstatement, or from a layoff list, in accord with Regulation 9.021), and found nothing in these provisions requiring promotion as soon as a position becomes vacant.</p>
    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[264,1441,1156,895]]]'>Additionally, the Court found nothing to prevent the City from allowing an old list to expire so that it could promote individuals from a new list, and nothing that granted candidates on a particular list a right to be promoted into a vacancy. Finally, the Commonwealth Court observed that the Civil Service Regulations gave the Commissioner discretion in deciding when to promote employees or to fill vacancies. Phila. Civil Serv. Reg. 10.022 (“[e]ligible candidates <em>may </em>be certified and appointed at any time after the list has been established until the list expires or is exhausted or cancelled.”) (emphasis added); 11.04 (providing the procedure to be used where the appointing authority, here, the Commissioner, decides to fill more than one vacancy at a time). Because there was no right to a promotion, and the promotion of individuals from a promotional list is not a ministerial act, the Commonwealth Court held the trial court erred in granting mandamus relief.</p>

According to the Union, the Civil Service Regulations likewise require vacancies to be filled immediately by promotion (if they are not filled by other specified means). Phila. Civil Serv. Reg. 9.021 (“[u]nless vacancies are filled by demotion, transfer, reinstatement, or by certification from a layoff list, they shall be filled so far as practicable by the promotion of permanent employees in the Civil Service.”). Because, according to the Union, it was both possible and practicable for the City to fill the vacancies by promotion, it argues the City had no discretion to simply allow the vacancies to remain unfilled until a new promotional list was established.</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[213,1604,1155,744]]]'>The Union also attempts to undermine the Commonwealth Court’s holding on policy grounds, arguing that the civil service system exists to limit and control employment premised on favoritism, cronyism, and discrimination by maintaining objectivity in employment decisions. Under the Commonwealth Court holding, according to the Union, the Fire Commissioner could keep vacancies open for any length of time, years or decades in fact, for the sole purpose of awaiting the appearance of a desired candidate on an eligibility list. Addressing the City’s suggestion that individuals from the top of a new list would be better candidates than those at the bottom of the expiring list, the Union argues that every candidate who was on the May 2011 list was there because the City deemed them objectively qualified.</p>

      <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>The Union argues that the Commonwealth Court decision in this case is inconsistent with <em>Walls v.

In <em>Walls, </em>the City and a group of civil service applicants agreed to extend a promotional list to three years. Another group of applicants challenged this decision, arguing that the promotional list expired by operation of law after two years. The trial court ordered the City to cease using the list and create a new one, agreeing that the old list had expired after two years. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed, examining the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter and Civil Service Regulations and finding no exception to the two-year mandatory expiration. The Union characterizes <em>Walls </em>as the Commonwealth Court’s rejection of the City’s “attempt to dodge specific mandates of the civil service regulations.” Union’s brief at 9.</p>

As further background relevant to this current legal dispute, the City and Union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement pursuant to Act 111, 43 P.S. § 217.1-217.10. Prior to the instant litigation, the Union submitted a set of proposals as part of its interest arbitration process with the City, specifically requesting that the City be required to <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>fill all vacancies within 60 days, or, where a vacancy arose within 60 days of the expiration of an active promotional list, before the list expired. The Union's proposal was rejected, and interest arbitration resulted in two awards setting forth the City’s management rights, including the right to determine selection and direction of personnel.</p>
