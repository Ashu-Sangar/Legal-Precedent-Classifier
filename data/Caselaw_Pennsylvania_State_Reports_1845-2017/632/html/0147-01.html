The petition also asserted that these enactments offended various provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution governing legislative processes, including the general requirement that no bill shall be passed containing more than a single subject. <em>See </em>Pa.

The Legislative Appellants also take issue with Judge Pellegrini's application of the law-of-the-case doctrine, noting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the principle does not operate as an inflexible command relative to decisions made at different stages of a proceeding. <em>See </em>Brief for the Legislative Appellants at 30 (citing <em>Riccio v.

Appellees also challenge the Legislative Appellants’ standing to appeal, since the Commonwealth Court held that no relief could be awarded against them. We decline, however, to credit this position. The Sears Appellees named the houses of the General Assembly and legislative leaders as respondents in their lawsuit, and Appellees secured a judicial determination that several of the Assembly’s enactments were unconstitutional. Thus, the Legislature is a party litigant with a manifest interest in the outcome of the appeals, and we will entertain its arguments which, in any event, overlap substantially with those advanced by the Executive Appellants. As to the Executive Appellants, whose standing is challenged by the Appellee Weisblatt, they are subject to an explicit order of the Commonwealth Court requiring them to refrain from enforcing the provisions of Acts 46 and 26 and, thus, plainly are aggrieved.</p>
