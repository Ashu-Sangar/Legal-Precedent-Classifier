    <p id="b514-11" data-blocks='[["BL_514.11",514,[257,1313,1150,202]]]'>Appellant, Stephen Treiber, appeals from the order denying him collateral relief from his criminal convictions and death sentence pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b514-12" data-blocks='[["BL_514.12",514,[255,1546,1151,472]]]'>On the night of March 9, 2001, appellant set fire to his home while his girlfriend, Denise Riddle, and his two-year-old daughter, Jessica, slept inside. As the home burned, appellant and Ms. Riddle escaped, but Jessica remained in her crib until firefighters removed her; however, they were unable to revive her. Appellant was charged with criminal homicide, reckless endangerment, and multiple counts of arson; the Commonwealth gave notice of its intent to pursue the death penalty.</p>
    <p id="b514-13" data-blocks='[["BL_514.13",514,[255,2042,1151,314]],["BL_515.1",515,[221,311,1154,737]]]'>Appellant’s neighbor, who went to help after seeing smoke emanating from the home, testified at trial that appellant and Ms. Riddle were standing on a second-story deck, and Ms. Riddle screamed for help while appellant calmly stood by with his arms folded. Appellant asked about the well-being of his dogs but, when referring to Jessica, said, “[T]he firemen will <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>get her. She’s probably dead anyway.” N.T. Trial, 9/30/02, at 97. A fire marshal who investigated the scene testified the fire had been started at two points of origin—one in the basement and the other in the garage—using gasoline, clothing, straw, and candles. He noted the home’s security system had been disabled and one wire had been cut. The marshal also observed a chain ladder affixed to the residence, which, he reasoned, had been recently tethered to the home because it had no signs of rust. Members of the fire and police departments also testified Jessica’s bedroom door was open, and stated appellant was unusually calm and inquired only about his dogs. At the scene, police told appellant they were searching for Jessica, to which he responded, “[W]ell, it’s probably too late anyway.” <em>Id., </em>at 242.</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[220,1071,1154,794]]]'>At trial, Ms. Riddle described appellant as very controlling, stating he implemented and enforced rules that shoes not be worn in the home, and that bedroom doors be closed and locked. Ms. Riddle also mentioned appellant had previously forbidden her from going to a local bar, once even threatening to burn it down if she went there again. She testified that, during the fire, appellant escorted her and two of their dogs onto the deck, but told her he could not rescue Jessica because “the smoke was too bad[.]” N.T. Trial, 10/2/02, at 124-25. Yet, Ms. Riddle recalled she did not observe much smoke at that time. She also testified that after Jessica was pronounced dead, appellant instructed her not to talk to police, and when she expressed her sorrow of Jessica’s death to appellant, he replied they “could always make another little Jessica[.]” <em>Id., </em>at 136.</p>

Weeks before the fire, appellant beeame obsessed with fire safety, making Ms. Riddle and her 22-year old son, Erik Keith, practice fire-evacuation routes. One month before the fire, appellant purchased straw on four separate occasions, along with two five-gallon gas cans, and he bought gasoline on two separate occasions the day of the fire. The week before the fire, appellant affixed a chain ladder to the residence as a <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>means of escape. Four days before the fire, appellant called an ADT Security Services employee to his home to update his security system. He disclosed to her he knew how to disable the security system and said a fire might start in his home in a few days. A funeral director testified that during meetings with appellant for Jessica’s funeral arrangements, he did not show emotion and repeatedly referred to Jessica as “it.” N.T. Trial, 10/3/02, at 161.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[255,747,1157,1154]]]'>Evidence of appellant’s motive and intent was also introduced at trial. Appellant’s unwillingness to pay child support was established by testimony from Jodie Treiber, Jessica’s mother. Ms. Treiber stated appellant had a visitation weekend with Jessica scheduled for March 9—the weekend of the fire—but appellant insisted he take Jessica early, <em>ie., </em>the previous Tuesday of that week. When appellant picked up Jessica, Ms. Treiber informed him she intended to increase his child-support payments. Jamie Pianta,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> who accompanied appellant and Mr. Keith on the trip to pick up Jessica, testified appellant discussed his plans to kill Jessica to avoid paying child support, stating he would use rope, gasoline, straw, and candles to start a fire in the home. Mr. Pianta said appellant expressed the same plans to him and Mr. Keith about one month earlier, during another trip to pick up Jessica. Other witnesses testified about appellant’s financial motives for the murder. For instance, one month before the fire, appellant tried to increase the limits on his credit card and his homeowner’s insurance, and sought to purchase life insurance on Jessica, naming himself as beneficiary. He also changed his automobile comprehensive deductible but did not alter his collision insurance.</p>

Specifically, it asserted appellant, about six weeks before the fire, contrived a threatening note and surreptitiously attached it to his own mailbox, arranging for Ms. Riddle to find it and report <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>it to police. The Commonwealth contended the note was appellant’s effort to cast suspicion away from himself and onto an unknown intruder. The note, which was comprised of letters cut from printed materials glued onto the paper, was addressed to “Steve,” and said, “[G]et rid of dogs or I kill them and burn you out again.” N.T. Trial, 10/2/02, at 88-89. Earlier that day, appellant called Ms. Riddle and told her someone was lurking around their home. When police arrived to investigate, appellant told them the doorbell rang earlier in the night but no one was there, and he saw the note affixed to the mailbox at that time. Police discovered hairs stuck to glue in the envelope and subsequently retained the services of DNA experts Dr. Joy Halverson and Dr. Christopher Basten. They determined one of the hairs was a canine hair, compared it to the hair of appellant’s dog, and concluded the hair was 1,000 times more likely to have come from appellant’s dog than any other dog.</p>

C.S. § 2502(a), arson endangering persons, <em>id., </em>§ 3301(a), arson endangering property, <em>id., </em>§ 3301(c), and recklessly endangering another person, <em>id., </em>§ 2705. At the penalty phase, the jury found three aggravating circumstances and two mitigators. The aggravating circumstances were: (1) appellant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony (arson), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); (2) appellant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person other than the victim of the murder, <em>id., </em>§ 9711(d)(7); and (3) the victim was a child under 12 years of age, <em>id., </em>§ 9711(d)(16). As for the mitigating circumstances, the jury found appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, <em>id., </em>§ 9711(e)(1), and a positive work history, falling within § 9711(e)(8)’s catch-all provision. However, the jury determined the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and sentenced appellant to death.

Trial, 10/2/02, at 85-92; N.T. Trial, 10/7/02 at 95-98. While initial testing of the note produced no forensic evidence, a scientist ultimately found two hairs embedded in the dried glue on the paper and concluded one of the hairs was canine. <em>See </em>N.T. Trial, 10/3/02, at 14-17. Police sought to ascertain whether the hair originated from appellant’s dogs, as this would implicate appellant as the note’s author. Accordingly, they sent the hair samples to Joy Halverson, DVM—a California veterinarian and epidemiologist, who also had practical experience in molecular biology and held herself out as a forensic canine DNA analyst. <em>See id., </em>at 109-12. Police also provided blood and saliva reference samples from appellant’s dogs. The district attorney notified appellant’s counsel of the scheduled testing.</p>
    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[223,1059,1154,1167]]]'>In response, appellant’s counsel telephoned several individuals knowledgeable in animal DNA analysis, including Marcia Eggleston, Ph.D, who oversaw the genetic testing of animals at the University of California, Davis, to determine whether a defense expert should be present during the testing. <em>See </em>N.T. PCRA Hearing, 8/10/09, at 32-34. Dr. Eggleston informed counsel she was familiar with Dr. Halverson’s work, Dr. Halverson was qualified to process canine DNA samples using standard protocols, and the procedures were straightforward and generally accepted within the scientific community. <em>See id,, </em>at 39-40, 151. Dr. Eggleston offered to review the results of Dr. Halverson’s test, but she did not tell counsel: (1) canine DNA evidence was novel; (2) Dr. Halverson was not qualified; (3) the genetic DNA markers used by Dr, Halverson were invalid; or (4) her methodology was flawed. <em>See id., </em>at 219. Based on those conversations—but prior to actual testing or preparation of any report—counsel abandoned further inquiry into the scientific validity of canine DNA evidence and ceased efforts to obtain a defense expert; instead, he chose a strategy of advancing the notion that the hairs were merely contaminants, which came in contact with the note after it was prepared. <em>See id., </em>at 40-41.</p>

Dr. Halverson’s reports declared a match between the hair sample found on the note and the reference blood sample taken from appellant’s dog, even though the report admitted the sample was “suboptimal” and produced “low template quantity or quality” DNA. Reports of Joy Halverson, DVM, 10/2/01, at 4, &amp; 8/26/02, at 1, available at Petitioner’s Evidentiary Hearing Exhibits, Vol. IX, tab 2 &amp; 3. Dr. Halverson initially opined:</p>

Yet, in a supplemental report, she indicated that since her last report she “completed coursework on forensic DNA analysis and ha[d] a greater understanding of the use of the likelihood ratio for estimating the significance” of a match between the hair and reference samples. Report of Joy Halverson, DVM, 8/26/02, at 1, available at Petitioner’s Evidentiary Hearing Exhibits, Vol. IX, tab 3. She explained she had come to appreciate the necessity of abandoning a straightforward application of the product rule, in favor of applying a likelihood ratio which could correct for “population substructure found in dog breeds and for the data missing from profiles of suboptimal DNA samples, such as the hair in this case.” <em>Id. </em>By applying this ratio and cross-referencing Dr. Basten’s supportive report, Dr. Halverson adjusted her previous probability estimate and concluded it was 1,000 times more likely the hair came from appellant’s dog than any other dog.</p>

At trial, Dr. Hal-verson testified—consistent with her report—that her testing revealed a match between the hair sample and the reference <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>blood sample from appellant’s dog. She concluded it was “a thousand times more likely that they match because they came from the same dog than because they came from two dogs by coincidence.” N.T. Trial, 10/3/02, at 129. This calculation was supported through Dr. Basten’s testimony. <em>See id., </em>139-41. On cross-examination, trial counsel did not question Dr. Halverson regarding her qualifications and did not object when she was proffered as an expert in canine DNA analysis and comparison. <em>See id., </em>at 116. Instead, trial counsel told Dr. Halverson, “I’m certainly not going to quibble with you about your findings.” <em>Id., </em>at 132. Trial counsel made no inquiries about her protocols, the actual testing, or the ensuing analysis; he merely confirmed Dr. Halverson was unfamiliar with the source of the hair samples tested and asked her a few questions about the second hair found on the note, which had yielded no DNA profile. <em>See id., </em>at 132-34. He did not cross-examine Dr. Basten at all. <em>See id., </em>at 143.</p>
    <p id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[225,1225,1153,741]]]'>Appellant testified at trial and denied creating the threatening note or committing arson or murder. <em>See </em>N.T. Trial, 10/5/02, at 36-37, 61-62. Consistent with trial counsel’s strategy, a DNA expert was not presented in the defense’s case. During closing arguments, trial counsel did not dispute Dr. Halverson’s DNA match, instead advancing the contamination proposition. <em>See </em>N.T. Trial, 10/7/02, at 75-77. In its closing, the Commonwealth stressed the canine DNA evidence connected appellant to the note, demonstrating his preparation and intent to carry out the arson and murder. The Commonwealth also emphasized the fact the hairs were embedded in dried glue, arguing this proved the hairs became attached to the note while the glue was still wet, <em>i.e., </em>during the note’s preparation. <em>See id., </em>at 96-97.</p>

N.T. PCRA Hearing, 8/10/09, at 138. Dr. Eggleston was the chairperson for the canine-genetics workshop at the ISAG and the execu<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>tive director of Veterinary Genetics Lab (VGL), a reference lab for the ISAG. <em>Id., </em>at 140. Dr. Eggleston disclosed Dr. Halverson’s “ten marker” methodology was known to her and ISAG as early as 1996, <em>id., </em>at 214-16, 222, and both she and VGL analyzed those ten markers from 2000-2002, <em>id., </em>at 148-45, 147, 163. She also stated any worldwide lab interested in analyzing and testing Dr. Halverson’s markers was able to do so at that time. <em>Id., </em>at 145. Although Dr. Eggleston conceded canine DNA testing was generally accepted within the scientific community, <em>id., </em>at 205, she testified Dr. Halverson’s particular methodologies and practices used in appellant’s case were not, <em>id., </em>at 161, 163, 166-202. She stated only four of Dr. Halverson’s ten markers were considered adequate. <em>Id., </em>at 165. Based on her own analysis, Dr. Eggleston concluded there was no scientifically reliable way to determine whether the hair sample came from appellant’s dog; thus, she opined the results of the testing were inconclusive. <em>Id., </em>at 202.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In response, the Commonwealth presented testimony from Dr. Halverson and Dr. Basten to the effect that their methods were generally accepted. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T.

N.T. PCRA Hearing, 8/10/09, at 148-49. She told counsel canine DNA testing was generally accepted in the scientific community and informed him an expert was not needed because Dr. Halverson had been conducting canine DNA analysis for many years and, thus, Dr. Halverson likely knew the accepted protocols for testing and extracting DNA from the hair. <em>Id., </em>at 150, 213-14, 216-17. Yet, she told counsel an expert should evaluate Dr. Halverson’s interpretation of the testing and offered to conduct such evaluations. <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>
      <em>Id., </em>at 150-52. She also stated it was not possible to analyze Dr. Halverson’s methodologies or conclusions until testing was completed. <em>Id., </em>at 153-54, 174-75. Dr. Eggleston did not tell counsel that canine DNA evidence was novel, Dr. Halverson was not qualified, the genetic DNA markers used by Dr. Halverson were invalid, or her methodology was flawed. <em>See id., </em>at 219. She also admitted to vouching for Dr. Halverson’s ability to process the samples, which encompasses the use of DNA markers. <em>Id., </em>at 221. Dr. Eggleston had only one telephone conversation with counsel, and counsel never indicated he would send her Dr. Halverson’s reports after testing or retain her to review the reports, nor did he ask her to refer him to another DNA expert. <em>Id., </em>at 154-55, 203.</p>

Trial counsel remarked he initially considered a Frye<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> challenge; however, after discussing canine DNA evidence with experts, including Dr. Eggleston, he concluded a <em>Frye </em>challenge or any other pretrial motion would be inappropriate. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 8/10/09, at 34-36, 39-41. He also decided it would be futile to call a defense DNA expert at trial and cross-examine Dr. Halverson and Dr. Basten on the validity of their findings. <em>Id., </em>at 40-41. Trial counsel explained the reasons for his “contamination” strategy, one of which was based on his conversations with canine DNA experts. He also recalled appellant told him his dogs were outside before the threatening note was discovered, which, he reasoned, was one explanation for the hair. <em>Id., </em>at 80-81. Trial counsel felt a contamination theory would be further supported by the fact the note had been in the Commonwealth’s possession for six months before a hair had been found and had been transported <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>various times between laboratories and other locations. <em>Id., </em>at 36, 40-41, 80-81.

Specifically, the Commonwealth notes Dr. Halverson’s testing was generally accepted in the scientific community at the time of trial, appellant’s own canine DNA expert testified to the same effect at the PCRA hearings, and a difference of expert opinion has no bearing on the admissibility of Dr. Halverson’s theories and methodologies.</p>

In support, appellant claims Dr. Halver-son’s experience focused on bird DNA testing and she did not publish materials involving canine DNA identification. Noting Dr. Halverson stated her qualifications stemmed from on-the-job training, appellant asserts she is unqualified because a mere technician lacking educational credentials cannot serve as an expert in forensic DNA evidence. Appellant claims he was prejudiced because, had counsel objected to Dr. Halver-son’s qualifications, the court would have disqualified her as an expert and the Commonwealth would not have been able to find a substitute expert, as she was the only individual in the country willing to testify about canine DNA testing.</p>

Appellant opines effective cross-examination would have undermined the Commonwealth’s claim that the hair found on the threatening note matched his dog, thereby weakening the Commonwealth’s arguments regarding intent, identity, premeditation, and absence of mistake.

One month before the fire, he purchased straw on four separate occasions, along with two five-gallon gas cans, and he bought gasoline on two separate occasions the day of the fire—straw, gasoline, and two five-gallon gas cans were recovered at the fire’s points of origin. During that month, he also changed his automobile comprehensive deductible to cover his vehicle <em>if destroyed by </em>fire—notably, he did not alter his collision insurance. Further, he tried to increase the limits on his homeowner’s insurance and sought to purchase life insurance on Jessica, naming himself as beneficiary. A few days before the fire, he affixed a chain ladder to the residence as a means of escape. The jury heard testimony that appellant, on two separate occasions, discussed his plans to kill Jessica to avoid paying child support, stating he would use rope, gasoline, straw, and candles to start a fire in the home. Evidence established the security system had been disabled and the fire was started by using clothing, gasoline, straw, and candles.</p>

He told the ADT employee he knew how to disable his home security system and said a fire may start in his home in a few days, indicating its likely points of origin—the same areas as the origin of the fire four days later. Because appellant told the employee about the threatening note and that a fire might soon occur, the employee offered to install camera equipment that day at no immediate cost, but appellant refused. Even though the employee explained she could place the cameras in any location appellant wished, he told her he didn’t “think the camera is going to catch [any potential perpetrators] because they’re going to come through the front door.” N.T. Trial, 10/4/02, at 70.

Ms. Riddle did not initially notice the note on the mailbox when she arrived home; thus, appellant insisted they leave the home and visit his parents. When they left, Ms. Riddle noticed the note, and appellant made copies of it before calling police. When police arrived to investigate, appellant told police the doorbell rang earlier in the night but no one was there when he answered, and he saw the note affixed to the mailbox at that time. Despite telling police he noticed the note on the mailbox earlier, appellant did not retrieve it at that time but instead waited until Ms. Riddle came home and discovered it.</p>

Appellant had previously forbidden his girlfriend to go to a local bar, once even threatening to burn it down if she went there again. On the day of the fire, however, appellant called her at least ten times, repeatedly urging her to go to the bar. Several witnesses testified appellant, before and after Jessica’s death, was very calm and showed no emotion. Other witnesses, including Ms. Riddle and appellant’s neighbor, stated he made no effort to assist rescuing Jessica, despite the facts that her bedroom was 11 feet away from his and, regarding Jessica’s fire escape, that he previously told Ms. Riddle he could easily get to her bedroom by breaking a wall in a bathroom that separated their bedrooms. The jury also heard testimony that appellant referred to his deceased daughter as “it” during funeral arrangements and, while she was burning inside the home, stated, “ ‘[T]he firemen -will get her.

PCRA Court Opinion, 3/27/12, at 56. We find the PCRA court’s conclusion is supported by the record and free of legal error. Appellant fails to acknowledge Mr. Pianta was essentially placed in a witness-protection program because he feared appellant would retaliate after he implicated him in the arson and murder, especially due to the fact that, as his landlord, appellant knew where he lived and had access to his apartment. The challenged evidence was not material or helpful to appellant, as it would have raised the inference he would retaliate.

And he does not explain how he was prejudiced by counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness, but merely contends counsel’s ineffectiveness in presenting testimony of good prison behavior, coupled with his deficiencies in investigating mental health, undermined confidence in the penalty phase’s outcome. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Brief, at 69.
