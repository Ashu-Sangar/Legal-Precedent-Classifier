The Commonwealth Court held that the Manheim Township School District (“the School District”) must provide transportation to both parents’ residences. For the reasons set forth herein, we agree that the School District is required to provide free transportation to and from both parents’ residences in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b640-4" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[261,740,1153,468]]]'>The facts of this case are not in dispute. Timothy L. Watts (“Father”) shares legal and physical custody of his child, C.W., with C.W.’s mother (“Mother”) on an alternating week basis pursuant to a court order. Both Father and Mother reside within the School District where C.W. attends public middle school. Father’s residence is approximately 4 ½ miles from C.W.’s school and Mother’s residence is approximately 5 ½ miles from the school. C.W.’s bus stop at Mother’s home is approximately 1.9 miles from Father’s residence.</p>

The School District estimated that 400 students benefitted from transportation to multiple locations, with somewhere between 50 and 75 of these students being transported to multiple parents’ residences as a result of custody arrangements. The School District stated that it did not have information on how many students were subject to an alternating week custody arrangement like C.W.</p>

The combined effect of these changes reduced the bus fleet by four busses, saving the School District approximately $200,000 per year. The School District does not indicate what portion of its savings was attributable to limiting students in shared physical custody arrangements to only one residence. Initially, the School District did not <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>strictly enforce the “one seat per student” policy and instead provided bussing for C.W. to and from both parents’ residences during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 school years.</p>
    <p id="b641-4" data-blocks='[["BL_641.4",641,[214,481,1156,788]]]'>In the summer of 2012, the School District notified Father that it intended to enforce the new transportation policy, and although there was an available seat on an existing bus route with an established stop servicing Father’s home, the School District would only transport C.W. to and from Mother’s residence, as her address was listed as the default address on C.W.’s school paperwork. Because of Father’s work schedule, he had to hire a nanny to drive C.W. to Mother’s house so that C.W., a seventh-grader, did not have to walk over 1.9 miles to his bus stop. Father sent several letters to the School District and attended a school board meeting voicing his objection to the transportation policy, all to no avail. Subsequently, Father instituted the instant action seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to require the School District to provide transportation to and from both residences.</p>

Alternatively, the School District asserted that it <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>had discretion to limit C.W.’s transportation to and from one residence.</p>

The trial court limited its decision to the facts of this case, rendering it applicable only where: 1) both parents live in the same school district; 2) the student is subject to an equally-split, shared legal and physical custody agreement; and 3) a school bus already serves each residence and could accommodate the student without any further cost or adding an extra stop.

Section 1361(1) states that “[t]he board of school directors in any school district may ... provide for the free transportation of any resident pupil to and from the ... school in which he is <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>lawfully enrolled_”24 P.S. § 13-1361(1). The School District does not dispute that it owes a duty of transportation to C.W. as a “resident pupil” based on Section 1361(1), as it has elected to provide transportation for its students. The contested issue is what this duty of transportation entails, and specifically, whether it requires transportation to Father’s residence.</p>

It would be illogical to hold that the transportation that is provided is from some location other than the student’s residence. As further support that transportation for purposes of 1361(1) must be to and from school to a student’s residence, Section 1366 of the School Code sets forth how to compute any distance specified in the School Code. Specifically, any distance calculated “between the residence of any pupil and any public school to be attended by him” must be computed by removing the distance between the student’s “dwelling house” and the public road. 24 P.S. § 13-1366 (Computation of distances).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Therefore, the relevant distances in the School <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>Code are based entirely on the student’s residence.

It is undisputed that the School District’s modification to its transportation policy affected 400 students and saved approximately $200,000 per year. Of these 400 students, the School District eliminated stops to more than one residence for 50-75 students because of physical custody arrangements. Assuming that the appropriate number is 75 students and the savings are equal per student, this represents 19% of the 400 students and therefore $38,000 of the $200,000 in savings.

I find the existence of this circumstance material to the outcome because it means that accommodating C.W.’s living arrangements would not substantially add to the school district’s financial or administrative burden in providing free transportation to its students. Thus, the county court’s decision to provide relief, and the specific relief ordered, are closely tailored to the dispute’s underlying facts as they were developed of record. It is not evident to me that the same relief would be required in a different situation, such as where the school district was able to demonstrate that providing transportation to both residences would require the expenditure of funds far in excess of the private cost of transporting the student to school or the appropriate bus stop.</p>

Since the School Code does not speak directly to this situation, the question becomes whether the Legislature would have intended for this extra cost to be borne by the school district or the family.

That body did not evidently consider the possibility of multiple homes within a single school district, as evidenced by the Code’s failure to provide guidance relative to such circumstances.</p>

For example, the Code does not affirmatively require busing. Hence, a significant increase in the cost of busing might lead some school districts to discontinue the service, or, alternatively, to curtail educational programs or raise taxes. Accounting for such tradeoffs falls within the domain of the school district in the first instance, and it lies within the legislative sphere to balance the broader policy considerations associated with affording school districts discretion in this area. As such, absent further legislative guidance, I share the dissent’s concern with having the judicial branch make broadly-worded rulings that are likely to bind school districts on a widespread basis across Pennsylvania.</p>

The rule that a student cannot have more than one residence for enrollment purposes applies equally to the student’s entitlement to free transportation. A school district fulfills its obligation to provide free transportation to a resident student when it transports them to and from their designated residence in the school district in which the student is enrolled.

The likely burden to the taxpayers and cost-benefit of such a rule should be examined carefully and decided by the elected state legislators. To determine whether it is appropriate to impose such a requirement on all the districts in the Commonwealth, it is necessary to evaluate in public hearings the various policy issues and consequences of mandating transportation to and from multiple residences for each student. Such a change in policy will present a logistical strain for school directors to create bus schedules while promoting efficiency and safety.
