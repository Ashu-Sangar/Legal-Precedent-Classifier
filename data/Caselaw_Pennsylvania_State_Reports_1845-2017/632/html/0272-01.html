    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[257,437,1152,689]]]'>Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company (“PTNA”) and its subsidiary, American Network Insurance Company (“ANIC”) (collectively, the “Companies”), are Pennsylvania life insurers specializing in long-term care insurance, covering skilled-nursing, nursing home, and assisted living and home health care for individuals with chronic illnesses or disabilities. In January 2009, the Commonwealth Court ordered the rehabilitation of the Companies, upon application of then-insurance Commissioner Joel Ario, who cited the consent of both entities as the sole grounds for the orders of rehabilitation. In accordance with the governing statutory scheme, <em>see </em>40 P.S. § 221.15, the Commonwealth Court appointed Commissioner Ario as statutory rehabilitator.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[254,1153,1151,527]]]'>The Companies’ troubles began in the 1990’s, when they widely sold policies carrying generous benefits, which proved to be underpriced and poorly underwritten. These policies are referred to here as “OldCo policies,” because by 2002 the Companies were issuing better underwritten policies (the “NewCo policies”) which became profitable. The financial fallout from the sale of OldCo policies, however, resulted in the involvement of numerous state regulators, including the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, which commenced an eight-year period of formal supervision of the Companies.</p>
    <p id="b338-6" data-blocks='[["BL_338.6",338,[255,1705,1149,358]]]'>Rate increases for OldCo policies were a linchpin in the Companies’ prospects for improving their financial condition, but these required approval from state regulators across the nation, and efforts to obtain such approval attained disparate results. The inability to secure enough increases, and the Companies’ deteriorated solvency, apparently led to their ultimate consent to rehabilitation.</p>

Grounds for liquidation existed, because both Companies indisputably were and are insolvent, <em>see id. </em>§§ 221.19, 221.14, although they had substantial assets and the means to pay claims for years to come. Given the undisputed grounds for liquidation, the central focus of the proceedings in the Commonwealth Court was placed on the propriety of conversion, which, again, is measured according to whether further attempts at rehabilitation would substantially increase the risk of loss or would be futile. <em>See id. </em>§ 221.18.</p>

(experts retained by the Commissioner), and United Health Actuarial Services, Inc. (experts retained by Intervenors). Intervenors presented evidence to support their position that future premium revenue—enhanced by rate increases and earnings on assets and cash flow—would cover future claims that will develop over the next sixty years. The Commissioner, then Michael F. Consedine, presented evidence to the contrary, in support of his position that continued rehabilitation was futile and that liquidation was warranted.</p>

Rather, it showed that a rehabilitation plan was abandoned in its nascency. In short, the Rehabilitator did not prove that continued rehabilitation substantially increases the risk to policyholders, creditors and the public or is futile. The quality assets held by the Companies and the existence of guaranty funds provide a safety net for their policyholders during continued rehabilitation. By contrast, liquidation promises immediate harm to the policyholders, creditors and the public, as the Reha-bilitator acknowledged to the Court in his Preliminary Plan.</blockquote>

Far from refusing to apply deference in the context of whether a statutory rehabilitator had reasonable cause to believe that further efforts toward rehabilitation would increase the risk of loss or be futile, the Superior Court of New Jersey’s Chancery Division in <em>LaVecchia </em>stated that <em>“deference is to be given </em>[to] the Commissioner’s decision to seek liquidation under” the analogue to Section 518(a). <em>LaVecchia, </em><a href="/nj-super/324/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="324 N.J.

At the hearing held in this matter, DiMemmo recalled being shocked by the enormity of the numbers when they were relayed to him, as, in his view, the amount of the projected negative surpluses and required rate increases for a return to <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>solvency had “changed everything,” such that rehabilitation was no longer viable.

This was contrary to the opinion he had been previously relaying to the Commissioner based on Milliman’s older 1993-2006 claims projection reports. <em>Id. </em>DiMemmo noted that he had never, in his experience as Deputy Insurance Commissioner, seen any long-term care insurance carrier receive rate increases of 200% during a rehabilitation process. <em>Id. </em>at 122-23.

Importantly, Robinson noted that, even if such increases were granted by regulators, it would harm those policyholders not able to afford the increases and, consequently, likely cause them to reduce their benefit levels or drop the policies altogether, thereby losing their coverage.

Because of the severity of the projected negative surpluses, and the enormity of the needed rate increases for solvency, Commissioner Ario accepted the unanimous recommendation of the rehabilitation committee that they should move, on a preliminary basis, toward liquidation. N.T. Hearing, 2/11/11, at 34.

In the estimation of the Commissioner, GA coverage would fully cover the majority of policyholders, and for those whose benefits exceeded the statutory limits of guaranty coverage, they would still receive “substantially more complete payment of their claims.” Amended Petition for Liquidation, 10/23/09, at 9. The Commissioner further determined that continued rehabilitation would result in a pernicious claims’ preference—namely, that policyholders with claims coming due first would be paid their full level of benefits since the insurer still had assets to pay them, but, later in the rehabilitation process, policyholders would receive less as the assets of the insurer were depleted. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. Accordingly, having concluded that continued rehabilitation of the Companies would be futile, given the magnitude of the rate increases needed to achieve solvency, and, also, that the interests of the policyholders would be better served by immediate liquidation, the Commissioner sought termination of the rehabilitation process and entry of an order of liquidation.</p>

By the time Commissioner Ario made the decision to liquidate these Companies in October 2009, the Department had already worked with them for nearly a decade in attempting to rectify the serious financial problems created by the badly underwritten OldCo policies; thus, the Commissioner was keenly aware of the Companies’ lack of success in obtaining considerably more modest rate increases from state regulators. Nevertheless, the record reflects that, when the Companies entered rehabilitation, the Commissioner, based on the information presented to him then about the Companies’ financial status—which indicated that the Companies could possibly be returned to profitability through obtaining rate increases on all OldCo and NewCo policies ranging from 17.3% to 42.3% by 2013—-was willing to consider pursuing that degree of rate increase. The record also supports the Commissioner’s determination that, once this information proved to be inaccurate and the true status of the Companies’ inability to pay future claims was revealed, i.e., that, in order for the Companies to achieve solvency within a reasonable length of time—a decade and a half—they would have to, by the <em>follomng June, </em>be granted approval by state regulatory bodies for a range of rate increases on all OldCo policies of at least 180%, and possibly as high as 232%, and be granted approval for rate increases on the NewCo policies of at least 104% and as much as 203%, the prospect of obtaining such massive increases was dim.</p>

Indeed, at the time the Commissioner filed his liquidation petition, the broad experience of his actuarial consultant, Milliman, indicated that rate increases on long-term care policies, as a general matter, were becoming more difficult to <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>attain from state regulators, and, in Milliman’s view, as the age of policyholders making claims under these policies increased over time, regulatory approval would only become progressively more difficult. N.T. Hearing, 2/24/11, at 10. Moreover, and importantly, as developed in the testimony at the hearing in this matter discussed <em>supra, </em>large rate increases would also likely result in many policyholders reducing their levels of coverage, or worse, dropping the coverage they had already paid for, at a time in their lives when they were most in need of such coverage. (Certainly, the prospect of such deleterious consequences was a compelling reason why state regulators were unlikely to grant such precipitous increases, given their fundamental responsibility to regulate the insurance marketplace and protect policyholders.) Hence, from my perspective, the Commissioner’s conclusion that continuing with the rehabilitation process would be futile, since the rate increases which were essential for the Companies to return to solvency within a reasonable time frame were not likely to be achieved, was well-supported.</p>
    <p id="b362-4" data-blocks='[["BL_362.4",362,[254,1330,1151,789]]]'>The record also supports the conclusion that the Commissioner had reasonable cause to believe that continued rehabilitation of these Companies would create a substantially increased risk of loss to policyholders in the form of reduced benefits. The Commissioner’s liquidation analysis indicated that, if the Companies continued in rehabilitation without receiving the steep rate increases needed to make them solvent, then the assets of the Companies would be gradually depleted. This would result in a situation where current claimants would receive the full amount of benefits which they paid for, whereas future claimants would receive lesser amounts as the Companies’ assets dwindled, and benefit levels payable under the policies would inevitably have to be capped in an effort to conserve the Companies’ diminishing resources.

Although not all policyholders would be entitled to receive their full benefits through immediate liquidation, it was the Commissioner’s considered judgment at the time he sought liquidation—which was informed by the most accurate data available to him regarding the financial status of the Companies—that it was the best of all the options available to him. At the time he filed his liquidation petition, the Commissioner estimated that liquidation would result in the majority of the Companies’ policyholders receiving greater benefits through the GAs—70 to 80% of the current benefit levels under their policies—than they would receive if the Companies continued in rehabilitation, which the Commissioner noted would, because of the large size of the projected negative surpluses, ultimately result in less of the policyholders’ benefits being covered by guaranty coverage. N.T. Trial, 2/3/11, at 65-67, 70; Commissioner’s Brief at 44. Thus, in my view, the Commissioner’s liquidation decision was supportable on this basis as well, since it sought to diminish the harm to the individual policyholders caused by these Companies’ insolvency.</p>

The Commissioner also noted that he was specifically reserving final judgment on this issue until the necessary analysis of this question was complete. Upon completion of that analysis, and based upon it, the Commissioner reached the conclusion that GA benefits, though lesser, were still more than what the policyholders would achieve if the Companies were permitted to continue to steadily deplete their assets and cut benefits throughout the protracted rehabilitation process, which the Commissioner determined would ultimately be futile.</p>

Furthermore, I do not find the evidence of record supports the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that the Commissioner somehow misused the rehabilitation process merely to bide time to prepare for liquidation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_11" id="ref_footnote_2_11">11</a> As outlined above, the evidence of record supports the conclusion that the Commissioner initially acceded to the Companies’ desire to pursue rehabilitation, and he was, during the preliminary phase of the rehabilitation process, working towards that goal. Indeed, the Commissioner hired a seasoned insurance professional to run the Companies, who had prior experience in rehabilitating a faltering insurer, and the Commissioner worked with the Companies’ own actuary to devise a plan to return the Companies to solvency. The Commissioner was, at that point, wholly relying on the Companies’ disclosures about their financial status to guide his decision-making process. It was only after the Commissioner received an accurate depiction of the Companies’ deficiencies in their ability to pay future claims from the professionals he had engaged—some of whom were the Companies’ own managerial staff—that he elected to convert the rehabilitation process to a liquidation. I, therefore, discern no misuse of the rehabilitation process by the Commissioner based on this record.</p>

To the contrary, and as the majority seemingly concedes, that court must apply a deferential abuse of discretion standard, which requires it to function as a reviewing court, and, as such, its role is limited to determining whether the Commissioner abused his or her discretion in finding that reasonable cause existed to convert the rehabilitation of the insolvent insurance company to a <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>liquidation. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 289-90, 119 A.3d at 322-23; <em>see also Foster, </em><a href="/pa/531/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="531 Pa. 598" data-case-ids="1834337" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0598-01">614 A.2d at 1091</a> (observing that, in conducting discretionary review of the Commissioner's decisions made during the conduct of the rehabilitation process, "it is not the function of the courts to reassess the determinations of fact and public policy made by the Rehabilitator”).
