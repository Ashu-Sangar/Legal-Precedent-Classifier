Shortly thereafter, Officer Winter visited Sementelli’s home, where, <em>inter alia, </em>he noticed that Sementelli’s Toyota Camry was absent from the carport. Officer Winter issued a “be-on-the-Iookout” bulletin for the car, and, the next day, officers in nearby Williamsport discovered Aaron Jones driving the vehicle. The officers initiated a traffic stop, and, under the guise of investigating an obscured vehicle registration or inspection sticker, questioned Jones as to how he had obtained the car. Jones indicated that a woman named Shonda owned the car and had allowed him to use it. Ultimately, the officers released Jones but seized the car.</p>

The dispatchers relayed the report to Lock Haven police, who forced entry into Sementelli’s home and discovered his body, apparently murdered six days prior in a brutal hatchet attack wherein he sustained numerous blunt and sharp force trauma wounds, fractures, and bruises, as well as a near-severed left ear and a punctured eye.</p>

According to Gaines, on March 23, 2003, she was babysitting for Michelle Mathis, a mutual friend of Appellant and Gaines, when Appellant came to Mathis’ home in Sementelli’s car and approached the door with blood on her face and hands. Gaines said that Appellant asked for Mathis, that Gaines let Appellant come into the home and shower, and that, when Mathis returned, the women went back to the crime scene, where Appellant cleaned up evidence and stole, <em>inter alia, </em>a plastic container of <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>coins and some DVDs.

In point of fact, my remarks go to the jurisdiction of <em>this Court </em>to consider the merits of a serial direct appeal. A post-conviction court’s award of <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief in a form that gives rise to jurisdiction in another court—which jurisdiction simply would not exist in absence of the relief—is obviously a unique and multi-faceted subject.</p>
