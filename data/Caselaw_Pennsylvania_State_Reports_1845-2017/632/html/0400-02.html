He also indicated that he gave her a substantial amount of money for a house that he could no longer live in, but stated that he would soon take care of the matter. The next morning, Appellant was seen inside a parked car approximately one and one-half blocks away from the residence of Yohn’s mother. Yohn’s son, Justin, was outside the home when he saw Appellant run up to the rear porch of the residence with his finger to his lips, directing Justin to be quiet. Appellant then kicked in the door and entered the kitchen. With Yohn’s son, Jeremy, in the room, Appellant opened his jacket, pulled out a knife, and began stabbing Yohn until she fell to the floor with the large knife still in her back. Appellant then fled through the back door, and encountered Justin outside waiting in the car to go to school. Appellant threw Justin from the car and drove away in it. Yohn died later that day from her injuries.

Rather, because the evidence established conclusively that Appellant broke into the victim’s home and stabbed her to death, it maintains that trial counsel merely conceded that Appellant’s conduct satisfied the definition of criminal homicide, which provides that one is guilty of criminal homicide “if he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another human being.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2501(a). Had trial counsel attempted to deny that the elements of criminal homicide had been established under the facts presented, the Commonwealth contends, counsel would have lost all credibility with the jury. It argues that when taken in the context of trial counsel’s opening and closing remarks, it is clear that trial counsel advocated to the jury that Appellant’s criminal acts amounted to, at most, third degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter, and not first degree murder. Trial counsel’s strategy in this regard, the Commonwealth concludes, did not undermine the truth-determining process, was imminently reasonable, and did not alter the outcome of the trial.</p>

Lantz testified at trial that the knife used in the murder did not come from her kitchen. N.T., Apr. 28, 2006, at 59. This testimony bolstered the Commonwealth’s theory that Appellant brought the knife with him into Lantz’s home, thereby establishing his specific intent to kill. In reference to a photograph of the kitchen that depicted a knife block with one knife missing, Lantz explained at trial that the knife was missing before she left for work on the day of the murder because her son had broken it months earlier when cutting an ice cream cake. <em>Id. </em>at 58. She further confirmed that the Commonwealth’s Exhibit 22, a knife handle, and Exhibit 9, a knife blade, did not together constitute the knife missing from her knife block. <em>Id. </em>at 59.

Appellant submits that the prosecutor’s theory regarding the sequence in which the wounds were inflicted was not based upon evidence of record or reasonable inferences therefrom because the Commonwealth’s forensic pathologist, Dr. Vimal Mittal, testified that he could not ascertain the sequence of the stab wounds.

Jeremy saw his mother fall to the floor near the door where Appellant entered the kitchen and then witnessed Appellant stab her a final time, leaving the knife protruding from her back.

I obviously have reservations about this subject, as I joined Madame Justice Todd’s dissenting opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Lucarelli </em><a href="/pa/601/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="601 Pa. 185" data-case-ids="4194565" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0185-01">601 Pa. 185</a>, <a href="/pa/601/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="971 A.2d 1173" data-case-ids="4194565,7299103" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0185-01,/a2d/971/1173-01">971 A.2d 1173</a> (2009). Given the importance of the right to counsel, the <em>LucareUi </em>dissent favored implementation of procedural safeguards relative to at least one strain of forfeiture, as are considered necessary in a number of other jurisdictions. <em>Id. </em>at 201-07, <a href="/pa/601/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="971 A.2d 1173" data-case-ids="4194565,7299103" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0185-01,/a2d/971/1173-01">971 A.2d at 1183-87</a> (Todd, J., dissenting); <em>cf.

Rather, as the majority otherwise recognizes, the PCRA court’s decision on the relevant point rested on its conclusion that Appellant expressly waived his right to counsel.</p>

I write separately to address Chief Justice Saylor’s reference, in his concurrence, to my dissent in <em>Commonwealth v. Lucarelli, </em><a href="/pa/601/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="601 Pa. 185" data-case-ids="4194565" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0185-01">601 Pa. 185</a>, <a href="/pa/601/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="971 A.2d 1173" data-case-ids="4194565,7299103" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0185-01,/a2d/971/1173-01">971 A.2d 1173</a> (2009). <em>See </em>Concurring Opinion at 431, 120 A.3d at 295 (Saylor, C.J.). As the majority herein discusses in Part II, in <em>Lucarelli </em>this Court recognized the distinction between the waiver of the right to counsel and the forfeiture of the right to counsel, noting the former requires a knowing act <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>(and thus a colloquy before it may be found to have been waived), while the latter does not. Majority Opinion at 415-16, 120 A.3d at 285-86. My dissent in that case took little issue with those broad principles; rather, I disagreed that the defendant’s conduct—his failure to obtain counsel in the nearly nine months leading up to his trial despite the ability to do so—constituted a forfeiture of the right to counsel, as the majority therein found. Nonetheless, I cited with approval cases in which the right to counsel was deemed to be forfeited, including where a defendant assaulted his lawyer. <em>See Lucarelli, </em><a href="/pa/601/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="971 A.2d 1173" data-case-ids="4194565,7299103" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0185-01,/a2d/971/1173-01">971 A.2d at 1183-84</a> (Todd, J., dissenting) (discussing cases). Thus, my joinder in the forfeiture holding in the instant case, where counsel was brutally attacked by his client, is entirely consistent with my position in <em>Lucarelli.</em>
