In support of closure, Appellant asserted that Mrs. Blystone “has considerable information concerning abuse suffered by [Appellant] at the hands of his father” which she would not reveal “absent a guarantee that the media and the public (and, by extension, her husband) will not be privy to the details of her testimony.” Closure Motion, 7/9/2014, at 7. Appellant claimed that his right to present all available mitigating evidence and, thus, his right to a fair trial, outweighed the public’s right to access criminal proceedings under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 7 and 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and that closure was narrowly tailored to the objective of eliciting Mrs. Blystone’s testimony because the closure would be limited to Mrs. Blystone’s testimony, and expert testimony and closing arguments addressing that testimony.

By contrast, Appellant may challenge the trial court’s order denying his closure request on appeal after final judgment, and, should we determine that the trial court erred in denying closure, we could vacate the judgment of sentence and order a new sentencing hearing at which Appellant would be entitled to introduce the testimony from Mrs. Blystone in partially closed proceedings.
