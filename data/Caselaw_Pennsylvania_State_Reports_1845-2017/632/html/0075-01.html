Dr. Martell noted appellee has undergone IQ testing six times, scoring a 74 in 1976, a 78 in 1977, a 75 in 1992, a 75 in 1996, an 81 in 1997, and a 69 in 2011. In particular, he observed the 1976 test type was unknown since the score’s only reference appeared in a Psychological Summary by Dr. Carol Andrews, who administered the 1977 test, a Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). In her summary, she noted appellee’s score was a four-point improvement over a test administered 11 months earlier. <em>Id., </em>at 40-41; Psychological Summary, 2/24/77. Given the increase over a short time-span and commonality of school-administered IQ tests, Dr. Martell surmised it was highly probable the 1976 test was also a WISC-R. <em>See </em>N.T. Hearing, 4/17/13, at 40-41, 69. He further averred the increase was likely the result of “practice effects,” improvement where one takes the same test twice within a year. <em>See id., </em>at 38, 41. The 1996 test, a Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), was administered by Dr. Harry Krop, <em>id., </em>at 43, while the 2011 test, a Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) was administered by Dr. Crown. Dr. Martell revealed he applied the SEM to the 2011 test score individually since the WAIS-IV is the “most psychometrically sophisticated” test available. <em>Id., </em>at 60. Because the 2011 test was the only <em>post-Atkins </em>exam and appellee had an incentive to put forth minimal effort, Dr. Martell also addressed concerns about the score’s legitimacy, specifically referencing a subtest used to measure effort level. N.T. Hearing, 4/17/13, at 83. Remarking that “fakers” generally score a four or lower, Dr. Martell indicated appellee scored a six, a sign of ample effort. <em>Id., </em>at 84. Similarly, he scored a five when the subtest was administered on the 1996 test. <em>Id.</em>

Here, the court chose to credit the testimony of Dr. Martell and Dr. Crown over Dr. Spangler. Specifically, it did not find Dr. Spangler’s rationale for discarding the 2011 test score persuasive, concluding his first two reasons—presuming all <em>post-Atkins </em>tests to be unreliable and the references to depression and ADD—were speculative. The court noted he failed to cite to specific evidence to support his post<em>-Atkins </em>theory, he never met with appellee in person, and it did not think the ADD and depression references conclusively established appellee suffered from those conditions. PCRA Court Opinion, 4/7/14, at 34-35. Rather, the court mentioned appel-lee’s perceptual-reasoning score, the fact appellee self-reported his depression, and that Dr. Spangler failed to raise the depression and ADD arguments about appellee’s other tests. <em><a href="/pa/619/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="61 A.3d 979" data-case-ids="4233892,4234470,7310723,7310746" data-case-paths="/pa/619/0218-01,/pa/619/0219-01,/a3d/61/0979-01,/a3d/61/0979-02">Id.</a> </em>Addressing Dr. Spangler’s third reason, appellee’s purported lack of effort, the court did not deem Dr. Spangler’s reference to specific questions as symbolic of poor effort, instead citing appellee’s digit-span score. <em>Id., </em>at 36. Overall, the court simply distrusted Dr. Spangler, criticizing his inter<a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>pretation of a six-point difference as “drastic” but a five-point difference as “natural variance.” <em>Id., </em>at 35 n. 22. Thus, like many <em>Atkins </em>cases, whether to include the 2011 test score amounted to a “battle of the experts.” Cognizant of this realization, we adopted a deferential standard of review, <em>see Hackett </em>at 26 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>at 981), and the court was free to judge Dr. Spangler’s credibility, which it supported with citations to the record. <em>See Williams, </em>at 992 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Curiously, the court took a numerical approach, observing the defendant in <em>Williams </em>was found to be significantly limited in seven of the 11 DSM-IV categories. Applying this logic, the court held appellee satisfied the “major” requirement because it found he was significantly limited in five areas: (1) communication, (2) functional academics, (3) self-direction, (4) social/interpersonal skills, and (5) leisure. First, the court cited appellee’s pervasive use of the phrase “like this and like that[,]” and Dr. Martell’s remark that appellee was one of the most communicatively deficient persons he ever interviewed. <em>Id., </em>at 37.

Moreover, while conceding ap-pellee’s scores improved at New Life Boys’ Ranch, the court found he peaked at a sixth-grade level. <em>Id., </em>at 39. Third, the court found appellee significantly limited in self-direction, mentioning he would get lost in his own neighborhood and, despite facing punishment from his stepfather, he failed to complete basic tasks, such as buying the correct items from the store, retrieving cigarettes, sweeping, or collecting trash. <em>Id., </em>at 40. Fourth, evaluating social skills, the court stressed appellee has avoided social interaction his entire life and quoted Dr. Martell’s characterization of appellee as a “loner[.]” <em>Id., </em>at 40-41.

While the Majority highlights Appel-lee’s low test scores in school, difficulty playing age-appropriate games and socially relating to his peers as a child, trouble performing some simple tasks, and poor sense of direction in his neighborhood as support for the PCRA court’s finding of intellectual disability, the factual accounts of his crime as set forth in our opinions on both direct appeal and in <em>Bracey II </em>evince otherwise. It is important to remember that when Appellee murdered Officer Boyle on February 4, 1991, he possessed the intellectual capacity to: arm himself in preparation of robbing and shooting.some drug dealers; operate a stolen vehicle; brandish a 9 mm automatic handgun at Officer Boyle while standing on the hood and roof of the police cruiser; demand that the Officer not touch his own firearm; shoot Officer Boyle with no less than eight rounds, one of which struck him in the right temple; and evade police for several days. Such premeditative behavior indicates an individual who was more than capable of taking control of a deadly situation. As this Court noted on direct appeal, this violent incident was not Appellee’s first, for the jury determined he had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to others including two prior burglary convictions. <em>Commonwealth v.
