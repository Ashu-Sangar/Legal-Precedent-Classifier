Jenna Addis was his student during her junior and senior years, from 2001 until her graduation in 2003. After Addis graduated, she attended Tulane University in New Orleans, where she still resides.</p>

During her visit, Addis spoke to Susan O’Bannon, a friend who was employed by Lower Merion High School. Addis told O’Ban-non that she and Schanne had been romantically involved while Addis was a high school senior and during the summer after she graduated. O’Bannon reported Addis’s allegation to school officials. Addis testified in her deposition that she discussed the matter with O’Bannon as a friend and not as an agent of the school. Addis stated, moreover, that she did not intend for O’Bannon to report the information to the school, that she was not aware O’Bannon would feel obligated to make such a report, and that she was surprised to learn that O’Bannon had done so. <em>See </em>N.T., Dec. 1, 2001, at 137, 141.</p>

They made two such calls in early December 2010 and memorialized the content of the conversations in papers which they sent to Addis for her correction and signature.

For a period of four to six weeks in the fall of 2002, Schanne assisted Addis in preparing for the SAT physics exam by tutoring her at her home. During this time, the pair developed a relationship that included a physical component, albeit they did not have intercourse until Addis graduated. After Addis moved to New Orleans for college, she and Schanne kept in touch and would have intimate relations whenever Addis was in Pennsylvania for holidays, although they were “not a couple anymore.” Statement at 3. At some point, however, Addis began to believe her high school involvement with Schanne was interfering with her ability to have healthy relationships with others, and she wanted Schanne to admit that his conduct had been inappropriate. She sent him an email to this effect, but was disappointed when Schanne responded by stating there was nothing improper about their relationship. During Ad-dis’s November 2010 visit to Pennsylvania, she met Schanne at a bookstore and repeated her concerns, but he again maintained that their relationship “wasn’t wrong.” Statement at 4.</p>

Schanne averred that Ad-dis’s statements were not judicially privileged because: they were not made during a school board meeting, hearing, or <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>other judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding; no judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding regarding Schanne was “convened or contemplated” at the time Addis made her allegations; and no other privilege applied to the statements.

The court observed, moreover, that Schanne admitted in his pleadings that the school’s pre-termination <em>Loudermill </em>hearing constituted a quasi-judicial proceeding, and that he conceded at oral argument that the material in Addis’s statement to school officials was pertinent to that proceeding. <em>See Schanne, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/898/0751-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="898 F.

Schanne contends that extending the privilege in these circumstances would not only fail to serve its purpose, it would also permit an individual who makes a defamatory communication to a third party to later “engineer a privilege” by persuading the third party to file a complaint based on the communication.

      <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>Addis responds, initially, by arguing that, because litigation is expensive and time consuming, this Court should hold that a declarant’s intent in making an allegedly defamatory statement is irrelevant to the question of privilege so that the declarant will not have to litigate the issue. She claims a contrary holding would allow a defamation plaintiff to impose undue litigation expenses upon a defendant whenever the latter claims the judicial privilege. Separately, Addis suggests that there is a broad spectrum of possible consequences to a declaration made regarding a teacher in Schanne’s position, from a private meeting with school officials which leads to an informal warning, to quasi-judicial proceedings which result in the teacher’s discharge from employment. Hence, she proffers that focusing on the declarant’s intent would be unworkable because it would be unclear where along that spectrum of intended outcomes the privilege should attach.</p>

She notes, in this regard, that, once it is determined that immunity attaches, the individual is shielded from liability regardless of intent; thus, she urges that we reject Schanne’s argument that the privilege does not apply in the first instance due to her lack of intent that the declaration to O’Bannon would lead to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings.

As such, any costs associated with litigating the issue arise when the defendant asserts the privilege and the plaintiff challenges it. It can hardly be the law that a plaintiff is prohibited from challenging a defense raised by the defendant because there are costs to litigating its merits. As for Addis’s observation that, once the privilege is held to apply, the speaker’s intent in making the statement is immaterial: this is true as far as it goes, but it does not address the question raised here concerning whether the defendant’s intent is properly taken into account in ascertaining if the privilege applies in the first instance.</p>

I write separately to emphasize that my position is firmly tied to the peculiar factual circumstances of the instant case. As noted by the majority, Jenna Addis was 26 years old and had been out of high school for more than 7 years when she told Susan O’Bannon that she had a relationship with Robert Schanne while she was a high school student. Had Addis been a student at the time she confided in O’Bannon, I might very well have reached a different result.</p>

The absolute judicial privilege should attach where, as here, a former student confides that she was sexually victimized by a school official to another school official who feels professionally obligated to report the statement to educational authorities, provided those details have a bearing on subsequent quasi/judicial proceedings. Therefore, under these circumstances, the student is the witness-declarant and the educational official is a possible party to the proceeding. The fact that Appellee could not mount the <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>courage to name her alleged perpetrator until her twenties should not be used against her.</p>

Independent of their friendship, O’Bannon was Appellee’s ninth grade biology teacher and remains an educational professional who, upon reflection, felt obligated to report Appellee’s allegations to educational authorities.
