This result affirms the proposition that a police officer’s activation of overhead lights on a patrol car automatically creates an investigative detention of those in the area; if reasonable suspicion is not extant, turning on those lights is <em>per se </em>an unconstitutional act of detention, tainting everything that follows. This is a head-scratchingly terrible result, which should not be given approbation by this court’s affirmance.</p>

She turned off her car’s lights; she did not activate her four-way blinkers. Seeing this obviously anomalous action given the time and place, the trooper pulled behind her vehicle, activated his overhead lights, and got out to approach on foot. At this point, appellee got out of her vehicle, unbidden, and the officer immediately noticed strong indicia of intoxication, eventually leading to sobriety tests and a BAC test showing a level of 0.22% (nearly three times the statutory limit).</p>

The analysis goes like this: as appellee said she did not feel free to leave, she was subject to detention, and as the officer did not articulate a basis for detention, his action in turning on his lights was “coercive authority” without justification, violative of her constitutional rights. The paralysis is that this officer apparently had only two constitutionally permitted options: either (1) pull in behind her very quietly, so he would not alert the driver to his identity in the dark, at 3 a.m., ignoring the manifest safety risks and the likelihood of scaring the driver half to death when he popped out of the dark; or (2) ignore the vehicle altogether and go blissfully down the road thinking, “Gee whiz, I wonder what that was all about.” The latter would be a dereliction of duty; the former is a good way to give the driver a heart attack or to get the officer shot.</p>

If an officer’s mere approach of persons not in motion were to be held inherently coercive in and of itself, analysis would be simple, but such an approach is not objectively coercive, and caselaw says so.

The objective test therefore looks more broadly, and requires more than an act that may engender entirely dissimilar reactions. Activating lights can provoke different reactions, but it does not constitute objective unconstitutional behavior that allows every accused to say “I didn’t feel free to leave,” thus comprising recognized detention and illegality, absent articulable suspicion. Objectively, lights equal identification, and identification as an officer does not constitute coercive authority.</p>

Objectively, all this officer did was park behind appellee’s vehicle with his overhead lights on. He had obvious reason to do so, but did nothing to block her vehicle. He did not restrain her movement or interrupt her travels. He did not cause her to pull over, and he did not direct her to her chosen stopping place, a gravel pull-out between two closed businesses at three o’clock in the morning. He did not brandish a weapon or do anything else to show force. He did not give her orders. The use of the overhead lights was the single objective factor bearing on the alleged unconstitutionality of the officer’s actions. That this is found to be a constitutional violation indicates the myopic nature of the subjective “I didn’t feel free to leave so I was illegally detained” analysis applied here.</p>

Pre-Trial Hearing, 6/22/12, at 10 (“I wanted to be visible at that point for our safety in case other vehicles came down that road,”).

As a seizure does not occur when an officer merely approaches an individual in public and questions the individual, it was permissible for Trooper Ro-gowski to approach Appellee’s vehicle on the side of the road and inquire if she needed aid and to discover her purpose for pulling off at this location late at night. As noted by the Commonwealth, Trooper Rogowski did not block Appellee <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>from leaving, direct her movement in any way, speak in an authoritative or threatening tone, or display any show of authority to restrain Appellee.

While the activation of overhead lights may be a factor for the suppression court to consider in determining whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave, a totality of the circumstances review requires that no single factor should dictate the ultimate conclusion as to whether a seizure has occurred. <em>Strickler, </em><a href="/pa/563/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="563 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1367019" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0047-01">563 Pa. at 59</a>, <a href="/a2d/757/0884-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="757 A.2d 884" data-case-ids="11243686,1367019" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0884-01,/pa/563/0047-01">757 A.2d at 890</a>.</p>

The flashing overhead lights notify oncoming drivers of the vehicles’ presence on the side of the road and signal to the motorist that an officer has arrived to offer assistance. These lights help assure the motorist of safety by distinguishing between the arrival of a responding officer and an unknown vehicle of a stranger who may not have the motorist’s best interests in mind. As a result, in many circumstances, citizens come to recognize the activation of a patrol car’s overhead lights as a reasonable response in allowing officers to meet their duty of providing assistance to stranded motorists or drivers that otherwise need assistance. Therefore, the activation of the patrol car’s overhead lights, standing alone, did not ripen the instant mere encounter into an investigative detention.</p>
