The petition contained 994 signatures (8.5%) out of the Township’s 11,640 registered voters and claimed that as of the 2010 census, the Township had a population density of around 1,258 inhabitants per square mile (“IPSM”). As stated, both figures easily exceeded the statutory thresholds of 300 IPSM and 5% registered voter signatures, which Appellant believed operated as conjunctive preconditions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

That same day, the Delaware County Bureau of Elections (“Intervenor”) filed a petition to intervene and a request for declaratory relief, claiming that in addition to not satisfying the statutory requirements, the petition should be dismissed because a home rule study referendum question was already on the ballot (which voters later approved), and that if Appellant’s referendum question were successful, the subsequent change in Township government could violate the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>

According to the majority, the Commonwealth Court’s contrary interpretation of the statute alters its plain language. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 324, 119 A.3d at 343. The majority also asserts that the statutory allowance for resubmission after an unsuccessful referendum “contradicts the opposing parties’ claim that such questions may only be submitted immediately after the census or special enrollment.” <em>Id. </em>at 324, 119 A.3d at 343. In terms of policy, the majority relies upon “actual census data” reflecting strong population gains in the relevant geographic area, albeit post-dating the enactment of both the relevant statute and the salient amendments, as dispelling Appellees’ position that Section 207 was designed to ensure a reasonably close temporal relationship between population <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>ascertainments and a referendum concerning second-to-first-class-township conversion. <em>Id. </em>at 325-27, 119 A.3d at 344-45.</p>

By mandating that a referendum be placed on the ballot at the first election after an ascertainment that the population of a second-class township met a certain threshold, the original (1931) statute unambiguously established that the referendum would proceed at an election which was reasonably contemporaneous with the ascertainment. <em>See </em>Act of June 24, 1931, P.L. 1206, art. II, § 207; <em>accord </em>Majority Opinion, at 322-24, 119 A.3d at 342-43. The General Assembly added the petition requirement, in 1941, not to obviate this requirement of temporal relationship between ascertainment and the referendum, but rather, to simply make the referendum also conditional upon the filing of a petition by at least five percent of the registered voters. <em>See </em>Act of July 24, 1941, P.L. 502, § 1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

      <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>I find this position to be the more persuasive one. As the intermediate and common pleas courts suggested, it is supported by the proximity, within Section 207, of the statutory timing provision to the requirement for ascertainment. <em>See In re Petition to Submit Ballot Question to Concord Twp. Voters, </em><a href="/a3d/100/0765-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="100 A.3d 765" data-case-ids="6917555" data-case-paths="/a3d/100/0765-01">100 A.3d 765</a>, 767 (Pa.Cmwlth.2014). Furthermore, I differ with the majority’s assertion that the second appearance of the word “after” in Section 207 would need to be changed to “provided” to support such construction. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 324, 119 A.3d at 343. Rather, all that is required is to accept is that an appropriate petition must be filed to trigger the occurrence of a referendum at the time of the election specified in the statute <em>(i.e., </em>“the first general or municipal election occurring, at least ninety days after the ascertainment” that the local population meets or exceeds the threshold for first-class township status, 53 P.S. § 55207).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> The majority’s contrary construction effectively transposes the filing of a petition, in place of ascertainment, as the triggering event for determining the timing of the referendum, thus allowing for referendums remote from ascertainments. Respectfully, I believe it would require substantial linguistic adjustments to the statute to unambiguously convey such an intention on the part of the Legislature.</p>

While <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>certainly I recognize that the potential for resubmission remote from population ascertainment is a factor militating in favor of the majority’s construction, I do not agree that this suggests that any submission may be remote. Like many other archaic statutory regimes, there are multiple ambiguities and incongruities within the instant one. In such landscape, the resubmission factor, in my view at least, simply does not carry dispositive weight. I take this position particularly in light of the prescription for “special enrollment,” <em>i.e., </em>an interim (between decennial censuses) local population assessment triggered by a petition advanced by at least twenty-five percent of landowners within the subject township. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 55205, In addition to establishing a predicate for a referendum after a decennial census which has failed to document a sufficient population increase, this procedure also serves to produce an ascertainment which would be substantially contemporaneous with the ensuing referendum, where no petition was filed within the requisite time period after a census-based ascertainment that the requisite population threshold had been met. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 65207.</p>

It appears to me that there were far greater uncertainties in the 1930s and 1940s concerning population fluctuations in the relevant geographic area, so that the benefits of a substantially contemporaneous ascertainment would have been of greater importance at the time this statutory scheme was enacted. <em>Accord In re Petition to Submit Ballot Question to Concord Twp.
