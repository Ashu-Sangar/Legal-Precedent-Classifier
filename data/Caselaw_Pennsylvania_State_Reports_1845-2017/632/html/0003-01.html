    <blockquote id="b61-6" data-blocks='[["BL_61.6",61,[271,1254,1111,366]]]'>The basis for the difference between these two standards is clear. Allowing an accused to withdraw his guilty plea after imposition of sentence requires a stricter standard to prevent defendants from using a guilty plea as a tool for previewing the sentencing by the court. Such a misuse does not occur when withdrawing a guilty plea prior to sentencing.</blockquote>

Moreover, <em>Lesko’s </em>rationale centered on “sentence-previewing” is strained. While <em>Lesko </em>correctly recognized that a defendant pleading guilty to an offense triggering a mandatory life sentence has no need to preview the sentencing result (as he already knows that he will receive a life sentence at the time the plea is accepted), <em>Lesko </em>used this premise to reach the opposite conclusion of that to which it logically leads. Contrary to the <em>Lesko </em>Court’s reasoning, if preventing previewing were the only reason supporting implementation of an elevated standard, there would be no reason to apply the higher standard at all to a defendant who has pled guilty to an offense triggering a mandatory life sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
      <em>Lesko, </em>however, upended this logic to conclude that the liberal standard should not apply in the first instance, again, without any acknowledgement of the driving justification for liberality in the presentence period, <em>i.e., </em>safeguarding defendants’ trial rights.</p>
