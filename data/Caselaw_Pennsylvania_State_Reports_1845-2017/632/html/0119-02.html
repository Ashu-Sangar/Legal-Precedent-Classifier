The courts below admitted appellant’s statements at trial, concluding appellant was not in custody for Fifth Amendment purposes and thus not entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings. We conclude appellant’s interaction with parole agents included custodial interrogation, making admission of the statements error, which was not harmless. Thus, we are constrained to vacate appellant’s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>

Agent McCartin testified he found the voicemail reliable because the caller identified himself and his relationship to appellant, and knew of appellant’s recent approved vacation to Virginia.</p>

Upon appellant’s arrival, Agent McCartin handcuffed him and searched him for weapons, finding none. Agent McCartin informed appellant that he and other agents were going to search his home for firearms and drugs based on a “course of action[.]” N.T. Trial, 5/10/12, at 96-97. He asked appellant if contraband would be found in his home; appellant became nervous and said he was unsure what agents would discover. Another parole officer, Agent Heidlebaugh, asked him whether firearms would be found in his home; appellant admitted a gun was in a drawer under the living-room couch. The agents transported appellant, still in handcuffs, to his home.</p>

They recovered a .40 caliber handgun from the drawer identified by appellant and an empty .22 caliber handgun case from appellant’s bedroom. They also seized $3,200, one pound of marijuana, and plastic baggies. When confronted with the drugs, appellant admitted they <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>were his. After completing the search, the agents asked where his vehicle was; appellant gave a location, but when the agents drove there, his vehicle was not there. Back at the parole office, agents saw a vehicle and asked appellant if it was his; he confirmed it was. The agents asked appellant whether he had a firearm in the vehicle; he admitted there was one under the passenger seat. The agents took his keys, entered the car, and seized a .22 caliber handgun. From the time of his arrival at the parole office, during the search of his home, and until he returned to the office with the agents, appellant remained in handcuffs and was never given <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>

It concluded, “According to established safety protocols, [appellant] remained detained while the parole agents conducted the approved residential search.

However, I respectfully disagree with the majority that the parole agent’s use of handcuffs removed the instant parole interview out of the realm of <em>Murphy </em>and transformed it into the functional equivalent of an arrest for which <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were warranted. This Court has held that the use of handcuffs on an individual is not disposi-tive of whether the individual is in custody, and as indicated <em>supra, </em>in <em>Murphy </em>the absence of handcuffs was just one factor considered by the Supreme Court. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b194-6" data-blocks='[["BL_194.5",194,[255,1447,1155,780]]]'>In the instant case, Appellant voluntarily arrived for a prearranged meeting at the parole office, where had had been on many occasions. He met with the parole agent, who had been supervising Appellant for approximately eighteen months. The supervision of Appellant during this time period included, <em>inter alia, </em>urine screens, office visits, and searches of Appellant’s approved residence. Appellant had been on parole for this period without incident and had recently returned from an out-of-state travel pass. Upon arriving at the parole office, the agent handcuffed Appellant, told him he had received information Appellant was in possession of firearms, and informed Appellant his approved residence would be searched. When asked if firearms would be found in his home, Appellant admitted there was a gun in a drawer under the living-room couch.</p>

Similar to the <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>defendant in <em>Murphy, </em>Appellant was not in an unfamiliar atmosphere, he was not in isolation, and he was familiar with the parole agent. While Appellant was handcuffed for the parole agent’s safety, there is no indication the parole agent insinuated the interrogation would continue until Appellant confessed and there was no aggressive, confrontational show of force. Simply put, the use of handcuffs does not, in my mind, tip the scale in this case from a non-custodial parole interview to the functional equivalent of an arrest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>
