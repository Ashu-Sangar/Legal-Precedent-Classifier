        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Moschziskeb,\nThis suit was brought by the Miners State Bank to recover from the estate of Michael Rosenberg, deceased, the balance due on a judgment note for $5,000, made by one Archbishop Alexander Nemolosky, dated January 5,1920, payable \u201con demand after date,\u201d to the order of plaintiff, containing on its reverse side a writing (hereinafter called \u201cthe endorsement\u201d) in the form of an assignment of the instrument to the Miners State Bank, a \u201cguarantee\u201d'of payment and a warrant to confess judgment, signed by the above-named decedent and others, the endorsers appearing in the following order: Elias S. Barny (Seal), Valentine W. Quigel (Seal), Alexander Nemolosky and Mike Rosenberg (without seals), as more fully shown in the reporter\u2019s note accompanying this opinion.\nThe statement of claim averred that defendant was executor of the estate of Michael Rosenberg, who died February 27, 1923; that \u201cMichael Rosenberg during his lifetime\u201d had \u201cendorsed the said note and guaranteed payment thereof to the Miners\u2019 State Bank\u201d; that the note was \u201cpayable on demand\u201d; that it had been duly presented to the maker, who paid only $500 thereon and refused to meet the balance, \u201cthough repeatedly requested so to do\u201d; \u201cof all of which premises the said defendant had notice,\u201d and, on his refusal to settle, the present action was instituted to collect the amount due, with interest from July 5,1921, to which date it had been paid.\nDefendant filed an affidavit of defense in the nature of a special demurrer, as follows: (1) \u201cThe statement of claim bases this action on an alleged endorsement of a promissory note upon which plaintiff is the payee, and of which it is the holder; the endorsement purports to be an assignment or transfer of said note by defendant\u2019s decedent and others to the Miners State Bank, the payee and the holder of said note; the statement does not aver that defendant\u2019s decedent was a party to said note, holder or owner of it, or the owner of any interest therein which he could assign and transfer; the endorsement was not effective for any purpose and cannot operate to make the estate of defendant\u2019s decedent liable for the amount of the note or any part thereof.\u201d (2) \u201cThe obligation of the endorsers, as disclosed by the statement of claim, was one of guaranty; the statement does not aver that the maker is insolvent, and it shows that the plaintiff did not exercise proper diligence in its efforts to collect the note from the maker; the action therefore cannot be maintained.\u201d\nThe affidavit ends thus: \u201cWherefore defendant prays judgment if he should make further answer or denial; and prays judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim and sustaining this proceeding in the nature of a demurrer.\u201d\nThe court below entered judgment for defendant, and plaintiff has appealed.\nTo sustain the judgment, defendant points to the note as an instrument under seal, and to the Act of May 28, 1715, 1 Sm. Laws 90, 1 Purdon\u2019s Digest, 13th ed., 469, which provides how a specialty must be assigned to enable the assignee to sue thereon in his or its own name; and defendant contends that, a lack of compliance with the act being shown by plaintiff\u2019s statement, the suit must fail. This, in short, is the argument to sustain point one of the affidavit of defense.\nIn reply, plaintiff contends that the Act of 1715 has no application; that it sues, not as assignee but as the original holder and payee of the note, to recover from defendant as an original surety thereon.\nAs to the capacity in which plaintiff sues, point one of the affidavit of defense, as drawn, admits, in effect, that plaintiff sues as payee and holder and not as assignee; but, despite his own affidavit, defendant argues, \u201cIt must be taken as conclusive that appellee\u2019s decedent had a title,\u201d in the sense of an assignable interest, because the written endorsement on the note contains a transfer of title, and this is equivalent to a warranty of possession of title by each signer of such endorsement; hence, notwithstanding the pleadings to the contrary, defendant contends that it must be assumed plaintiff sued in the capacity of assignee. This contention is not properly before the court, however, for the affidavit of defense not only fails to suggest that the decedent had, or must be presumed to have had (in accord with the present argument), an assignable interest, but, by implication at least, denies it, showing by the very words of point one that defendant understood and accepted the fact that plaintiff claims no such interest. Therefore, on the pleadings, the Act of 1715 falls out of the case.\nThe note itself contains a warrant of attorney to confess judgment at any time, and this, as admitted by both sides, makes it a nonnegotiable instrument: Volk v. Shoemaker, 229 Pa. 407, 410. Under such circumstances, if the endorsement were merely defendant\u2019s decedent\u2019s signature, and nothing more, there could be no recovery thereon (Wilson v. Martin, 74 Pa. 159; Shaffstall v. McDaniel, 152 Pa. 598, 600, 601); this is not the case, however, for defendant\u2019s decedent did more than merely endorse a nonnegotiable instrument, he signed what may \u201cbe interpreted to mean a liability by contract\u201d: Kline v. Keiser, 87 Pa. 485, 486-7.\nTrue, the endorsement says, \u201cI hereby......guarantee payment,\u201d and, on these words, defendant, adopting the view of the court below, argues that plaintiff cannot recover because it seeks to enforce a guarantee against decedent\u2019s estate without any consideration moving to the latter to assume the obligation. As to this, it may be noted first, that, no such point of demurrer, as absence of consideration, is made in the affidavit of defense; next, in a case like the one before us, where the secondary obligation, or suretyship, is entered into at the time of the creation of the principal debt (and in the present instance, there being nothing to indicate any other time, it must be assumed to have been then entered into: Woods v. Sherman, 71 Pa. 100, 105; Siegel v. Baily, 252 Pa. 231, 233, 235), the payment of the money to the principal debtor is sufficient consideration to support the obligation assumed by the surety. We early said, in Snevily v. Johnston, 1 W. & S. 307, 309, that where the promise to meet the debt of another \u201cis made at the same time with the principal contract, and becomes an essential ground of the credit given to the principal debtor,......no other consideration need be shoAvn than that for the original agreement\u201d; and, later, in Campbell v. Knapp, 15 Pa. 27, 30, we stated: \u201cThe guaranty being a part of the [original] transaction, the consideration for it is sufficient to maintain the action.\u201d Then, in Paul v. Stackhouse, 38 Pa. 302, 306, we said: \u201cIt is not essential that a consideration move to the surety,\u2014 it is sufficient if the principal derive a benefit from the promise.\u201d\nWhat we have already said disposes of the contention as to lack of consideration to sustain the endorsement, and this is so whether defendant\u2019s decedent was a surety or a guarantor; but we have referred to him as a surety because the note at bar is an obligation payable on demand, with a contractual endorsement of a character which, this court has ruled, creates the liability of suretyship, when on a demand note. While there appears at the bottom of the instant note, without any apparent connection with the body thereof, the words, \u201cDue July 5, 20,\u201d the words of the instrument itself concerning the due date are such as have been held by us to create an obligation payable on demand; further, the statement of claim avers that the note in suit was \u201cpayable on demand,\u201d and there is no denial of that fact on the record; so, for present purposes, we must accept this admitted averment as correct. In Homewood Peoples Bank v. Hastings, 263 Pa. 260, 265, the obligation reads, \u201cPayable on demand after date,\u201d and there, as here, the endorsement is, \u201cI hereby guarantee payment\u201d; we said, \u201cThe note......being payable on demand, became due immediately (Boustead v. Cuyler, 116 Pa. 551), thus fixing the liability of the person guaranteeing payment of the obligation as of the day on which it was executed, and also creating the liability of suretyship as distinguished from technical guaranty.\u201d The note in that case, so far as the date of payment and guarantee are concerned, being precisely like the one under discussion, we must here hold, as was there ruled, that the endorsement now before us likewise created \u201cthe liability of suretyship as distinguished from technical guaranty\u201d: see also Roberts v. Riddle, 79 Pa. 468, 470; Iron City Nat. Bank v. Rafferty, 207 Pa. 238, 239, 240.\nFinally, defendant\u2019s decedent was a surety because the Act of July 24, 1913, P..L. 971, provides, \u201cThat every written agreement hereafter made by one person to answer for the default of another shall subject such person to the liabilities of suretyship, and shall confer upon him the rights incident thereto, unless such agreement shall contain in substance the words: \u2018This is not intended to be a contract of suretyship,\u2019 or unless each portion of such agreement intended to modify the rights and liabilities of suretyship shall contain in substance the words: \u2018This portion of the agreement is not intended to impose the liability of suretyship.\u2019 \u201d The endorsement on the note in suit forms an agreement in writing to answer for the default of another, else the Statute of Frauds would deny recovery thereon against defendant\u2019s decedent (Wilson v. Martin, 74 Pa. 159, 160, 161); and being such an agreement, without the words necessary to make the liability assumed other than that of a surety, the Act of 1913 applies by its very terms, and defendant\u2019s decedent cannot be treated as though only a general guarantor.\nThis brings us to the second point made in the affidavit of defense, that, if liable at all, decedent was entitled to the peculiar rights of an ordinary guarantor; hence, in order to maintain its suit, plaintiff had to show that the principal debtor had been diligently pursued to insolvency before this action was commenced, and, the statement of claim failing so to aver, judgment on demurrer for defendant was correct. It is sufficient to say that this point is neither touched upon in the opinion of the court below nor pressed in the argument of counsel for defendant, and it might be dismissed on these grounds alone, or because, as already shown, according to the record before us, the decedent appears to be a surety rather than a guarantor; but, whatever he may be termed, the point in hand is covered by citing Campbell v. Baker, 46 Pa. 243, where we held that \u201cA guaranty of the payment of a note \u2018when due\u2019 is broken by nonpayment at maturity, and the guarantor is then liable upon his contract to the creditor, who is not bound either to pursue the principal or show his insolvency.\u201d In other words, when one warrants payment at a particular time, it means just that, and not payment after pursuit and insolvency of the principal debtor, even though the Avord \u201cguarantee,\u201d \u2014 Avhich usually imports the necessity for the latter course, \u2014 may be used: see also Homewood People\u2019s Bk. v. Hastings, supra, and authorities cited in connection therewith.\nWe have not overlooked plaintiff\u2019s argument to the effect that, if the assignment part of the present contract of endorsement be ignored, the words, \u201cI hereby guarantee payment,\u201d contained therein, should be treated likewise, because no portion of a written agreement, not plainly inserted by accident or mistake, may be eliminated by judicial construction; but this means only that, in construing one part of a written agreement, we cannot ignore another portion which has any bearing on the part under consideration, \u2014 not that where, as here, the portion ignored has no apparent bearing on the obligation set forth in the part sought to be enforced, the latter must fall because the former is not heeded.\nHere, on the facts as pleaded, we cannot see that the words in the endorsement as to \u201ctransfer\u201d have any bearing on those as to \u201cguarantee,\u201d or that they affect the question of the liability of the endorsers. The form used is no doubt intended for service where an owner of a nonnegotiable instrument wants to transfer it to a new holder for value, with a guarantee of payment, employing a single writing to accomplish both purposes (Southern L. & S. Co. v. Baker, 281 Pa. 587, 592); and, so far as the present endorsers are concerned, it is probably a. case of indiscriminately taking the form in its entirety, where, in point of fact, the guarantee clause alone was desired for use. Of course, in saying this, we are indulging in surmise, suggested by the state of the record, which, when explained by an affidavit on the merits, or at trial (see Shaffstall v. McDaniel, 152 Pa. 598, 601, 602; also revised order, Southern L. & S. Co. v. Baker, 282 Pa. 204) may present a different aspect; but, however that may be, on the record as it stands, the court below, instead of following the course it did, should have given defendant permission to file a further answer (section 20 of the Practice Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483) before considering the entry of final judgment.\nThe judgment is reversed, and defendant is granted the right to file such an affidavit of defense on the merits as is required by section 7 of the Practice Act, supra, of one in his representative capacity.",

In an action by the payee of a judgment note under seal against an executor of an endorser, where it appears that deceased had signed with others on the back of the note what purported to be, inter alia, an assignment of the note to the payee, and the affidavit of defense admits in effect that plaintiff sued as payee and holder, and not as assignee, and fails to state that deceased had an assignable interest, defendant cannot claim that deceased had an assignable interest and that plaintiff therefore sued as an assignee.\n2. In such case the Act of May 28, 1115, 1 Sm. L. 90, providing how a specialty must be assigned to enable an assignee to sue thereon, has no application.\n3. A promissory note containing a warrant of attorney to confess judgment at any time, is a nonnegotiable instrument.\n4. While suit cannot be brought on a nonnegotiable note against one who merely endorses his name thereon, suit may be brought if he signs his name to a written endorsement which can be interpreted as imposing upon him a liability by contract to pay the note.\n5. Where a secondary obligation or suretyship is entered into at the time of the creation of the principal debt, the payment of the money to the principal debtor is sufficient consideration to support the obligation assumed by the surety.\n6. Such rule applies to an endorser on a note, whether he is a surety or a guarantor.\n7. Where a note is payable on demand, and an endorser states over his signature that he hereby guarantees payment of the note, the endorsement fixes the liability of the endorser as of the day on which it is executed, and also creates the liability of suretyship as distinguished from technical guaranty.\n8. In such case the Act of July 24, 1913, P. L. 971, applies, and the endorser cannot be treated as though only a general guarantor, in the absence of any words in the endorsement necessary to make the liability assumed other than that of a surety.\n9. A guaranty of a note \u201cwhen due\u201d is broken by nonpayment at maturity.\n10. A warranty of payment at a particular time, means payment at that time and not payment after pursuit and insolvency of the principal debtor, even though the word \u201cguarantee\" may have been used.\nContract \u2014 Construction\u2014Elimination of words \u2014 Judicial construction.\n11. The rule that no portion of a written instrument, except such as may have been inserted by accident or mistake, may be eliminated by judicial construction, does not apply where the portion ignored has no apparent bearing on the obligation in the part sought to be enforced.\nAppeals \u2014 Question not considered in lower court.\n12.
