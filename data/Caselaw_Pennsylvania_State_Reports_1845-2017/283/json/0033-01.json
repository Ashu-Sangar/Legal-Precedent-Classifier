        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice Moschziskee,\nThis is a proceeding under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act of June 18, 1923, P. L. 840, to determine whether plaintiff is entitled to a new term of ten years at the expiration of a lease for that period, or whether he is entitled to a term from year to year only. The court below decided in favor of the longer term, and defendant has appealed.\nBoth parties stated at the bar of this court that they had elected to treat the statute under which these proceedings were brought as constitutional, hence no question was raised on that point; and since the present case involves a real controversy, and the act invoked is one which deals with remedies and practice, rather than with substantive rights, the court is not impelled to insist that its constitutional validity shall be argued at this time; but it may be well to state that in assuming jurisdiction we must not be understood as determining constitutional points, or as indicating any view with reference thereto, for, until such matters are properly raised and argued, we entertain no opinion concerning them.\nBy lease, dated March 25,1913, defendant let to plaintiff a building in the City of Altoona \u201cfor the term of ten years from the first day of September, 1914,\u201d \u201cin consideration whereof\u201d the latter agreed to pay the former \u201cthe sum of $585 per month......during the said term of ten years.\u201d It is to be noted that no \u201cyearly rental\u201d is mentioned, as in the clause about to be quoted; and, as we shall later point out, the subsequent use of these words, after their omission here, is significant.\nThe term expired September 1, 1924, and the controversy arises over the construction of the following paragraph: \u201cAt the expiration of this lease, said Aaron [lessee and plaintiff] to have the privilege of re-leasing the said premises at the yearly rental of $7,200, payable monthly at $600 per month.\u201d At this point it is to be noted that the privilege granted is not to renew the old lease at an increased monthly rent, but to re-lease the premises on the basis of a yearly rental. In other words, instead of following the form of the original lease and mentioning simply the amount of the monthly payments, as increased, the idea of an annual term is suggested by naming an annual rental.\nThere is a distinction between the ordinary meaning of words such as \u201cthe privilege of renewing this lease \u201d which appear in the cases relied on by plaintiff, and words such as \u201cthe privilege of re-leasing said premises, at a yearly rental,\u201d etc., which appear here. To renew a lease implies not only a leasing again of the premises, but more, in that it conveys the definite idea that all the terms of the new lease, including the period during which it is to run, are to be the same as those contained in the original lease; for, to \u201crenew\u201d is to \u201crevive\u201d or \u201crestore to existence\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary; and see Richards v. Richards, 12 L. J. Eq. 460, 463), while to \u201cre-lease\u201d means simply to \u201clease again\u201d or \u201cto grant a new lease of\u201d: Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary. This difference of meaning between \u201crenew\u201d and \u201cre-lease\u201d has significance here, as we shall presently indicate, though, of course, under some circumstances the words might be used to express a like meaning. For instance, in Cairns v. Llewellyn, 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 599, 607 (where other authorities, used by the court below in this case, are cited), the Superior Court states: \u201cThe word \u2018renew\u2019 or \u2018renewal\u2019 is not essential [to bring the general provisions of the original lease into the contemplated one,] if other words conveying the same idea are employed, \u2014 \u2018re-rent,\u2019 \u2018rent again,\u2019 \u2018privilege of another term,\u2019 \u2018refusal of the premises,\u2019 and like expressions, without more, are sufficient, provided the length of the new term is specified\u201d; but this is far from saying \u201c.that, where the length of the term is not specified,\u201d such words as \u201cthe privilege of re-leasing the premises\u201d must, under every and all circumstances, be given the same meaning as \u201cthe privilege of renewing the lease,\u201d so as to require the same term of years as the original lease, which in effect is the argument of plaintiff in this case.\nTo sustain his contention, plaintiff carries the line of authorities on which he relies too far. Speaking generally, it may be said that the cases cited by the court below, and those relied on by plaintiff, all turn on the general rule discussed in 16 R. C. L. sec. 390, at page 887, that a simple covenant to renew, without more, \u201cimplies a renewal on the same terms [except as to the renewal clause itself] and for the same time as the original lease, and is therefore sufficiently certain to be binding.\u201d There is no question here as to the clause in controversy being \u201csufficiently certain to be binding,\u201d for the parties agree as to this, and the court below has found, without exception being taken, that \u201cAll other terms of the releasing contract [except as to the period] are admitted and agreed to by the parties, i. e., the premises to be let, the amount of rent and the manner of its payment, and conditions as to repairing, water rent and heating.\u201d The only point raised for decision is stated in appellant\u2019s question involved thus: \u201cDoes the tenant\u2019s election to exercise the privilege of [the option] clause give him any additional or extended term, and, if so, for what period of time?\u201d\nWhile the clause in question omits to state in so many words precisely what the term of the new lease is to be, on the other hand it does not provide for a \u201crenewal\u201d of either the old lease or of the old term, or for the privilege of such renewal, but for the privilege of \u201cre-leasing said premises\u201d; and, these words being susceptible of a meaning different from the former, the question is, were they meant to have a different meaning in the present instance?\nIf, in seeking for the answer to the question just stated, our attention is confined to the option clause, we observe at once that, though no term is stipulated, a yearly rental is fixed, naming the amount, and then, \u2014 as in the demise itself, \u2014 the amount of the (increased) monthly installment is stated. In view of this mention of the new monthly installments, unless the words \u201cat a yearly rental\u201d were placed in the option clause with a purpose to measure the future term, it may be seen that they are entirely unnecessary and serve no purpose.\nThe demising clause names a term of ten years and fixes a monthly rental only; had the parties intended a term for the new lease like that in the old one, merely changing the rental, it is natural to assume that they would have used the phraseology of the original lease, and, after providing for the privilege of renewal, would have said, \u201cat $600 per month,\u201d instead of expressly providing, as they did, for a yearly rental. Under the circumstances, the last-mentioned provision is significant, and may well be treated as bringing this case within the rule established in Pennsylvania that, where no period of duration is mentioned in a lease, the law favors a yearly term, especially where there is an indication that the parties so intended; and in many cases the stipulation of an annual rental has been accepted as such an indication.\nIn Lesley v. Randolph, 4 Rawle 123, 125, the court had the following lease before it for interpretation: \u201cWe have this day rented to George F. Randolph the store or warehouse No. 241 High Street, the rent to be eight hundred (800) dollars per annum, payable quarterly.\u201d We there said: \u201cThe lease......is not expressly for any determinate period of time, and it is only by construction that a limitation can be affixed to it. It, at an early period in England, would have been considered a letting at will, but as it is not so in express terms, it would at the time of our Revolution have been deemed a lease from year to year; and more especially so, as an annual rental is reserved to be paid: 2 Bl. Com. 147, Chitty\u2019s ed. and note (11); Adams on Eject. 102-3. Sir William Blackstone says, speaking of tenancies at will, \u2018Courts of late have rather held them to be tenancies from year fo year, so long as both parties please, especially where an annual rent is reserved 2 Bl. Com. 147. In Bree v. Lees, 2 W. Bl. Bep. 1173, Lord Chief Justice DeGrey says, \u2018All leases for uncertain terms are prima facie leases at will; it is the reservation of an annual rent that turns them into leases from year to year/ And Sir J. Mansfield, Chief Justice, in Richardson v. Langridge, 4 Taunt. 131, lays down the same rule in a case put by him by way of illustrating it in the following words: \u2018If there were a general letting at a yearly rent, though payable half yearly or quarterly, and though nothing were said about the duration of the time, it is an implied letting from year to year.\u2019......It also comes directly within the description of a lease from year to year, as it is given by Messrs. Chambers, Bingham, and Comyns, who have each written and compiled a treatise on this subject. Mr. Chambers, in his work, page 355, says, that \u2018A general taking at an annual rent is a lease from year to year.\u2019 See Bing. Landlord and Tenant, 177 and Comyn\u2019s Landlord and Tenant, pp. 7, 8, 91, and 303, all to the same effect......I however do not wish to be understood as entertaining the opinion that a lease for a year, and so from year to year as long as both parties shall please, is a lease for the term of two years certain at its commencement. My idea of it is this: that it is binding prospectively on the parties for one year only, capable however of being extended to a second, third, fourth, or fifth year, and so on, unless determined by the dissent of either party, which may be done at the close of any one year, by giving three months\u2019 previous notice to that effect, but at no time before the close of a year after it has once commenced.\u201d See also Hey v. McGrath, 81* Pa. 310; Jones v. Kroll, 116 Pa. 85, 88, 89, 92; 24 Cyc. 1028, par. 2, sec. b. Of course, Lesley v. Randolph did not involve a new letting following a prior term, but the principles there laid down are more pertinent in construing the present contract than those cited by the lower court.\nThe three authorities mainly relied on by the court below to sustain the principle applied by it in reaching the decision here appealed from, that \u201cthe privilege of a renewal extends the lease for the term of the original lease,\u201d are all distinguishable on their facts from the case at bar.\nIn Karn v. DiLorenzo, 111 Atl. R. 195 (Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors), there was a written lease for three years containing the provision, \u201cwith privilege of renewal.\u201d Defendant contended that the words employed were too indefinite and uncertain to constitute a contract for a new term. In disposing of this contention, the court said: \u201cThe clause is certainly brief, but under well-settled principles of interpretation it is sufficient to constitute a good covenant; ______it has uniformly been held that a general covenant \u2018to renew\u2019 implies a renewal on the same terms and for the same times as the original lease, and therefore is sufficiently certain to be enforceable.\u201d Thus it may be seen that this case, differing from the one at bar, falls strictly within the rule that the bare right to renew a lease, without more, means the right of renewal for a term similar to that in the original lease.\nIn Kollock v. Kaiser, 98 Wis. 104, 73 N. W. 776, the lease was for ten years, \u201cwith the privilege of a renewal,\u201d nothing more of significance being said; which, of course, brought the case within the rule just stated.\nPhillips v. Reynolds, 20 Washington 374, 55 Pac. 316, decides merely that, under a lease for a fixed term, containing a clause that, at the expiration thereof the landlord would either buy improvements made by the tenant or \u201cextend this lease,\u201d without anything to show how long the extension should be for, the landlord could not escape Ms liability to purchase the improvements by a mere nominal extension of one day.\nThere is no effort here, as in most of the prior cases, to defeat the contract, for appellant admits that appellee has the right to a new term under the provisions of the original lease as changed by those of the option clause, and appellee desires to take advantage of that right, whatever it may be; the only question concerns the duration of the new term, and, as to this, the clause itself furnishes the key with sufficient precision to take the case out of the rules relied on by the court below; and also out of control of the rule that, \u201cin construing provisions relating to renewals, where there is......uncertainty, the tenant is favored\u201d (Kaufman v. Liggett, 209 Pa. 87; Stetler v. North Branch Transit Co., 258 Pa. 299; Hunter v. Johns, 275 Pa. 532), likewise relied on by the court below. In short, none of the cited authorities approximately presents the combination of contractual facts which appear in the instant appeal, and none of them controls this case. According to the option clause before us, plaintiff is entitled to lease the demised premises again, but not for the period of the original lease; he is entitled to a yearly term, at the increased rental of $7,200 per annum, under the essential provisions (Rutgers v. Hunter, 6 John. Ch. 215, 218) of the original lease as varied by those stated in the option clause, and the court below erred in deciding otherwise.\nWe have not discussed other parts of the contract between the parties because, on the record before us, they are not of any particular help in construing the option clause. We may state, however, that the lease provides for certain alterations and repairs to be made by the lessor and for others by the lessee, and it stipulates that the latter is to \u201cpay the water rent and heat the building at his own expense\u201d; while the option clause states that the lessee is to make \u201chis own repairs and improvements, paying the water rent and furnishing his own heat, as per the terras herein named.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel attempt to detach the phrase \u201cas per the terms herein named\u201d from its position at the end of the clause and to attach it to the words at its beginning, so as to make the clause read: \u201cAt the expiration of this lease, said Aaron to have the privilege of re-leasing as per the terms herein stated.\u201d There is no warrant for so reading the clause; the phrase in question occurs at the end thereof and merely qualifies the preceding words, \u201cpaying the water rent and furnishing his own heat,\u201d as to which no change is made between the original contract and the contemplated lease.\nThe declaratory judgment is set aside and the court below is directed to enter one in accord with the views expressed in this opinion; costs to be divided between the parties litigant.",

There is a distinction between the ordinary meaning of words such as \u201cthe privilege of renewing this lease\u201d and the words \u201cthe privilege of re-leasing such premises at a yearly rental.\u201d\n4. To renew a lease implies not only a leasing again of the premises but more, in that it conveys the definite idea that all the terms of the new lease, including the period during which it is to run, are to be the same as those contained in the original lease.\n5. To \u201cre-lease\u201d means simply \u201cto lease again\u201d or \u201cto grant a new lease.\u201d\n6. Where the length of a new term is not specified in a lease, such words as \u201cthe privilege of releasing the premises\u201d cannot under any and all circumstances be given the same meaning as \u201cthe privilege of renewing the lease,\u201d so as to require the same term of years as the original lease.\n7. Where no period of duration is mentioned in a lease, the law favors a yearly term, especially where there is an indication that the parties so intended.\n8. Where a lease provides for a term of ten years at a rental of $585 per month \u201cduring the said term of ten years\u201d and further provides that \u201cat the expiration of the lease\u201d the lessee shall \u201chave the privilege of re-leasing the said premises at the yearly rental of $7,200 payable monthly at $600 per month,\u201d the lessee has the privilege of re-leasing the premises for a yearly term at the yearly rental named, but not for the term of ten years as provided in the original lease.\n9. In such case the words of the lease are so explicit that there is no place for the application of the rule that in construing provisions relating to renewals, where there is uncertainty, the tenant is favored.\nContract \u2014 Construction\u2014Rearrangement of words.\n10. In constructing a contract the court will not change the position of a phrase which merely qualifies the preceding words, so as to give the contract a different and much wider scope.\nArgued February 10,1925.\nAppeal, No. 149, Jan. T., 1925, by defendant, from declaratory judgment of C. P. Blair Co., March T., 1924, No. 18, for plaintiff, in case of W. S. Aaron v. Wm. L. Woodcock.\nBefore Moschzisker, C. J., Frazer, Walling, Simpson, Kephart, Sadler and Schaefer, JJ.\nReversed.\nPetition for declaratory judgment under Act of June 18, 1923, P. L. 840. Before Searle, P. J., specially presiding.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the facts.\nJudgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was, inter alia, judgment, quoting record.\nJohn Woodcock and W. I. Woodcock, for appellant.\u2014\nA covenant to grant a new lease is not the same as a general covenant to renew and does not import a lease with like terms and provisions or with like covenants: Withlock v. Duffield, Hoffm. N. Y. 110; Willis v. Astor (N. Y.), 4 Edw. 594; Miller v. Trafford, 70 L. J. Ch. 72.\nA lease for no determinate period of time but by which an annual rental is reserved is a lease from year to year: Lesley v. Randolph, 4 Rawle 123; Hey v. McGrath, 81* Pa. 310; Jones v. Kroll, 116 Pa. 85.\nThe lease at bar was made for the original term of ten years and the rent in it was reserved by the month at $585. In this clause giving the option to re-lease the rent is reserved by the year, payable monthly, and this fact should be of some weight in determining the proper interpretation of the clause: McDonald v. Karpeles, 61 Pa. Superior Ct. 496; Cairns v. Llewellyn, 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 599; Creighton v. McKee, 7 Phila. 324; Cunningham v. Pattee, 99 Mass. 248; Rutger v. Hunter, 6 John. Ch. (N. Y.) 218; Reed v. Campbell, 43 N. J. Eq. 406.\nWhen a tenant holds over he is bound by the terms of the lease: Cairns v. Llewellyn, 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 599.\nThomas G. Hare, with him John J. Haberstroh and Robert F. Hare, for appellee.\n\u2014 Early decisions may have made a distinction concerning renewal, extension, re-rent, rent again, re-leasing, privilege of another term, and like expressions, but the more recent authorities uniformly hold that the term employed will be construed to effect the intention of the parties: Cairns v. Llewellyn, 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 599, 607; McDonald v. Karpeles, 61 Pa. Superior Ct. 496, 498.\nA simple covenant to renew a lease, which makes no provision as to the terms and conditions of the renewal in the lease implies a renewal for the same rental, term, and conditions as provided in the original lease, and is sufficiently definite and certain to be valid and enforce-\nable: Creighton v. McKee, 2 Brewst. 383; Cairns v. Llewellyn, 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 599.\nMarch 16, 1925:"
