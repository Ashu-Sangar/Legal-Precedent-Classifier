        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe only real question on this appeal is, Was the evidence legally sufficient to show claimant, Annie B. Edwards, to have been the common-law wife of the deceased employee of defendant company? The referee found this fact in her favor and made an award of compensation, which was sustained by the board but reversed by the court below; hence the appeal.\nThere is evidence on the record from which, standing alone, the fact of marriage might be inferred, but claimant frankly testified that she and the deceased employee \u201cwere not legally married,\u201d and that no ceremony had been performed between them; that she \u201cjust went to live with him as others because [she] cared for him and thought he cared for [her].\u201d In answer to the question, \u201cWas there anything said between you about going together and living as man and wife?\u201d claimant replied, \u201cNothing that I know of.\u201d On this state of the evidence the court below very properly concluded that, \u201cThe present case is ruled by McDevitt\u2019s Est., 280 Pa. 50, 52, in which it was said: \u2018Cohabitation and reputation are not marriage; they are but circumstances from which a marriage may be presumed. The presumption of marriage arising from such facts may always be rebutted and wholly disappears in the face of proof that no marriage in fact had taken place......Moreover, the cohabitation having been meretricious at its inception, its illicit character is presumed to continue......The presumption that a cohabitation meretricious in its origin continues to be of that character may be rebutted and proved to have become matrimonial and a lawful common-law marriage established. The change may be established by circumstantial evidence, but the circumstances must be such as to exclude the presumption that the original relation continued, and to prove satisfactorily that it was changed to matrimonial union by mutual consent......Here, the proof does not satisfactorily rebut that presumption. True, the deceased permitted her to assume his name......[and introduced her as his wife]; but [this] did not constitute a marriage; while the contention that it indicated there had been one is answered by appellant\u2019s positive testimony to tbe contrary.\u2019 Tbe admission of claimant, as in Mc-Devitt\u2019s Estate, that there was no marriage ceremony [or contract of marriage made per verba de prsesenti] was fatal to ber claim.\u201d\nTbe judgment is affirmed.",

A woman cannot recover compensation for the death of her alleged husband under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, where she testifies that she went to live with the deceased, but that there was no marriage ceremony, or nothing said between them about going together and living as man and wife.\n2. Cohabitation and reputation are not marriage; they are but circumstances from which a marriage may be presumed; but such presumption may be rebutted by proof that no marriage had in fact taken place.
