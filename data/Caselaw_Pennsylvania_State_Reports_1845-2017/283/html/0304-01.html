Rittenhouse, trading as the Read-Rittenhouse Company, sued the Exeter Machine Works, Inc., to recover certain commissions alleged to be due him from the latter, for acting as sales agent, pursuant to an <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>agreement made between them. At trial, plaintiff testified, on cross-examination, that his business was that of manufacturers’ representative in the sale of steel and allied products; and that, in addition to acting as defendant’s sales agent, he transacted business of the same general character for other concerns, — indicating, as defendant contends, that plaintiff was conducting the business of a broker. Counsel for defendant thereupon sought to cross-examine plaintiff as to his payment of a broker’s license, required by the Act of May 7, 1907, P. L. 175. Plaintiff objected that there was no averment in the affidavit of defense as to his being a broker or that he had failed to comply with the statutory requirements in question. The objection was sustained, under exception, and the cross-examination was not permitted. The jury found for plaintiff. Defendant moved for a new trial, the principal reason in support of this motion being that, since plaintiff had sworn by his own testimony that he was engaged as a broker during the period covering his dealings with defendant, the trial judge erred in refusing to permit the latter’s counsel to cross-examine plaintiff as to whether he had a broker’s license and had paid the state tax on his business. The court in banc granted a new. trial, that the “question whether the plaintiff was actually engaged in the business of a merchandise broker at the time......he rendered the services for which he brought suit,” might be properly developed, and, if necessary, submitted to a jury. The present appeal is from the order granting the new trial.</p>

Miller, <a href="/pa/275/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="275 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="1075633" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0452-01">275 Pa. 452</a> (see also Cherry v.

On appeals such as the one now before us, this court never reverses unless the record <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>demonstrates that the order complained of was caused alone by a clear error of law or was based on a palpable abuse of discretion; neither of which appears in the present case: Weiss v.
