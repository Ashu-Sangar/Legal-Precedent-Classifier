In the summer of 1922, certain individuals secured a like Pennsylvania charter for a corporation with a capital stock of $100,000, known as “the MacKay Company,” the purpose of which was the manufacture of incubators and other poultry supplies, at Lancaster. Several stockholders and officers of the Ice Company being interested in the MacKay Company, it was mutually agreed that the latter should acquire for its use certain real estate of the former, at the price of $20,000, to be paid for with stock of the MacKay Company at par. In July of that year, the Ice Company apparently made an offer of the real estate in question to the MacKay Company on the terms above stated. In any event, on the fourth of the next month (August) the stockholders of the latter <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>company, which had just received its charter, held a formal meeting, perfected an organization, and at the meeting of its board of directors on the same day, “it was resolved that the offer of the Consumers Ice &amp; Coal Company to grant, bargain, sell and convey to this company a certain tract of land with building and improvements thereon, situated partly in Lancaster City, and partly in Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pa., at the intersection of Ice Avenue and North Plum Street, adjoining the property of the said Ice Company and the Pennsylvania railroad right-of-way, including a railway siding as now constructed and the perpetual use thereof over the property of said Ice Company, and a right-of-way of at least twenty feet wide adjoining said tract to the east, as surveyed by I. Carpenter, C. E., on July 21,1922, copy of which draft is attached hereto, in consideration of the issuing of $20,000 par value of the capital stock of this company to said Consumers Ice &amp; Coal Company, be accepted; and upon the execution and delivery of proper deed or deeds for said property, free and clear of any encumbrances, the president and treasurer are authorized and directed to issue and deliver to the said the Consumers Ice &amp; Coal Company four hundred (400) shares [at par value of $50 per share] of the capital stock of this company.” Thereafter, on August 14, 1922, at a meeting attended by all the directors of the Ice Company, “it was unanimously resolved that the Consumers Ice &amp; Coal Company sell, grant and convey, to the MacKay Company, all that certain piece of land, situated partly in Lancaster City and partly in Manheim Township, with buildings and improvements thereon erected, bounded and described, as follows:.....Containing — acres, as per survey made by I. Carpenter, C. E., for the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000).” This resolution also authorized the president and secretary to execute the deeds and receive the purchase price. A further resolution adopted at the same meeting declared, inter alia, that the stock of <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>the MacKay Company was worth par and accepted the $20,000 in full payment for the land, and also declared that the sale thereof would “not interfere with the full exercise of the corporate franchises and business of this company.” As a part of the agreement and in anticipation of this sale, the Ice Company had erected certain buildings on the land in question for the use of the MacKay Company. Pursuant to the agreement of the parties, as evidenced by the resolutions above mentioned, the MacKay Company took and retained possession of the real estate so purchased, expended large sums in equipping and fitting the buildings to meet its special needs; also had the buildings insured and in general assumed control of the property as owner and proceeded to manufacture incubators, etc., therein. At a meeting held on September 19, 1922, the directors of the Ice Company adopted a resolution authorizing its officers to proceed and execute the agreement as embodied in the resolution of August 11th. Charles L. Miller, Esq., of the Lancaster Bar, was attorney for both corporations and prepared a deed describing the property according to the Carpenter survey, which had been made at the instance of the Ice Company. Mr. Miller exhibited the deed to the Ice Company’s manager, who expressed satisfaction therewith and affixed the seal of his company thereon, but requested that the execution of the deed be delayed until after January 1, 1923, to avoid complicating the income tax returns. The MacKay Company often expressed a readiness to perform on its part and requested an execution of the deed, which was never done, and in May, 1923, the Ice Company adopted a resolution in repudiation of the sale. The MacKay Company proved a financial failure and in July, 1923, being insolvent, passed into the hands of receivers, who promptly filed this bill praying for a decree compelling the Ice Company and its officers to specifically perform the contract for the sale of the real estate as above mentioned. To this a responsive answer was filed and tes<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>timony taken. Thereupon the trial court made numerous findings of facts and legal conclusions, sustaining plaintiffs’ contention, and in due course a final decfee for specific performance was entered; then defendants brought this appeal.</p>

This objection cannot be lightly disregarded, but when we consider that the MacKay Company was chartered, organized and officered largely by those in charge of the Ice Company, who clothed it with an apparent ownership of valuable real estate, whereby it was enabled to secure loans and contract other obligations, it must be conceded that the creditors of the MacKay Company have an equity which cannot be ignored. While that company turned out an unfortunate enterprise, it was undertaken in good faith and the record contains neither allegation nor proof of fraud. It may be, as urged, a hardship on the Ice Company’s minority stockholders, but under all the circumstances we cannot say the trial court reached a harsh or inequitable conclusion. Plaintiffs’ equity is stronger because of the large amount of <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>labor and material expended upon the property, including the installation of machinery and fixtures.</p>
