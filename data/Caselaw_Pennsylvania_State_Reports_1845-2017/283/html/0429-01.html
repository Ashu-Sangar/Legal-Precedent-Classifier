    <p id="b455-7" data-blocks='[["BL_455.12",455,[149,1657,1151,643]]]'>Plaintiff sued defendants to recover damages for the breach of an alleged contract. The trial judge refused defendants’ point for binding instructions, and plaintiff recovered a verdict for $10,266. The court in banc entered judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto, upon two grounds: (1) The parties had not entered into a contract; and (2) The alleged agreement, even if it had been made, would not have been enforceable, because of section 4 of the Sales Act of May 19, 1915, P. L. 543. In disposing of plaintiff’s appeal from that judgment, we shall limit our consideration to the last of these points.</p>

    <p id="b456-6" data-blocks='[["BL_456.5",456,[295,722,1149,863]]]'>Admittedly plaintiff, who claimed it was a “buyer,” did not “accept part of the goods......contracted to be sold......and actually receive the same,” nor did it “give something in earnest to bind the contract, or in part payment.” Hence, unless “some note or memorandum in writing of the contract” appears, it cannot be enforced against defendants who are “the party to be charged” in this action. The first draft of a contract, drawn by defendants’ agent, was unsatisfactory to plaintiff, and was signed by neither party. The second draft, prepared by plaintiff, was signed by it, but not by defendants. Beyond these there are no writings in evidence, except the correspondence between the parties; and it becomes important, therefore, to determine the principles to be applied in ascertaining whether or not the contract in suit can be gathered therefrom.</p>

Admittedly more than half of the whole number were written before a contract is even alleged to have been made. Several positively deny there was any contract. Some of them speak of a contract, but do not state its terms, nor do they, or any of the others, specifically refer to any document from which these terms could be ascertained. Indeed, if the letters signed by defendants are considered, either separately or together, it is gravely doubtful whether or not they refer <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>to an existing contract; they seem rather to relate to an agreement -which defendants expected would be entered into, but in fact never was, because they could not supply materials which would measure up to the warranties of quality on which plaintiff insisted.</p>
