Collins was the owner of a tract of land in the' City of Philadelphia, abutting on Sixty-fourth Street, and extending for one block from Diamond Street to Malvern Avenue. This was divided into lots so that twenty-four similar brick dwelling houses could be erected. In 1921, to aid in financing, the building operation, he conveyed the entire tract to one Webb, “under and subject to the restrictions that none of the said properties shall ever be occupied by persons of other than the Caucasian race, and neither shall be built beyond the present line or changed into stores for a period of ten years from the date [of said deed].” Some months later, the property was retransferred to the former grantor. He sold two of the buildings in course of erection, subject to the covenant recited, and altered the basement of the house fronting on Diamond Street, so that it could be used by him for business purposes, and it has since been so occupied. All of the remaining houses were sold, that to the complainant in 1922, and the house abutting on Malvern Avenue to one of the defendants a year after. In 1924, the latter commenced the remodeling of the lower floor of her house, so that it might be used as a store, as was the property at the Diamond Street end of the block, and the bill now before us was filed by the owner who purchased in 1922, and whose property faced on Sixty-fourth Street, to restrain the proposed change as violative of the restriction im<a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>posed for the benefit of all the houses in the block. Mr. Bien, husband of the holder of the title, and the contractors, were joined as defendants. After final hearing, a decree was entered restraining the change of the basement of Mrs. Bien’s house into a store, and it is from this order the present appeal is taken. The court below found the district to be residential in character and that the restriction for ten years was made for the purpose of continuing it as such.</p>

It should be noted first that the present bill was filed not by him, but by an owner of a house in the block, purchased prior to that of Mrs. Bien, and subject to the same restriction as appeared in the latter’s deed. If the action had been by the original grantor, who had shown by his conduct that the purpose was not to prevent such an alteration on the side streets, a different proposition would be presented. It might be forcibly argued, had this been the situation, that the acts of the owners showed the intention of the parties, and the meaning of the words used: DeSanno v. Earle, <a href="/pa/273/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="273 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="1070861" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0265-01">273 Pa. 265</a>; Landell v.

Here, however, the complainant is a purchaser who complains of a violation of the restriction made for his benefit and that of other buyers of houses facing on the street, and Mrs. Bien was a subsequent grantee of the corner lot: Harmon v. Burow, <a href="/pa/263/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="263 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1047519" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0188-01">263 Pa. 188</a>; Rabinowitz v.
