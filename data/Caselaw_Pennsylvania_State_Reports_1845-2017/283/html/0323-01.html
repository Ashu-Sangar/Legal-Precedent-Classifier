In 1922, by agreement, the Acceptance Corporation sold and transferred all its property, including assets, good will, <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>etc., to the Finance Corporation and received in payment therefor the common and preferred stock of the latter company at the ratio of two shares of the Finance Corporation for three shares of like stock of the Acceptance Corporation. As a part of the same transaction the Finance Corporation agreed to assume all the outstanding liabilities, both fixed and contingent, of the Acceptance Corporation and all of its obligations upon uncompleted stock agreements. The sale was duly ratified by the stockholders of the Acceptance Corporation, which corporation, later on the same day, voted to dissolve. A large majority of the holders of preferred stock in the Acceptance Corporation surrendered their stock therein and received in exchange the preferred stock of the defendant corporation, but others refused to do so. Among the latter was the plaintiff’s decedent, herein called plaintiff, who held such preferred stock to the par value of $5,600, for which he brought this suit on the contention that it was a liability assumed by the Finance Corporation under the agreement above mentioned. Defendant filed a responsive affidavit of defense and at the trial a verdict was directed for plaintiff, but the court in banc entered judgment for defendant n. o. v. and plaintiff appealed.</p>

    <p id="b350-4" data-blocks='[["BL_350.5",350,[257,568,1149,1505]]]'>Practically the only question in the case is whether plaintiff’s claim as a preferred stockholder was such a liability of the Acceptance Corporation as to be among those assumed by defendant. We agree with the trial court that it was not. The holder of stock, whether common or preferred is not a creditor of the corporation (Warren v. Queen &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/240/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="240 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="993124" data-case-paths="/pa/240/0154-01">240 Pa. 154</a>; Pardee et al. v.

Union Trust &amp; Savings Bank, <a href="/f/248/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="248 F. 268" data-case-ids="6737466" data-case-paths="/f/248/0268-01">248 Fed. 268</a>; also note (p. 254) to Kinston Cotton Mills v.

The fact that the agreement provides for an exchange of preferred stock for preferred stock shows the parties did not consider such stock in the Acceptance Corporation as a liability assumed by defendant, to be paid in cash. True, plaintiff was not bound to exchange his stock for that of the defendant corporation (Lauman v. Lebanon Valley Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/30/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="30 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="415549" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0042-01">30 Pa. 42</a>, 48; Mason v.
