Other witnesses testified they heard no warning of its approach given by the driver of the truck, and that it ran from forty to fifty feet after striking. plaintiff; that the trolley car had come to a stop at the time plaintiff alighted and that he was hit by defendant’s truck as he was stepping from the roadway to the sidewalk. Defendant testified his truck was running alongside of the trolley car, that the latter did not stop and that plaintiff stepped from the car practically in front of the machine. This conflicting testimony required submission of the case to the jury under proper instructions. In so doing the trial judge in substance said that, while plaintiff had a right to cross the roadway from the trolley car to the sidewalk in the middle of the block, it was his duty under such circumstances to “exercise more than ordinary care” and “observe whether or not there was anything approaching, ......and, if there was, not to commit himself in front of it unless he had a perfect opportunity to get across to the pavement in safety,” and that, if he failed to observe this degree of care, he was guilty of contributory negligence, and a verdict should not be rendered in his favor.</p>
