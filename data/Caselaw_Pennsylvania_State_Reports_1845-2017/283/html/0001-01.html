J. and E. J. Smith, brothers, and a brother-in-law, James J. Seyfried. The latter was also a director of the Lehigh National Bank, whose place of business was in <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>the same town. At various times, loans were negotiated by the former company, represented by notes, all of which were drawn to its own order, and endorsed by the parties named. The last, a renewal, was dated July 7, 1914, payable ninety days thereafter. This obligation was signed as before, except that the personal representatives of Seyfried, whose name was first, but who had died in the meantime, appeared. Payments on account had reduced the balance due to somewhat less than $6,000. The silk company became insolvent, and efforts were made by the bank to have those liable pay the amount still due. In 1917, it brought suit against all endorsers.</p>
    <p id="b27-3" data-blocks='[["BL_27.4",27,[157,1074,1151,867]]]'>On behalf of the estate of Seyfried, a statutory demurrer was-filed, denying that the obligation was joint, and insisting that, as a result, there was a misjoinder of parties. Expecting that some adjustment might be made, the legal question raised was not brought up for argument until 1923, or definitely disposed of until a year later. The court was then of opinion that the legal position urged should be sustained, and suggested an amendment, striking the names of the living defendants from the record. In the absence of proper averments showing joint liability, it was correctly so ordered (Wolf v. Hostetter, <a href="/pa/182/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="182 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="893195" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0292-01">182 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/182/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="182 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="893195" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0292-01">292</a>; </em>Matawan Title Co. v.

It was likewise insisted that the amendment, made by direction of the court, was, in effect, the institution of a new proceeding, which was barred by the statute <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>of limitations.

They were all liable to the bank which discounted the notes, though primarily the first named was required to pay, and this happened to be the decedent, Seyfried. If there was any agreement between him and his brothers-in-law as to the ultimate division of responsibility, that must be settled between themselves, but in so far as the bank, which is the plaintiff here, is concerned, any such understanding cannot defeat its right to recover against the first endorser.</p>
