In that case, the fact of nonsupport found by the auditor was confirmed by the orphans’ court, and the husband was accordingly excluded from participating in the distribution of the wife’s personalty. Later, he claimed rights in the wife’s real estate, as tenant by the curtesy, contending that the prior finding of the fact of nonsupport did not preclude him from having that question again examined, by a jury, in an action of ejectment, relying, as appellant does here, on the rule that a decree of the orphans’ court on an account of personal estate is conclusive only as to the fund then distributed and does not bind the court when another account in the same estate comes before it for adjudication. The Superior Court, speaking through Judge Reeder, sustained the husband’s contention and held that the rule on which he relied was applicable; but we do not regard the opinion of Judge Reeder as well considered, nor the case as correctly decided, in so far as it lays down the principle that facts found in a prior adjudication of a particular fund are not conclusive in a later adjudication, — the parties being the <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>same, — of another and different fund belonging to the same estate.</p>

In the former case, upon the adjudication of the first account of an executor, the orphans’ <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>court decided, as a fact, that an alternative gift to him in the event of the death of the testatrix within thirty days of the date of the will, with consequent failure of a charitable bequest, was not a device or scheme of the testatrix, participated in by the claimant, to defeat the operation of the Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 328. This point, we held, could not be reopened upon the adjudication of the second account of the executor, as the exact question of fact involved had already been determined in the prior proceeding, and, no appeal having been taken therefrom, all controversy regarding it was closed between the parties claiming the estate. Mr. Justice Stewart, speaking for the court, said: “A cause of action once finally determined, without appeal, between the parties on the merits, by any competent tribunal [Larkins v. Lindsay, <a href="/pa/205/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="205 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="930001" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0534-01">205 Pa. 534</a>; Klick v.

This is a rule dictated by a public policy which demands that, when a fact has been judicially and finally determined between the same parties, contention with respect thereto must cease. The rule applies with, the same strictness where the cause of action, while not technically the same, is nevertheless so related to the cause in the prior litigation that some matter, the establishment of which is essential to the recovery in the second, was determined in the first......The only question before the court [on the prior adjudication] was not one of law but purely of fact, and upon the truth with respect to it the whole case depended. The finding of the court was quite as conclusive as a verdict of a jury would have been. It will hardly be contended that, had it been submitted to a jury on an issue framed, the same question there decided could afterwards have been inquired into; as well might the personal identity of one claiming as a legatee, once settled in a judicial proceeding where it was the sole question in issue, be made the subject of <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>a second contest. The doctrine of res adjudieata here applies, and the end of the controversy was reached as to the matter inquired into on the adjudication of the second account, when, in the adjudication on the first account, it was definitely determined that there was no collusion between the testatrix and appellant to defeat the operation of the statute.” In other words, where, as here, the former controversy was between the same parties and concerned the same general question as now involved (i. e., the right of the husband to participate in the distribution of the estate of decedent), though a view of law there applied may be departed from, all issues of fact there decided, concerning the parties entitled, become res adjudieata as between such parties; and this is true even though the findings were made when the personal estate of decedent was the particular subject-matter before the court, and now the real estate is the particular matter involved, for in both instances the general subject-matter was the estate of the decedent; and, in the language of Mr. Justice Stewart, supra, while the respective causes of action are “not technically the same,” they are “so related” that a “matter the establishment of which is [now] essential [to appellee] was determined in the first” adjudication; so “the rule applies.”</p>

If the averments of the answer do not show an exclusive equitable title in the decedent, then there is no substantial controversy to be judicially passed on, and the court below did not err in sustaining appellee’s demurrer; and, since the pleading demurred to was an amendment to an original answer, and was in the nature of a bill of particulars, the court below did not err in entering final judgment.</p>

This being the case, no substantial issue is raised for judicial decision so far as the alleged wrongful conduct of the husband is concerned, and the mere fact that the properties were purchased by the individual funds of the wife would not be sufficient to defeat an estate by entireties, which is a most natural way for married people to hold property, however acquired.</p>
