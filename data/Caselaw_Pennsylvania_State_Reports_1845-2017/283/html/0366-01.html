When the owner permits his car to be used in violation of the statute, as was here done, his liability attaches for injury resulting from its negligent management, irrespective of whether the party was at the time engaged on his personal business; and, for all natural and probable results of his wrongful act, he must respond in damages: Stubbs v.

Certain'witnesses testified to boisterous conduct on the part of the driver of the car in which the minor plaintiff was riding, saying they detected the odor of hard cider or alcohol upon his breath, and it was proposed to elicit their opinions as to whether or not he was intoxicated. Where facts are narrated which indicate a likelihood of such condition, the judgment of witnesses is admissible to establish this (Com. v.

A witness, Chapin, an auto mechanic, was in his house, some 200 feet from the public highway, on the night of the accident. He was on the second floor, preparing to retire. From the sound of the exhaust of the motor of a passing car, he was of the belief that it belonged to Yocum, since it differed in sound from other machines in that community, though he was not prepared to say that it wgs not like other Ford cars to be found elsewhere, and which might have been going by. To show that this auto, which he did not see, was being driven at an excessive speed, was the purpose of the proposed testimony, though an examina.tion of the evidence adduced to show his qualifications fails to disclose that he could so testify. Opinions as to the speed of a moving object may be given, where the witness shows proper knowledge, but to base such judgment on the noise made, without actual observation, or more information than here shown, should not be permitted: Wright v.
