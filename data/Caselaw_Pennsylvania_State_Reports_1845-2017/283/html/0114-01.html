The lease provides, the “premises shall not be used for any purposes contrary to this agreement, and in case of violating this agreement the lessors may, at their option, declare the term of this lease at an end.” The lessees sublet the premises, as they were privileged to do, to Harry Bloom. The clauses governing subletting give to the lessors or their assignees the same rights and powers against subtenants as against original lessees. The lessor-owners assigned the lease, with all its terms and conditions, to Berry and Cohen, who subsequently assigned to the present use-plaintiffs.</p>

Bloom denied any connection with the still, charging another who had the privilege of occupying for a short time a small boarded off portion of the building as responsible. The court below, on petition, opened the judgment thus entered, and, at the trial subsequently held, the jury found the premises were used for purposes contrary to the lease and the law, with Bloom’s knowledge and connivance.

Long before the Volstead and state enforcement acts, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the control and regulation of the manufacture, sale and possession of liquors was within the police powers of the state. In Samuels v. McCurdy, <a href="/citations/?q=000%20U.S.%20000" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="000 U.S. 000">000 U. S. 000</a>, it is stated “It must now be regarded as settled that, on account of their well-known noxious qualities and the extraordinary evils......, a state has power absolutely to prohibit manufacture, gift, purchase, sale, or transportation of [such] liquors within its borders without violating the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment,” citing a number of authorities. The Eighteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution conferred on Congress' the same police power with reference to intoxicating liquors as that possessed by the several states: U. S. v. Cohen, <a href="/f/268/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="268 F. 420" data-case-ids="6737445" data-case-paths="/f/268/0420-01">268 Fed. 420</a>. It is a well recognized principle of law that all contracts are made in subordination to a prospective exercise of the police power within legitimate limits by the state (Relief <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>Electric Light, Heat and Power Company’s Petition, <a href="/pa-super/63/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="63 Pa.

Though the enforcement acts were passed several years after this contract was executed, the possibility of their passage was always present, and contracts are made with that possibility in view. Contracts which may indirectly or incidentally be concerned with matters coming within the field of prohibition legislation must be construed as having been executed with the possibility of such legislation in view. Therefore the provisions of these acts apply to the present contract, making the violation thereof a cause for forfeiture. Moreover, the constitutional prohibition against the impairment of the obligation of contracts does not apply to the federal government. The forfeiture of leases where the premises have been used in violation of the liquor laws is a valid exercise of the police power as being an aid to prohibition. It has a direct effect on the enforcement of the law. If violators of the law were permitted to remain in possession, enforcement would be rendered increasingly difficult, whereas if the premises are returned the maintenance of public morality is secured. It is very important that a lawless occupant should be completely ejected by a law-abiding lessor. Forfeitures under this section of the Volstead Act have been upheld: Grossman v. U. S., <a href="/f/280/0683-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="280 F. 683" data-case-ids="6720968" data-case-paths="/f/280/0683-01">280 Fed. 683</a>; U. S. v.

B., 39) contemplates no such construction with respect to forfeiting a lease. The language of the act is “Any violation of this title upon any leased premises by the lessee or occupant thereof shall at the option of the lessor work a forfeiture.” The cause of forfeiture arises when the unlawful relation is shown to exist. A conviction is unnecessary. The consequences of the act, so far as the public is concerned, may result in fine and imprisonment, but, as it relates to the owner of the premises, his protection lies in forfeiture. It is a separate, distinct and independent redress, different from the government’s right to convict or resort to padlock proceedings. See Com. v.

It is conceded the ownership of the reversion in fee was not in the use-plaintiffs, and that an assignment of the lease, with the owners’ rights accruing thereunder, was made to use-plaintiffs. (Wh&amp;n the petition to ope® the judgment was filed it <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>admitted that the use-plaintiffs succeeded to the interests of the owners of the' property, but asked that judgment be opened because Bloom had at all times used the demised premises in accordance with the provisions and covenants of the lease. By the agreement of October 11, 1922, appellants recognized title in appellees, and no controversy was raised in the court below on the right of plaintiffs to stand in the shoes of the original lessors. Our consideration of this appeal will be limited to the questions raised by petition and answer and in the court below: Shapiro v. Malarkey, <a href="/pa/278/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="278 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1080497" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0078-01">278 Pa. 78</a>. Parties in a position similar to that of the use-plaintiffs here were held to be proper parties to enforce such a forfeiture as this one, in U. S. v. Boynton, <a href="/f/297/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="297 F. 261" data-case-ids="3634624" data-case-paths="/f/297/0261-01">297 Fed. 261</a>.</p>

Glumicich, <a href="/pa-super/81/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="81 Pa. Super. 521" data-case-ids="655570" data-case-paths="/pa-super/81/0521-01">81 Pa. Superior Ct. 521</a>. Where a subtenant offends against a provision prohibiting the occupation of the premises for dwelling houses or any unlawful purpose, the restriction on the manner of use runs with the land, and is binding on the estate in the hands of subtenants: Wheeler v.

The appellants argue that the general phrase “shall not be used for any purpose contrary to this agreement” describes no event on which a forfeiture can be predicated and that it is to be confined to certain specific prohibitions in the lease which have not been violated, and that no cause of forfeiture under the lease has arisen. In view;, of our conclusion that the <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>statute gave a good and valid cause of forfeiture, it is unnecessary for us to decide this additional question.</p>
