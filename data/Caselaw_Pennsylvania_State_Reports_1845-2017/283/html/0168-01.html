The evidence in rebuttal of the presumption must be directly to the point, but, if it is, though contradicted, the weight of the evidence which satisfies the conscience of the chancellor is sufficient.</p>

A witness called by her testified that he had heard the father tell his daughter he had bought a property for her, but on cross-examination he was in doubt as to whether plaintiff said he had bought, or was going to buy, and as to whether he had said he was going to give it to his daughter or had given it to her. On behalf of the father, it was shown, without contradiction, that he negotiated the purchase, paid the entire consideration and that its payment represented practically his entire estate (an important circumstance: Dorman v. Dorman, <a href="/ill/187/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="187 Ill. 154" data-case-ids="3231630" data-case-paths="/ill/187/0154-01">187 Ill. 154</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20N.E.%20235" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="58 N.E. 235">58 N.

E. 510</a>), this the daughter knew; that he made other payments on account of the property out of his own pocket for insurance, interest on mortgage and for repairs, that he went into possession of the property, that when it was sold for $16,600, the check in settlement was drawn to the order of the daughter, who deposited it in bank and immediately gave him $4,000 thereof, $1,000 in cash and $3,-000 in a check, which he deposited in his own bank account; the balance of the consideration, $8,600, was placed in a saving fund account to the daughter’s credit. It further appeared, without contradiction, that the father paid the daughter’s expenses connected with going to this settlement. Immediately after purchasing the property, the father went into possession of it and conducted a. business therein, paying no rent for the part he occupied and receiving all the rents from those who were tenants of the other portions of it. He deposited the rents in the daughter’s name,-but when the property was sold she turned over to him all of the money in this account.</p>

Differences arose between them, which resulted in his leaving the house and demanding from her the balance of the purchase price of the property. She refused to give it to <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>him. He retained counsel, who notified the bank not to pay the money over to the daughter, but before this notice was received, she went to the bank and being unable to draw the money because of a rule of the institution as to notice, negotiated a loan from it for an amount slightly less than the deposit and received the money, which she appears to have secreted, although claiming to have invested it in liberty bonds. Her testimony as to where she bought the bonds and as to what she had done with them was so incredible that the chancellor gave no weight to it. He credited the testimony of the father and refused to believe that of the daughter alleging the gift, and found as a fact that there was no gift. Such finding, supported as it is by the evidence, is accepted by us: Gassner v. Gassner, <a href="/pa/280/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="280 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="1084473" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0313-01">280 Pa. 313</a>. Since the presumption of a gift to the daughter has been rebutted, her standing is the same as that of a stranger. It being admitted that the father paid the purchase price and having been shown to the chancellor’s satisfaction that it was not his intention, by putting title in his daughter, to make a gift of the property to her, there is a resulting trust by implication of law in favor of the father.</p>
    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[257,1620,1145,753]]]'>The question was duly raised by appellant as to whether equity had jurisdiction, the allegation being made that the demand of the father was but a money demand. When the bill was filed, however, against the daughter and the bank in which she had deposited the money, there was still money left in the bank in the daughter’s name and whatever its amount it was chargeable with the trust in the father’s favor if the trust was established. This gave equity jurisdiction, and, jurisdiction having attached in equity for any purpose, it will be retained to round out the controversy: Schermer v.

      <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>The final decree entered by the chancellor directed defendant to pay over to plaintiff the money in her hands found to belong to him, with interest thereon, and that the bank pay the plaintiff the balance of the deposit remaining with it to the credit of the defendant. We have not been convinced that this disposition of the case was wrong. The court below had the parties and their witnesses before it; their credibility was for it, not for us. There is sufficient evidence in the record to uphold the decree, and, therefore, it is affirmed, and the defendant, Fannie Ratkosky, is directed to pay the costs.</p>
