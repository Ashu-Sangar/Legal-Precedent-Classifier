The maker was a depositor in the holder bank, having two accounts, one individual and the other “John W. Garland, Spe<a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>eial.” On the day of maturity of the note the individual account was slightly overdrawn; the “special” account had a balance of $102.39. The holder, during that day, received for collection from the maker two checks aggregating $12,500, drawn on New York and Pittsburgh banks, for deposit to the “special” account; it was credited with the proceeds. Plaintiff protested the note for nonpayment at maturity. The two checks thus deposited did not pass through the clearing house on that day, but did afterwards, and were paid in the regular course of business. Before notice from the banks that the checks were or would be paid, plaintiff, on the day after the deposit, honored the maker’s cheeks drawn against this deposit; on that and the two following days practically all of the deposit was checked out. The holder now undertakes to recover from the endorser. The claim is resisted for the reason that the bank failed to apply the credit of the maker (represented either in. cash deposits or collections on hand, which in due course were reduced to cash or both) to the payment of the note (the word “credit” as used hereafter will be used in this sense). Before maturity, the endorser had notified the bank to collect the note when due, as he would not endorse any further renewal. These latter facts are important only as they serve to impress the holder with its duty in the premises.</p>

They were credited to his account. Though the checks were for collection, and were merely choses in action until paid, they were nevertheless prop-, erty of the maker in the hands of the bank, and by due diligence could have been, and in fact were, reduced to possession. They were paid while the note, though protested, still remained the property of the holder bank. It is not our purpose to enforce any undue hardship on banks, nor to embarrass the free negotiation, collection and liability arising through the use of negotiable instruments. But banks should be held at least to the measure of an individual’s responsibility and be diligent in the collection of its paper at maturity. The reasonable requirements of ordinary business' ¡relations dictate such course.</p>

He is also entitled to the benefit and advantage of any remedy a creditor may have against the principal debtor; this right in reason should be preserved to him as long as payment of the debt by him remains a possibility. We therefore reaffirm the rule that where a holder bank has deposits immediately reducible to cash in its hands on maturity, it must apply the cash subsequently received to the liquidation of the note; but the duty extends only to cash received in due course of business.

After the receipt of notice from the endorser to collect the note at maturity, and that no further renewal would be made, the bank, on the day following the deposit of $12,500, honored checks drawn by the maker against this account; it permitted the entire balance to be swept away, though no notice had been received by it that the checks of $12,500 had been paid. Without such notice, the honoring of the first withdrawal checks evidenced the fact that the bank regarded the deposit of $12,500 as cash on the day it was received; therefore it had at maturity sufficient credits of the maker to apply to the liquidation of the note.</p>
    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.6",242,[276,1393,1151,1023]]]'>Our conclusion is not altered by the fact that the account to which the checks were placed was in the name of “John W. Garland, Special.” The account, to have the effect contended for by appellant, must come within what is generally understood by the words “special” account, as distinguished from a general one. A “special” deposit or account is one where the identical money or thing deposited is to be kept safe and returned as deposited. The relation of debtor and creditor is not created, but that of bailor and bailee is, title remaining in the bailor. Whether a deposit is general or special depends on the facts and circumstances attending its making; but it is certain that the mere use of the word “special” placed after the depositor’s name will not cause the deposit to come within the definition above mentioned, nor will it effect an appropriation of the moneys for any particular purpose, so that it may be said they were set aside for a limited purpose with the bank’s knowledge.</p>

      <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>Money may be deposited specially, which has no relation whatever to bailment, trust fund or specific appropriation. It is a common practice to place money in banks in separate accounts to quickly, safely and accurately report to the government income for the past year. Special accounts are created for income, while capital remains in the individual account. The word “special” has no particular significance, as trustee, administrator and the like. A “special” deposit in a bank of the kind appellant contends for, is one in which money is entrusted to a bank not to be used but to be kept safely and sufficiently returned: Catlin v. Savings Bank, <a href="/conn/7/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="7 Conn. 487" data-case-ids="6753726" data-case-paths="/conn/7/0487-01">7 Conn. 487</a>, 492; Keene v.

But the word alone is not sufficient to convey that meaning. A deposit styled “special” is insufficient to put the bank on inquiry: Prosser v. First Nat. Bank (Tex.), <a href="/sw/134/0781-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="134 S.W. 781" data-case-ids="11298091" data-case-paths="/sw/134/0781-01">134 S. W. 781</a>, 783.</p>

The bank could show, however, that the deposit was for a purpose as described in the foregoing opinions, where the word has a definite meaning: either within the law as to specific deposit, or an appropriation of money for a particular purpose. When plaintiff tried to limit the deposit, the evidence was utterly insufficient. On the contrary, defendant proved the maker’s account marked “special” was used by him not only for his general business purposes but for his domestic purposes as well; it was cheeked out indiscriminately. It was in fact a general deposit, so known and acted on by the bank.</p>
