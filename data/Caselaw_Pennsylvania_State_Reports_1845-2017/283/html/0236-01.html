Edmonds, at Buffalo, New York, and four years later removed to Pittsburgh where they have since resided and where Mr. Edmonds has been continuously engaged in business. In 1901 he bought a home on Harriet Street for $10,000, taking title thereto in the name of his wife. He paid $2,500 thereon and they gave a joint bond and mortgage for the balance. Edmonds was then perfectly solvent and not engaged or about to engage in any hazardous business. In April, 1912, Edmonds gave his wife $7,000 to pay on the bond and mortgage, which she did, leaving an unpaid balance of $500, subject to which she then exchanged the Harriet Street property for a house and lot on Rippey Street, the latter being subject to a mortgage of $5,000, and the title thereto being taken in the name of Mrs. Edmonds. Plaintiff is a Pennsylvania corporation located at Norristown and Edmonds is and, since about 1906, has been its sales <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>agent in Pittsburgh. In 1915 Edmonds separated from his wife and children and about the same time two judgments amounting to approximately $10,000 were entered against him, in favor of the plaintiff on notes containing warrants of attorney. By executions issued thereon, the Bippey Street property was seized, in the fall of 1915, and sold by the sheriff to plaintiff, as Edmond’s property; thereupon this action of ejectment was brought. Plaintiff averred and offered evidence tending to prove that Edmonds was insolvent in 1912 and that payment of the $7,000 was invalid as tending to hinder and delay creditors, of which it was one, and that as to them, he was the equitable owner of the Bippey Street property. The trial judge directed a verdict for plaintiff for the land at issue; but later the court in banc entered judgment in its favor for seventy ninety-fifths of such land and therefrom defendant has appealed.</p>

Therefore, when he turned over the $7,000 to apply thereon he was paying a debt for which he was individually liable, and it is familiar law that a debtor in failing circumstances may prefer one creditor to another (Snayberger v. Fahl, <a href="/pa/195/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="195 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="914054" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0336-01">195 Pa. 336</a>; Candee &amp; Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/191/0644-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="191 Pa. 644" data-case-ids="907094" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0644-01">191 Pa. 644</a>; Penn Plate Glass Co. v.

In the exercise of such right he may pay a claim for which he is surety. “His [the debtor’s] right to prefer is not limited to claims which could be legally enforced, or on which his liability has become absolute. A contingent liability may be a sufficient basis for a preference. So an indorser of a note is contingently liable to the holder thereof and may secure him by a confession of judgment, and the liability of a surety on an unmatured obligation is a lawful debt, claim or demand which will warrant a preference”: 12 R. C. L. p. •576. We do not intimate that Edmonds occupied the position of surety, but treating him as such and as in<a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>solvent, his creditors might perhaps have asked for subrogation, or sought relief in equity; but a surety, on paying an obligation given by the principal as part consideration for property bought, does not thereby become part owner of the property. The creditors of an insolvent debtor who, while such, has expended his money in the improvement of his wife’s real estate, with her consent, may in a proper case have relief in equity (see Curtis &amp; Co. v. Olds, <a href="/pa/250/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="250 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1016995" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0320-01">250 Pa. 320</a>) but cannot sell the land as that of the husband and recover possession in an action of ejectment. The trial court recognized Mrs. Edmonds’ equity in the Harriet Street property to the extent of the $2,500 her husband paid thereon in 1901, but erred in concluding that the payment by him of the $7,000 on the bond and mortgage in 1912 vested in his creditors a title to seventy ninety-fifths of the Eippey Street property. The most they could claim from Mrs. Edmonds, or her property, under any possible theory, would be the $7,000 and interest thereon. See Karstorp’s Est., <a href="/pa/158/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="158 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="848221" data-case-paths="/pa/158/0030-01">158 Pa. 30</a>; Barto’s App., <a href="/pa/55/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="55 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1470714" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0386-01">55 Pa. 386</a>. Otherwise they might recover land on which she had expended large sums of her own money, as appellant suggests is the case here.</p>
