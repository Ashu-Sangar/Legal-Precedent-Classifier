The referee found this fact in her favor and made an award of compensation, which was sustained by the board but reversed by the court below; hence the appeal.</p>

The presumption of marriage arising from such facts may always be rebutted and wholly disappears in the face of proof that no marriage in fact had taken place......Moreover, the cohabitation having been meretricious at its inception, its illicit character is presumed to continue......The presumption that a cohabitation meretricious in its origin continues to be of that character may be rebutted and proved to have become matrimonial and a lawful common-law marriage established. The change may be established by circumstantial evidence, but the circumstances must be such as to exclude the presumption that the original relation continued, and to prove satisfactorily that it was changed to matrimonial union by mutual consent......Here, the proof does not satisfactorily rebut that presumption. True, the deceased permitted her to assume his name......[and introduced her as his wife]; but [this] did not constitute a marriage; while the contention that it indicated there had <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>been one is answered by appellant’s positive testimony to tbe contrary.’ Tbe admission of claimant, as in Mc-Devitt’s Estate, that there was no marriage ceremony [or contract of marriage made per verba de prsesenti] was fatal to ber claim.”</p>
