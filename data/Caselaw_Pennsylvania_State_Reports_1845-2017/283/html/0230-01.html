    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.11",256,[285,735,1154,1678]]]'>Defendant is the owner of the Hirsch Building on Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, in which the elevator system consists of two cars moving side by side, with counterweights for each located in the back of the shaft. Dr. Gehrs, a tenant on the third floor, requiring the use of electricity, secured consent of defendant’s superintendent to place a conduit in the back part of the elevator shaft with wires therein by which the electric current could be transmitted from a generator in the basement. The superintendent suggested Sunday morning, April 8,1923, as a convenient time for installing the conduit, etc., which plaintiff’s husband, Curtis M. Sloan, an electrician, contracted with the doctor to do. On that occasion the elevators were in charge of and operated by a young man in defendant’s employ, named Kaltenborn. By arrangement between him and Sloan, car No. 1 was to remain at a proper height so the latter and his helper could, by placing a plank on the top thereof, do the necessary work on the third floor. Meantime, when elevator service was required, Kaltenborn operated car No. 2. The evidence for plaintiff, although contradicted, was sufficient to support a finding that Kaltenborn agreed to call to Sloan whenever car No. 2 was to be moved up or down, which he did on several occasions; later, he moved the car up without notice to Sloan, who was caught and killed by the descending counterweights. At the trial of this case, brought for the damage thus sustained, the questions of negligence and contributory negligence were submitted to the jury, who found for plaintiff; from judgment entered thereon defendant has appealed.</p>

Sloan was there by the implied invitation of the owner and, hence, occupied the position of an invitee; being such, it was the landlord’s duty to use reasonable care for his protection: Newingham v. J. C. Blair Co., <a href="/pa/232/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="232 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="977863" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0511-01">232 Pa. 511</a>; Reed v.
