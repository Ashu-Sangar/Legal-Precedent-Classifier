Barny (Seal), Valentine W. Quigel (Seal), Alexander Nemolosky and Mike Rosenberg (without seals), as more fully shown in the reporter’s note accompanying this opinion.</p>

    <p id="b47-3" data-blocks='[["BL_47.4",47,[128,735,1151,1074]]]'>Defendant filed an affidavit of defense in the nature of a special demurrer, as follows: (1) “The statement of claim bases this action on an alleged endorsement of a promissory note upon which plaintiff is the payee, and of which it is the holder; the endorsement purports to be an assignment or transfer of said note by defendant’s decedent and others to the Miners State Bank, the payee and the holder of said note; the statement does not aver that defendant’s decedent was a party to said note, holder or owner of it, or the owner of any interest therein which he could assign and transfer; the endorsement was not effective for any purpose and cannot operate to make the estate of defendant’s decedent liable for the amount of the note or any part thereof.” (2) “The obligation of the endorsers, as disclosed by the statement of claim, was one of guaranty; the statement does not aver that the maker is insolvent, and it shows that the plaintiff did not exercise proper diligence in its efforts to collect the note from the maker; the action therefore cannot be maintained.”</p>

    <p id="b48-4" data-blocks='[["BL_48.5",48,[309,633,1147,205]]]'>In reply, plaintiff contends that the Act of 1715 has no application; that it sues, not as assignee but as the original holder and payee of the note, to recover from defendant as an original surety thereon.</p>

This contention is not properly before the court, however, for the affidavit of defense not only fails to suggest that the decedent had, or must be presumed to have had (in accord with the present argument), an assignable interest, but, by implication at least, denies it, showing by the very words of point one that defendant understood and accepted the fact that plaintiff claims no such interest. Therefore, on the pleadings, the Act of 1715 falls out of the case.</p>

Under such circumstances, if the endorsement were merely defendant’s decedent’s signature, and nothing more, there could be no recovery thereon (Wilson v.

    <p id="b49-3" data-blocks='[["BL_49.4",49,[193,518,1154,1628]]]'>True, the endorsement says, “I hereby......guarantee payment,” and, on these words, defendant, adopting the view of the court below, argues that plaintiff cannot recover because it seeks to enforce a guarantee against decedent’s estate without any consideration moving to the latter to assume the obligation. As to this, it may be noted first, that, no such point of demurrer, as absence of consideration, is made in the affidavit of defense; next, in a case like the one before us, where the secondary obligation, or suretyship, is entered into at the time of the creation of the principal debt (and in the present instance, there being nothing to indicate any other time, it must be assumed to have been then entered into: Woods v. Sherman, <a href="/pa/71/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="71 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1031218" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0100-01">71 Pa. 100</a>, 105; Siegel v.

We early said, in Snevily v. Johnston, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 307" data-case-ids="1852641" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0307-01">1 W. &amp; S. 307</a>, 309, that where the promise to meet the debt of another “is made at the same time with the principal contract, and becomes an essential ground of the credit given to the principal debtor,......no other consideration need be shoAvn than that for the original agreement”; and, later, in Campbell v. Knapp, <a href="/pa/15/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="15 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="408808" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0027-01">15 Pa. 27</a>, 30, we stated: “The guaranty being a part of the [original] transaction, the consideration for it is sufficient to maintain the action.” Then, in Paul v. Stackhouse, <a href="/pa/38/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="38 Pa. 302" data-case-ids="994096" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0302-01">38 Pa. 302</a>, 306, we said: “It is not essential that a consideration move to the surety,— it is sufficient if the principal derive a benefit from the promise.”</p>

While there appears at the bottom of the instant note, without any apparent connection with the body thereof, the words, “Due July 5, 20,” the words of the instrument itself concerning the due date are such as have been held by us to create an obligation payable on demand; further, the statement of claim avers that the note in suit was “payable on demand,” and there is no denial of that fact on the record; so, for present purposes, we must accept this admitted averment as correct. In Homewood Peoples Bank v. Hastings, <a href="/pa/263/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="263 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1047442" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0260-01">263 Pa. 260</a>, 265, the obligation reads, “Payable on demand after date,” and there, as here, the endorsement is, “I hereby guarantee payment”; we said, “The note......being payable on demand, became due immediately (Boustead v. Cuyler, <a href="/pa/116/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="116 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="554374" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0551-01">116 Pa. 551</a>), thus fixing the liability of the person guaranteeing payment of the obligation as of the day on which it was executed, and also creating the liability of suretyship as distinguished from technical guaranty.” The note in that case, so far as the date of payment and guarantee are concerned, being precisely like the one under discussion, we must here hold, as was there ruled, that the endorsement now before us likewise created “the liability of suretyship as distinguished from technical guaranty”: see also Roberts v. Riddle, <a href="/pa/79/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="79 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="438434" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0468-01">79 Pa. 468</a>, 470; Iron City Nat. Bank v.

Martin, <a href="/pa/74/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="74 Pa. 159" data-case-ids="1034751" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0159-01">74 Pa. 159</a>, 160, 161); and being such an agreement, without the words necessary to make the liability assumed other than that of a surety, the Act of 1913 applies by its very terms, and defendant’s decedent cannot be treated as though only a general guarantor.</p>

It is sufficient to say that this point is neither touched upon in the opinion of the court below nor pressed in the argument of counsel for defendant, and it might be dismissed on these grounds alone, or because, as already shown, according to the record before us, the decedent appears to be a surety rather than a guarantor; but, whatever he may be termed, the point in hand is covered by citing Campbell v. Baker, <a href="/pa/46/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="46 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="420650" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0243-01">46 Pa. 243</a>, where we held that “A guaranty of the payment of a note ‘when due’ is broken by nonpayment at maturity, and the guarantor is then liable upon his contract to the creditor, who is not bound either to pursue the principal or show his insolvency.” In other words, when one warrants payment at a particular time, it means just that, and not payment after pursuit and insolvency of the principal debtor, even though the Avord “guarantee,” — Avhich usually imports the necessity for the latter course, — may be used: see <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>also Homewood People’s Bk. v.

    <p id="b52-4" data-blocks='[["BL_52.5",52,[241,470,1151,688]]]'>We have not overlooked plaintiff’s argument to the effect that, if the assignment part of the present contract of endorsement be ignored, the words, “I hereby guarantee payment,” contained therein, should be treated likewise, because no portion of a written agreement, not plainly inserted by accident or mistake, may be eliminated by judicial construction; but this means only that, in construing one part of a written agreement, we cannot ignore another portion which has any bearing on the part under consideration, — not that where, as here, the portion ignored has no apparent bearing on the obligation set forth in the part sought to be enforced, the latter must fall because the former is not heeded.</p>
    <p id="b52-5" data-blocks='[["BL_52.6",52,[233,1178,1153,1242]]]'>Here, on the facts as pleaded, we cannot see that the words in the endorsement as to “transfer” have any bearing on those as to “guarantee,” or that they affect the question of the liability of the endorsers. The form used is no doubt intended for service where an owner of a nonnegotiable instrument wants to transfer it to a new holder for value, with a guarantee of payment, employing a single writing to accomplish both purposes (Southern L. &amp; S. Co. v. Baker, <a href="/pa/281/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="281 Pa. 587" data-case-ids="1087065" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0587-01">281 Pa. 587</a>, 592); and, so far as the present endorsers are concerned, it is probably a. case of indiscriminately taking the form in its entirety, where, in point of fact, the guarantee clause alone was desired for use. Of course, in saying this, we are indulging in surmise, suggested by the state of the record, which, when explained by an affidavit on the merits, or at trial (see Shaffstall v. McDaniel, <a href="/pa/152/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="152 Pa. 598" data-case-ids="838098" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0598-01">152 Pa. 598</a>, 601, 602; also revised order, Southern L. &amp; S.

L. 483) before considering the entry of final judgment.</p>
