The latter also claims that more than the $75,000 specified in the agreement was expended “for buildings and other improvements,” but, if so, the evidence in this case does not prove it. According to plaintiff’s testimony, the Rubber Company did not make the expenditures called for in the agreement, by the dates set forth in any of the respective installments : nevertheless, though knowing the work was still going on, as in fact it was for some seventeen months after April 1, 1921, and that the Akron Engineering Company, under its contract with the Rubber Company, was, during all that time, improving the property, plaintiff did not declare the “agreement null and void,” nor attempt to retake possession of the land and improvements.</p>
    <p id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[260,1231,1150,858]]]'>After the Rubber Company ceased to proceed with the work, defendant sued it and recovered the judgment for $7,230.21 above referred to, issued a fi. fa. thereon, had the property levied on and condemned, and followed this with a vend. ex. to have it sold. Not until after that occurred, did plaintiffs act. They then obtained from Mr. Thorne the character of certificate specified in the agreement; without notice to any party interested, they caused an amicable action and judgment in ejectment to be entered against the Rubber Company, and, by virtue of a writ of habere facias possessionem, obtained possession of the property. They then filed the bill in equity in this case, defendant answered, and the case was tried, resulting, as stated, in a decree perpetually enjoining it from selling the property under its judgment.</p>

L. 536, and April 22, 1850, P. L. 549. The court below refused to enjoin the sale, but we reversed because she had a clear title, devised to her by her mother, which could not be sold for her husband’s debts, since the above statutes expressly forbade it. We were careful to say, however (pages 196-7) : “It may and ought to be conceded, that it has been the constant practice in this Commonwealth, for a creditor to seize in execution any property which he may believe his debtor has an interest in, and sell it in satisfaction of his debt. It is an axiom of our law, that, in some form or other, all property of a debtor not expressly exempt, is liable to be taken in satisfaction of his debts. Upon this principle, wherever an interest is alleged, the execution is allowed to go, and the question of interest is afterwards tried on the title obtained at the sale......True, the practice does often put the real owner to the trouble and expense of defending against a title so obtained, and of showing that the debtor had no interest whatever in the property sold. The cloud upon his title is often doubtless an injury; but notwithstanding this, the doctrine that the creditor has a right to seize and sell <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>his debtor’s interest in property, whatever it may be, has been so firmly fixed, that the courts have not been armed with power to interfere in limine......With this practice it is not intended to interfere in this decision.”</p>

We reversed, and said Hunter’s App., supra, was so decided, because “there the exclusive ownership of Mrs. Hunter in her own right was not denied by plea, answer or demurrer,” and we added that “the jurisdiction given to a court of equity for the prevention or restraint of the commission of acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the rights of individuals, was never intended to be used to obstruct the collection of debts,......[to permit this, save in extraordinary cases] would lead to a constant use of the powers of equity to hinder and delay the collection of honest claims, and to prevent the creditor from reaching the marrow of a fraud.”</p>

Whenever such interest is alleged, the creditor is permitted to proceed with his execution ; and if there be any question in regard to title, it may be raised and determined afterwards in an action of ejectment.

In the instant case, since no such situation appears, the decree below was erroneous. True, the record does not disclose the expenditure of the $75,000 for the purpose stated, but even this defect may be cured at the ejectment trial, when, as quoted from Davis v. Michener, <a href="/pa/106/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="106 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="455549" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0395-01">supra,</a> “the whole field of inquiry will be open.” It may then be shown that the amount stated was in fact expended on the property “for buildings or other improvements,” not necessarily paid for by the Rubber Company, but expended by it and others under contract with it. At that time the certificate of Mr. Thorne will not be controlling as against defendant, or the purchaser at the sale, for, as already stated, the former had levied on and condemned the property before the certificate was given <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>and while the Rubber Company was still in possession.</p>
    <p id="b123-3" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[185,421,1159,2017]],["BL_124.1",124,[267,351,1149,430]]]'>Moreover, even if the proofs fail to show an expenditure of the $75,000 “for buildings or other improvements,” there will still remain a matter to be considered. While plaintiffs, under the agreement quoted, had the right to declare it null and void, if the expenditures were not made by the dates specified, they did not do this, but stood still, knowing the work was being carried forward by the Akron Engineering Company, defendants’assignor. This was, at least as to that company, a clear waiver of the provision making “time......of the essence of the agreement” (Welsh v. Dick, <a href="/pa/236/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="236 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="986613" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0155-01">236 Pa. 155</a>), and thus the matter stood when the property was levied on and condemned under defendant’s judgment. At that time the Rubber Company had an interest in the land, for no steps had been taken to dispossess it. It must not be forgotten, too, that the right to retake possession was for “any” failure, however trivial, to comply with the terms of the agreement “on or before the dates mentioned” in it. A right of forfeiture so based is highly penal in its nature (see Gross v. Exeter Machine Works, Inc., <a href="/pa/277/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="277 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1079554" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0363-01">277 Pa. 363</a>) and hence will not be enforced in a court of equity, —whose jurisdiction plaintiffs now invoke, — except upon equitable principles. Surely it needs no argument to show that, under the facts here appearing, it would be inequitable to permit them to summarily take and keep possession of improvements costing not less than $57,-416.62 of the $75,000 required to be expended; some of which were incurred by defendant, with plaintiff’s knowledge, after the time when, under the contract, they could have declared the forfeiture now relied on. It does not follow, however, that in granting equitable relief to defendant, inequity will be visited on plaintiffs. They may still be entitled to have the full amount of $75,000 expended for “buildings or other improvements,” within a reasonable time, which result may be secured by a conditional verdict, the ejectment by the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale being an equitable <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>one. We abstain, however, from a fuller consideration of the questions arising on this branch of the case, since the facts, as developed at the trial between plaintiffs and such purchaser, may be essentially different from those appearing in the present record; but we may add that plaintiffs will have an adequate remedy at law to bring that controversy to an early decision: Heller v. Fishman, <a href="/pa/278/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="278 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1080597" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0328-01">278 Pa. 328</a>.</p>
    <p id="b124-4" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[267,789,1148,156]]]'>The conclusion above stated obviates the necessity for considering the other defects alleged against plaintiffs’ right to the relief sought.</p>
    <p id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.6",124,[267,955,1149,101]]]'>The decree of the court below is reversed and the bill in equity is dismissed at the costs of appellees.</p>
