    <p id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.12",246,[275,998,1148,423]]]'>By this bill in equity the plaintiff railroad company sought to enjoin the collection of county taxes from a property owned and used by it in the City of Pittsburgh. The learned chancellor who heard the case decided that five-sixths of the value of the building is taxable and one-sixth thereof and the land upon which it stands are exempt. From this determination the railroad company prosecutes its appeal.</p>
    <p id="b246-6" data-blocks='[["BL_246.13",246,[271,1434,1151,971]],["BL_247.1",247,[160,345,1155,1575]]]'>The building was erected on land belonging to the railroad company already in use by it for tracks and platforms. The structure is seven stories high and is contiguous to a freight station of the company. The first floor is merely an extension of the floor of the freight station. The tracks which were on the land prior to the construction of the building are substantially as they were before, the building being erected above them; they pass under it to the freight station. The first story is used for ordinary freight station purposes and the upper ones are devoted by the railroad company to storing incoming freight. On arrival at Pittsburgh, cars are unloaded at the building and their contents placed in the space reserved for storage. The articles stored remain in the building for varying lengths of time to meet the convenience of the shipper, no limit as to the length of time during which they may remain being prescribed. Deliveries can be made from the building to <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>persons other than shippers or consignees who exhibit a proper order. The storage facilities are not extended to the public as a whole, but only to shippers and consignees of freight coming into Pittsburgh over plaintiff’s lines. The building was erected for the purpose of affording additional freight station space to the railroad company, because other railroad companies entering the city were furnishing to shippers the kind of storage service now furnished by plaintiff, and, as a result of which, a considerable amount of transportation business that otherwise would have gone to plaintiff, went to its competitors, and, because plaintiff had an inadequate supply of empty box cars for the shipment of goods from Pittsburgh to points off its own lines, it was thought by those charged with the management of the railroad that the furnishing of storage facilities would increase the volume of box-car traffic from off-line points, which would make available to plaintiff a larger number of empty box ears for outbound off-line freight. It is alleged by plaintiff that the latter was the primary purpose to be served in erecting the building and in making storage facilities available to patrons of the road. It is apparent that the expectation in this respect was justified by the event, as plaintiff since the completion of the building has had available for outbound traffic many hundreds of box cars more per year than before it was built. The value of the building has always been included in the plaintiff’s return to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for capital stock tax purposes.</p>

While appellant denominates the building, and the use to which that part of it is put which was held by the court below to be liable to taxation, a terminal facility, in reality it is a warehouse, used, it is true, only by inbound shippers over plaintiff’s line for that purpose, but by whomsoever used, the use is for the storage of goods, for which use charges are made and for the goods, not bills- of lading but warehouse receipts are issued, therefore, it must be held,to be what it is, a storage <em>warehouse; </em>and a storage warehouse of this character is not such a part of the railroad as to be exempt from local taxation.</p>

In this respect, we think appellant has conjured up a spectre much thinner than air. Means would unquestionably be found to collect the tax, if in a most unlikely event it should not be paid, which we are sure would not result in the dismemberment of the railroad. We have approved of the division of buildings belonging to charitable organizations and churches for taxation purposes, exempting <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>from taxation the space occupied for charitable and church purposes and taxing that portion from which revenue was derived: Board of Home Missions, etc., v. Phila., <a href="/pa/266/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="266 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1056046" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0405-01">266 Pa. 405</a>; Phila. v. Barber, <a href="/pa/160/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="160 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="852129" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0123-01">160 Pa. 123</a>. No reason is apparent to us why the same thing may not be done with the structure in question.</p>
