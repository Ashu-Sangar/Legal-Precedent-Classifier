        "text": "Opinion bt\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThe appeal is from a decree of an orphans\u2019 court awarding a life estate to the posthumous daughter of a child of the first life tenant.\nLydia Seidel Throm, the testatrix, a single woman, died November 1,1932. She was survived by her niece, Ruth Seidel Throm Detweiler, her sole next of kin. By her will dated January 29, 1931, testatrix placed her estate in trust to pay her niece, Ruth, the net income for life and upon her decease the income was further directed (\u2018to be distributed unto the children of the said Ruth Throm Detweiler, share and share alike, or their issue.\u201d The will further provided that upon the death of the children or issue of her niece, Ruth, the corpus was to be paid to a named orphans\u2019 home, a charitable institution.\nRuth, the niece and life tenant, survived testatrix and died December 17, 1942, leaving but one child, a son Charles. She died testate and also left a husband, her executor, the appellant herein. Charles died September 20,1952. The niece, Ruth, and her son, Charles, received the net income during their successive lives. When Charles died he left surviving a posthumous daughter, Charmaine, whose guardian ad litem is the appellee. The testamentary disposition of the corpus in remainder is conceded to be void because the will was not executed in accordance with the statute in effect at the time of her death. An intestacy resulted. The learned court below in prior adjudications correctly decided that Ruth, the niece, sole next of kin of testatrix, possessed a vested estate in remainder, subject, however, to the trust life estates. Charles, the son of the niece, the first life tenant, enjoyed a life estate after the death of his mother on December 17, 1942, until his own death on September 20, 1952 \u2014 a period of nearly ten years. The guardian of Charles\u2019s posthumous daughter, Charmaine, claims that his ward possesses a succeeding life estate in the trust res. It was so awarded by the Orphans\u2019 Court. The executor under the will of Ruth Seidel Throm Detweiler claims that Ruth possessed a vested remainder free of additional life estates and has appealed. The rights of the parties are determined by a construction of the words of the will reading \u201cto be distributed unto the children of the said [niece], share and share alike, or their issue.\u201d\nWe do not agree with the interpretation of the learned court below. The word \u201cissue\u201d cannot always be construed in a strict technical sense. Ex proprio vigore it indicates succession of descendants ad infinitum. When the word is used in this sense, ordinarily such gift is void because it is in violation of the rule against perpetuities: Lockhart\u2019s Estate, 306 Pa. 394, 159 A. 874; Friday\u2019s Estate, 313 Pa. 328, 170 A. 123. In Harrah Estate, 364 Pa. 451, 72 A. 2d 587, we adopted the doctrine of \u201cvertical separability\u201d. Where the term children or issue would have possibly included hypothetical individuals beyond the limits of the rule, gifts to children or issue otherwise valid within the rule are not thereby rendered invalid. The auditing judge applied this doctrine. He ruled that since the niece, the first life tenant, and her child, Charles, the succeeding life tenant, were both in being at the date of the death of testatrix, Charles\u2019s posthumous daughter took immediately upon her father\u2019s decease \u2014 a life in being \u2014 and therefore the gift was valid. The gift was not rendered invalid because Charles might have had other children born beyond the limits of the rule. Since Harrah Estate, supra, this principle has been applied, but it has no application in the present will construction.\nAs we construe the words \u201cto be distributed unto the children of the [niece], share and share alike, or their issue\u201d, they do not mean successive life estates to the niece\u2019s children followed by life estates to the issue of such children ad infinitum. It is impossible to distribute a fund \u201cshare and share alike\u201d among children and their issue. One\u2019s \u201cissue\u201d do not exist and cannot be ascertained until after a person dies. The true interpretation of such words obviously means a per capita distribution among children and a per stirpital distribution to the issue of any child or children who may have died in the parent\u2019s lifetime. The gift to \u201cissue\u201d of children is manifestly substitutionary in the event of the-death of such child before he would otherwise have taken. We have so decided when the gift is to a beneficiary \u201cand his issue\u201d: Lippincott Estate, 349 Pa. 538, 546, 37 A. 2d 599. The Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County , has also so decided when the gift is to a beneficiary- \u201cor' his issue\u201d-: Borden\u2019s Estate, 44 D. & C. 279 (Ladner, J., Auditing Judge); Fausten\u2019s Estate, 60 D. & C. 602; (Van Dusen, P. J., Auditing Judge). In both of the last named cases the opinion was written by Bolger, J. for a unanimous court.\nWe direct that the court below enter a definitive decree of distribution of the corpus in remainder of the trust estate to Charles W. Detweiler, Executor under the will of Ruth Seidel Throm Detweiler, deceased, in accordance with this opinion.\nDecree reversed. Costs to be paid out of the corpus of the trust estate.",
