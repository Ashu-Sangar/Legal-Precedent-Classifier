Bosler, died in 1916 leaving a will in which she gave her estate to her six children in equal shares. In the case, however, of three of them — two daughters and the petitioner — she created a trust as to a portion of their shares, leaving to each such daughter the income of a fund of $10,000 for life subject to a spendthrift trust, and to the petitioner the income of a fund of $20,000 for life, likewise subject to a spendthrift trust. Upon the death of each of these three children the principal was to go to his or'her issue; in default of issue then living-each child was to have a general power to appoint the <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>remainder by will; in default of both issue and the exercise of such general power of appointment the remainder was given to decedent’s other descendants then living.</p>
    <p id="b367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[193,578,1146,431]]]'>There was a clause in decedent’s will as follows: “I have made these three bequests in trust, not from any lack of confidence in or affection for my said two daughters and son, but in order that I may feel that I have made provision for them which will assure to each one of them a support throughout his or her whole life, under any circumstances, and for the comfort that I will personally derive from such knowledge.”</p>

He is 65 years of age. He seeks termination of the trust on the ground that he has never had any issue and is incapable of having any, and he contends that because of his general power of appointment coupled with his life interest he has what is tantamount to an estate in fee and is therefore the only person having an interest in the trust. He presented testimony to the effect that he is a civilian employee of the United States Navy earning between $150 and $160 per month, that by reason of his age he is likely soon to be retired with a probability of not being able then to obtain other employment, and that because, on the one hand, of the shrinkage in the returns from the investments in the trust fund and, on the other, of the rise in living costs, he faces the prospect of inability to support himself and his wife in any degree of comfort. The present annual income from the trust after payment of the trustee’s commission and the Pennsylvania Personal Property Tax is approximately $660.</p>

Obviously, however, it would be a matter of pure speculation as to whether — whatever the change of conditions since her death — she would now want part of the corpus of the trust turned over to the petitioner, involving, as it would, the pro tanto depletion of the fund from which the income was to be derived and with the future payments ordered out of corpus made available to the claims of creditors and assignees because not subject to the spendthrift trust provision. Since she must have realized that changes might occur both in the amount of the income from the trust and in the varying circumstances of petitioner’s life it would have been easy for her, had she so intended, to authorize the trustee in its discretion to advance portions of the corpus to petitioner if conditions at any time so dictated.</p>

Certainly there is no appellate authority which holds that a partial reduction in the income of a spendthrift trust constitutes such a failure of the purpose of the trust as to warrant its termination by judicial decree. The principle upon which the cases rest is the protection of the settlor irrespective of the welfare or interests of the beneficiary.

Spendthrift trusts can have no other justification than is to be found in considerations affecting the donor alone. They allow the donor to so control his bounty, through the creation of the trust, that it may be exempt from liability for the donee’s debts, not because the law is concerned to keep the donee from wasting it, but because it is concerned to protect the donor’s right of property. ... We repeat, spendthrift trusts are allowed not because the law concerns itself for the donee; he may conserve or dissipate as he pleases; the law’s only concern is to give effect to the will of the donor as he has expressed it.” So also <em>Heyl Estate, </em><a href="/pa/352/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="352 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="464078" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0407-01">352 Pa. 407</a>, 411, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.2d%20130" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="43 A.2d 130">43 A. 2d 130</a>, 131, 132; <em>Borsch Estate, </em><a href="/pa/362/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="362 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="477347" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0581-01">362 Pa. 581</a>, 587, 588, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="67 A.2d 119">67 A. 2d 119</a>, 122.</p>
