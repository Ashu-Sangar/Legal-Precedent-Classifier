At the conclusion of the plaintiff’s evidence, the defendant moved for a compulsory nonsuit which the trial judge granted and which the court en banc later refused to take off. Judgment was accordingly entered, and the plaintiff appealed. The pertinent facts are not in dispute.</p>

Jur., Libel and Slander, §3. See <em>Collins v.

However, truth of the matter, when pleaded and proven to the satisfaction of the jury, constitutes a defense. Section 2 of the Act of April 11, 1901, P. L. 74, 12 PS §1582, provides that “In all civil actions for libel, the plea of justification shall be accepted as an adequate and complete defense, when it is pleaded, and proved to the satisfaction of the jury, under the direction of the court as in other cases, that the publication is substantially true and is proper for public information or investigation, and has not been maliciously or negligently made.” In the Restatement, Torts, §5S2, it is said that “The truth of a defamatory statement of fact is a complete defense to an action for defamation.” See <em>Kilian v. Doubleday &amp; Co., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/367/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="367 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1228401" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0117-01">367 Pa. 117</a>, 123, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.2d%20657" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="79 A.2d 657">79 A. 2d 657</a>.

He was indicted, tried and <em>acquitted </em>of having set up and maintained gambling devices in violation of Section 605 of The Penal Code of 1939, P. L. 872, 18 PS §4605. At the trial of the present action, Schnabel freely admitted these facts and the trial court, in view of “these <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>admissions, and being convinced that plaintiff had not made out a case of invasion of privacy”, entered the compulsory nonsuit at the close of the plaintiff’s case as already stated. It is the refusal of the court en banc to take off the nonsuit which Schnabel assigns here for error.</p>
    <p id="b645-4" data-blocks='[["BL_645.4",645,[196,688,1149,210]]]'>The opinion of the learned court below, written by the trial judge, aptly summarized the plaintiff’s contentions with respect to the allegations of libel and adequately and correctly disposed of them as follows:</p>
    <p id="b645-5" data-blocks='[["BL_645.5",645,[194,917,1151,543]]]'>“Plaintiff apparently concedes [that truth is a defense to an action for defamation], but contends that it has no application, urging the Court to rule that the quoted reference to the plaintiff was not the whole truth in that it did not also refer to the acquittal of plaintiff in the criminal proceedings, and further that it should be a jury question as to whether or not, in the context of the whole article, there could be justifiably found a false imputation that plaintiff was a gambler or operated a gambling establishment.</p>
    <p id="b645-6" data-blocks='[["BL_645.6",645,[192,1479,1151,817]],["BL_646.1",646,[243,346,1158,476]]]'>“There is no merit to these contentions. The item does not charge plaintiff with setting up and maintaining gambling devices at which money was played for, (see Section 605 of The Penal Code of June <em>24, </em>1939, P. L. 872, 18 P.S. 4605), which is the offense for which plaintiff was indicted and acquitted, and therefore the failure to mention such acquittal does not detract in any way from the truthfulness of the story. Nor are we convinced that even by innuendo was plaintiff accused of any gambling activity other than that which might have been charged against him merely from the admitted fact of possession of slot machines under Section 603 of the Penal Code (18 P.S. 4603) : <em>Commonwealth v. Cancillieri, </em><a href="/pa-super/166/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="166 Pa. Super. 1" data-case-ids="468748" data-case-paths="/pa-super/166/0001-01">166 Pa.

The acquittal of plaintiff under Section 605, possibly <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>because of lack of proof of actual play on tbe machines for money, in no way derogates against the truth of a totally separate charge which might have been brought against him under Section 603. Under the Cancillieri case, he could have been found guilty of violation of the latter section merely on proof of possession of the machines alone, the intent to use them for gambling purposes being inferred from the inherent nature thereof.</p>
    <p id="b646-5" data-blocks='[["BL_646.4",646,[241,844,1158,594]]]'>“Innuendo cannot be used to enlarge the natural meaning of the words used. The quoted portion of the article referring to plaintiff, even considered in the context of the whole story concerning slot machines, could not have the effect of imputing anything to plaintiff except that which was admittedly true. The tidal judge properly determined that question and, therefore, since the article fairly and reasonably could not be construed to have the meaning imputed by plaintiff, the case should not have gone to the jury: <em>Sarkees v. Warner-West Corporation, </em><a href="/pa/349/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="349 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="459115" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0365-01">349 Pa, 365</a>-368.”</p>

Although the plaintiff cites no decision of either of our appellate courts which recognizes the. existence in Pennsylvania of the right of privacy, he asserts that such a right does exist on the basis of a concurring opinion by. the late Chief Justice MAXEY i . <em>Waring v. WDAS Broadcasting Station, Inc., <a href="/pa/327/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="327 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1176736" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0433-01">327 Pa. </a></em><a href="/pa/327/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="327 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1176736" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0433-01">433</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.%20631" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="194 A. 631">194 A. 631</a>, and the decisions in <em>Leverton v.

(C.A. 3); C<em>layman v. Bernstein, </em>38 D. &amp; C. 543; and <em>Harlow v. Buno Co., Inc., </em>36 D. &amp; C. 101. Assuming, without deciding, that such a right does exist in Pennsylvania, the appellant has not brought himself within the op<a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>eration of the rules governing the right of privacy where such right has been judicially recognized.</p>
    <p id="b647-4" data-blocks='[["BL_647.4",647,[189,469,1150,1036]]]'>The appellant would hardly assert that, at the time the slot machines were found on his property, it was an unreasonable interference with his privacy to disclose that fact to the various news-dispersing media. It is beyond question that, at the time, his activities were a legitimate matter for public inquiry — and that is so whether the appellant came willingly or unwillingly into public notice. Nor is the mere lapse of time between the date of the seizure of the slot machines on the appellant’s property and the date of the republication of that fact determinative, per se, of the question whether the appellant had so far “reverted to the lawful and unexciting life led by the great bulk of the community” as not to be any longer a proper subject of public interest. The result in each case depends upon a balancing of the conflicting interests,-— the interest of a person not to have his privacy invaded, on the one hand, and, on the other, the legitimate interest of the public to be informed.</p>
    <p id="b647-5" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[185,1518,1153,819]],["BL_648.1",648,[224,355,1160,1090]]]'>In the present instance, the defendant publisher printed a newspaper story which described police efforts to eradicate gambling activities in counties adjacent to Bucks and, in the course of the article, made reference to the fact that it had been six months since slot machines had been exposed in Bucks County when they had been found on the appellant’s property. The newspaper story was comparing conditions in the various counties and, therefore, legitimately referred to the conditions in Bucks County. By his possession of the slot machines, the appellant relinquished his asserted right to be let alone; and, the passage of the six-month interval did not wipe away the notoriety occasioned by his possession of the machines. In <em>Sidis v. F-R Pub. Corporation, </em><a href="/f2d/113/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="113 F.2d 806" data-case-ids="1023570" data-case-paths="/f2d/113/0806-01">113 F. 2d 806</a> (C.A. 2), for example, <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>recovery was denied where a famed child prodigy was the subject of a biographical sketch in a national magazine many years after he had purposely sought anonymity. Of. also <em>Leverton v. Curtis Pub. Co., </em>supra, at p. 977. The present appellant’s privacy was not invaded. Moreover, as noted in Comment d, §867, Restatement, Torts, “. . . liability exists only if the defendant’s conduct was such that he should have realized that it would be offensive to persons of ordinary sensibilities. It is only where the intrusion has gone beyond the limits of decency that liability accrues. These limits are exceeded where intimate details of the life of one who has never manifested a desire to have publicity are exposed to the public, or where photographs of a person in an embarrassing pose are surreptitiously taken and published.” In publishing a fact already known to the public, and which had obvious relevance to the printed story at hand, the defendant publisher cannot be said to have exceeded the limits of decency.</p>
