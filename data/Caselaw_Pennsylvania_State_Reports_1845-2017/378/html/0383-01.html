Accordingly* the sheriff having made his return showing his inability to make service in accord* <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>anee with subsections (a) and (b) of Rule 2180 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, plaintiff petitioned the court to authorize service upon defendant by registered mail directed to the Secretary of the Commonwealth and to the corporation at its last registered office or principal place of business as provided by subsection (c) of said Rule. The court made an order directing that such service be made, which was accordingly done, and the court therefore properly overruled defendant’s objection that “no legal, proper, or sufficient service of the complaint or writ has been made on the corporation in accordance with law, and therefore this court is without jurisdiction over the defendant to proceed with this cause of action.”</p>
