    <p id="b636-8" data-blocks='[["BL_636.10",636,[271,1376,1156,929]]]'>The issues raised have been thoroughly litigated below and there now remains but the single question whether the appropriations were made under the Capitol Park Extension Act of June 3, 1943, P. L. 818, or under the State Highway Law of June 1, 1945, P. L. 1242, as implemented by The Third Class City Code of June 28, 1951,. P. L. 662. Upon the answer to that question depends whether- the. properties .were taken not later than January 29, 1945, in an exercise of the power of the Department of Property .and Supplies under the Capitol Park Extension Act or.on July 16, 1952, the date of the Governors approval of the Highway Department’s plan' for the widening of Forster Street as filed, and recorded in. the Highway Department. The relative significance of the two dates lies in the fact that the fair market value of the properties was admittedly higher at the later date. ■</p>

      <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>The question was raised in the court below on exceptions by the Department of Property and Supplies and by the City of Harrisburg to the several reports of the Board of Viewers on the respective properties involved. In their reports, the Viewers concluded as a matter of law that the Department of Property and Supplies had not condemned the properties under the provisions of the Capitol Park Extension Act of 1943; that the Department of Highways of the Commonwealth had condemned them, under the provisions of the Highway Law of 1945 on July 16, 1952, the date the Governor approved the plans for the widening of Forster Street; and that the City of Harrisburg, by virtue of the Highway Law and the Third Class City Code, became liable for the payment of all damages incident to the widening of Forster Street.</p>
    <p id="b637-4" data-blocks='[["BL_637.4",637,[166,1250,1152,753]]]'>The Viewers accordingly made awards of damages to the several property owners from which neither the Commonwealth nor the City of Harrisburg ever appealed. These awards, by lapse of time without appeal therefrom, have long since become final as liabilities of the City of Harrisburg. The Department of Property and Supplies and the City have contented themselves with their appeals to this court from the orders of the court below dismissing the exceptions to the Viewers’ reports. It would be pointless now to consider what the situation of the appellants might have been, in the light of the final awards, had we found that their exceptions to the Viewers’ reports were well taken.</p>

Such a conclusion would also require us to hold that the provisions of the State Highway Law and the Third Class City Code relating to the assessment of damages by viewers are inapplicable. ‘ This we feelwe have' no right to do. On the contrary, our conclusion is that there- was no taking on January '29, i945, as contended by -the Commonwealth, and that therefore §208 of the State Highway Law is applicable, and thé timé of taking must be determined under the provisions of this latter statute. ‘</blockquote>

L. 3242, 36 PS Pkt. Parts 670-101 et seq.
