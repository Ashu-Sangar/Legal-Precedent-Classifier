Testator’s son claims that he is immediately entitled to 4/7ths of the remainder of the estate on the ingenious theory that since it is impossible for him to have children or issue, there was an intestacy as to these remainder interests and since he is the testator’s sole heir, his life estate merged or coalesced with the remainder. There are many reasons why this appeal must fail, several of which we shall discuss.</p>

The trustee in bankruptcy sold at public auction all the right, title and interest of the bankrupt under the will of his father, Samuel Dickson, including his life estate in (one-half of) the net income therefrom. This interest was purchased by Henry S. Drinker, Jr., individually, and also for and on behalf of the law firm of Drinker, <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>Biddle &amp; Reath. Mr. Drinker and Drinker, Biddle &amp; Reatli thereupon created an irrevocable trust to which they transferred, assigned and delivered to the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company all of the aforesaid right, title and interest which Drinker had purchased at the bankruptcy sale. This trust provided, inter alia, that the trustee should hold the said estate in trust to pay the net income quarterly to Arthur G. Dickson for his life, and upon his death to convey, assign, transfer and pay over all property then held by the trustee to his wife. Mr. Dickson’s wife is now deceased. The trust deed also contained the usual spendthrift trust provisions. It is obvious that this inter vivos trust with its spendthrift trust provisions is not the same as the life estate created for Arthur G. Dickson in the will of his father.</p>
    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[253,1228,1156,588]]]'>In order to create an intestacy, Dickson contends that it is impossible for him to have any children and he offered to prove by expert medical testimony that such was the fact. An intestacy is, of course, an important and absolutely indispensible link in the chain of his argument, because his father’s will gave the remainder interest not to Arthur but to Arthur’s surviving children and issue (of deceased children), with a contingent gift over, upon failure of such children and issue, to the nieces of testator’s late wife <em>living at testator’s death.</em>
