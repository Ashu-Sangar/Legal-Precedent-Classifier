The natural panoramic sweep of one’s eyes is bound to encompass many objects, but it can scarcely be said, without some evidence to fortify the assumption, that that look was larcenous. The Judge misstated the evidence when he said that Frank said the trespasser fumbled around the bureau. The error, of course, was unintentional. The Judge did not at the moment recall just what the witness had said, and so indicated. However, the Judge’s saying that he wasn’t certain did not save the situation. This was the basis of the whole case of burglary. It was his duty to be certain on a matter which was the bedrock foundation of the entire prosecution.</p>

Later on in his charge he said: “Consider the fact that he, according to the testimony of the son, Frank Marks, <em>fumbled around </em>or looked on the bureau in the boy’s bedroom. What was his purpose in doing that? <em>You might well find from that evidence, </em>in my opinion, <em>that this intruder had the intent to commit a felony, to wit; the crime of </em>larceny.”</p>

But, again, the Judge did not stop here. He persisted in his error and almost made a fetish of it. In the very next paragraph of the charge he said: “Of course, that matter is entirely for you. I am not telling you what your verdict should be, but it is my opinion that you <em>could find such an intent from those circumstances, </em>together with all the other circumstances in the case.”</p>
    <p id="b384-6" data-blocks='[["BL_384.6",384,[249,2146,1156,152]]]'>This instruction was egregiously wrong. You cannot find an intent from something that is a vaporous nothing.</p>

Of course, he did not have an opportunity to review the notes of testimony before he sentenced the defendant because obviously they could not have been transcribed on the same day the trial ended: In point of fact, the notes of testimony were not filed until February 25, 1953, 26 days after the termination of the trial. We do not know whether the Trial Judge ever looked at the notes of testimony but we do know that at the hearing on the petition for writ of habeas corpus, the defendant remembered the testimony of Frank Marks much more clearly than-the Judge. He definitely recalled that Frank Marks had actually only said that the intruder “looked ón ; a bureau?’ When Garrison emphasized that “That is the ' only' evidencé,”' the Judge remonstrated: “Yoú - aré jumping : -all over ' the- place.

In the <em>Ellis </em>case the evidence established that one night at 1:30 a.m. the defendant broke a window and forced himself into the home of the complaining witness, Mrs. Bessie Charland. She ordered him to leave but he refused to do so. When later she called the police he departed. He was charged with burglary. In the lower court it was argued by the Commonwealth that since the defendant was an unwanted guest in the house at the time indicated he could only have been there for the purpose of committing a felony, namely, rape. The defendant was convicted. This Court reversed the conviction which, incidentally, had been affirmed by the Superior Court, and said: “The record contains no evidence of an intention to commit any felonious act against the person or property of Mrs. Charland. It is true that intent may be inferred from actions as well as words. These actions, however, must bear a reasonable relation to the commission of the felony. The record discloses no overt act sufficiently proximate to the alleged intended crime which may properly be said to be one of the natural series of acts required for the commission of the crime. The verdict is one which under the evidence could only have been reached by, and <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>based upon, conjecture and surmise rather than permissible inferences from evidence adduced.”</p>

There is evidence in the record that he was intoxicated that night and if he entered the house it is quite probable he did so as the result of alcoholic irresponsibility. He was certainly a trespasser and he broke a window, offenses for which he could be punished, but to convict him of the crime of burglary in the absence of evidence that he was intending to commit a felony is to play at ducks and drakes with the law.</p>

Certainly if a defendant has an attorney to advise him of his rights to an appeal and the defendant refuses to avail himself of appellate relief, a writ of habeas corpus can be denied in the absence of proof that he has discovered additional evidence not available to him at the trial. But where one is indigent, where the Court-appointed lawyer leaves him on his own immediately after the verdict, and where the Judge imposes a sentence before he can have opportunity to study the transcript of the testimony to ascertain if he has made an error, it is clear that the writ of habeas corpus is not only proper but the only means left to the defendant to obtain the justice so far denied him.</p>

We have pointed out how the Trial Judge incorrectly stated that the defendant fumbled around the bureau. The District Attorney goes further and improves on the Trial Judge’s vivid imagination. In Ms printed brief submitted to this Court he asserts that the defendant “searched the top of the bedroom bureau.” There is not the slightest whisper of a suggestion in the whole 134 pages of the record that the defendant searched the top of the bureau, that he searched any part of the bureau, or that <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>he searched anywhere or anything in any part of the house.</p>

I am convinced that his misstatement sprang from the seed of an ardent partisanship, that it grew in the soil of a fervent loyalty to the home Court, that it was watered by a boundless determination to win the case, that it was cultivated in the sun of a prosecutor’s zeal, and that it finally flourished in the assumption that the defendant was not of sufficient importance to warrant a meticulous adherence to the official transcript. But no person who comes into court, regardless of rags, record, or repute, can be deprived of a fair trial, a deliberative adjudication, and a reflective judgment. Milton Garrison may have been the most worthless person in the community, but the agencies of government should be the last to push him down into an even lower stratum of respected society.
