February 4, 1954, wMch approved the proposed merger of Fidelity-PhiladelpMa Trust Company (which has its main office and six branch offices in Philadelphia) with the First National Bank of Chester (which has a main and two branch offices in) Delaware County.

L. 72.’ The distinction t3ius made has been reiterated and reinforced in a multitude of subsequent cases holding that where a statute expressly provides that there shall be no appeal the scope of appellate review is limited to the question of jurisdiction and the regularity of the proceedings; the merits of the controversy cannot be considered: even'though the interpretation given to the facts or the law by the governmental agency or the court below may have been erroneous. It is only where the statute is . silent on the question of appeal that a review-by .certiorari' may be had ‘in the broadest sense’ and the court may consider the <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>record, including the testimony, to determine whether the findings are supported by competent evidence and to correct any conclusions of law erroneously made.”</p>

On this question the parties diametrically differ.</p>

We therefore agree with appellant that the prohibition of review applies only to the question of removal of an officer, employe or director under §501B.</p>

This is a non sequitur. Moreover, this section has no application to the case of a merger, the effect of which is to establish a branch office or branch bank. Where no branch bank is involved the law makes no provision for reference of the proposed merger to the Banking Board.

In an exceptionally short Per Curiam opinion, this Court there held that an appeal should be quashed where the Board of Finance and Revenue refused a petition for refund of inheritance taxes paid by an executor, for the reason that an appeal from the action of this administrative body does not lie unless expressly authorized by statute. The Fiscal Code of April 9, 1929, gave the Board authority to hear and determine petitions for refund of transfer inheritance <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>tax and provided, inter alia, that “the action of the Board on such petitions shall be final.” This Court said that in refusing the petition “we are unable to say the Board abused its discretion.” If narrow certiorari did not lie in such a case there would seem to be no point in the Court’s statement that it was unable to say the Board abused its discretion.

In that case a bill in equity was brought to restrain the Board from certifying the valuation of all taxable real property in a certain township because the determined value was grossly excessive. The Court below correctly held that a bill in equity would not lie; that the déterminations of the Board are used solely for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the state subsidy for each school district and had no bearing whatever on local taxes; that the Board was not obliged to hear testimony or divulge the basis of its findings; and finally, that “A bill in equity may not be used as a substitute for an appeal in order to circumvent the legislative prohibition [against review].” This was clearly not appealable for the additional reasons set forth in <em>Newport Township School District v.

The way to maintain one’s jurisdiction in full vigor and integrity is to respect that of another.</p>
    <p id="b364-4" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[246,637,1156,1093]]]'>The discussion in the majority opinion as to the relative scope of review upon a broad or a narrow certiorari is wholly irrelevant to the question of appealability of an order of the Banking Board. The inquiry here is not how one gets into court for the review of such an order, but whether he gets there at all. Insofar as the cases cited in the majority opinion involved appellate review on certiorari, they were concerned with judgments, orders or decrees of judicial or quasi-judicial bodies where, of course, certiorari by this court lies. Even in respect of such judicial bodies, when an appeal is statutorily denied, a review by this court on certiorari is narrowly limited to questions of jurisdiction and regularity of the proceedings. How, then, can the majority, aside from the error of allowing an appeal from the administrative order of the Banking Board, say that “certiorari lies in its broadest sense” in the present instance? It is simply not possible to overestimate the harm that will ensue from this court’s allowance of an appeal in this case.</p>

In the present instance, the appellant has neither a substantial nor a direct interest in the Banking Board’s order. All that concerns it is a speculative fear of loss based upon an assumption of harmful competition from the merged bank. Such conjectural interest, even if well-founded, would not give the appellant standing to appeal in any circumstances.</p>
