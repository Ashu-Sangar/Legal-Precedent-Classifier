We note that defendants could not use, under Machikas’ agreement with Peters, the name “Majestic Restaurant”; and the question arises whether “Majestic Grille” is, under the facts in this case, so similar as reasonably likely to confuse or deceive prospective customers or otherwise harm the plaintiff.</p>

Defendant, Machikas, was asked the following questions: “Q. Why did you change the name from Betsy Ross to Majestic Grille? A. Well, the reason why, because that fellow, you know, he make the place a wreck out of it and I put my name on it, Majestic, because people know me over there for thirty years. That is why. . . . Q. Why didn’t you call it the Majestic Restaurant instead of the Majestic Grille? A. Well, I talked with my partner and we say we put <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>Majestic Grille. Q. Why did you say Grille? You always used the word restaurant. . . . Q. Didn’t you use Majestic Restaurant all the time since you were in business? Isn’t that what you said? A. I was interested with Majestic because every place I was I call it Majestic. Q. But you called it Majestic Restaurant, didn’t you, all the time? A. That’s right. Q. Why did you change it suddenly to Majestic Grille in August or September of 1952? A. Also I got the sign up there. I <em>put restaurant, too. </em>Q. All right. Why did you register as Majestic Grille instead of Majestic Restaurant? BY THE COURT: Q. Can you tell us why you preferred to use the name grille instead of restaurant? A. As <em>long as I put the </em>Majestic— Q. What? A. <em>I don’t think it was different. . . . </em>Q. But why didn’t you use restaurant? You have got a restaurant there; isn’t that so? Why didn’t you use Majestic Restaurant? A. <em>Well, on the sign up there it says restaurant, </em>and then the window it says Majestic Grille. Q. You got a big neon sign in the window saying Majestic Grille? A. That’s right. BY THE COURT: Q. <em>But you have another sign on the premises which says Majestic Restaurant? </em>A. <em>That’s right. . . </em>.”</p>
    <p id="b89-4" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[168,1619,1154,644]]]'>It is clear from defendant’s own testimony that the 12 inch-high word “Majestic” is the key word he was interested in and wanted; and that he didn’t think the word “Grille” was different from “Restaurant”; and that he used the sign “Majestic Restaurant” in his window. How, in view of that testimony, is it possible to defend defendants’ change of name from “Betsy Ross” to “Majestic Grille” or “Majestic Restaurant”, or to find that Machikas did not intend to break his agreement Avith plaintiff, or did not intend to injure plaintiff, or to divert plaintiff’s business to the defendants.</p>

      <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>While the Chancellor did not consider the evidence was sufficient to establish confusion among customers and tradespeople between plaintiff’s restaurant and defendants’ restaurant, credible witnesses did testify that bills for food delivered to defendants were erroneously sent to plaintiff; that people telephoned plaintiff asking whether this was defendants’ “Majestic Restaurant”; that food was delivered to plaintiff that was intended to be delivered to defendants; and that the Bureau of Assistance called several times to check on employment involving persons employed or seeking employment at defendants’ “Majestic Restaurant”. All of this occurred within the period of two months prior to this suit. Considering the difficulty of proving confusion (and loss of trade, as to which there was inadequate evidence) we consider this testimony was both important and adequate.</p>
