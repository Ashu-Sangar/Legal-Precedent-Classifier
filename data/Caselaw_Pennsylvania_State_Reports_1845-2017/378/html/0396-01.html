The appellant, William W. Dickinson, and twelve other shareholders personally attended the meeting, expressed their dissatisfaction with the merger and voted against it. Within thirty days from the time of the agreement and after due notice had been given to the defendant, the appellant and the other dissenting shareholders filed a petition with the court of common pleas to have their stock appraised, pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 336 of the Act of May <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>17, 1921, P. L. 682, 40 PS §459. An answer was filed to the petition by the defendant wherein it contended (1) that inadequate notice was given by the petitioners and (2) that there was no necessity for the appointment of appraisers because the defendant stood ready and willing to pay the petitioners the full market value of their stock, determined by transactions on the New York Curb Exchange and on the over-the-counter market, as of the date of the adoption of the agreement.</p>

It is the price which an article will bring when offered for sale in the market.’ ” [Quoting Words and Phrases, first series, volume 5, page 4383]. In <em>Kountz v.

Ordinarily, when an article of sale is in the market, and has a market value, there is no difference between its value and the market price, and the law adopts the latter as the proper evidence of the value. This is not, however, because value and price are really convertible terms, but only because they are ordinarily so in a fair market. . Clearly the Legislature could only have intended what is ordinarily understood by market value when it employed the words in this section. Stock may have several values, a market value, a book value, a speculative value or an actual value, but where the Legislature has clearly made market value the measure of valuation we may not engraft upon the words a strained or assumed construction. Where a market exists uninfluenced by artificial factors,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and a statute expressly uses the words “market value”, the market value governs rather than a speculative value obtained by estimating the value of the several properties and rights of the corporation: See 13 Am.

He relies principally on the case of <em>Barnett v.

The distinction between that case and the instant one is that the petitioner in the <em>Barnett </em>case resorted to a court of equity for relief instead of pursuing the remedy provided by statute. We disagree with the appellant that this is a distinction without a difference. The statutory light of appraisal provided by the In<a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>surance Company Law of 1921 is not the shareholder’s exclusive remedy; he has recourse to a legal or equitable action at his election. In the <em>Barnett </em>case, supra, this Court did not construe the term “full market value” under Section 5 of the Act of May 29, 1901, P. L. 349. It was merely held that “. . . A dissatisfied stockholder voting against consolidation effected under the act of 1901 ‘may’ have his damages and the value of his stock ascertained and payment of the same secured in the mode pointed out in that act, but this remedy is not his only one. He may adopt it if he prefers it to that which these appellees adopted; but he is not required to do so. .

The lower court overruled this contention and appointed appraisers who rejected the valuation of $71 per share and fixed it at $78 per share. The defendant corporation filed an exception to this finding of the appraisers which was dismissed, so that the defendant corporation was a losing party in the court below, and it took no appeal to this Court.
