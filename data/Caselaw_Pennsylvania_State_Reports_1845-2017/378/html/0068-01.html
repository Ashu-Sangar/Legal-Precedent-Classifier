    <p id="b102-4" data-blocks='[["BL_102.4",102,[251,636,1164,1429]]]'>On December 19, 1949, plaintiff was employed at a service station which since 1941 had been operated by defendant’s lessees, Hart &amp; Eiseman, under a lease with defendant. Lessees wished to decorate the premises and especially a light on top of a 12 foot high steel pole. The pole was erected on a concrete island in the driveway between three gasoline pumps which were also on this tiny island. Steel flanges were welded on the bottom of the pole; the bottom of the pole was then affixed to these metal flanges which in turn were bolted to the concrete island; then a small cap or bell-shaped housing was placed over the bottom of the pole, which covered up the flanges and the bolts. A light to illuminate the gas pumps was placed on top of the pole. This pole had been there for 15 years and plaintiff and his employers daily worked around it and often leaned against it. Prior to the accident, no one had ever seen anything the matter with the pole; after the accident, the pole was found to be badly rusted on the inside and this created a dangerous condition. No outside or reasonable inspection would have disclosed this rusted or dangerous condition, but it could have been discovered only by lifting the small cap or bell-shaped housing which covered the bottom of the pole as well as the flanges and the bolts, and then tapping the pole with a hammer.</p>
    <p id="b102-5" data-blocks='[["BL_102.5",102,[247,2078,1156,264]],["BL_103.1",103,[185,343,1150,934]]]'>Lessees, under the terms of this lease, agreed to repair and maintain the premises and to save the lessor harmless “from any liability by reason of any personal injuries to any person on or about the said premises and the lessees further agree that they will assume all <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>liability and damages which may arise from any damages that may occur either on or in front of said premises.” Nevertheless, plaintiff sued the lessor and not the lessees, and proved that defendant from time to time had voluntarily entered upon the premises and repaired damaged pumps and equipment and painted the inside and outside of the station as well as the pole. However, it is important to note that no evidence was produced by plaintiff to show that any repairs were ever made by defendant to the pole;, the most defendant did was to have the pole painted several times, including one time three months prior to the accident. Plaintiff proved by a so-called practical expert witness that such a steel pole is likely to oxidize and rust on the inside, and may last 3 years or 75 years, depending upon the kind of steel, the climate, and atmospheric conditions.</p>

The trouble with plaintiff’s case is that defendant never made or undertook to make or was obligated to make repairs to the steel pole — at best for plaintiff. all defendant did was to paint the pole. Moreover, the rust' on the inside of the pole and its consequent dangerous, condition could not have been observed by any inspection from the outside, or by any kind of inspection except that detailed above. Under these facts, plaintiff has not brought himself within the above principle of law and the Court below correctly entered a judgment non. obstante . veredicto.</p>

Could there be any question of the liability of the defendant in such a case?</p>

    <p id="b104-6" data-blocks='[["BL_104.7",104,[229,1063,1160,934]]]'>During the many years that Hart and Eiseman operated the gasoline service station, the defendant landlord had often voluntarily made repairs to the station, by fixing the roof, painting the pumps and the station both inside and out. The pole involved in this litigation had been painted only three months prior to the mishap which became the basis for the lawsuit. Following the accident, it was discovered that the pole in question was badly rusted and at the breaking point had deteriorated to paper thinness. One of the plaintiff witnesses testified that as far back as 1941 he had worked on this pole and that while employed by the defendant company it was his job “to maintain and repair anything owned or leased to Hart Eiseman by the Sterling Oil Division.” This would include “pumps, poles, tanks, building, air compressor, water pump, hoist, oil dispensing equipment.”</p>

Thus, although there was no obligation on the part of the defendant here to guarantee the solidity of the pole which brought the plain<a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>tiff to grief, there was certainly a moral and legal responsibility on its part not to proclaim that it was a good, reliable pole when the slightest investigation or inspection would have revealed a contrary condition.</p>

Dust to dust applies to telegraph poles, electric light poles, barber poles and gasoline stations, as well as to human beings. The defendant simply had no right to say to the world: <em>This is a </em>good, <em>strong pole, </em>when, through its agents and employes, it knew that the pole had been subjected to the freezing weather of twenty winters and the blistering heat of twenty summers, as well as the little fortuitous bumps, shoves and pushes of careless motorists and workers, which, through the years could amount to the cumulative battering strength of a sledge hammer blow.</p>

A person is charged with ordinary knowledge of the workings of these forces, and his conduct, if it is to escape being stigmatized as wanting in care, must conform to the normal workings of the forces of nature. . .</p>

Therefore, he must so build and maintain his dam as to withstand the water’s pressure.

No superficial covering can keep out the burrowing termites that work their way into the deepest texture of the most solid timber.

In affirming the verdict the plaintiff obtained in the court below, Judge Gunther, speaking for the Superior Court, said: “The carpenter performed work in and about the area complained of in such manner as to hold out to the tenant that the whole dangerous area had been repaired. The gist of appellant’s negligence is that the insufficient repairs gave a deceptive appearance of safety and thereby led the tenant and her guests to use the floor in a way which, but for the repairs, they would recognize to be dangerous . . . Although it does not appear that appellant or his workman expressly told the tenant that the floor was fully repaired, such was the clear implication which the jury was warranted in finding from the fact that the carpenter came for that very purpose, worked for several hours in and about the dangerous area, and finally announced that he was finished. Mrs. Terrell was warranted, as the jury found, in relying thereafter on the safety of the floor she naturally assumed had been fully repaired.”</p>
