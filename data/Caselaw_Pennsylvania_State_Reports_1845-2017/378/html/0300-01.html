Five years later the Legisla<a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>ture of Pennsylvania enacted a law, Section 3 of which reads: “Every person now or hereafter employed by the said cities, as herein provided, if any, of the age of sixty years and upwards, who shall have been so employed for a period of twenty years or more, shall, upon application to the board of pensions herein created, be retired from service, and shall during the remainder of his or her life receive the pension or compensation fixed by this act...” (Sec. 3, Act of Assembly, May 28, 1915, P.

He was then only 33 years of age. Employment in private industry could have brought him a higher rate of pay with even possibly better opportunities for promotion, but against those attractions government service offered a more certain tenure and, with this pension law, an assured annuity in the future. Hickey could even build upon the prospect of obtaining, when he had reached his sixtieth year, another job, compensation from which, added to the guaranteed pension, would make for a comfortable living in his later years. With this long-ranged plan of his life ahead of him he agreed to remain 20 years with the City and pay certain sums into the Pension Fund.</p>

L. 191, (16 PS 326) prohibiting such double pensions. We ruled that the Act of 1937 which was passed after <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>Baker became a County employe, could not affect his already vested right to the County Pension: “When the legislation in question was passed, [The Act of 1937,] appellee already had been a member of, and had contributed to, the County retirement fund for approximately nine years. He made these contributions on the basis of the existing rules, regulations and provisions for eligibility for retirement allowance. As of the time he joined the fund, his right to continued membership therein, under the same rules and regulations existing at the time of his employment, was complete and vested. The legislature could not thereafter constitutionally alter the provisions of his already existing contract of membership.”</p>

His pension was as assured (upon his attaining 60 years of age) as if the Pension Board had already placed the pension installments in a safety deposit box and had given him the key to the lock which would open to that key each month, once the intervening time limitation had expired. This right became private property belonging to Hickey, and the Legislature could not under any circumstances demand from Hickey surrender of the key to the deposit vault.</p>

The concept of pensions has come down through the centuries wearing a cloak of monarchical dispensation. Kings conferred pensions on court favorites, artists and military heroes with a flourish which proclaimed <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>that the royal treasury was as inexhaustible as the crown’s power was unlimited. However, despite ceremony and pronunciamento, the pensioner obtained no vested right to the proclaimed pension. In fact, he could not be any more assured of a continuation of the pension than he could be assured that his head would remain on his shoulders if he should displease his absolutist benefactor. But the pension of today is not a grant of the Republic nor in this case is it a gift of the City Fathers. It is the product of mutual promises between the pensioning authority and the pensioner; it is the result of contributions into a fund which exists for the single purpose of pensions. Adhering to the theory that pensioners are in the nature of glorified petitioners for public largesse, the appellees call to our attention general statements in the law books which undoubtedly originated in the era of imperial and kingly sway. For instance, counsel for the appellees quote: “The unquestioned rule is that a pension granted by the public authorities is not a contractual obligation, but a gratuitous allowance, in the continuance of which the pensioner has no vested right; and that a pension is accordingly terminable at the will of the grantor.” (54 A.L.R.

Hickey agreed to work for the City 20 years and to pay certain sums into the Pension Fund. He has fulfilled those conditions. The City agreed, in its turn, to pay Hickey a pension or <em>compensation </em>for the remainder of his life when he reached his 60th year. Shutting off the pension because he obtained employment elsewhere is refusal on the part of the Pension Fund to abide by its contract. If this contract had been entered into between a private <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>individual and a private corporation it is unquestioned that the Legislature could not impose an additional condition for its fulfillment.

Thus, counsel for the Pension Board say: “A person who receives public money every month under a municipal retirement system should not receive additional public monies as an active employee of the county in which the city of which he is a pensioner is situated.” But a contractor who constructs a public office building in one city and a public swimming pool in another city also receives public monies from two governmental agencies, but this fact does not lessen the legality or right of his claim. He is rendering two services. Appellee’s counsel further argue: “It is quite clear that the same tax payers who maintain the retirement pay would also pay the salary of subsequent employment of the pensioner. That this is not consistent with public policy and the spirit of pension systems is also quite evident.”</p>

The service is required and the salary is paid regardless of identity of the payee. It is a mere coincidence that the man who is receiving a city pension after 36 years faithful City service and the man who works for the County, again giving faithful, competent service happens to be the same man. He is. like the contractor who built the office building and the swimming pool. He is entitled to remuneration for both jobs.</p>

      <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>The interdiction in the Act of 1933 is not so much a suspension of pension rights as it is a restriction on the right of employment. The Act says in effect that Hickey will receive what he is entitled to receive and what he has paid for, provided he does not work for Allegheny County. But the Legislature has no right to say this. It can no more bar Hickey from working for the County than it can bar him from working for the United States Steel Company, or from running a grocery store, or from taking a trip to Europe, or running for political office.</p>
