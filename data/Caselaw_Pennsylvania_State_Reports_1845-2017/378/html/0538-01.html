A legislative body may, in a statute or ordinance, furnish its own definitions of words and phrases used therein in order to guide and direct judicial determination of the intendments of the legislation although such definitions may be different from ordinary usage; it may create its own dictionary to be applied to the particular law or ordinance in question. It was entirely competent, therefore, for the ordinance to include professions in its definition of “businesses” in order to explain the coverage it intended by its use of the latter term. In <em>National Biscuit Co. v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/374/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="374 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="1241450" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0604-01">374 Pa. 604</a>, 609, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.2d%20182" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="98 A.2d 182">98 A. 2d 182</a>, 185, it was stated, concerning this same ordinance, that while, ordinarily, mercantile license taxes have been imposed only upon merchants, there was neither law nor reason why a tax, even though so designated, could not be extended to persons otherwise engaged, and it was pointed out that the Acts of May 23, 1949, P. L. 1669, and May 10, 1951, P. L. 265, were in fact almost as broad as this ordinance and defined the word “business” in nearly the same language; also that the Pittsburgh Mercantile License Tax which was the subject of discussion in <em>Federal Drug Co. v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/358/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="358 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="8845730" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0454-01">358 Pa. 454</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.2d%20849" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="57 A.2d 849">57 A. 2d 849</a>, imposed liability upon persons engaged in many non-mercantile operations. In fact, the appellants in the <em>national Biscuit Co. </em>case included insurance agents and brokers, and we held that they were liable for the tax under this ordinance. Nor may it be amiss to add that, in a <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>broader sense, a professional man “sells” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> his services for a financial consideration just as a business man sells his merchandise, although his activities are attended, in the case of the lawyer or doctor, with a certain measure of idealistic and altruistic motivations which do not necessarily pertain to the market place.</p>
    <p id="b575-3" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[161,675,1154,1487]]]'>Plaintiff suggests that what the ordinance contemplated in regard to those engaged in professional activities was that the tax should apply, not to income derived from services rendered, but merely to receipts from sales transactions, if any, incidental to the practice of their professions, — in other words, not to their professional but to their non-professional activities. In support of that proposition plaintiff points to such cases as <em>Commonwealth v.

In all those cases, however, the tax was levied under statutes which expressly imposed it only on vendors of, or dealers in, goods, wares and merchandise, and not, as in the present case, also upon those <em>engaged in professions, occupations and vocations </em>or rendering <em>service. </em>The cases thus relied upon by plaintiff are, therefore, not at all in point.</p>

      <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>We are, then, clearly of opinion that the ordinance here in question was intended to include those engaged in professions — and therefore lawyers — in its coverage.</p>
    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[255,563,1155,208]]]'>2. This brings us to the second question: Is the ordinance, when so construed, unconstitutional as an infringement upon the independence of the judicial branch of government?</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[248,784,1161,1541]],["BL_577.1",577,[177,350,1153,1658]],["BL_578.1",578,[239,348,1156,1100]]]'>Two propositions bearing upon that question are self-evident. One is that the privilege of practicing law carries with it no exemption from the duties of citizenship, including the sharing with all others the expense of government, national, state and municipal; lawyers pay federal income taxes, state personal property taxes, municipal real estate and net profits taxes the same as all other persons. The other proposition is that lawyers are officers of the courts and it is solely from the courts that they derive the authority to practice their profession; the legislative branch of government, whether state or municipal, can neither grant nor revoke such authority, nor prescribe or in any manner interfere with their functions and activities, nor regulate the conduct of their practice. If, therefore, the present ordinance involved any encroachment upon the judiciary it would represent but a vain attempt on the part of the municipal authorities to exercise a power which they do not possess; <em>(Hoopes v. Bradshaw, </em><a href="/citations/?q=231%20Pa.%20435" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="231 Pa. 435">231 Pa. 435</a>, 487, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.%201098" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="80 A. 1098">80 A. 1098</a>, 1099.). The question, therefore, is whether the tas which it imposes does constitute any such encroachment upon, or interference with the judiciary thereby violating the constitutional separation of power among the three branches of government. In deciding that question we must be careful not to be misled merely by inept terminology. Thus the ordinance requires the payment, of a fee of JS3.0Q. for procuring a “mercantile <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>license.” Taken literally, the word “license” would connote the granting of a permission, and, since a mercantile license tax is on the privilege of doing business,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> it might offhand appear that the obtaining of a license is made a prerequisite or condition for the right of the taxpayer — in this case the lawyer — to continue in the practice of his business or profession. But nothing could be further from the truth, for it is too clear for discussion, and indeed we have definitely held, that the charge of $3.00 is not in fact a “license fee” but a registration charge, — a mere procedural device to establish the identity of those who, by reason of their occupations, are subject to the tax, the $3.00 being merely to cover the clerical expense of the registration and issuance of the license certificate: <em>Armour &amp; Co. v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/363/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="363 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1221636" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0109-01">363 Pa. 109</a>, 112, 113, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.2d%20405" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="69 A.2d 405">69 A. 2d 405</a>, 407; <em>National Biscuit Co. v.

It need scarcely be said that an attorney at law requires no license, other than from the courts, to practice his profession; indeed merchants also, for that matter, have the legal right to conduct their business operations without license by governmental authority save only in the case of certain special businesses which, because of their nature, are subject to the police power, as, for example, the sale of liquor. But the important and indeed the controlling point here is that <em>a lawyer’s right to engage in, or continue to engage in, the practice of his profession is not conditioned upon his procuring the so-called, license or </em>
      <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>
      <em>paying the tax imposed by the ordinance, nor is it in any manner regulated or affected thereby; </em>if lie fails or refuses to carry out any of the duties imposed upon him therein the only penalty is that which applies ordinarily to all other tax measures, namely, an entry of judgment and execution against his property, fine and possibly imprisonment for making false or fraudulent statements on a return or wilful default in filing one. In short, the ordinance is purely a revenue measure; it does not interfere with, or seek to exercise any power or authority over, the rights and obligations of the lawyer as an officer of the court or in the pursuance generally of his professional practice; in those respects it nowise differs from all the other taxes which lawyers now pay in common with their fellow citizens. And it may well be asked, What is the practical difference between a revenue tax on income or gross receipts, admittedly valid, and a revenue tax on a privilege measured by that same income or gross receipts?</p>

Jur. pp. 268, 269; §12; McQuillin, Municipal Corporations, (3rd ed.) volume 9, p. 293, §26.130. In the United States Supreme Court as early as the case of <em>Royall v. Virginia, </em><a href="/us/116/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="116 U.S. 572" data-case-ids="3517616" data-case-paths="/us/116/0572-01">116 U. S. 572</a> (1886), a license tax on a lawyer was held to be an occupation tax for which the so-called license was “merely a receipt and not an authority,”— nothing more than a mere form of imposing a tax for revenue and not an exaction for purposes of regulation. The court there said: “In the case of Humphreys v. The City of Norfolk, supra, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, referring to the previous case of Ould v. City of Richmond, said: ‘The objection was made in that case that a power to license involves in its exercise the power to prohibit without such license; and that such power vested in a municipal corporation is incompatible with the rights of attorneys conferred by their general license to practice in any and every part of the State. This objection did not prevail. Judge Anderson, upon this point, speaking for the entire court, conceded that the city authorities could not prohibit attorneys at law, already licensed, from practicing their profession within the city limits. The exercise of the vocation was, however, a civil right and privilege, to which are attached valuable immunities and pecuniary advantages, and is a fair subject of taxation by the State and by municipal corporations. . . . ‘The principles settled by that case/ continued the court, ‘are decisive of this. In neither case is the attempt made to prohibit the exercise of the business or vocation. The license required by the corpora <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>tion is merely a mode of assessing tlie tax; if it be reasonable and just, it matters but little by what name it is called.’ ”</p>

The view originally prevailed that such tax was an unconstitutional encroachment upon the independence of the state government and an interference Avith its capacity to perform its functions. But in <em>Graves v. New York ex rel.

The maxim that everyone is supposed to know the law is a statement of towering fantasy because it purports to say that everyone knows <em>all </em>the law, including all court decisions, statutes, ordinances and the limitless expanse of rules and regulations promulgated under such decisions, decrees, statutes and ordinances. Counting the leaves of the trees of the forests on the North American continent would be a simple task in comparison to reading and digesting what is contained in all the pages of all the multitudinous books of the law. It is because the founders of our Commonwealth were aware of the vertiginous celerity with which laws are enacted that they declared, through the organic law of the State, that each law, as it comes off the assembly lines of the legislative and executive machine, must carry a designation and a name so that those to be affected thereby will at once be warned of its applicability to them.

But this Court said that food did <em>not </em>include drink: “The first question before us is whether that section can be sustained as to drink, under the constitutional requirement that the subject of the act shall be clearly expressed in the title.

It says, in effect: “The word ‘business’ is in the title; business is said to include profession; the practise of the law is certainly a profession. Therefore, the practise of the law is a business, and all practitioners of law must obtain a mercantile license.” This argument is calculated to lead one persuasively along a track of reasoning until, before one can be made aware, he is led into forbidden territory. In 1872 our State Legislature passed an Act, the title of which authorized the Union Passenger Railway “to lay additional tracks of railway.” Under the color of this title, the railway company proceeded to lay tracks in territory into which it had no right to go, but this Court halted the transgression: “To lay additional tracks on an existing railway is a different thing from, extending the railway itself into new territory not before authorized to be used. The difference in purpose is so palpable, and the difference in consequences so grave, the mind cannot hesitate a moment in the conclusion that the language which authorizes the former only cannot mean to sanction the latter. To confound these two is to open the door to fraud, and to enable men, expert in the use of phrases, to steal away the rights of the people; and this it was a purpose of the <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>amendment to prevent. Then, clearly, a reader of this title alone would be led to conclude that the purpose of the supplement was to enable a single-track railway company, as this company was, merely to lay down additional tracks along its line of railway. The language is not that of extension of its line into new places, but of addition to that which it had already.” <em>Union Passenger Railway Company’s Appeal, </em><a href="/citations/?q=81%20Pa.%2091" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="81 Pa. 91">81</a><a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">*</a><a href="/citations/?q=81%20Pa.%2091" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="81 Pa. 91"> Pa. 91</a>, 94.</p>

In that case a pharmacist who sold bottled drugs which he had himself compounded argued that the Emergency Sales Act of 1932 levied upon “sales of tangible personal property” did not apply to his product because the practise of pharmacy was a “profession” rather than a “business.” The President Judge rejected this argument: “Those words are popular rather than ‘legal’ terms. A minister’s sermon, or a brief prepared by a lawyer, or a physical examination of a patient by a physician, is not the subject of a sale, but a bottle of <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>medicine is.

For a lawyer to display such a license would be to declare falsely to the world that he was engaging in a mercantile activity. The fact that the posting feature of the Ordinance has reportedly now been repealed does not alter the significance of its inclusion in the first place because it reveals that Council, at the time of passage of the measure, was thinking in terms of stores, warehouses, market stalls, factories, mills — and not lawyer’s offices. At the oral argument before this Court, counsel for the City presented a photostatic copy of an Ordinance (Bill 35) which states that Section 2 of the Ordinance of December 9, 1952, has been amended by “removing the requirement for the posting of licenses.” But Section 9 of the Ordinance remains intact, and it still carries a penalty for failing to post the notice! Assuming, however, that the repeal of the posting feature has been duly effectuated, the taxpayer is still required to obtain the license and he must have it on hand to display to every city official and inspector who demands to examine it. It may be in the long run, if inspection runs riot, that the lawyer may find it more practical to have the license conspicuously framed and conspicuously hung in his office, thus avoiding the necessity of having to remove it from his files for examination each time the whimsy of an inspector or city official dictates inspection of it. The displaying of the license may also serve to smother unjust suspicion that the lawyer has not paid the mercantile.tax.</p>
