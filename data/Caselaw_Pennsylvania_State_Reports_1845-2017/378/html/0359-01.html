Shumaker, District Attorney of Butler County, and W. P. Geary, District Attorney of Clarion County, five persons individually and as officers of the Allegheny County Sportsmen’s League, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, and by that corporation, against the New York &amp; Pennsylvania Company, Inc., and R. M. Jones, its manager, together with five individuals averred in the bill to be members of the Sanitary Water Board. The complaint sought to restrain as a public nuisance the alleged pollution of the Clarion River by the corporate defendant, and was brought under the provisions of Section 601 of the Pure Streams Act of June 22, 1937, P. L. 1987, 35 PS §691.1 et seq.</p>
    <p id="b393-6" data-blocks='[["BL_393.8",393,[192,1511,1147,709]]]'>Preliminary objections were filed to the bill and the corporate defendant also filed a petition under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, challenging the court’s jurisdiction of the subject matter. The court held it was without jurisdiction, but on appeal to this Court (<a href="/pa/367/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="367 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1228277" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0040-01">367 Pa. 40</a>) we reversed a,nd remitted with procedendo. Argument on the preliminary objections was then heard by the lower court, one of which was that the Allegheny County Sportsmen’s League and its officers were improperly joined as parties to the complaint. On October 8, 1951 the court sustained this objection and ordered that the Sportsmen’s League and its officers be dismissed as parties plaintiff.</p>

On July 23, 1952 the defendants filed a petition for a rule to show cause why Mr. Sherman and his two associates, William D. Henning, Esquire and Francis X.

The warrant of attorney given by Clyde S. Shumaker, District Attorney of Butler County, is as follows: “I, Clyde S.

McCulloch, attorneys of the City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, to represent me <em>in the above capacity </em>as attorneys in the above entitled case; the said Francis X.

Geary, District Attorney of Clarion County, was identical but bore the date October 5, 1949. The warrants given by Clark H. Painter and Merle E. Wiser who succeeded Messrs. Shumaker and Geary as District Attorneys of Butler and Clarion Counties respectively, were undated, identical and purported to authorize Messrs. Sherman, Henning and McCulloch to continue to perform such duties in the equity proceeding as had been performed in the past for his predecessor . . <em>in like manner, and under the same </em>arrangements.”, and granted all powers necessary “. . . <em>to prosecute, settle and discontinue, compromise and to do any and all things that I am empowered </em>to do <em>by reason of my office as District Attorney </em>.. .”. (Emphasis supplied). The answer of the three attorneys stated that by reason of these warrants they were counsel for the District Attorneys and alleged that the petitioner had been apprised at the argument on the preliminary objections that respondents were authorized to act for the two District Attorneys. The petitioners’ allegation that neither of the District Attorneys was authorized to appoint a private attorney to represent him in litigation in which he was acting in an official capacity was denied. All of the other allegations of the petition, including particularly those stating that the respondents had not been and could not be appointed assistants to the District Attorney of Clarion County or Butler County under the applicable laws of this Commonwealth, and that they were not authorized to practice in either county, were admitted.</p>

      <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>Under New Matter it was alleged that the defendants’ petition had been filed after unreasonable delay and not in good faith. Defendants filed a reply to this New Matter, averring that the petition was filed in the week immediately following the first action taken by Messrs. Sherman, McCulloch and Henning after the Allegheny County Sportsmen’s League had been dismissed as a party plaintiff, i.e., the letter to Judge Neely under date of July 16, 1952 asking that the case be set down for hearing. In this respect the reply admitted that at all times since the filing of tiie bill, all steps in the prosecution of the case had been taken by and on the initiative of the respondent attorneys, but pointed out that because of the fact that these persons did represent the Allegheny County Sportsmen’s League, which a,t such times was still a party plaintiff in this proceeding, no objection could have been raised by the defendants to this procedure. The defendants’ reply also averred that it was not until after July 16, 1952, the date of the first affirmative step in the prosecution of this case after the District Attorneys of Clarion and Butler Counties had become the only parties plaintiff, that the question of representation by the attorneys for the Sportsmen’s League of these public officials could have been properly raised.</p>

The court sustained the exceptions, granted the motion to strike off and ordered and directed “. . . that the instant action shall not be further prosecuted by the remaining plaintiffs unless it is actively and personally directed and conducted by the present district attorneys of Butler and Clarion counties or their successors in office.”.

An examination of the record and the various papers filed seems to clearly disclose that all aggressive action taken to date in and out of court other than the execution and filing of the complaint has been taken by and on behalf of the Sportsmen’s League and not by or on behalf of the District Attorneys. Such examination will likewise show that the Sportsmen’s League exhausted every means possible to remain a party plaintiff, even to an appeal to the Supreme Court. Had the District Attorneys shown any real interest in the case such efforts would have been unnecessary. In addition, the papers executed by the present District Attorneys are undated and it is not unreasonable to conclude that they were signed solely as a result of the rule to show cause. It must necessarily follow that the respondents had no so-called warrants of attorney between the date of the bringing of the action and the time of the filing of the petition for the rule. The former District Attorneys had ceased to hold office at the time the rule was granted. The original papers gave the respondents ‘complete power to prosecute, negotiate, settle and superintend’ the action, while the second set of papers given by the District Attorneys who succeeded the original two District Attorneys provided that they should ‘continue to perform such duties in the above-entitled matter as in the past they have performed’ for the former District Attorneys ‘in like manner, and <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>under the same arrangements’, and they were given power to ‘prosecute, settle and discontinue, compromise, and to do any and all things that I am empowered to do by reason of my office as District Attorney’ in this case. This is a strange and unusual delegation of power by elected officials and we find indicates a complete surrender or abdication of power on the part of these public officials so far as this particular case is concerned. Our conclusion is that it indicates an intention to turn over the name of District Attorney to the private attorneys, the respondents, for use of the Sportsmen’s League, which is no longer a party in the case. This cannot be done.”.</p>

Sherman, Henning and McCulloch assert that they are also attorneys for the district attorneys. They admit that they were at no time appointed assistant district attorneys and that they could not have been so appointed under any authorizing statute. They rely solely upon the warrants of attorney ill-advisedly and improperly executed by the district attorneys. These warrants constitute a complete abdication of the duties, powers and responsibilities attached to the latters’ offices, a total abandonment and surrender to private counsel of the discretion and judgment vested in them as public officials in a matter affecting the general public. In this case the interest of the Commonwealth as a whole as well as the interest of the residents of Clarion and Butler Counties is involved.

Nor do we hold that a district attorney in a prosecution or proceeding brought in the interest of all members of the public alike may not obtain the advice and assistance of private counsel under exceptional conditions requiring additional professional skill and knowledge, if the latter’s compensation is provided .for and his participation is in subservience to the district attorney’s discretion, judgment and control of the litigation.

However, conclusive against the contention is that neither consent nor acquiescence could breathe life into an act by the public officials here involved which was entirely devoid of legal sanction. There was no authority in the district attorneys to delegate all of their powers, duties and responsibilities to private counsel whether such delegation was informally or formally accomplished. In this latter regard the warrants of attorney were merely evidential of such unlawful delegation, so that whether such warrants were timely demanded under the Act of April 14, 1834, P.

The same argument was unsuccessfully made in the <em>Minerd </em>case: “It is argued that the special attorney thus appointed holds an office. We think this by no means follows. He is just what the act says he is, a special attorney ‘retained and employed’ by the Attorney General to represent the Commonwealth in the particular matter or matters just as the Attorney General may retain and employ special attorneys to represent the Commonwealth in other special situations Avhen in his judgment it is proper to do so.

Superior Ct. 107</a>, the District Attorney of Dauphin County petitioned the Court of Quarter Sessions for the appointment of additional district attorneys to assist him in the investigation and trials of certain cases. The assistants were appointed and their appointments challenged. The Superior Court held: “Assuming these assistants to the district attorney were but officers de <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>facto and not de jure, they were discharging their duties on behalf of the public under an appointment, which, if irregular, gave them color of title and therefore they were not mere volunteers.

Furthermore, the three attorneys here have not actually been made assistant district attorneys. They are only special counsel for the two district attorneys in one special case.</p>

L. 1278, 16 P.S. §1 et seq., for the purpose of showing that Messrs.

But, as I have already stated, these three lawyers are not assistant district attorneys in the technical sense of men appointed by the District Attorney to assist him in <em>all </em>his functions as a district attorney. Secondly, these three lawyers have not asked for, nor are they to receive any compensation for the services they will voluntarily offer to the two counties. It is not an anomaly (and certainly it is most gratifying) that there are people who are willing to offer their services to the government content only with the compensation of having done a patriotic duty.

This Court held that the appointment was legal and proper: “The services to be rendered were not general in relief of the county solicitor, but <em>special in connection with specific projects, </em>these being, all matters connected with proposed alterations and additions to the courthouse, the bonding of the county to provide the funds necessary to make them, and in all the legal incidents thereof, also as special associate counsel in connection with a proposed bond issue of the county, which the record shows was in excess of $4,000,000, for the purpose of providing improved highways within the county, part of which it was necessary to authorize by popular vote, and in all matters of a legal nature incident to or arising out of the creation of this indebtedness and the purposes thereof.”</p>

Does the decision today of the Majority of this Court cast a mist of inconclusiveness over all jury verdicts, all jail sentences imposed and fines collected under the cross-suit system?

The lower court declared that: “The instant action shall not be further prosecuted by the remaining plaintiffs unless it is actively and personally directed and conducted by the present district attorneys of Butler and Clarion counties or their successors in office.” It may be that the District Attorneys of Butler and Clarion Counties are too busy with the normal functions of their offices in the detection and prosecution of crime to take up this additional burden of a civil case which requires the amassing of data, the gathering of evidence not from one county but many counties, the summoning of witnesses, many days of court trial in a county not that of the involved district attorney. It may be that the district attorneys believe themselves lacking in the technical knowledge and training necessary adequately to prepare and try the issues raised by the pleadings. It may be that since more than their respective counties are involved, the district attorneys may have difficulty in correlating their respective official participation and that therefore the services of attorneys not bound to geographical limits of either county are imperative.</p>
