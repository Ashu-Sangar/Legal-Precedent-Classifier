If the testimony supports such findings, his discretion will not be disturbed. And if the testimony so taken de novo is <em>undisputed, </em>but there are submitted to him extenuating facts and circumstances, such as, inter alia, inadvertence, emergency, unintentional or accidental violations, including, among other reasons, economic hardship, if adequately supported by the testimony, the exercise of the hearing judge’s discretion will not be <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>disturbed.. .. ‘. . . the action of the lower court will not be disturbed on appeal except for manifest abuse of discretion.’ . . . The learned court below set aside the suspension of the operator’s license and restored same <em>solely </em>upon the ground of economic hardship. The court said in its order: ‘[It] would work an undue hardship upon the defendant and his family, in that he is a steel worker with no other practical means of obtaining transportation to this employment and that in his spare time and in that in his off hours he aids his father-in-law in his delivery service, the appeal of the defendant is allowed and the suspension of his operator’s license is set aside and the same restored to him.’ This constitutes a manifest abuse of discretion by the hearing judge. Every time a person is convicted of a crime and is sentenced to prison, he and his family doubtless suffer an economic loss. But this constitutes no excuse for defendant’s wrongdoing. . . . Economic hardship standing alone is insufficient to excuse such a violation.”</p>

      <em>65 </em>miles an hour at a place where, as in all the cases hereinabove mentioned, the maximum speed limit was 50 miles per hour. His place of employment was 48 miles away from his home.

In this case the defendant was an automobile repair man. The owner of an automobile told him that his car shimmied at 70 miles per hour, so defendant took the car out to test it. It was daylight and the highway was dry. He was clocked on Route 422, a three lane highway, at <em>70 to 90 </em>miles per hour through light traffic. <em>He also drove through a S5 mile per hour zone at 55 miles an hour. </em>Defendant admitted that he drove at a speed of 65 miles per hour. He had a wife and two children and, as in most of these cases, he had never been arrested before. Unlike the defendants in a number of the cases herein-above cited, this defendant obviously could still work as a mechanic in the garage even though he could not test cars during the suspension of his license. The Secretary suspended his license for 90 days. Defendant contended that the speed laws should not apply to a mechanic who is testing a car for shimmying at 70 miles per hour, although neither he nor the majority of this Court can point to any such express or implied exception in the statute, and this Court has no right or power to rewrite an Act of the Legislature.</p>

A tester who drives 90 miles an hour can Mil people just as easily as any other operator who drives 90 miles an hour. What is the use of the daily pleas and warnings by municipal, state and federal authorities and by newspapers and radios to drive carefully and obey the speed laws? What is the use of all of the hue and cry about the scores of thousands who are injured or ldlled on our highways by recMess driving or speeding, if the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is going to let off a man (1) who drives 55 miles per hour through a 35 miles per hour speed zone, and then (2) wilfully and flagrantly violates our speed laws by driving <em>through traffic at 70 to 90 miles per </em>hour?

If no findings had been made it would be at most harmless error, because defendant’s admissions made a suspension of his license imperative!

In this case we have the defendant traveling at a speed <em>over fifty-five miles in a thirty-five speed zone </em>and traveling <em>seventy to ninety </em>miles<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">*</a> per hour on a highway where the legal speed limit is fifty miles per hour.

The net result is a contrariety of rulings throughout the lower Courts of this Commonwealth and a multiplicity of appeals to this Court. I agree with the Secretary of Revenue and the Attorney General and trial Judges that in order to obtain consistent, as well as just decisions in this class of case and to avoid the confusion which prevails throughout the Commonwealth on this subject, this Court should give the lower Courts some additional standards to guide them. In any event, the action of the majority of this Court in reversing the order of the Court below, which, suspended this defendant’s license, is in my opinion absolutely unjustifiable; and I would therefore affirm the- order of the Court below.</p>
