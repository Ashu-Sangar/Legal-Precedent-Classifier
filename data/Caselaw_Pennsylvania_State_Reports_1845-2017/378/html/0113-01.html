Baldesberger, claims that by virtue of the will of his deceased father he is the owner in fee simple of a certain portion of a farm property which his father had owned, but plaintiff’s sister, Carrie Baldesberger, one of the defendants, claims that that will gave her a life estate in the property.</p>

By his will, written in 1909, he bequeathed and devised to his wife, for her life, all of his personal property and the use of all of his real estate. He owned a farm situate in Upper St. Clair Township, Allegheny County, containing 53 acres, 37 of which lay on the northwest side of a public highway and contained no buildings or improvements and the remaining 16 acres lay on the southeast side of the highway and contained the farmhouse, barn, and other outbuildings. He devised the 37 acre portion of the property, after the death of his wife, to all his children to be equally divided between them. There is no present controversy in regard to <em>that </em>devise.</p>

At that time, of the eleven children one had died and all the others had married except plaintiff and his sister Carrie; Walter married in 1939. Carrie, who is a school teacher, had left the family home on the farm in 1925 and had then purchased a lot in Carrick (now a part of the City of Pittsburgh) and built thereon a house for herself in which she has lived continuously to the present time. She registered there for the purpose of voting, voted in the elections held in that municipality and never in the township where the farm was located, and never went back to the farm except for occasional visits over week-ends and during vacation periods. Walter has continued to live upon and operate the farm.</p>

The question submitted to the jury was whether Carrie Baldesberger had abandoned or forfeited her interest in the fifth paragraph of her father’s will. The verdict of the jury was that she <em>had </em>abandoned her rights therein. The court, however, thereupon held that by that paragraph she was <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>devised a life estate which she could not lose by abandonment, and therefore the court entered judgment for defendants. Exceptions to this action of the court having been dismissed by the court en banc, plaintiff appeals.</p>
    <p id="b149-3" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[146,625,1154,596]]]'>Defendant’s contention is that her father’s will gave her an unconditional life estate, and, if that were so, plaintiff admits that such an estate could not be lost or forfeited by abandonment. It is plaintiff’s position, however, that defendant obtained under the will merely an incorporeal right or privilege to use the property for her home, and, if that were so, defendant admits that such a right <em>could </em>be abandoned. The controlling question in the case, therefore, is the nature and extent of the interest which defendant acquired by the fifth paragraph of her father’s will.</p>
    <p id="b149-4" data-blocks='[["BL_149.5",149,[145,1234,1155,1094]],["BL_150.1",150,[270,343,1161,1759]]]'>It is our opinion that that interest was not a life estate but merely an incorporeal right or privilege. The testator’s will is couched in technical legal language. It devised his real estate to his wife for life and devised the portion of the farm in question, after the death of his wife, to plaintiff in fee simple. As far as the other children were concerned, there is no such language employed, but merely a direction that that portion of his farm and the buildings thereon, with the farm implements, stock and furniture, was “to be kept as a home” for those children who might remain single and he speaks later of the children “for whom said home is provided.” This is not the case, therefore, of a devise of an estate in property followed by an explanation of the testator’s purpose in making the devise; obviously such an explanation would not have the effect of limiting the devise itself.' Here, on the contrary, -there is merely a provision that the property “be kept as a home,” — the grant of a privilege to occupy the property as a home, nothing more. It was <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>clearly the testator’s intention that plaintiff should succeed to the complete ownership of this portion of the farm in subordination only to one other intention, namely, that the property was to be available to any or all of testator’s unmarried children so long, but only so long, as they might desire to make it their home. Certainly he did not intend that the farmhouse might remain vacant, possibly for the life span of a child of 50, 60 or 70 years during which time none of the children, even though unmarried, resided or wished to reside there. It is also to be borne in mind, and the testator must be presumed to have known, that a life estate may be conveyed to a stranger, and that it is subject to encumbrance and sale on execution to a stranger; indeed the defendant apparently recognizes that if she does have a life estate she can lease the property to some other person, because she has in fact brought a suit to recover rent from the plaintiff who occupies the farm. Defendant actually contends that she is not obliged to use the property for a home at any time whatever during her life and that the will did not provide that an unmarried child would forfeit his or her interest if he or she permanently abandoned the property or chose never to live there in the first place, but it is inconceivable that the testator intended to give her, or any of his children who remained single, a freehold estate which could defeat (and, if defendant’s position is sustained, would in the present case defeat) his express purpose in providing that the property should be kept as a home, that being clearly his only reason for deferring plaintiff’s accession to the ownership.</p>

Row, </em><a href="/pa/9/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="960770" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0072-01">9 Pa. 72</a>, where there was a grant in fee but a reservation to the grantor’s father and mother during their lives of the possession of the land “as a home or residence for them,” it was held that the father and mother had no estate which they could assign to a stranger but only a right to occupy the land as a home. The court said that “It was clearly the intention of the parties to the deed, to provide a comfortable home for their aged parents during their joint lives, provided they made the property a permanent home or residence.” In <em>Calhoun v. Jester, </em><a href="/pa/11/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="404680" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0474-01">11 Pa. 474</a>, where there was a devise of a plantation but with a provision that the testator’s son, John, should have the privilege of living on the place during his life, it was held that this gave John, not an estate, but a license. The court said that “Had he taken an estate, it would have been liable to judgment and execution by his creditors — the very thing, perhaps, which the testator designed to prevent.” In <em>Kearns v. Kearns, </em><a href="/pa/107/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="107 Pa. 575" data-case-ids="8858756" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0575-01">107 Pa. 575</a>, where there was a devise to the testator’s wife of any part of his dwelling house which she might desire to occupy during her life, for her use and the use of their two daughters so long as they remained unmarried, it was held that the daughters had merely a right of occupancy which ceased with their mother’s death. The court said that “The evident intention of the devise was that the daughters who remained single should make it their home with their mother during the continuance of her estate. The estate was not given directly to the daughters. It was given to the mother.” In <em>Shipley’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/45/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="45 Pa. Super. 570" data-case-ids="419303" data-case-paths="/pa-super/45/0570-01">45 Pa. Superior Ct. 570</a>, where there was a direction by the testator that his sister should have the right to retain the use of a house as a family residence as long as she might wish to do so, it was held that the sister took merely a personal license or privilege to occupy the <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>house and not a life estate. The court said that “It is . . . clear that there was no intention to incumber the right or privilege thus conferred upon her with any of the incidental obligations that would attach to or flow from the creation of a life estate in her favor.” In <em>Sinnott’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/53/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="53 Pa. Super. 383" data-case-ids="435132" data-case-paths="/pa-super/53/0383-01">53 Pa.

Dracourt, </em><a href="/watts/3/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Watts 240" data-case-ids="1841321" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0240-01">3 Watts 240</a>, there was a devise of a house with a reservation of two of the rooms for the use of the devisee’s mother <em>during her life; </em>the testator stated that his desire in reserving the rooms for her was that she should be sure of a shelter or home during the time she might have to live. It was held that she received a life estate and not a mere personal privilege. However it is clear that there the mother was expressly given an unconditional life interest in the property and the testator merely made an explanatory statement as to his purpose in making the gift, namely, that she should be sure of a home. In <em>Wilson v. McKeehan, </em><a href="/pa/53/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="53 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="1004753" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0079-01">53 Pa. 79</a>, there was a devise to the testator’s wife and children of all the proceeds of his farm during her life, she to have the privilege of living with the family in the dwelling house as long as she lived. It was properly held that the grant of the proceeds of the farm was a devise of the property itself and therefore conferred a life estate; the privilege of living with the family was merely a superfluous additional grant. In <em>Bell v. Fulton, </em><a href="/sadler/1/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Sadler 200" data-case-ids="235986" data-case-paths="/sadler/1/0200-01">1 Sadler 200</a>, there was a devise of the testator’s farm and furniture for the use of his family, “to be joint or common property,” the profits therefrom to be considered as the property of the family jointly or of so many of them as might remain in a family ca-<a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>parity; there was an express provision that if any of the testator’s daughters withdrew from the family other provision was to be made for her. It was held that of the “joint or common property” each child received an undivided interest in the farm for life. Here there was a clear devise of the property to the children, their interests to terminate on their withdrawal from the family. In <em>McCalla’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/16/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="16 Pa. Super. 202" data-case-ids="832648" data-case-paths="/pa-super/16/0202-01">16 Pa. Superior Ct. 202</a>, the testatrix left her property for a home to a wife and husband during their lives. It was held that they were not obliged to occupy the property as a home. Here life estates were clearly given by express grant; the words “for a home” were merely, as the court said, the expression by testatrix of the purpose “for which she recommended and desired the property to be used, or explanatory of her bounty.” In <em>Cheroka v. Tobolski, </em><a href="/pa-super/151/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="151 Pa. Super. 238" data-case-ids="1047360" data-case-paths="/pa-super/151/0238-01">151 Pa.

And since, as thus decided, her interest in the property ceased upon her abandonment of it as a home, such abandonment had the same effect under the testator’s will as if she had married or died, and, since all the other surviving children are married, it follows, from well settled applicable rules, that the devise of the re<a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>mainder to the plaintiff was accelerated, that he is the present owner in fee simple of the property in question, and that there is no other valid outstanding title: <em>Fletcher v.

    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[257,966,1162,816]]]'>The language of testator’s will, considered in its entirety, clearly gives an interest or estate in the farm to his single children for life or until marriage; and upon their death or marriage, testator gave the farm to Walter if he was then living, and if he was then dead, to testator’s youngest living child. The majority opinion admits that if Carrie was given a life estate or an estate until her marriage, as Carrie and her two youngest sisters claim — and as the testator himself provided — “such an estate could not be lost or forfeited by abandonment.” How can one find only a personal privilege in the single children when each alternative gift over is conditioned not upon the termination or abandonment of that privilege, but solely upon the death or marriage of his single children?</p>
