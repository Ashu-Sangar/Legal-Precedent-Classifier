He was survived by his widow, Sarah, and his daughter, Ruth, who constituted his sole heirs and next of kin. The daughter, Ruth, had a son, Charles, born in his grandfather’s lifetime and who survived testator, testator’s widow and his mother. Charles was survived by a posthumous daughter, Charmaine, who still survives.

Upon the decease of <em>both </em>widow and daughter, testator disposed of the corpus of his estate. He contemplated the death of his daughter with and without leaving issue. Since the daughter left issue surviving we are here concerned only with the testamentary provision providing for that event. This dispositive clause reads: “ITEM: At and upon the death of my wife, Sarah K. Throm, and my daughter Ruth S. Throm Detweiler, and my daughter Ruth S. Throm Detweiler dying leaving lawful issue or issue of a deceased child or children, I order and direct my hereinafter named Executors and Trustee to pay and deliver the whole net proceeds of my estate to the issue or issue of such lawful child or children of my daughter Ruth S.

Detweiler, who is the executor under her will and the appellant herein. It is appellant’s contention that the testamentary provision is void because it is in violation of the rule against perpetuities. Should it be so construed, an intestacy would result and appellant’s wife, testator’s daughter, would receive her intestate share which would pass under her will.</p>

Since testator’s death was in 1931, prior to the Act, this will must be interpreted under the then existing law.

The crux of <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>this case, however, is the construction of the words which immediately precede the above clause, and which follow it, viz.: <em>“to pay and deliver . . . upon arriving at the age of thirty (SO) years respectively”. </em>Appellant contends that under the doctrine of the “pay and divide cases” the interest of the issue is <em>contingent </em>upon the issue respectively attaining thirty years of age. This period would be void for remoteness since such a vesting could <em>possibly </em>occur beyond the limits of the rule. On the other hand, the executor of the grandson, Charles, appellee, contends that Charles, the daughter’s child, possessed a vested interest in remainder and that the testamentary direction of payment was merely a deferment.</p>

In brief, it is: <em>where there is a direction to pay and divide, but there is no antecedent gift which is independent of the direction and time for payment, the legacy is contingent. </em>That the cases <em>applying </em>the doctrine have not always been in harmony is apparent from statements of at least two of our former Chief Justices which are quoted in <em>Rickenbach Estate, </em>supra, (p. 125). Judge Hunter, of the Philadelphia Orphans’ Court, made an accurate statement in <em>Batchelor Estate, </em>67 D. &amp; C. 310, when he said (p. 317) : “While an intention to make a gift contingent may be inferred from a direction to pay and divide (Moore v.

We agree with the appellee that when testator gave the remainder, upon the death of his daughter, to her “issue or issue of such- lawful child or children” he must have meant' <em>that issue which survived her. </em>One cannot <em>“leave” </em>issue to be born many years after one’s death. Another significant situation precludes the adoption of appellant’s contention. The daughter was given one-third of the income. Testator directed that in case the daughter predeceased his widow (which she did) such income shall go to the daughter’s children (issue) <em>until the widow died. </em>When the widow died there was no further gift of income. It would be unreasonable to suppose, in the absence of language to the contrary, that testator intended, upon the death of the widow, <em>the grandson or his issue shoidd thereafter receive neither income ■nor corpus until■ the daughter’s child or his issue' should respectively attain thirty years of age.</em>
