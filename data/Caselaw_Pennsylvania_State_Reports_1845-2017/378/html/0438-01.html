It recorded a plan of lots to be laid out in the tract and, in its original deeds, created a building restriction affecting each of the lots it conveyed. This restriction provided, inter alia, that no building should ever be erected within 14 feet of any street or avenue upon which the lot should front. In 1891 the deed to defendants’ predecessor in title contained this restriction. At that time the entire tract consisted of farm land with a single house thereon, but it developed into a built-up residential area. Originally Cottman Avenue was known as Township Lane and was legally opened to a width of 33 feet but in 1891 it was established with a cartway of 40 feet and two 14-foot sidewalks and in the period between 1912 and 1915 it was further widened to 100 feet with a cartway of 60 feet and two 20-foot sidewalks.</p>

Plaintiffs own and occupy premises on the north side of Cottman Avenue between Dungan and Claridge Streets, but those who are most interested herein are in the block between Montour and Claridge Streets, where defendants’ property is located. Defendants, having obtained a permit for the purpose, have started to extend the front of their store building southerly for some distance into the 14-foot restricted area, where they propose to erect a one-story addition completely enclosed in glass, and in <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>which it is their intention to display their furniture, carpets, linoleum and rugs.</p>

Defendants contend, and the court below was of the opinion, that it was designed merely for aesthetic purposes, that is, to insure the better appearance of the streets and to preserve the residential character of the neighborhood. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, urge that it was also to protect the light, air and view of the residents of the houses which, it was anticipated, would occupy the tract, and it is, of course, true that while an easement to light and air cannot be acquired in Pennsylvania by prescription and the doctrine of ancient lights is not part of.our law, an easement to light and air <em>may </em>be acquired, as any other easement, by express or implied grant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The area covered by the properties of these plaintiffs and defendants has been zoned commercial and is now almost completely commercial in fact. In the block in which defendants’ property is situated, 1219-1221 Cottman <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>Avenue is a grocery store, 1223 is a confectionary store, 1225-29 is defendants’ furniture store, 1231 is defendants’ dwelling house, 1233 and 1235 are semidetached dwelling houses, 1237 is a shoe store and 1239 a drug store.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The testimony disclosed that there are now erected in the tract at least 38 buildings which are used for commercial purposes, including two taprooms, two real estate offices, three garages and gasoline service stations, a bakery, two auto supply stores, a tailoring establishment, a tropical fish store, a music store, several grocery stores, a restaurant and cafe, an automobile agency, a shoe store, a drug store, and other types of retail merchandising establishments and garages rented to owners of private automobiles. Cottman Avenue itself, greatly widened as previously stated, has become an important business street and artery of traffic. Light, air and prospect, undoubtedly important to residents of front-porch houses, play much less part in the case of store properties. To preserve the restricted building line at a distance of 34 feet north from the north curb of Cottman Avenue in stead of flush with the inner line of the 20-foot sidewalk would seem to be, under present conditions, a sheer waste of valuable space for the commercial properties now occupying the street and without any real or substantial benefit to anybody. Incidentally, the dwelling houses of the plaintiffs at 1233 and 1235 Cottman Avenue are at an appreciable distance from the property of defendants which is to be extended.</p>

The majority opinion, in pointing out that 38 buildings in this block are used partly for stores, as well as for residences, demonstrates more clearly than anything else could the fact that this was never intended to be a restriction for residential homes. <em>This restriction applies, and can apply only to light and air. </em>If such a restriction appeared in a zoning ordinance, any counsel who contended that it was intended to and did prohibit the erection of commercial buildings and limited the zoned community to residential properties would be laughed out of Court. It is clear that such a setback restriction, if it were contained in a zoning ordinance, would be interpreted and could be sustained not as a residential restriction or for aesthetic purposes, but as a reasonable provision for light and air (health or safety).

Hamilton, </em>175 Pa., supra, an owner divided his land in 1832 into three lots and in the deed for the middle lot provided that no building or part of a building shall be erected on the lot within 5 feet of the south line of Chestnut Street. At the time Chestnut Street was entirely residential. Defendant purchased the lot in 1895 and planned to erect a building thereon which would violate the covenant. Defendant there contended, as do these defendants, that this was merely a building restriction and that Chestnut Street had changed to such an extent that it was now composed almost entirely of business or commercial properties. This Court reversed the lower Court and said that the obvious, purpose of the restriction was to afford light and air, and that no violation of such a restriction would be permitted even though the character and use of the land and buildings on Chestnut Street had completely changed. The Court’s opinion (pp. 336-337) is equally applicable to the facts in the instant case: “It is probable that deprivation of air is less endurable to the occupants of a dwelling, than to those of a store or factory; and generally the <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>latter are less disposed to resist such deprivation; but <em>these elements promote the health and comfort of one class of occupants as fully as the other, and both have the same right to insist on a restriction for their protection</em>

Contracts such as this, whether construed as covenants or conditions, since Spencer’s case, have been enforced, both at law and in equity, between the immediate parties to them and their grantees, near and remote. . . .
