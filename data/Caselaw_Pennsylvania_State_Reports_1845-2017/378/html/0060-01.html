A Mr. Morrison loaded the car. Mr. Menafee testified that this particular car had arrived at Walsh, Colorado, loaded with an inbound shipment of merchandise consisting of machinery. When the shipper ordered a car for loading with broom corn, Mr. Menafee said that he examined this car personally and that it was dry and fit for broom corn. In his brief, counsel for plaintiff flatly states that the car was admitted by the defendant to be a leaky one. That is not true. Mr. Menafee further testified that there had been rain and snow for two weeks before this shipment was loaded and that the broom corn lay out in the open weather for at least two weeks. On cross examination he said that the shippers shipped twenty per cent of their shipments wet, and that the growers store the broom <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>corn on the open ground all winter. At destination, Mr. C. G. Plies, the railroad agent at Federal Street, Pittsburgh, where the shipment was delivered, testified that he examined the car and . . . that there was no leakage in the roof. He did say that at one end of the car there were several cracks in the end of the car from % to % inch wide. Mr. R. L. Turner, chief clerk at the Federal Street station, inspected the car and testified that the car and the broom corn were damp throughout with a moldy, gray cast.</p>

It contains the notation, ‘Shipper’s load count and weight.’ When the broom corn was weighed the next day at Dodge City, Kansas, by the railroad company, it listed the weight as 29,400. The plaintiff argues that this increase in weight of 840 pounds is evidence that moisture was getting into the car. This particular point is relatively immaterial. It was referred to by the Court-in its charge . . . and was for the jury.</p>

Under the law, even where a bill of lading does not contain the. notation ‘shipper’s load and count’, the. effect, of the recital in the bill of lading that the shipment was .received in apparent good order and that the contents and condition of the contents of the packages are unknown to the carrier, the defendant carrier may produce evidence and-show the contrary, to wit, that the shipment was not in good order when loaded.

Johnson Line, </em>33 Federal Reporter 2d 70, <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>expressly so holds. That case involved the question of a shipment of steel bars which were bent upon delivery at destination. The Court in its opinion, at page 70, said: ‘The principal contention of the appellant seems to be that the court below failed to give due consideration to the recital in the bill of lading that the steel was received in apparent good order and condition. The appellee insists that this recital was qualified by a statement written across the bill of lading to the effect that the shipper was not accountable for bending, but we will assume that the latter statement did not refer to the condition of the steel when taken on board the vessel, or qualify in any way the recital that the steel was in apparent good order and condition. In other words, we will assume that the bill of lading was a clean one as claimed by the appellant. But the appellant seems to attribute too much importance to this phase of the case. A bill of lading is both a contract and a receipt. A recital that the shipment is in good order and condition is not contractual and does not amount to a warranty as between the immediate parties. The carrier is free to prove the contrary. Hutchinson on Carriers (3d Ed.) Sec. 157 et seq.; 10 C. J. 200. The recital contained in the bill of lading was therefore only prima facie evidence and was entitled to such consideration as the court deemed proper under the circumstances, and no more.’</p>
