How, for example, can a depositor or donor make <em>a valid delivery </em>in those cases in which he already has a bank account or a safe deposit box in his own name, and wishes to create in praesenti a <em>joint interest </em>and divest himself of <em>all </em>dominion over the subject of the gift? Contrary to the majority opinion, it is absolutely impossible to divest the donor of <em>all </em>dominion (and control) and invest the donee with <em>complete </em>dominion (and control) over a joint account or joint box or interest, and still have each party possess a joint dominion and control. There is little or no difficulty with respect to intention; but with respect to the relinquishment of <em>all </em>dominion over a <em>joint </em>bank account or a <em>joint </em>safe deposit box, such a divestiture (and the investing of complete dominion in the donee) is, upon careful analysis, <em>a contradiction in terms and an impossibility. </em>Yet the ma<a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>jority assert that that is the proper test or rule in these cases.</p>

Moreover, if, as the majority assert, Chadrow did not wish his niece to have access to the box, why did he have her sign a receipt for the key? And if he did not want her to have the contents of the box until after his death, why did he sign an agreement giving her a <em>present </em>title thereto and specifically say therein that she <em>is </em>the joint owner of the present and future contents of the box? Moreover, he could not have intended her to have a right of access merely for his convenience because (a) he could have given her a right of access without making her a joint owner of the contents of the box, and (b) he never made any statement of such an intention (for his convenience), and he never once asked her in his lifetime to get him any of the contents of the box. It is clear as crystal that Chadrow wanted and intended to make his niece the joint owner of the contents of the safe deposit box. <em>His oral statements at the time of the gift showed this, his actions showed this, and most important of all, the joint tenancy agreement which he and his niece signed expressly, specifically, clearly, unambiguously and unequivocally stated this!</em>

The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Linn, said (pp. 378-379): “No. 9, appeal of Jean S temler, raises a different question, it is: What was the effect of the agreement prepared by the bank and signed by both parties on December 7, 1926, in the circumstances shown? It may again be repeated: ‘The sums deposited in this account belong to Frank Stemler and Jean Stemler jointly, it being understood each may withdraw upon his or her or their individual order during joint lives, and we hereby direct and authorize the Camp Curtin Trust Company, Harrisburg, Pa., to pay any balance remaining upon the death of either <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>of us, to the survivor.’ Certain results were undoubted. The bank agreed to pay the deposit to either on demand. Its obligation was a chose in action. As between him and his daughter, Stemler transferred to her an interest in the chose — an interest in the right to receive payment from the bank; he expressed Ms donative purpose; as part of the evidence of intention, he executed and delivered the agreement creating a joint interest with the right of survivorship. They agreed that ‘the sums deposited . . . belong to . . . [them] . . . jointly’; they provided that either might withdraw the money during their joint lives, and the survivor, on the death of either. An interest as joint owner was transferred, as appears from the statement that ‘the sums . . . belong to . . . [them] . . . jointly’; it was not merely a power to collect (as to which, see Flanagan v. Nash, supra; Zellner’s Est., supra). When, therefore, after Stemler’s death, the bank paid the money to Jean Stemler, it discharged its obligation by paying to the survivor in accordance with the contract made by the bank and the depositors. On the main question, the learned chancellor thought the case was similar in fact to Flanagan v. Nash, supra, and Grady v. Sheehan, <a href="/pa/256/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="256 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="1030778" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0377-01">256 Pa. 377</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.%20950" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="100 A. 950">100 A. 950</a>, in which it was held that the evidence was insufficient to establish title to the fund as a gift inter vivos. In neither of those cases was there, as in appeal No. 9, <em>a writing signed by the parties, completely expressing the intention to vest by assignment a present joint interest in the chose in action with the right of survivorship.</em>
