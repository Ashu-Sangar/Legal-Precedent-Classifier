That he was present during the trial and when the sentence was pronounced, and that full opportunity for the exercise of all his rights in relation to both was accorded to him, is not denied. The specification therefore rests on the common law doctrine that in capital cases the record must show affirmatively that the prisoner was present at every stage of the proceedings against him. <em>The contention of the defendant based thereon is that although he toas actually present he is entitled to a new trial because the clerk neglected to note his presence on the record.. In the light of the undisputed facts there is no real merit in this contention; it is purely technical and it ought not to prevail unless the amendment which made the record conform to the fact was unauthorized. We think the amendment was clearly within and a proper exercise of the power of the court. It simply supplied a clerical omission and placed the record in this particular in harmony with the fact. It excluded the possibility of an inference from the record opposed to the truth of the case, but it did not deprive the defendant of any substantial right. What right had he to require that a defect in the record arising from an oversight of the clerk in keeping it and which left room for an inference hostile to the undisputed facts, should be perpetuated for his benefit? He neither lost nor acquired anything by the defect which prevented the correction of it in accordance with these facts.” </em>(Italics supplied). This controls the present <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>case. Although the fact of presence was denied, the contrary was conclusively established and therefore with the record corrected, as it can be, by the court imposing the sentence, the writ must be denied.
