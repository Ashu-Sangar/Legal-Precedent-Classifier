It does engage in the transportation and sale of gas in interstate commerce. It is denied by the plaintiffs that gas from the Pratt Pool passes into interstate commerce. It is true that the defendant is subject to the control and regulations of the Federal Power Commission and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. But none of these considerations can oust the jurisdiction of the court of equity under the circumstances of this case. We must therefore hold that the court has power to enter into the inquiry posed by the complaint, without regard to the control or regulation exercisable by these administrative agencies. “Congress meant to create a comprehensive scheme of regulation <em>which would he complementary in its operation to that of the states} </em>
      <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>without any confusion of functions.” (Italics supplied) : <em>Public Utilities Commission v.

It is not stored solely as a step in further interstate transportation or sale, but is thereafter transported and sold in <em>areas of this Commonwealth, </em>when demands call for its use. The cases cited by the defendant to sustain its contention that this activity is interstate are not in point, for in those cases the facilities were solely temporary interruptions in the interstate commerce of the product. Here the storage is an essentially local aspect of its business.</p>

Section 1(b), 0. 556, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20Stat.%20822" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="52 Stat. 822">52 Stat. 822</a>, 15 F.S.C.A. §717 (b) specifically excludes from its application “the local distribution of natural gas . . . the facilities used for such distribution . . . the gathering of natural gas.” This language is plain and unambiguous and necessarily concludes any control by the Federal Power Commission over the facilities for storage, i.e. facilities for gathering and distributing gas locally. These are left to local regulation and control. Such facilities are not within the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission. See <em>Federal Power Commission v.

    <p id="b628-4" data-blocks='[["BL_628.4",628,[260,904,1155,1041]]]'>Nor does the Pennsylvania Public Utility Law of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1053, 66 PS §1101, deprive the court of jurisdiction. The Act states that unless otherwise provided nothing contained therein “shall . . . abridge or impair any of the obligations, duties, or liabilities of any public utility ... in equity or under the existing common or statutory law of the Commonwealth, . . . [nor] in any way abridge or alter the existing rights of action or remedies in equity or under the common or statutory law of the Commonwealth, <em>it being the intention that the provisions of this act shall be cumulative and in addition to such rights of action and </em>remedies.” (Italics supplied). There is nothing in the Act that ousts equity’s jurisdiction in this case, and there is no question that its jurisdiction is retained. Cf. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Shumaker v.

The answer to this is that there is no abandonment directed by the court at this stage of the proceedings. Abandonment necessarily implies the voluntary or intentional act of the party having the facility, right or power to relinquish it. Here, if the court should grant full injunctive relief, the cessation would be <em>forced </em>upon defendant. See <em>Pearlman Trust, </em><a href="/pa/348/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="348 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1220300" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0488-01">348 Pa. 488</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%20418" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="35 A.2d 418">35 A. 2d 418</a>. Furthermore, the court may grant relief short of what it particularly considers a cessation. See <em>Meth v. Meth, </em><a href="/pa/360/0623-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="360 Pa. 623" data-case-ids="475020" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0623-01">360 Pa. 623</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.2d%20848" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="62 A.2d 848">62 A. 2d 848</a>.</p>
    <p id="b629-4" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[158,1184,1152,1094]]]'>Lastly, defendant contends that the lessors of lands in which it stores gas are indispensable parties-defendant in this proceeding, having leased the lands to the defendant for the purpose of the storage. It may be observed that nowhere in the complaint is any averment made that the lessors of the land have committed any tortious act against the plaintiffs, — nor have they. The present action is based upon a tortious “use” of the land by this defendant and in nowise attempts to attack anything creating the leasehold. As pointed out by Judge Hook writing for the court below: “This case on its merits concerns solely the acts of the defendant, its lessors should not be considered indispensable parties to this proceeding.” Cf. <em>Maxson v. McElhinney, </em><a href="/pa/370/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="370 Pa. 622" data-case-ids="1234507" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0622-01">370 Pa. 622</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%20747" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="88 A.2d 747">88 A. 2d 747</a>. The rights and duties of the defendant and its lessors remain necessarily as provided in the leases, regardless of the outcome of this proceeding brought solely to determine whether the particular use of the lands by defendant constitutes a tortious act against the plaintiffs.</p>
