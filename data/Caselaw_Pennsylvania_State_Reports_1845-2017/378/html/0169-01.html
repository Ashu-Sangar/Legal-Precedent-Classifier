Universal Pants Company occupied the second and third floors of the building and Clyde Shirt Company occupied the first and fourth floors. The four floors were serviced by a freight elevator maintained by defendant, Clyde Realty Company, Inc. The accident occurred at the elevator landing gate located on the third floor, one of the floors occupied by Universal Pants Company. The framework of the elevator landing gate was made of wood consisting of two upright pieces one on each side and three crosspieces, one at the top, one in the middle and one at the bottom. The framework was covered with one-half inch wire mesh. The landing gate was 5 feet <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>6 inches high and 7 feet wide. In the upper section of the landing gate, on the right-hand side as one faces the gate, there was an uncovered opening extending upward from the middle crosspiece to the top crosspiece. The opening was 10 inches in width and 22 inches in height and approximately two feet nine inches from the floor. The elevator landing gates on each floor were equipped with automatic locking devices so that the elevator could not be operated unless the elevator landing gates were closed. If the elevator landing gate on any of the floors was open it was impossible for anyone on any other floor to move the elevator. The elevator was motor driven but it was necessary to use a hand cable to start it. To operate the elevator from outside the landing gate it was necessary for the operator to reach through the opening" and pull the hand cable. By pulling down on the hand cable the elevator was brought up, and by pulling up on the hand cable the elevator was brought down.</p>

We need not repeat what the court has so accurately and meticulously considered and ruled in its opinions.

He said (p. 203) : “. . . that wanton misconduct is something different from negligence however gross, —different not merely in degree but in kind, and evincing a different state of mind on the part of the tortfeasor. Negligence consists of inattention or inadvertence, whereas wantonness exists where the danger to the plaintiff, though realized, is so recklessly <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>disregarded that, even though there be no actual intent, there is at least a willingness to inflict injury, a conscious indifference to the perpetration of the wrong. Having in mind this characterization of wanton misconduct, it will be readily seen that the principle that contributory negligence is not a defense to an action for a tort involving such misconduct is not in conflict with the rejection in Pennsylvania of the doctrines of ‘comparative negligence’ and ‘last clear chance’ hereinbefore referred to.”</p>
    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[246,904,1156,761]]]'>In that case there was testimony by plaintiff’s witnesses concerning wanton negligence of the defendant’s motorman. In the opinion it is stated (p. 204) : “Instead of giving binding instructions for defendant, the learned trial judge should have instructed the jury that, even if the motorman was grossly negligent, plaintiff, because of decedent’s contributory negligence, cannot recover, but that such contributory negligence would not be a bar if the motorman was guilty of wanton misconduct, that is, if he exhibited a reckless disregard for decedent’s safety after observing his perilous position and realizing the danger involved in proceeding at a high rate of speed and without giving warning of his approach.”</p>

While the elevator was motor driven, it required a pull on a hand cable in order to start the operation of the motor and <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>the elevator. There could be no movement of the elevator if any landing gate remained open. There were electric bells at each floor for use if the presence of the elevator was required. The opening in the elevator door was approximately two feet nine inches from the floor and was ten inches in width and twenty-two inches in height. The opening was for the sole purpose of enabling the operator’s hand to be placed through it in order to pull the cable and thus start the motor. There is not the slightest indication in the testimony that defendants were aware that decedent or any other person had any habit, as alleged, of putting their heads through the hole which would thereby cause them to be injured. Indeed, the testimony discloses that the described condition existed for many years without any indication of danger. Also, decedent worked in the premises for at least three years and was fully aware of the situation. Since there are no disputed facts for submission to a jury, and since we must accept as true decedent’s own admission and plaintiff’s testimony, together with all inferences in the light most favorable to her, it becomes <em>matter of law </em>for the court to determine whether or not wanton negligence has been established and also whether or not plaintiff is barred from recovery because of decedent’s contributory negligence.</p>

No evidence of negligence of defendant showing defect or fault was shown and nonsuit was there granted.

Although motor-driven, its movements were controlled by a cable which passed through the floor and ceiling of the elevator cage. A signal bell on each floor was supposed to serve as a means of calling the elevator, but it did not always respond to pressure. When, however, it was mechanically aroused, its answering squeal was often drowned out in the clatter of some 150 electrically-impulsed sewing machines on each floor. Of the 300 persons employed in the building, many who made use of the elevator apparently operated it themselves. Raymond A. ICeshel, who had been with the Universal Pants Company for <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>four years prior to the accident, testified: “Q.

Often the light in the elevator was not lit or was covered with a dirty rag. The electric bulb outside the landing gate dangled in such a position that when not actually in darkness it threw shadows onto and around the landing and all its dangerous appurtenances. Although the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>elevator could be lowered or raised by thrusting a hand into the shaft and pulling the cable, this operation often failed to move the car because of an automatic locking device which immobilized it when the landing gate on any floor was not entirely closed. The right side of the landing gate on each floor was provided with an opening measuring 10 x 22 inches. When a rider failed to summon the elevator by ringing the bell or by jerking the cable, he would thrust his head through this opening and yell into the elevator shaft, calling upon all those who could hear, to close the gate which might be holding the elevator fast.</p>

Day after day, month after month, year after year, they saw people using the grim opening in the elevator shaft. They knew, even as much as they later charged Walter Hucaluk with knowing, that this procedure was a perilous one, but they did nothing to stop it. They knew that the law forbade such a procedure, but they ignored the law.

The duty rests on the carrier of passengers to see that the instrumentality used to convey passengers should be constructed so as to be reasonably safe, according to the- use to be made of it. The duty holds the owner or the-carrier to the highest degree of care and-foresight. . A passenger, entering an elevator,-. commits- himselfabsolutely- to: the .care and protection of the-owner so-far, as the. operation of-the car and its. construction- is-concerned.- I-f-.the. construction of the elevator-car permits the passenger to reach the elevator shaft-while the car is -in motion,- it cannot be termed as anything less than dangerous. Take the <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>present instance, this cage, crowded or uncrowded, permits one standing near the unprotected end, by a nod of his head, to receive a blow that would kill him, or, by extending his arm or shoulder outside the path of the car, to receive a severe wound. The rule announced in this and other states means precisely what it says. <em>The owners of elevators are held to the highest degree of care in the construction of cars, and, when an elevator carrying passengers is operated without protection on all sides, that is negligent construction.”</em>

McKeesport Tin Plate Co., </em><a href="/pa/263/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="263 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1047456" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0327-01">263 Pa. 327</a>, the plaintiff was injured when he oiled certain machinery which was in motion. He knew from observation that it was safer to wait until the machinery was stopped before oiling it, but this was not always possible. The foreman in charge of the shop knew of the dangerous practise but made no attempt to prevent it. One day, while engaged in the hazardous work the plaintiff slipped and his arm fell into the moving cogs with consequent mangling injury. In the ensuing lawsuit the defendant company argued that since the plaintiff was conscious of the danger inherent in the operation he was performing, he could not recover. This Court, however, in affirming the verdict which the plaintiff received from the jury, quoted from the case of <em>Fortney, v. Breon, </em><a href="/pa/245/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="245 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="326274" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0047-01">245 Pa. 47</a>, 52-4, as follows': “True, there was danger in so doing, but the existence of danger does not prove negligence. If it did, there would be no safety except to abandon the use of machinery. .</p>

This social duty the <em>law </em>recognizes and enforces, and for any injury resulting from any person’s lack of elementary forethought, the law holds that person accountable. A normal human being is held to foresee those injuries which are the consequence of his acts of omission or commission which he, as a reasonable human being, should have foreseen. The question whether a person charged with negligence or negligent acts or omissions should havé foreseen the injuries resulting from those acts or omissions is <em>for the jury, </em>if there is any credible evidence from which a reasonable con-, elusion can be. drawn in support of the claim of neglect of duty. ‘A verdict should not be directed if on <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>all the facts and circumstances there is room for fair and sensible men to differ in their conclusions.’: Mc-Cracken v.

But there is nothing celestial about an elevator. Its machinery, operation, and movements are open to inspection, study, and supervision. Its future performance can be anticipated from its past. If it is encased in a shaft that is so defective that people may fall into it, the property owner can foresee that one day that elevator will run down a fallen victim. If the shaft is so open to the public that riders will, still exercising ordinary care and prudence, look into it in seeking transportation, <em>that </em>is also something that is foreseeable, to be anticipated, and to be guarded against.</p>

Did they foresee the foreseeable, did they anticipate what was so clearly written in the book of anticipations, did they evaluate the inexorable law of cause and effect? These were all questions of fact for the jury, because they are matters within the sphere of human observation, calculation, and appraisement. The action of the lower court in withdrawing these questions from the jury was a flagrant abuse of discretion which has been countenanced and affirmed by this Court. By doing so, a widow and four orphans have been deprived of a right guaranteed to them by the law of the land. And I accordingly vigorously dissent.</p>
