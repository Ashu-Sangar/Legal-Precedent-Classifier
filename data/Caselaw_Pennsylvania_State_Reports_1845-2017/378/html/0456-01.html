    <p id="b490-6" data-blocks='[["BL_490.8",490,[245,1009,1158,535]]]'>This controversy is concerned with the effect of a widow’s election against her husband’s will upon the quantum of the shares in his residuary estate bequeathed to beneficiaries other than herself. The law in such regard is too well settled to require extended discussion. It is rather the manner in which the learned Court below applied the law, in assumed effectuation of what it apprehended to be the testator’s overriding intent, which these appeals bring here for review.</p>

Babcock, the decedent, devised and bequeathed to his wife, Mary, absolutely, his residence property and all his household furnishings and tangibles. By Article Two, he devised and bequeathed all of the residue and remainder of his property to his trustees to divide the same into twenty-four equal parts which he then disposed of in consecutively numbered sections of Article Two. By Section 1, he gave eight of such parts to his trustees in trust to secure an annual income, of guaranteed amount, to his wife for life with directions to his trustees to divide the corpus, after his wife’s death, into two equal shares, one of which was to be added to a trust fund under Section 2 for his son, Ered C. Bab<a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>cock, and the other share to be added to a similar trust fund under Section 3 for his son, Edward Vose Babcock, Jr. By Section 2, the testator allocated three parts to his son, Fred (one-half outright and one-half to his trust), and by Section 3, he allocated two parts to his son, Edward V., Jr., (one-half outright and one-half to his trust). By Section 4, he gave to his nephew, Robert P. Babcock, three parts, absolutely. By succeeding sections, he divided the remaining eight of the twenty-four parts of the residue among beneficiaries, not of his blood, as follows, — one part each to five named employees, two parts to charities to be selected by his trustees and the remaining part to such of his household servants, company employees and personal friends as the trustees, in their uncontrolled discretion, might select.</p>

Babcock, shall die during my lifetime, the property <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>hereinbefore devised and bequeathed in trust for her under this Section 1 of this Article Two of my will shall be disposed of as provided in said Section as though my said wife had died immediately after my death.”</p>
    <p id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.4",492,[254,627,1157,1373]]]'>In an account filed, the executors took credit for a distribution of income made by them to beneficiaries under the will on the basis of a division of the residue (after deduction of the widow’s l/3rd) into twenty-four parts. Some of the employee-beneficiaries filed exceptions to the account, contending that the effect given by the executors to the widow’s election improperly reduced their respective shares from l/24th to l/36th each. The exceptants argued that “when the widow filed her election she walked out of the will taking with her the property representing the remainders which her sons would have received had she not elected to take against the will.” They contended that their fractional interests of l/24th each in the entire residue of the estate are not to be diminished by reason of the widow’s election. The auditing judge stated the problem, as he saw it, as follows, — “The question thus presented by these facts is whether the widow, by electing to take against the will, extinguished the remainders provided for her two sons in Section 1 of Article Two or whether by her election the remainders of the sons in the trust are accelerated with the right in the sons to be made whole out of the 2/3rds of the estate which remains after the widow takes l/3rd outright by reason of her election.”</p>

The effect of the auditing judge’s action was to reduce to sixteen the number of equal parts into which he divided the remaining 2/3rds of the residuary estate after the widow’s l/3rd had been deducted. Thus, by the decree of distribution, the court awarded to the exceptants, at the manifest expense of the testator’s sons and their families, the equivalent, in amount, of a l/24th, each, of the net value of the <em>whole </em>of the decedent’s estate before deduction of the widow’s l/3rd. The trustees under the will and the testator’s sons separately excepted to the decree of distribution. After argument, the court en banc (one judge dissenting) dismissed the exceptions in a final decree from which the trustees and the testator’s sons have brought these appeals.</p>
    <p id="b493-4" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[183,1359,1152,871]]]'>There is nothing in the testator’s will to warrant the slightest inference that he intended to cancel or annul his sons’ remainder interests in the trust fund for his widow for life upon her electing to take against his will. On the contrary, his plain and unambiguous language explicitly confirms what the law independently declares as the effect of the widow’s election. We agree with the pertinent observation of the dissenting judge below that, “It is not necessary in construing the will of Edward V. Babcock, deceased, to speculate as to the testamentary disposition he intended to make of his estate if his wife should elect to take against his will.” When the words which the testator employed are given their usual and ordinary meaning, they clearly and unmistakably express his testamentary intent.</p>

There was an acceleration of the remainders. The balance in the estate must be held and distributed as directed by the will.”</p>

Fully cognizant, as he was bound to be <em>(Estate of Vance, </em>supra, at p. 209), of his wife’s paramount right to take a third of his estate outright regardless of his will, the testator provided in Article Two, Section 1, in connection with the trust <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>for liis wife for life, “If my said wife shall elect to take against this will, all of the provisions thereof for her benefit shall be thereby cancelled and annulled . . . .” Among the provisions <em>for her benefit </em>were the devise and bequest of the testator’s residence property and furnishings by Article One and the right to a guaranteed minimum income of $20,000 for her life from the trust estate created in Section 1 of Article Two. Nowhere did the testator evidence any intent that his sons’ remainders in the trust estate, created by Section 1 of Article Two, were to be cancelled and annulled if his wife elected to take against his will. Had the testator intended otherwise, he would have plainly said so just as he did provide for the cancellation and annullment of the testamentary provisions for his wife’s benefit.</p>
    <p id="b495-4" data-blocks='[["BL_495.4",495,[177,1231,1149,1101]]]'>Having thus directed, in the event of his wife’s electing to take against his will, for the cancellation and annullment of no more than the testamentary provisions <em>for her </em>benefitthe testator immediately went on to direct that “the provisions of this will with respect to all property except that thus taken by my wife shall be carried out in the same manner as if she had died immediately after my death.” What the widow had thus “taken” by her election was l/3rd of the testator’s entire estate. Consequently, “all property” except the widow’s third was the 2/3rds residue of the entire estate as to which the provisions of the will were to be carried out “in the same manner”, i.e., by a division into twenty-four equal parts, as if Mrs. Babcock had died immediately after her husband’s death. That necessarily means that the vesting, in possession and enjoyment, of the remainders in the trust estate under Section 1 of Article Two was to be accelerated to the date of the widow’s election which was the “equivalent of her death.”</p>
    <p id="b496-4" data-blocks='[["BL_496.3",496,[262,347,1156,929]]]'>
      <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>The provision which we have just been considering is a part of Section 1 of Article Two which, as we have seen, is concerned solely with the trust fund for the benefit of the testator’s wife for life with remainder to their sons. In this same Article and Section of the will, the testator further provided that, if his wife should predecease him, the property “devised and bequeathed in trust for her under this Section 1 of Article Two . . . shall be disposed of as provided in said Section as though my said wife had died immediately after my death.” The testator could hardly have more plainly indicated his intention that his sons’ remainder interests in the trust under Section 1 of Article Two were to be unaffected either by his wife’s death or by her election to take against his will save that in the latter event the remainders would be accelerated and diminished by one-third of their amount otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[260,1298,1157,983]],["BL_497.1",497,[164,343,1146,100]]]'>The widow’s election did not, as the auditing judge mistakenly conceived, operate to reduce the twenty-fourth interests in the residue, under the testator’s will, to thirty-sixths. The beneficial interests have at all times been in twenty-fourths. The only difference occasioned by the widow’s election was that the fund in which the proportionate interests in the residue would share was one-third less than the testator’s entire net estate. In other words, the proportionate interests in the residue remained the same after the widow’s election, but the fund for distribution among such interests was less. That is no more than frequently happens when a widow elects to take her share in her husband’s estate under the intestate law instead of taking under his will and furnishes no justification for arbitrarily disregarding the testator’s provisions in the event his wife should elect to take against his will. Such provisions are valid and are to <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>be enforced as written: <em>Houston Estate, </em><a href="/pa/371/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="371 Pa. 396" data-case-ids="1237105" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0396-01">371 Pa. 396</a>, 398-399, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20A.2d%20525" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="89 A.2d 525">89 A. 2d 525</a>.</p>

For one example from many, the appellees assert that “when the wife elected to take her l/3rd part of the estate outright, she took the trust res, and the trust and the remainders dependent thereon were extinguished.” That is what the auditing judge similarly concluded. But, the widow took no specific property nor the shares of any specific testamentary beneficiaries. She took one-third of the testator’s entire estate. There is no rational basis for deducing that, by her election, she affected the fractional interest of any particular beneficiary under the will other than as she affected all of such interests by reducing the fund for distribution among them.</p>

He had given considerable thought to the making of the will, to the division of his big estate, to the rewarding of the faithful and to the assistance of the needy. By dividing his estate into 24 equal parts he could make a distribution which would satisfy every demand of conscience, generosity and gratitude.</p>

He had already created a funded life insurance trust in the amount of $321,000 for his son Fred C. Babcock. This is mentioned to show that the relationship between Babcock and his immediate kin was of the best and to reveal further that the two sons were already well-laden beneficiaries of the generous bounty of their father.</p>

In order that she should enjoy to the fullest this bequest, the testator provided that the trustees appointed under the will were to hold, manage, invest and reinvest the indicated 8/24ths as a separate trust fund, collecting the income and paying it to her in certain installments. She was to receive at least $20,000 a year. If the annual income for any reason should not amount to $20,000, the trustees were empowered to pay to her “out of the principal of the trust fund, an amount equal to the difference between the net income so distributed and the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000).”</p>

He made his bequest a life estate not because he loved his wife less but because, being an astute and capable business man he concluded that in the long run she stood to gain more this way. This procedure would save her share of the estate from double Federal estate taxation (once upon his death and again upon her death.) That there was no thought on his part of limiting her enjoyment of the 8/24ths bequeathed to her is conclusively proved by the fact that the trustees had the right upon request <em>from her </em>to invade the principal of the trust, even to the extent of depleting it completely in order to assure her the indicated $20,000 a year.</p>

Nowhere in the will is there the slightest intimation that the enjoyment of any one twenty-fourth was to interfere with any other twenty-fourth.

As against the possibilities that any <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>particular legatee would not be available to receive outrightly his legacy, the testator provided for substitutions in the form of living spouses, children, other legatees and so on. While any particular legatee might (because of the possibilities already anticipated with regard to other legatees) obtain a larger share than the 24th or 24ths outrightly bequeathed to him, in no possible connection could any legatee obtain less than the 24th directly bequeathed to him. For instance, if the legatee H. B. Leech (under Section 7) should predecease the testator, Leech’s share would pass to and be divided among other residuary legatees in proportion to their respective interest. Thus, it is to be seen that some of the other legatees could get something more than l/24th, but Leech himself (if alive and in the employ of the Babcock interests), could never receive less than the l/24th irrevocably apportioned to him.</p>

There cannot be the slightest question that he intended the remainder to be wiped out. If he had desired that the remainder from the life estate was to survive even though the wife took the S/24ths outrightly, it would have been the simplest matter for him by the addition of a single sentence in the last paragraph of Section 1 of Article Two of the will to so declare. A matter of this grave importance would not have been left to mere assumption, or, worse yet, conjecture. As the learned President Judge Boyle stated in his opinion in the court below: “Had the testator intended that the remainders provided for his sons under Section 1 of Article Two of the will were <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>to be accelerated and made whole out of the two thirds of the estate remaining after the widow’s election to take against the will, he would have so stated in plain and unmistakable language. He knew of the possibility and effect of the widow’s election and wished to protect the beneficiaries outside the family against it. It is reasonably certain that one who planned the distribution of estate as carefully as did the testator in the case at bar would not have allowed so drastic a change in his testamentary scheme and the distribution of so large portion of his estate to rest upon the operation of a rule of law when a sentence in the will would have accomplished the result for which the ex-ceptants contend.”</p>

But this is a juggling of figures. It is as clear as daylight in mid-June that the testator divided the <em>whole </em>estate into 24ths, not what was left after any certain remainders were deducted. It is not much consolation to tell Mr. Babcock’s faithful employes that although their appreciative and generous employer left them each a 24th of his estate, they should be content with l/24th of what remained after the workings of a technicalism which is nowhere mentioned, nowhere recommended, or nowhere inferred by Mr. Babcock.</p>

But it is to be noted that this argument about a second division into 24ths evaporates when one recalls that Article Two (on the first page of the will) begins: “All the residue and remainder of my property, real and personal,... I devise and bequeath to the trustees named in Article Four hereof, in trust to divide the same into twenty-four (24) equal parts . .

Whether the widow took with or against the will there were always 16/24ths of the estate left. There were always the 16 steel-fenced islands irrevocably devised and bequeathed to specific beneficiaries. The quoted rule does not say that that which a remainderman could have taken upon the expiration of a life estate from a <em>certain portion </em>of the estate, shall reduce specific bequests out of another, <em>different portion </em>of the estate.

Where acceleration works a hardship, parts of the estate may be <em>sequestrated, </em>in accordance with equitable principles, for the benefit of disappointed legatees and devisees.”</p>

In ascertaining the intention of the testator in that case, Justice Steabne said: “To gather the testamentary intention we must place ourselves in ‘testator’s arm chair’ and consider the circumstances surrounding him when he executed his will: Postlethwaite’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/68/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="68 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1024532" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0477-01">68 Pa. 477</a>; McGlathery’s Estate, <a href="/pa/311/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="311 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1146311" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0351-01">311 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=168%20A.%20886" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="168 A. 886">168 A. 886</a>. The will reveals testator’s complete satisfaction with his own philosophy of life and his success. He perpetuated his memory by provision for maintenance of his mausoleum and the erection of a charitable foundation, named for him, to benefit the ‘poor sick’ and ‘poverty stricken’ of his native borough.” Justice Steabne then, point by point, analyzed the will showing just what the intention of the testator was. Is there any difficulty in ascertaining the intention of the testator Babcock? He wanted to divide his estate in such a way as to provide for those who had been close to him in home, office, field, arid mill. During his lifetime he had made other handsome provisions for his wife and children. He made it clear that nothing was to disrupt the division of his estate into 24 parts so that the objects of <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>his bounty in home, office, field, and mill would all receive the shares that his mind, heart and conscience dictated so clearly.</p>

It has in effect rewritten the will of Edward Y. Babcock. It has substituted its judgment for that of the testator, it has disposed of his wealth in defiance of his expressed declaration, it has attributed to him a slyness which the record does not warrant; it has made him an Indian giver; it has put him in the light of a duplicitous master who said one thing to his employes and servants and then did something else. And all this has been done in the name of the law. It has done all this in tribute to a supposed technical rule which strikes tyrannically and arbitrarily, unconcerned for facts, heedless of circumstance, blind to reality and deaf to the demands of justice. It has taken from the servant and taken from those whose loyal services contributed to the formation of the fortune here being litigated; it has taken from those who need and given to those who do not need; it has taken from the meager purse of charity and added to the swollen chests of treasure. It has done all this in the name of law, but the law which the Majority invokes is not a law which for the good of the common weal must occasionally impose an individual hardship. The law which the Majority calls upon is not insensate, it is not irrational, it is not obdurate. When properly invoked it does accomplish justice, it does make for certainty and fairness, all so necessary in society if order is to be served and continuity to be preserved. The trouble here is that the rule of law which the Majority has invoked has no application to a set of facts such as here presented. It assumes that there must be an acceleration of the remainder estate regardless of time, tide and circum<a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>stance. In 1928 this Court did not see acceleration in so arbitrary a light. Chief Justice von Moschzisker, speaking for the Court in <em>Feeney’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/293/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="293 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1111143" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0273-01">293 Pa. 273</a>, 285, said: “This doctrine of acceleration, however, is <em>not an arbitrary one, </em>but it is founded, in the case of a will, on the presumed intention of the testator that the remainderman should take on the termination of the previous estate notwithstanding the prior donee may be still alive, and is applied in promotion of the presumed intention of the testator and <em>not in defeat of his intention </em>. . <em>”</em>
