        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThe action was trespass for the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband, fatally injured.by an automobile, while he was crossing a public highway thirty feet wide. A verdict for the plaintiff was set aside, presumably for inadequacy, and a new trial was granted. Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v. was overruled. This appeal is from that order: Fornelli v. Pennsylvania, R. R., 309 Pa. 365, 164 A. 54.\nPlaintiff\u2019s husband, a passenger in a northbound bus through the village of Glenshaw, alighted from the right-front door of the bus at Witmer Stop. The bus had stopped partly on and partly off the paved portion of the highway at a place that was also within the lines of a side road extending eastward, but which did not cross the main highway. Immediately opposite the stopping place, on the left or west side of the main highway, and set back a short distance from it, was:the Sava Inn, to which the man apparently intended to go. -A woman passenger also alighted immediately behind him and walked eastward, on the side road. She saw the man walk back, that is, southward,- along the right side of the .bus, which, meanwhile, .started northward. After she had.traveled.about tw.enty-flve feet down the side road she heard a crash. Plaintiff\u2019s husband was found-lying to the left or west of the highway. The place where the bus stopped on the right side of the highway and the Sava Inn on the left side, are on a rather .wide curve, the bus stop on the outside'and: the Inn. on. the inside, of the curve. The road was a three-lane, highway. The weather was drizzling rain, and misty. Mrs. Eichhorn, who followed plaintiff\u2019s husband out of .the bus, testified that he \u201cwalked on the length of the bus and around the .rear\u201d and \u201cwent the opposite, direction\u201d from that in which she was going. .She said that, as. she turned, she looked northward on the highway and \u201chad seen the reflections of a couple of cars coming up . . . 300, 350 feet . . . coming from the north to the south\u201d after the' bus had' started northward; the bus, then, must have moved along far enough not to obstruct her view northward.\nA witness, Seelnacht, describing the course of the road, said it had \u201ca wee bit of a bend for about, well, above that [place of accident] say at least over a thousand feet above that.\u201d He describes the place where Weibel\u2019s body was found as off the paved portion of the highway. Another witness, Barndollar, says the body was \u201coff the road four- or five feet ... on the side [of the inn] where they have the driveway into the hotel. ...\u201d Another testified that defendant\u2019s car was damaged on the right side: \u201cThe right-hand light was pushed back, and the fender had a dent in it.\u201d\nIf no other facts had appeared, there would of course have been no liability for want of evidence of negligence. To prove negligence, plaintiff called Mrs. Camplin who testified that on the night of the accident she talked with the defendant, who said to her: \u201c \u2018I was going to town; it was raining, and I was coming into the curve, and the lights blinded me. About 30 feet ahead of me I saw a man. I got confused; I couldn\u2019t stop; I hit him, or the car hit him. He went up in the air, he came down on the hood of my car and rolled on to the cinders.\u2019 Q. Did I understand you to say that he said it was raining? A. It was misting or. drizzling, to that effect he said. \u2018The lights blinded me.\u201d\u2019 In cross-examination she said: \u201cQ. Did Mr. Ferguson say in this conversation what lights it was that blinded him? -A. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember just exactly. He may. have said the car lights or the bus lights, I don\u2019t remember that. Q. You are not sure about that? A. No, sir. Q. That is the impression you got from him at any rate? A. Yes, sir, because they were coming up the road. Q. And he said that was just as he coming into the turn? A. And he was coming into the turn, coming into the curve.\u201d The plaintiff testified that on the same night she had a conversation with the defendant: \u201cHe asked me if I was Mrs. Weibel and I said yes, and he said, \u2018Well, I am the yonng man that hit yonr husband.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, how in the world did it happen?\u2019 He said, \u2018Well; I had a date and I was late. I was driving pretty fast and the lights of the bus blinded me, and I went off the curb and hit the man,\u2019 and he didn\u2019t see him until he was on top of him almost and hit him. . . . Q. Did he say where Mr. Weibel was on the road when he hit him? A. About 20 or 30 feet in front of him when he saw him, and he no more than saw him until he hit him. He got confused, he said. . . . Well, he said, \u2018I am the young man that hit your husband.\u2019 I said, \u2018How did it happen?\u2019 He said, \u2018I had a date and I was driving pretty fast. I was late, and I didn\u2019t see Mr. Weibel until I was almost on top of him,\u2019 and he said, \u2018He looked at me and I looked at him, and I got confused and stepped on the gas instead of the brake and went off the curb and hit him.\u2019 \u201d Charles O\u2019Connor, described as \u201can investigator,\u201d testified that six days after the accident defendant told him \u201cIt was raining, it was a little foggy and the road was wet. . . . Q. How fast did he say he was going? A. Between 30 and 35 miles an hour. Q. And did he tell you whether anything happened fx*om that point as he was driving down? A. Yes. Q. What did he say? A. He said that just as he was entering the curve the lights of a bus .moving toward Butler shone on his windshield and slightly blinded him. Q. Did he tell you whether or not his car hit Mr. Weibel? A. Yes, sir, he did. Q. After the lights blinded him what did he say happened? A. .That just as he got opposite what he called Sam\u2019s restaurant he saw a man on the road in front of him, about a car length in front of him \u2014 that is the length of his own car \u2014 and that he attempted to pull to the left to go around the man but that the front of the car struck him. Mr. Dickie: Q. To what? A. The car struck him and he seemed to fall over the right front fender of the car and off to the right. Mr. Weir: Q. Did he state at what speed he was traveling when he saw the man a car length away? A. Yes. Q. What speed did he say? A. Thirty to thirty-five miles an hour.\u201d\nThe ttvo accounts of the occurrence, that given by Mrs. Camplin and Mrs. Weibel, and that given by Mr. O\u2019Connor, as related to them by the defendant, are not quit\u00e9 the same. The appellant-defendant contends that as it is impossible to say from which of the accounts of the accident the jury inferred his negligence, plaintiff has not sustained the burden of proof; he invokes the principle that if the evidence be so contradictory in essentials that any verdict based on it would be a mere guess, the jury should not be permitted to consider it, citing Ginocchietti v. Lehigh Talley Railroad, 338 Pa. 507, 509, 12 A. 2d 919, and cases there cited. We all agree that the evidence in this case is not within the principle relied on.\nIn charging negligence, the statement of claim had averred that while exercising due care in crossing the highway, \u201cwhen he [Weibel] had almost and practically completed crossing said highway and when he had reached the extreme westerly side thereof he was struck violently and with great force by the right front fender and right front headlight of the [car] of the defendant traveling in a southerly direction on said Route No. 8 at the point aforesaid, and the force of this collision caused the deceased, . . . to be thrown to the right of said automobile onto the dirt and ground adjacent to the westerly side of said highway, . . . SIXTH: The negligence and carelessness of the defendant, Wilbur L. Ferguson, at the time and place aforesaid, was the sole and proximate cause of the aforesaid collision and of the death. ...\u201d The averment of negligence was further separated into details as to excessive speed, failure to keep his car under adequate control, failure to give warning, reckless driving, etc.\nIf the jury accepted defendant\u2019s account, as given on the night of the accident to Mrs. Camplin and Mrs. Weibel, the jury might well find that he was late for his engagement, \u201cdriving pretty fast\u201d and, hindered by the weather and the bus lights, \u201cwent off the curb and hit the man\u201d; that defendant\u2019s car left the paved portion of the highway and struck Weibel who had completed the crossing and left the highway. That, of course, made a case for the jury under the averments in the statement of claim.\nOn the other hand, if the jury accepted the facts stated by defendant to Mr. O\u2019Connor six days later, that he was traveling between 30 and 35 miles an hour, \u201cslightly blinded\u201d by the bus lights, so that when \u201che got opposite what he called Sam\u2019s restaurant he saw a man on the road in front of him\u201d and then struck the man, a verdict of negligence, also within the averments of the statement of claim would also be supported. This follows because the jury may have found from Mrs. Eichhorn\u2019s evidence that the bus started northward before Weibel started to cross; in that event the bus must have traveled some distance before its lights could affect the vision of the defendant traveling southward at a rate of 30 to 35 miles an hour in another lane of the three-lane highway. Not only is there no evidence that any other car moved northward whose lights might have affected defendant but defendant\u2019s statement is that it was the bus lights that \u201cslightly blinded him.\u201d If so, the jury may have found that the blinding occuiwed considerably north of the place of collision and not just before reaching the point where he first saw Weibel 30 feet in front of him. In such circumstances the effect of the lights, as an element in the transaction, was for the jury: Farley v. Ventresco, 307 Pa. 441, 445, 161 A. 534. It is of course well settled that a driver must maintain such control over his car as to enable him to stop within the range of his headlights however much his visibility may be impaired by storm, darkness, f\u00f3g, curve in the road or other conditions: Hutchinson v. Follmer Trucking Co., 338 Pa. 424, 427, 5 A. 2d 182; see also Mason v. Lavine, Inc., 302 Pa. 472, 477, 153 A. 754. Defendant was conscious of the weather conditions, the curve in the road and the wet or slippery surface; there is no evidence of any emergency not created by his own conduct which would diminish' the degree of care ordinarily exercisable by him: compare Simrell v. Eschenbach, 303 Pa. 156, 161, 154 A. 369. Both of defendant\u2019s declarations to the witnesses support averments in the statement of claim.\nIn view of what -has been said, it is obvious that decedent cannot be held, as matter of law, to have been guilty of contributory negligence.\nThe order refusing the judgment n. o. v. is affirmed.",
