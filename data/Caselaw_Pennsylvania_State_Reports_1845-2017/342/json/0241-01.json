        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Patterson,\nThis appeal is from the refusal of the court below to award one-half of the balance remaining in the estate of Andrew Kirchner, deceased, to the Board of Trustees of Norristown State Hospital, which sum it claims to be entitled to under the terms of the decedent\u2019s will.\nAndrew Kirchner died testate on March 5, 1937, leaving to survive him his widow, Wilhemenia Kirchner, who had been committed to the Norristown State Hospital, suffering from senile dementia, on September 17, 1936, where she remained until her death on January 13, 1938. By his will, dated November 13, 1934, testator directed, in paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b), that all of his assets be converted into cash and that the sum realized be given to trustees who should \u201ccarefully conserve my moneys in safe banking institutions\u201d. In paragraph 1(c), he provided that the trustees \u201care to see that my wife, Wilhemenia Kirchner, is placed in proper surroundings in a clean, refined German Institutional Home for Aged People, where she will be looked after to her every desire, and where she will have the comforts of home\u201d, such institution to provide freedom of worship, and that \u201cif feasible, I recommend the Old People\u2019s German Home, at Warrington, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, as the institution where she be entered.\u201d He provided, in paragraph 1(d), that the trustees should \u201cmake the necessary financial payments to this institution to provide for the maintenance\u201d of the wife and, in paragraph 1(f), directed that the wife \u201cbe provided for in this institution until the time of her death\u201d. T\u00e9stator then provided, in paragraph 1(g), that upon the wife\u2019s death \u201cone-half of the amount remaining is to be given to the Home where my wife was kept in her last years, while the other one-half is to be distributed equally\u201d among five named relatives.\nAt the audit of the first and final account of the executor of testator\u2019s estate, which was filed, following the death of the widow, on May 29, 1939, the Board of Trustees of the State Hospital claimed that it was entitled, under paragraph 1(g) of the will, to one-half of the balance remaining in the estate. The auditing judge sustained this claim and made an award to the Hospital accordingly, to which action the other parties in interest filed exceptions. After a hearing on the exceptions, the majority of the orphans\u2019 court concluded that the Hospital was not entitled under the terms of the will, sustained the exceptions taken to the award, and directed that the whole of the fund constituting the balance of testator\u2019s estate be paid over to the five named relatives: Umble\u2019s Estate, 323 Pa. 170. This appeal by the Board of Trustees of the Hospital followed.\nAppellant concedes that testator\u2019s use of the . expression \u201cthis institution\u201d requires that paragraphs 1(d) and 1(f) be construed as relating to an institution of the type particularized by him in paragraph 1(c), i. e., a \u201cclean, refined German Institutional Home for Aged People\u201d, but urges that because, in paragraph 1(g), \u201ctestator made no reference to the class or type of home, in which he had directed his trustees to place his wife, as he had in the two previous provisions, but provided merely that one-half of the remaining estate should be given to The Home\u2019 where his wife was kept in her last\nyears\u201d, it should be inferred that he \u201cintended that, there would be but one condition necessary to be fulfilled in order to qualify a home to become a legatee of one-half of the amount remaining after his wife\u2019s' death, and that condition was that the home should have, kept her in her. last years.\u201d. This inference cannot be drawn. Testator\u2019s direction in the immediately preceding paragraph of the will that the widow should \u201cbe provided for in this institution until the.time of her death,\u201d wherein he concededly referred, to an institution of, the type described in paragraph 1(c), obviously precludes any inference that he had in contemplation, when he executed his will, the possibility that she should be \u201ckept in her last years\u201d in an institution of any other type. Consequently, if appellant is to share in the balance of the estate, by virtue of paragraph 1(g), it-must appear that it , is an institution of the type prescribed by the testator.\nThe evidence shows that the Norristown State Hospital is a state institution, established and maintained primarily for \u201cthe reception, care and treatment of the indigent, insane\u201d (A.ct of May 5, 1876, P. L. 121, Section 9.) ;. that persons are not admitted simply because they are aged, but must also be mentally .underdeveloped or mentally impaired, and that persons so afflicted are admitted irrespective of age; that persons are admitted only upon being committed, voluntarily or involuntarily, and that when a patient\u2019s mental impairment has been cured, he may not be permitted to remain in the institution, but.must be discharged. While it may be that despite its denomination as a \u201chospital\u201d and despite the fact that it is restricted to persons with mental afflictions or deficiencies, preference being given to the indigent insane, the appellant institution might conceivably be regarded as a \u201chome\u201d, when the term is considered in a broad sense, manifestly it cannot, with any degree of propriety, be regarded as a \u201crefined German Institutional Home for Aged People\u201d such as testator prescribed for his wife when he wrote his will. Nor does the circumstance that it also \u201cperforms the functions of a home for elderly persons who are mentally incompetent to care for themselves\u201d, as the auditing judge found, alter the plain fact that it is not such an institution.\nIt appears that when testator executed his will he was aware of his wife\u2019s mental condition, for he directed, in paragraph 1(e), that the trustees should \u201cact for my wife in every case\u201d, describing her as being \u201cmentally unfit to take care of herself\u201d, and it is significant as bearing upon his intention that, knowing this, he nevertheless employed language which, in our opinion, clearly does not comprehend a mental institution of the type of appellant. Compare Hope\u2019s Estate, 253 Pa. 400. Also significant is the fact that following the commitment of his wife, nearly six months before his death, testator did not change his will in this respect. As is stated by the appellees: \u201cIf, because of the deterioration of the mental condition of his wife, he wanted the same reward to be held out to the Norristown State Hospital as he had provided for the Institutional Home of the type mentioned in his will, it is hardly likely that he would have failed to charige his will to specifically so provide.\u201d Under these circumstances, and particularly in the absence of evidence that he was convinced otherwise, the only reasonable assumption is that testator never abandoned hope that his wife would improve, and intended that when she did sufficiently regain her faculties to warrant it, his provisions for her maintenance and comfort \u201cin her last years\u201d should be carried out. As death overtook the wife before discharge from the appellant hospital, the situation which testator had in contemplation when he made the provision in question never arose and the intended gift, therefore, failed, as the court below very properly held.\nDecree affirmed. Costs to be paid by appellant.\nAppellant states: \u201cIn the court .below, appellant urged that, in any event, the court could invoke the cy pres doctrine in favor of this claim. On this appeal, the appellant has abandoned this argument becaus\u00e9 of the ruling of this Court in White\u2019s Estate, 340 Pa. 92.\u201d , ,",
