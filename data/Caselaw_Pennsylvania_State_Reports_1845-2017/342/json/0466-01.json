        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe plaintiff, Davidson, sued Patterson for injuries sustained while a guest passenger in the car of H. D. Brainard which collided with the car of the defendant Patterson. Patterson filed an answer denying the negligence charged against him and then, pursuant to Buie 2252, 332 Pa. cxxiii, filed a petition to add Brainard as a defendant, averring that Davidson\u2019s injuries resulted solely from Brainard\u2019s negligence. The court allowed the petition to join Brainard. The additional defendant then filed an answer denying defendant Patterson\u2019s averment. The plaintiff did not file a supplementary statement against the additional defendant pursuant to Buie 2258 (a) and therefore, in accord with Buie 2258 (c), was barred from recovery against him. After the period for filing a supplementary statement against the additional defendant had passed, he moved that he be dropped from the record. As the plaintiff elected not to proceed against him and, as the defendant Patterson had made no averments of liability of the additional defendant to him, there was no reason to keep him a party. As to amendment, see United Societies, etc., v. Klochak, 340 Pa. 159, 16 A. 2d 373. The court properly made the rule absolute. Compare Rau v. Manko, 341 Pa. 17, 17 A. 2d 422.\nJudgment affirmed.\nBrainard brought an action against Patterson, the subject of the appeal in Brainard v. Patterson, 342 Pa. 465. \u25a0",
