His will directed that all his debts should be paid “as soon as conveniently” after his decease; he left his property to his wife, Emma S. Krick, for life, “with the power ... to sell and make conveyance of real, and personal property, to invest the proceeds, etc.”; upon the death of his wife a fund' of $10,000 was to be set up and the income paid to his daughter Estella for life under a spendthrift trust, the principal to go to . her children, or, upon certain contingencies, to other persons; the remainder of the estate was left to Estella; the wife was appointed executrix of the will.</p>

Krick died September 7, 1937, but during the' nineteen years she was executrix she filed no account. In 1939 letters of administration d.b.n.c.t.a, were granted in the Estate of Wellington B. Krick to Berks County Trust Company, which thereupon petitioned the court for a citation against Daniel B. Shepp, who was the executor of the Estate of Emma S, Krick, to file an account on her behalf in her husband’s estate. The court so directed. Exceptions to the account were filed by the administrator. Upon the audit the court found that the estate was indebted to the executrix in the sum of $50,308.05 for expenditures made by her out of her personal funds to pay debts of the estate, <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>At hex’ death she had in her possession, as the sole remaining asset of the Wellington B. Krick Estate, a bond and mortgage in the sum of $50,000 payable to her as executrix. She had never, in her lifetime, assex’ted any claim or interest in or to this bond and mortgage, but, as the indebtedness to her- exceeded the amount of this asset, the court decreed that the bond and mortgage should be assigned to her own estate.</p>

It does not challenge the amount due to Emma S. Krick, as found by the court, but it contends that the $50,000 bond and mortgage is an asset not subject to her claim. ' The Wellington B. Krick Estate owned two properties, — one at 109 North 4th Street, Reading, which was sold- by the executrix for $12,000 under an order of the court for payment of debts, this sale being confirmed June 1, 1918, and the other at 635 Penn Street, Reading, which was conveyed by deed of December 27, 1919, signed by Emma S. Krick as executrix and in her individual capacity and by Estella K. Schaffer (nee Krick) and her husband. The latter property was sold for $75,000, of which $10,000 was paid in cash, a purchase money bond and mortgage of $50,000 was given to the executrix, being the bond and mortgage previously referred to, and a second mortgage for $15,000 was also given to her as executrix, which mortgage was subsequently paid and satisfied. The executrix, however, in ox*der to clear the title, was obliged to pay $48,848.38 to satisfy mortgage and judgment liens, expenses and commissions, so that the net proceeds from the sale of this property amounted to $26,151.62.</p>

L. 447, section 15(a), would not have been entitled to payment out of the proceeds of the Penn Street property, it follows that she is similarly debarred: <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>
