The original defendant filed an affidavit of defense in which he denied that the'scréen was caused to fair by reason of negligence on the ■ part of a servant or agent under his control, averring that, if the screen fell by reason of any negligence, it was the negligence of the Dith<a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>ridge Development Company, the owner of the apartment house, and thereafter, on January 31, 1940, more than three years after plaintiff’s injuries, he issued a writ of scire facias, under the Act of April 10, 1929, P. L. 479, as amended by the Acts of June 22, 1931, P. L. 663, May 18, 1933, P. L. 807, and June 25, 1937, P. L. 2118, to bring the Dithridge Development Company upon the record as additional defendant, averring that it would be “liable over” to him for any claim established by the plaintiff. The court made absolute a rule, to show cause why the writ of scire facias should not be quashed on the ground, inter alia, that the facts averred in, support of the allegation of “liability over” did not sustain any such legal conclusion; hence this appeal. . •</p>
