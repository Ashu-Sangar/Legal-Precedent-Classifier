Moore were issued by Prudential Insurance Company of America, in each of which his wife, Rosella Moore, was named as beneficiary. The right to change the beneficiary was reserved by the insured; should the <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>beneficiary not survive the insured, the amount due under the policies was to be paid to the insured’s executors, administrators or assigns.</p>

She brought this suit to recover under the policies, at first in her own right as beneficiary, but, by subsequent amendment, as administratrix of her husband’s estate. Defendant .filed an affidavit of defense which resisted recovery of additional benefits provided for in the policies if the death was due solely to external, violent and accidental means, the affidavit, alleging that in the altercation which led to Moore’s death he was the aggressor and therefore his death was not accidental. As to the portion of the claim relating to the ordinary life insurance, defendant asserted its willingness to make payment “to a person who can' receive the same without thereby' placing the said Rosella Moore in a position to make claim for a part of said insurance, as widow; of the insured, and thus allow her to reap indirectly a benefit from her own felonious and wrongful act in killing the insured.” The court struck off “new matter” alleged by defendant and made absolute plaintiff’s rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense as to thé face amount of the policies, leaving open for subsequent trial the question of defendant’s liability for the accidental death benefits.

While public policy dictates that the beneficiary should not be allowed to claim the insurance money, it does not demand that the contract itself be invalidated. The designation of a beneficiary is only an incident of the agreement, especially where, as here, the insured reserves to himself the power to change the beneficiary and thus retains control over the proceeds. If no beneficiary had originally been appointed, or if the beneficiary had died prior to the death of the insured, the proceeds would have gone to the insured’s estate, and the same result must follow when the beneficiary, though surviving the insured, has become personally disqualified. It was only her <em>own </em>rights in the policies that plaintiff destroyed when she killed the insured. He was the one who contracted with the company, and, having paid all the premiums, he, or his estate upon his death, should not lose the fruits of his contracts merely because the person whom he had designated as the beneficiary incapacitated herself from qualifying in that capacity.</p>

Superior Ct. xxxix), the beneficiary of a policy murdered the insured, her husband, and suit was brought against the company by the administrator of the estate of the insured. In sustaining a directed verdict for the plaintiff the court said (pp. 276-278) : “It is conceded that by her act Mrs. Freeney disqualified herself to become a beneficiary and an action by her could not be maintained against the defendant. Is the latter, therefore, relieved from liability to pay to anyone? The contract was made directly with Elmer Freeney. ... In naming the wife as beneficiary it was manifestly in eontem<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>plation of the parties that she would not only be alive but capable of receiving the benefits of the policy.

The condition on which payment was to be made has arisen; the . . . beneficiary has ceased to exist, legally speaking; ... On such a state of facts the fund should be paid to the estate of the decedent.” That case correctly states the law and rules the present controversy.</p>

It is not within the province of defendant, however, to raise that question. No problem of descent and distribution affects its liability as established by the policies. It has nothing to do with the application of the money.

Defendant suggests that a constructive trust of the proceeds of the policies should be set up in favor of the creditors of the insured aud his heirs (consisting of his children by a former wife) but excluding the beneficiary. But as Mr. Justice Drew said in his concurring opinion in <em>Tarlo’s Estate, </em>supra (page 327) : “Without overruling the principle expressed in Carpenter’s Estate . . . and doing violence to the statute of descent, the device of a constructive trust cannot be employed.” The only theory by which an equitable interest could be declared to exist in the creditors and heirs of the insured would be that the insurance money had become the property of the insured’s estate, but on that theory it can be administered <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>only in tbe orphans’ court and in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth thereto applicable. • If plaintiff should receive in that court any part of the proceeds of the policies, after payment of the debts of the estate and in common with other distributees, it would not be as beneficiary of the contracts of insurance, but as one entitled by the Intestate Act to a distributive share of her husband’s estate regardless of the source from which it was derived.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
