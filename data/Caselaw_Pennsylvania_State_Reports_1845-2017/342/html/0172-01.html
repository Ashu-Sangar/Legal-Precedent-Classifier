In 1936 there remained unpaid on the appropriations for 1934 and 1935 the sum of : $5,700, to recover which plaintiff brought mandamus proceedings against the township commissioners. On April 7,1936, the township solicitor entered into a written agreement with plaintiff’s counsel that judgments might ' be entered aggregating that amount, and that the township would enact an ordinance appropriating to plaintiff “for each year hereafter, at least the sum of Three Thousand ($3,000.00) Dollars, which said sum shall be paid to the plaintiff out of tax levies made for each year hereafter and al<a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>lotted to the Fire Appropriation Fund, said payments to be made to the plaintiff before any other moneys shall first be paid out of said Fund.” The township appropriated to plaintiff $3,000 for the year 1937 and the saíne sum in 1938, but neither of these amounts was paid. On October 12,- 1938, thé township passed an ordinance, apparently in pursuance of- the 1936 agreement, providing that “the sum of $3,000.00 shall be appropriated each year for the use of the Volunteer Fire Department of Coal Township* find the said sum shall be provided' for in the Annual Budget of said Township of Coal, and shall be paid to the proper officers of said Department for their use thereof annually.” The present petition • for writ of alternative mandamus was brought by plaintiff against the commissioners to secure from them an order on the township treasurer to pay, out of the first moneys received by him, the appropriations of $3,000 for each of the years 1937 and 1938, together with $481.50 interest which remained unpaid on the judgments entered in 1936. The court ordered payment of the $481.50*- and that item is no longer in controversy, but dismissed the writ as to the $3,000 items* and from that dismissal this appeal was taken.-</p>

There-was some question raised at the trial of the cause as to whether the commissioners had approved the agreement made by the solicitor of the township in 1936, but for present purposes it may be assumed that such approval was given. • The portion of that agreement, however, which obligated the township to enact- an ordinance' making an appropriation to- plaintiff:- for each year thereafter was invalid and wholly ineffectual for the purpose, and this is true also of the ordinance of October 12, 1938, which provided for similar future appropriations.

It cannot enter into a contract which will extend beyond the term for which the members of the body were elected; It cannot, by ordinance or resolution, make it obligatory upon a future body to pass an ordinance. Therefore -the commissioners could not agree in 1936, nor ordain in 1938, that later commissioners, in the exercise of their governmental power, would appropriate funds to the Volunteer Fire Department.</p>

The items listed in the budget designated the needs of the township for the year, but all funds for general purposes were kept in one account, and orders were drawn on this fund and charged against the particular budget item in question, the appropriation to plaintiff in the budget being labeled as “Contribution to Volunteer Firemen.” The budgetary appropriations did not create in plaintiff a vested right in any fund.

    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[273,772,1147,480]]]'>The situation may. be thus summarized: The township budgeted money to plaintiff, not because of any valid or enforceable contractual obligation, but in. the exercise of its governmental or legislative capacity. Unfortunately, it found itself unable to collect sufficient taxes to make the appropriations good.. Whatever disappointment this may have occasioned to the (Volunteer Fire Department, that body has no claim which it can successfully assert either at law or in equity.</p>
