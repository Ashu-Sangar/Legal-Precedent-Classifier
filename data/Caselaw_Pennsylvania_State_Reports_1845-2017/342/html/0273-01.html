On demand after date for value received I promise to pay to the order of ourselves $35000°%oo. The sum of $35000 and 00 cts Dollars at the Union National Bank of Scranton, Pa. without defalcation.” It was alleged that it was signed by fourteen persons and endorsed by the makers and that the note was delivered to the plaintiff, Miners Savings Bank of Pittston, for value. The copy in the statement of claim disclosed no altera<a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>tions or erasures. Ten of tlie defendants were served and they, together with W. F. Barron, joined in an affidavit of defense in which they denied that they signed or delivered the note declared on.</p>

The record of the first trial is not included in the printed record presented to us, but we gather from the opinion of the court certain facts with' reference thereto. At the first trial, after the original’ note had been produced and the plaintiff had proved the signatures and endorsements, it offered certain proofs with relation to the alterations. Counsel for defendants and the trial judge were then of the opinion that the original note produced was not the note Set forth in the statement of claim and that this constituted such a variance between allegata and probata as to exclude the proofs which plaintiff. proposed.to make. After consultation, a juror was withdrawn and the case was continued to afford an opportunity for a rule to amend and for consideration of the question by the trial judge. The amendment had not been made when the case was called for trial a second time.</p>

The defendants = who appeared and defended stipulated that the signatures as makers and endorsers on the original note were their signatures. Plaintiff then prodficed a witness and pro-’ posed to prove that the note was then in the same condition -as it was when it was negotiated at the plaintiff bank; The offer was objected to by defendants and the trial judge sustained the objection upon the ground that the note must first be proved and received in evidence before such testimony as was tendered could be heard: The judge was evidently of the opinion that there was a <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>fatal variance and that the proofs could not be received under the pleadings. We. believe this evidence should have been received. Orderly and logical procedure would seem to require that the plaintiff, in attempting to explain the alteration, should first show whether the alteration was made before or after it was negotiated with the bank.</p>

The plaintiff next proposed to prove by witnesses that all the makers and endorsers of the note in question were directors and stockholders of the Peoples Savings &amp; Trust Company .of Duryea; that prior to September 2, 1931, an examination of the affairs of. the bank was made by the Secretary of Banking, which disclosed an impairment of capital and surplus of the bank; that the Secretary then made demand upon the makers and endorsers of, the note to make good the impairment of capital and surplus; that the makers then agreed to make a note payable to themselves and place it in the hands of W F. Barron, treasurer, of the bank, for the purpose of negotiation to the. end that the impairment be made good; that, the note was executed and endorsed, but that-, prior to negotiation with the, plaintiff bank the,name of Jacob, Kurlanchek was cancelled or stricken out as maker and endorser; that Barron.received from the plaintiff bank iu exchange for the note five certificates of deposit totaling. $35,000, receiving the same as representative of the directors,, defendants herein; that the makers of the note, in suit had knowledge that he had permitted Jacob Kurlanchek to cancel and strike out his name as maker and endorser,; that they recognized and ratified his act-by <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>paying several installments of interest on' said note and plédging tlie certificates of deposit, which had been delivered by' the bank as a consideration for' the note, to the Secretary of Banking to make good the impairment of capital and surplus; and-that tlie'Duryea bank having passed into the hands of the Secretary for the .purpose of liquidation, the certificates were endorsed to the Secretary of Banking on August 29, 1932,' in accord with the agreement of the directors and the makers of the note. -</p>

L. 194, §124 (56 PS §276). An alteration is material which changes “the number or the relations of the parties”: §125 (56 PS §278). “Where an instrument containing the words ‘I promise to pay’ is signed by two or more persons they are deemed to be jointly and severally liable thereon”: §17 (56 PS §22). .“An instrument is negotiated when it is transferred <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>from one person to another in such manner, as to constitute the transferee the holder thereof”: §30 (56 PS §81).

    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[253,671,1154,1736]],["BL_301.1",301,[184,345,1147,202]]]'>We are of the opinion that there is no merit in the conclusion of the court that the failure to note the alteration in the copy set forth in the declaration formed the basis for concluding that there was a fatal variance between the allegations and proofs. The original note had been produced at the first trial so that defendants at the second trial knew that the note contained an alteration or cancellation as well as the exact nature of such change. The Practice Act of 1915, P. L. 483, §5 (12 PS §386), provides: “Every pleading shall have attached to it copies of all notes . . . upon which the party pleading relies for his claim.” While we have held that the copy must set forth the whole instrument <em>(Finch v. White, </em><a href="/pa/190/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="190 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="905072" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0086-01">190 Pa. 86</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.%20457" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="42 A. 457">42 A. 457</a>; <em>McCready v.

If we accept plaintiff’s offers, as we must for the present purpose, the changes were made before the note was negotiated and the bank had no claim against Kurlanchek. He was not a party to the note and he was not included as a defendant. Aside from all this the plaintiff incorporated in the record, by permission of the court and with the acquiescence of defendants, a photostatic copy of the note. The claim of the plaintiff was thereby definitely fixed and the defendants were fully apprised of the alterations so that the objection in this respect becomes a shallow technicality without substance. In fact the court below, in its opinion, said: “That being a matter of form, we would have permitted an amendment at the first trial were that the only trouble and had the motion been made.” The circumstances in the case of <em>Berks County Trust Co. v. Lyte, </em>

In any event, the plaintiff has now offered to amend, to which offer we will give further con-, sideration.</p>
    <p id="b301-3" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[183,566,1149,1304]]]'>The serious question presented to us arises by reason of the granting of the nonsuit after plaintiff’s offers of evidence were rejected and its motion to amend its statement was refused. The court below, in a carefully prepared opinion, has recorded for the benefit of the parties and this court its reasons for its action. Those reasons were, briefly and in substance, that the proposed amendment explaining when and under what circumstances the erasure or cancellation of the Kurlanchek signatures was made presented a situation that defendants could not be expected to be prepared to meet without notice, and that the plaintiff failed to take advantage of an opportunity given it to amend before trial, thereby causing serious delay in this litigation now long extended. It is apparent that the nonsuit was granted not because the offers of proof, if fulfilled, taken with the proposed amendments, would not have made out a prima facie case for the jury, but because the presentation of the amendment ivas unduly delayed. On the oral argument counsel for the defendants also contended that the amendment introduced a new cause of action after the statute had run on the claim. We are all of one mind that the motion to amend should have been granted and the proofs received.</p>
