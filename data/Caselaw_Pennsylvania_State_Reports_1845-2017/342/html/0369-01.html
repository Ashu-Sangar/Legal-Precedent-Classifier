Furthermore, the State of Pennsylvania is not crippled in Its governmental activities by this tax. If it finds itself so crippled, it can take from the City of Philadelphia at any time the authority to tax any of the city’s residents who are employees of the government of Pennsylvania. The only power that Philadelphia has to impose any tax on its residents is the power the state gives it in the “Sterling Act.” Repeal this act and the power vanishes and the tax falls.</p>

This is fundamental. The power to tax, where delegated by the legislature to a municipality or other local subdivision, is confined to the subjects of taxation enumerated in the delegation of power, and also to the purposes designated in such delegation. . . .

We there said: “Subject to constitutional limitations, the elementary premise is that the power to tax vests exclusively in the legislature; it may by express direction delegate segments of the taxing power to municipál <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>bodies, whose exercise thereof is confined to the power so delegated.” In the instant case, it is conceded that the legislature has delegated certain of its taxing power to the City of Philadelphia.

This attitude on the part of the state may increase the difficulties of collecting this tax as against state employees but it does not make the ordinance unconstitutional, nor does it prove that the “Sterling Act” does not authorize the enactment of such an ordinance.</p>
