It was shown that, in 1932, appellant was indebted to appellees’decedent in the sum of $53,000, which debt appears in .the-books of the partnership of which appellant is the surviving member, under-date of January 2,1932, with a notation “Int. 4% Semiannually July &amp;. Jan; each year — July 9&gt; 1932 changed to 3%%”, following which are entries showing the payment of interest in July, 1932, and in January and August, 1933. These entries were identified by Miss Goldstein, who. testified that they had been made by her, at the direction of appellant, in the course of the partnership business. "While she stated that the original entry -referred .to a- bond and mortgage executed by appellant and his son to the decedent on January 2, 1932, in the amount of $53,000, bearing interest at 4% and payable in 5 years, which she testified she had seen at the time of execution, she admitted that she did not know whether the bond and mortgage had ever been delivered to the decedent and that she had no conversation with thé decedént regarding- the mortgage or the reduction of interest,, but had been informed of these matters by appellant.</p>

She explained that the payment of September 11, 1933, had erroneously been entered as a payment of interest and that she added “Prin”- as-a correction, appellant having informed her that the decedent would make no further charge of interest on the obligation^ The witness also explained the notation upon a check of the partnership produced by appellees, bearing the same date and payable to the decedent in the sum of $200* “On account int.” as án error; and that the figure $52,000, appearing in the first book-entry for 1934, was an error for $53,000.</p>

Finally, appellant offered in evidence a bond and mortgage, dated September 1, 1934, found in the possession of the decedent at her death and since recorded, which was executed by appellant and his son to the decedent to secure the payment of the principal sum of $52,200, without interest, ten years from its date, and this was admitted without objection.</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[285,856,1148,1072]]]'>The jury returned a verdict for appellant, specially finding that the $3,500 judgment note was included in “the mortgage”, whereupon appellees filed a motion for judgment n. o. v. This motion having been granted by the court below, appellant has appealed, contending that under the evidence the jury was warranted in inferring that the decedent, who was appellant’s sister-in-law, had withdrawn her savings to satisfy the indebtedness of his. partnership, to a bank, had. accepted the first bond and mortgage from the partners in satisfaction of all other obligations, inadvertently omitting to return the judgment note here involved, and had surrendered that bond and mortgage upon the delivery of a second bond and mortgage to secure the reduced indebtedness, having agreed to forego the receipt of interest because the bank in which she had formerly deposited the savings loaned to appellant had failed and would have paid no interest on the fund had it not been withdrawn; consequently, that the verdict of the jury in his favor should have been sustained.</p>

The holder is not required to prove that it has not been paid. His case is made by the production of the instrument in the first instance, and the burden of showing payment <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>is on him who alleges it”: <em>Whitney v.

The sole question presented, therefore, is whether sufficient legally competent evidence was offered by appellant in support of his defense of payment, by inclusion in subsequent obligations, to overcome this presumption,.

    <p id="b257-3" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[168,742,1150,1087]]]'>We think the question must be answered in the negative. The entry of the word “Paid” in appellant’s books was not evidence of payment. It was merely the bookkeeper’s record of a self-serving statement made by appellant, and there was no evidence that the decedent had access to the partnership books or that she was aware of the entry. Nor does the “Uniform Business Records As Evidence Act” of May 4, 1939, P.. L. 42, which provides that records made in the regular course of business shall be admitted in evidence “if, in : the opinion, of the court, the sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its admission”, purport to make such record admissible, particularly in a suit against the estate of a decedent. Here the only source of information was appellant himself, the time and method of payment are not shown in the entry, and it is the. statement of a conclusion rather than a fact. Clearly it was inadmissible. See <em>Ducoign v. Schreppel, </em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Yeates%20346" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Yeates 346">1 Yeates 346</a>; <em>Saam v.

The altered and defaced document , offered in evidence was properly excluded in the absence of ¿ny proof that it had been delivered to the decedent, and even if delivery had been shown, the question of whether the alterations were made before or after such delivery would have remained unanswered.
