On the above date after working hours, and at about 5:30 p.m. he entered the building ,to return to his room. The statement, alleged that at the . time aforesaid plaintiff “walked to the elevator shaft on the ground floor of the building and, finding the door thereto partly open and no guard in place and believing the elevator, lift .to be level with the floor where he was standing, walked through the opening, and suddenly and without warning fell to the bottom of the elevator shaft, sustaining thereby serious and permanent injuries.” The statement also alleged that the <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>defendant failed “to provide or maintain good, sufficient and adequate light in the area and vicinity of the elevator shaft so as to properly illuminate and bring into view the actual condition of the elevator shaft at the time the plaintiff fell therein.” After trial the jury awarded plaintiff $7,000. The motion of the defendant for judgment n. o. v. was refused and an order was made granting the plaintiff the option to remit the sum of $1,745.25 or suffer a re-trial of the case because óf the excessiveness of the verdict. The plaintiff then filed á remittitur and judgment was entered in his behalf for $5,254.75. This appeal was then taken.</p>

The third class of cases is where a .person, walks in a, dim light and has reason to think that an elevator is at the, floor when in fact it is not; and . he uses his best .judgment as .he proceeds and then meets with an, accident.

As I took it the floor being there, and no barrier being there, I walked off on what I thought was the floor -of the elevator; I fell into the shaft.” It must be noted that in this case of <em>Murphy v. Bernheim &amp; Sons, </em>the plaintiff was deceivéd <em>by his </em>senses, the condition of the light being such that the mingling “of the shadow with the dust and particles” made him think that he perceived the floor of the elevator when in fact none was there. The plaintiff there used his senses and we- therefore held' that whether or not he was guilty of negligence was a question-for the jury; In the . instant case the plaintiff did not-use his senses at- all; he relied éxclusively upon his reasoning powers. He concluded that <em>because the outer door dould be opened, </em>the elevator must be in position inside the door. If he had exercised his sense of feeling, it would have informed him that the elevator was not there. If he had lighted a match and exercised his sense of sight, his eyes- would have told him that the elevator was not there; All animals,- including man, must depend primarily upon their senses to warn them of impending danger. For example, when one is about to drive across a railroad, he' must not only stop but he must also look with his eyes and listen with his ears. He must do this even if it is a gate-protected crossing and the gates' are-up. If from that latter, fact, -he-reasons that no train is approaching and a train is in fact approaching and-he is injured by it, he cannot escape the imputation of negligence by pleading that he used his reasoning powers. “Self-preservation is the first <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>law of nature” and no one exhibits normal obedience to that law unless he uses <em>both </em>his reasoning power <em>and </em>his senses for his own preservation. In the <em>Murphy </em>case (supra) we said: “When one is moving in the dark he must proceed with the greatest caution and literally ‘feel his way around.’ ” The instinct of self-preservation impels a man of ordinary prudence to avoid by the vigilant use of all of Ms.-faculties, a danger that should obviously -be-apprehéhded. In <em>Murray v. Earl, </em><a href="/pa/282/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="282 Pa. 517" data-case-ids="1088388" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0517-01">282 Pa. 517</a>, 520, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20A.%20436" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="128 A. 436">128 A. 436</a>, this court said: “Where the entrance is dark, it would seem that ordinary care would condemn the act of a person Who steps into an elevator shaft, knowing its location, without satisfying himself that the elevator is there.”</p>
    <p id="b389-3" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[166,1122,1152,699]]]'>The grievous error which plaintiff made was in. accepting his reasoning faculties, as the sole assurer, of his safetyi In the absence of sufficient light to enable him to see into the shaft he <em>assumed </em>that <em>because </em>the outer door was movable the elevator must be there. He thus placed improvident reliance on the perfection of the door-locking mechanism and on defendant’s supervision of it;. No man of common.caution will rely -for his safety upon the watchfulness of others when his-own senses are available, to apprise him of likely imminent danger. When an individual <em>ean </em>assure his own safety by the use of his senses, he mast do so or abide the consequences of his carelessness.</p>
