Hensel died on January 25, 1934, leaving a will in paragraph 4 of which he provided as follows: “I give and bequeath to. Union Trust Company of Pennsylvania, Trustee hereunder, my real estate known as and numbered 28 and 30 South Third Street, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in trust nevertheless, to pay to my wife, Maude V. Hensel, the. income therefrom”. Following the death of the widow on April 25, 1934, appellants, who are her heirs at law, instituted these proceedings, in ejéctmentj contending that, under paragraph 4 of Hensel’s will, their decedent took an absolute estate in the 28 and 30 South Third Street properties and claiming to-be the owners thereof. under the intestate laws. Appellees, who claim the real estate in dispute under the residuary clause of the will of Phillip K. Hensel, filed demurrers on the ground that the terms of the will gave the widow, Maude V. Hensel, merely a life estate in the properties, which demurrers , the court below sustained, and these appeals followed.</p>
