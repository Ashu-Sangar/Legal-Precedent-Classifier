Mattison owned all the stock of Keasbey and Mattison Company. Certain litigation between them was compromised by Mattison purchasing Keasbey’s shares for $3,900,000, of which $750,000 was paid in cash and $3,150,000 by the delivery to Keasbey of Mattison’s bond for that amount secured by the deposit with Eidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company of all the shares of the company’s stock. The bond, which was dated January 11, 1929, provided for the payment of the principal in seven annual instalments on January 25th of each year thereafter, the first six of <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>$500,000 each and the last $150,000, all with interest at the rate of six per .cent per annum.</p>

It was provided that “for the purposes of this deed all interest required to be paid by the terms of the bond ... on the entire principal sum . . . and on each and every part thereof, is to be considered income.” It will be noted that Keasbey did not assign all his right, title and interest in and to the bond to the trustee but reserved to himself the $500,000 instalments due January 25, 1930 and 1932, and the final in stalment of $150,000 due January 25,1936.</p>

This division was made on the basis of the principal sums OAving to the testamentary trustee and the trustee under the deed of $650,000 and $1,500,000 respectively, ignoring the fact that the trust inter vivos might be entitled to an additional share by reason of the assignment to it of all the interest payable under the terms of the Mattison bond.</p>

Thereafter Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company filed its account as trustee under the deed in the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County and as testamentary trustee in the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County. At the audit of the former account the executor of the Estate of Helen Keasbey Frischkorn contended that the proceeds of the Mattison bond allocated to the trust inter vivos should be applied to the interest required to be paid under the bond before any application was made to the principal of the trust, since the interest, according to the terms of the deed, was to be considered income under the trust; in the alternative he contended that there should be a proper apportionment between principal and income. The auditing judge rejected the claim for application <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>of the px'oceeds first to interest, but allowed a certain nxeasure of apportionment.</p>

The court in banc did not pass upon the merits of the adjudication, but took the position that before the relative rights of the life tenants and the remaindermen under the trust could be determined it should be made certain that the total proceeds had been properly divided between the trust inter vivos and the testamentary trust and that the former had received all to which it was entitled. It pointed out that that matter could be determined only in the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County where the account of the testamentary trustee was pending, because, while the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County could surcharge the trustee under the deed for any excess improperly paid to the other trust, the Montgomery County court alone could make the necessary order on the testamentary trustee if it found that some of the proceeds allocated to that trust should be returned to the trust inter vivos. The court said: “We have considerable doubt concerning the accountant’s action in ignoring the right of the inter vivos trust to apportionment with respect to ‘interest’ on the entire obligation and in accepting the division solely on the basis of the principal claims. . . . As a matter of procedure ... it seems unwise and impractical to consider surcharging a fiduciary for failure to prosecute a legal claim when proceedings involving the claim itself are pending befoxm a coux*t of competent jurisdiction which can adjudicate all phases of the question in dispute. Since the excess, or overpayment, if any, is in the testamentary trust, for which an account is presently pending in Montgomery County, a majority of the court is of opinion that we should suspend confirmation of the adjudication and direct the trustee of the trust inter vivos to present a claim against <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>the testamentary trustee for the alleged excess or overpayment.” Accordingly, the court dismissed all the exceptions “pro forma”, and recommitted the record to the auditing- judge '“to await the termination of the proceedings in Montgomery County relating to said claim.” From that order the executor of the Estate of Helen Keasbey Frischkorn appéals.</p>
