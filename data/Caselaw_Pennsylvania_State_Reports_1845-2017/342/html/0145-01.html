On November 1, 1926, the bank’s Board of Directors notified Potruch- and Rupp that- it would, not renew these notes unless they were covered by sufficient collateral. The minutes of the bank show that on November 8, 1926, “on proper, motion made, seconded and carried the cashier was authorized to secure from Aaron Potruch a.mortgage for $47,000 to cover the amount , of indebtedness with us, which mortgage is to be used as security in addition <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>to the endorsement of Lawrence H. Rupp.” On November 17, 1926, the Board of Directors of the bank accepted the second mortgage for $47,000 as collateral for these notes, in addition to Rupp’s endorsement. The first mortgage on the property was in the amount of $65,000. The second mortgage for $47,000 is in the usual form and does not make any reference to the fact that it was given as collateral security for the obligations. At the time this mortgage was given, Potruch was indebted to the bank in the sum of $17,921.29 <em>on other obligations to which Rupp was not a party. </em>This indebtedness continued in excess of $20,000 thereafter. The Rupp endorsed notes of Potruch, which aggregated $47,000 on November 17, 1926, were reduced to $29,000 by December 3, 1931. Potruch’s total indebtedness to the Lehigh Valley National Bank on December 3, 1931, was $59,220. In this total are included $16,500 borrowed in February, 1928, and $5,000 borrowed in May, 1928. Under date of April 10, 1931, the bank entered the second mortgage for $47,000 upon a collateral register sheet, in that bank, signed by Aaron Potruch- and bearing his endorsement as follows: “For value I assign the following as collateral subject to all the provisions relating thereto in my notes now or hereafter given to Lehigh Valley National Bank, Bethlehem, Pa.” On October 14, 1931, Potruch executed and delivered to the bank his demand renewal note for $5,000 and on July 7, 1932, a similar note for $16,500, and he specifically pledged as collateral security for the payment of these nates and of any other liability or liabilities to the holder thereof, due or to become due, or that might be thereafter contracted, whether direct or contingent, or whether now or thereafter acquired, “the collateral described on collateral leaf bearing payor’s signature.” In this “described collateral” was the above mentioned $47,000 mortgage. <em>Rupp </em>was <em>not </em>liable on any of these notes in the amounts of $16,500, $5,000, and $500, respectively.</p>

They were placéd in the bank’s cash vault and were marked as additional collateral for notes of Aaron Potruch.” 6. No officer or director of the bank “knew or was ever told by Aaron Potruch or Lawrence H. Rupp of any restriction upon the said bond and mortgage and their use as general collateral security for all the obligations and indebtednesses of Potruch with: the bank.” The 9th finding is in accord with our statement above made about the entry of the $47,000 mortgage upon the bank’s collateral register sheet, and the endorsement on that sheet, signed by Potruch. The 12th finding is in accord with our statement above made about Potruch’s demand renewal note for $5,000 and his specific pledge of the $47,000 mortgage as collateral for “the payment of said note and of any other liability or' liabilities to the holder thereof) due or to become due, . . . direct or contingent or whether • now or thereafter acquired.” The 16th finding is in accord with our statement above made about Potruch’s demand renewal note for $16,500 and his specific pledge of the $47,000 mortgage as collateral for “the payment of said noté and of any other liability or liabilities to the holder thereof, due or to become due”.</p>

All the cases show that subrogation is granted as a means of placing the ultimate burden of the debt upon the person who should bear it. The law gives the creditor the right to enforce the payment of the debt due him in whatever .way is legitimately open'to. him,-and equity never'attempts prejudicially to interfere with the creditor’s exercise of his legal right.

However, the long period of inaction does indicate that both Rupp and the appellant had little faith in their claim. Rupp was notified on November 18,1931, by E. W. Cromwell, Vice-President of the bank, as follows: “We must again remind you that this mortgage was secured by the bank to protect themselves for any liability over and above the indebtedness covered by what we felt were strong endorsements such as your own and the present emergency in the affairs of Mr. Potruch shows the wisdom of that action. If we were to surrender any of our rights at the present time it would not only .be bad business on our part but we would be subject to very strong criticism from the National Bank Examiner.” Rupp lived four years, five months and eleven days after the receipt of this letter and though he was an able attorney fully cognizant of all his legal rights, he-instituted no action against the bank. Appellant became the successor to all of Rupp’s legal rights in respect to this collateral on July 23, 1936, (when he was appointed trustee of his bankrupt estate) and he did not file this bill until September 15, 1939.
