It appeared that with unexpired sentences of from “40 to 80 years, plus back time for parole violation of 22 years and 9 months,” the relator was sentenced <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>to life imprisonment under section 2 of the Act of April 29, 19.29, P. L. 854, 19 PS § 922.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In that proceeding the relator complained that, while sentencing him under section 2, the court had failed to = comply- with section 4 by.not vacating previous sentences imposed on him. This Court thereupon corrected the omission by vacating the sentences imposed in 1921 and 1923 and directed that the sentence of life imprisonment “shall take effect immediately.”</p>

Section 4, in part, provides ; "“If at any time within two years, either after conviction or sentence, it shall appear that a person convicted of any of the crimes set forth in section one of this act has previously been convicted' of any such crimes three or more times, it shall be the duty of the district attorney of the county in which the last conviction was had to file an information accusing the said person of such previous convictions, and to serve a copy of such information upon the defendant thirty days be<a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>fore taking any further proceedings in court as hereinafter set forth. Thereupon the court in which the last conviction was had shall cause the said person whether confined in prison, penitentiary or otherwise, to be brought before it, and shall inform him of the allegations contained in such information and of his right to be tried as to the truth thereof according to law, and shall require such offender to say whether he is the same person as charged in such information or not. If he says he is not the same person, or refuses to answer, or remains silent, his plea or the fact of his silence shall be entered on record, and a jury shall be empanelled to inquire whether the offender is the same person mentioned in the several records as set forth in such information. If the jury finds that he is the same person, or if he acknowledges or confesses in open court after being duly cautioned as to his rights that he is the same person, the court may sentence him to imprisonment for life prescribed in section two of this act, and shall vacate any previous sentence notwithstanding that the term of court in which the last sentence was imposed may have expired. ...”</p>

If for present purposes, we assume that no-information whs filed, that omission, in the circumstances disclosed by the record, will not vitiate the. sentence. It is of course true, as relator argues, that penal statutes must be strictly construed, but that also means, as has frequently been said, that they must be construed with common sense. The relator’s identity, as the person formerly convicted, must be regarded as “acknowledged” or “confessed” (to use the words of the Act) both ;by his former proceeding and also by this one. Presumably, he was.-cautioned by the court as the Act provided; as no issue appeared, there was none to try-and it became the duty of the court to pass sentence under the Act of 1929. Nothing would be gained -by now sending the record down for a trial as to identity; it clearly appears that the.omission, if one. be assumed, was harmless error.</p>
