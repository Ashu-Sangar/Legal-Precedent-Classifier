Hannum, Jr., trustees under the will of John P. Crozer, deceased, on June 24, 1940, petitioned the court below for an order authorizing the payment, out of the trust estate, of compensation to the guardian ad litem, of fees of his counsel, counsel for the trustees and for the life tenants, and of costs and expenses incurred by counsel, “properly allocating the charging of the said compensation and counsel fees against principal, or against income, or against both principal and income”, as the court should direct. While the charges, which aggregate $11,498.71, include an unspecified amount representing fees of counsel for the trustees, for services in connection with the routine administration of the trust, they largely resulted from the preparation and presentation of a former appeal to this Court, taken by the guardian and trustee ad litem from the refusal of the court below to sustain exceptions filed by him to the trustees’ third account <em>(Crozer3s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/336/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="336 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1195590" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0266-01">336 Pa. 266</a>), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with that litigation in the court below having been already paid, without objection, out of principal. By its final decree, the court below directed that $2,000 of the charges in question be charged against the life tenants, “as and for their proper and. fair share” of the expense, and <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>that the balance remaining be charged against principal. These appeals, one by the trustees and the other by the guardian ád litem, followed. The reasonableness of the sums thus authorized to be paid is conceded by all parties in interest, the sole question presented by . the ■appeals being whether, as appellants maintain; ■ they should have been charged wholly against income. ■</p>

As the point of incidence of the expense'must be. determined, in such a-case, as between innocent pérsons, equitable considerations dictate that it' should be borne by all the parties, which object is attained if the expense of the litigation is charged to principal; thereby the life tenants as well as the remaindermen share the burden, for, as the principal is thus reduced, the income is also proportionately reduced, automatically throwing a just and fair portion of the burden of the'charge upon the income beneficiaries. , See Restatement of Trusts, section 233, Comment (g). Conceding all of this,' appellants poiht to certain provisions of the will which they contend require a' departure from these rules in this estate.</p>

Appellees, who are life tenants, point out that thé words “created' as aforesaid”, in the latter provision of the will, do not refer'to the word “principal”, but to the word “trust”, and take the position, in- effect sustained by the court below, that under the former, provision, which they contend amounts to “no morethama usual definition of ‘net income’ ”, the court was not bound to charge all the expenses in question against income-; further, that the allocation of the .charges; by the court below was equitable and proper.</p>

Moreover, the court below had expressly found, “after a careful examination of the! will and careful conferences about its <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>meaning”, an intention that “every kind of outlay”, and particularly the item of additional compensation allowed the trustees for exceptional “services rendered in conserving the estate” there involved, might be allowed out of income. The provisions of the will in that case, which were held to justify a departure from the course ordinarily to be pursued, are manifestly not comparable with the provisions now before us and the case is, therefore, as appellees state, “of little assistance here”. A case which does, however, have an important bearing here, is <em>Davidson’s </em>Estate, supra, not referred to by either side. There this Court expressly approved the allocation of counsel fees, incurred in litigation necessary to collect upon a $60,000 note included as part of the trust estate, between the life tenant and rémaindermen, in proportion to the total amount of principal and interest collected, and this notwithstanding a provision that income should be paid only “after deducting necessary expenses and taxes”, saying, at 358: “While the income and not the principal is generally liable for the expense of administering the fund <em>(Crawford’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/256/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="256 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1030724" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0504-01">256 Pa. 504</a>), yet this rule has an exception where unusual or extraordinary expenses are necessarily incurred, and <em>although the will in this case expressly directs that the dividends should he paid cafter deducting necessary expenses and taxes’, it must he presumed that this had reference only to the usual expenses of administration </em>and will not be construed as extending to a case like the present, where expensive legal proceedings were necessary not only to collect the interest but also to preserve the corpus of the estate from actual loss.”</p>

Payment of <em>“all </em>direct or collateral inheritance, succession, estate or transfer taxes” is directed to be made out of the residuary estate, and testator empowers his executors to sell and dispose of “any or <em>all" </em>real estate and to convey same free of “any and <em>all" </em>liens and encumbrances and discharged from “any and <em>all" </em>trusts. Under such circumstances, and particularly in view of the immediately following words of qualification, “necessary”, “proper” and “legal”, the word “should receive no emphasis in the particular instance greater than in the other cases where it has no conceivable meaning”: <em>In re Heist, </em><a href="/nys/137/0768-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="77 Misc. 432" data-case-ids="7659008" data-case-paths="/nys/137/0768-01">77 Misc.
