His basic error is the premise that he and= his predecessors , in title:held the property.in question <em>by adverse possession. </em>There was nothing adverse about appellant’s posses<a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>sión until after John H. Lyme died on January 16, 1939. • Lyme was in lawful possession of the premises of which his wife died seised, until March 30, 1904, when he conveyed <em>Ms interest </em>in these premises to Annie CL Stoner. Her right of possession thus acquired vested by divers conveyances in the appellant, as above noted. That John H. Lyme may have <em>believed </em>that he owned this land in fee simple by reason of his wife’s deed to him bn June 1, 1883, does not affect in the slightest degree.the legal situation of these parties. <em>“Color </em>of title” contributes nothing to the <em>fibre </em>of title. In <em>McCall v. </em>Neely, <a href="/watts/3/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Watts 69" data-case-ids="1841248" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0069-01">3 Watts 69</a>, 72,- Chief Justice Gibson said: “An entry, is by color of title when it is made under a bona fide and not pretended-to claim to a title existing in another.” In other words, the occupier of land-'.under “color of title” differs^ from an avowed squatter on land only in his state of mind. For example, an individual who tákes and carries away another’s personal property in the honest belief that it is his, has no felonious intent yet'the good faith which attended the taking is nb défense when the legal owner claims his property. “Color bf title” is merely the appearance of title without its reality. It saves its possessor only from the imputation of being a naked trespasser. The defendant and his predecessors in the occupancy of the land in question, back to and. including John H. Lyme, had the statuses neither of title holders nor trespassers. They were life tenants and as such were in lawful possession of the premises until John H. Lyme died. Their successive occupancies of these premises did not start the statute of limitations running against this plaintiff, for no principle of law is more firmly established than that the statute of limitations does not begin to run against an heir at law to a property held by one who occupies it as a tenant by the curtesy or as grantee of the tenant by the curtesy until the death of the tenant by the curtesy. The statute could not begin to run against the holder of the title until she had a right of entry.</p>

From the period the right of entry vested in the plaintiffs, and from that period only did the statute begin to run against them.” As to the Act of 1856 (supra), this court said: “It is alleged that the Act of 1856 has introduced a different rule. Such however is not the case. That act does but affect the former rule as to persons of unsound mind,, married, women and minors, who, previously thereto, had ten years after the removaT of their several disabilities within which to bring suit against such as might have intruded upon théir right of entry ; now, however, by the statute above mentioned, the lapse of thirty years, from the time when such right of entry accrued, bars their right of action, though the disabilities therein referred to be not removed : <em>Hunt v. Wall, </em>25 P. F. Smith 413. It will be observed, however, that the right of action in such persons is presupposed, for the-time runs from the period when the right of entry begins, but .where this right does not exist no action lies, and, hence, the statute can have-no ■ effect. So, in the case in:hand, to say that the statute shall run from a date when the heirs of Elizabeth Ege had¡ no right of entry, and consequently no right of action, is to say that they might be barred of such’right by no default of their own and -without the possibility of remedy. . . .. It is not to be forgotten that mere color of title is valuable only so far as it indicates the extent of the disseisor’s claim; if it fails in this, it fails altogether: <em>Barnhart v.

In ' <em>Lloyd’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/281/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="281 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1087047" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0379-01">281 Pa. 379</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.%20806" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="126 A. 806">126 A. 806</a>, this court, in an opinion by Justice <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>Sadler, said: “Appellee was not barred because he was not. entitled, to possession until 1924 when his father [the tenant by the curtesy] died, and was in no position to assert his-claim, if .any existed, until the preceding estate, had ended, and, therefore, the statute [of limitations.] could not: be applied because of failure to insist upon his ownership at an earlier date. During the continuance of life estate, one holding in remainder is. not bound to notice possession taken and continued by virtue of a conveyance, from the life tenant: <em>Stahl v.

J. p. 972, sec. 122, contains this statement': “It is .well settled that as a general rule the possession of a tenant for life is not adverse to the remainderman or reversioner. Nor does the .possession of the grantee of a tenant for life become adverse to -the remainderman or reversioner until after, the death of the life tenant, whether the conveyance purports .to transfer only , the life , estate or the title in fee simple.” In 1 R. C. L. p, 743, sec. 63, appears this statement: “The possession of a tenant for life, as such, cannot be adverse to the remainderman or reversioner, because the right of action of the remainder-man or reversioner does not accrue until the death of the tenant for life. It has . been so held as to life tenants in right of dower, and by the curtesy.” In <em>Ontelaunee Orchards v.

One having the right of possession may recover in ejectment against him who has the right of property; for if the plaintiff shows himself to have been in the peaceable possession, and that he was forcibly dispossessed, it will enable him to recover, and the defendant cannot set up title in bar.” (Citing cases.)
