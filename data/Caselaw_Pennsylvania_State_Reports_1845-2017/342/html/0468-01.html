Davis Wilson, then Controller of Philadelphia, with particular reference to the Union Traction. Company stock, Mr. Wilson being then concerned in the Philadelphia street railway litigation. ■ To quote only one of the instances given in the .evidence, Mr. Casani testified, with respect to the investments generally: “Q. What kind of information were you. getting from him? [a named broker]. A. What I was trying to get from these people all the time was that we had seen stock go below our appraisal .figure. We knew it was non-legal and what we were trying to find out was if we could procure a judgment of what he would recommend us to do other than what we were -doing with it. ■ Nobody was telling us, ‘You go out and sell it’; everybody was of the opinion ‘These are good stocks; they will come back.’ What we tried to do was to eliminate the sacrifice of assets in this estate.” He said that both the trustees were following the quotations of these securities and watching them in the daily papers and investment journals. ■</p>

We entered into an agency agreement, where we have all the custody of the securities, collect income, and make the investments and reinvestments as they may direct.' Agency service includes consultations with our trust officers concerning the assets of the estate.” The trustees did not delegate power to the trust company;, “everything in the handling of the trusts was -done on their approval only.” Among the duties performed were looking after the real estate, <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>keeping accounts, collecting income. and' distributing it to the life tenant accompanied by appropriate states ments. For this service the trust. company received <em>3% </em>of the <em>.5% </em>charged for collecting the income, each of the trustees receiving <em>1%. </em>The arrangement ■ with the Trust Company continued during the entire,period covered by the account. Mr. Casani testified:. “When we talked to the Girard Trust Company about the po: sition we were in they advised us to hold these securities,” Mr. Loesche said, apparently speaking, as, of December, 1931, of the U. G. I. stock, .“I remember saying to them I thought that.was..rather a sound stock; it was a rather, large part of the estate, and probably the market conditions did not warrant selling at that particular time.” , He said that he “had many discussions with them relative to this estate.” • Mr. Casani testified that his reason for not selling the TJ. G. I. stock was that “in our judgment, for us- to sell that stock would be to sacrifice a considerable asset, and we also felt that if we disposed of that. stock for that price, which in our judgment was too low, and we re-invested in legal investments, the only ones that we would have considered, Federal bonds, that our income would have suffered a shrinkage and so we decided, felt in our judgment the thing to do, to protect the estate and also to protect the income, was to hold the -TJ. G. I. stock.” He said substantially the same thing of the General Electric Company stock, that “at thirty-one that it was too low and we would be sacrificing an asset to have sold it, and it would have reduced the income for the life tenant.” There are similar expressions of their ultimate conclusions concerning other investments. We have of course not quoted all the evidence on the subject but it shows a’case within the rule; their “retention of the securities in question represents, not a mere lack of attention, but an honest exercise of judgment based on actual consideration of existing conditions.” These trustees, it may be noted, <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>were selected by the testator to carry out the purposes of the trust; one of them, Mr. Casani, was testator’s nephew, engaged in business with him, and entitled to share in the remainder after the life estate, an interest that he would wish to protect. As the learned court has found that, in the honest exercise of judgment in conditions presented from time to time as disclosed by the record, they refrained from selling because they thought sales then would be at an unreasonable sacrifice in respect of both principal and income, they have complied with the rule.</p>

In that case, as' in this, the accountant had the burden of justifying his conduct; after considering his evidence, the court found “no adequate excuse for appellant’s retention of the stocks ever since 1930.” From that finding of fact liability followed as of course. That was the decision. The apparent misunderstanding of it appears to result from expressions selected from the opinion which certainly were not intended by the court to modify the rule<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> as theretofore applied. In the opinion, the words “promptly” and “prompt” were used in referring to the general rule requiring conversion; the words “to some extent” were added in a sentence <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>which, in <em>Nola's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/333/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="333 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1187954" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0106-01">333 Pa. 106</a>, 109, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20326" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="3 A.2d 326">3 A. 2d 326</a>, read as follows: “He is thus vested by the law with a measure of discretion and is allowed the exercise of his own judgment as to the wisdom of selling the securities under then prevailing market conditions,” so that it read “and allowed to some extent to exercise his own judgment” etc. Apparently, also some of the misunderstanding results from the fact that one year after the guardian received the securities at the audit of the executor’s account was fixed as the date when the replacement value of the securities should be calculated. It has been argued that the rule referred to in <em>Taylor's Estate, Brown's Estate </em>and <em>Hola's Estate, </em>supra, was modified by the decision in <em>Seamans' Estate. </em>The words “promptly” at page 363, and “prompt” at page 364, used in the opinion in <em>Seamans' Estate, </em>and the addition of the words “to some extent” page 363, were not intended by the court to be given the effect suggested by counsel. In <em>Dauler’s Estate, </em>for example, <a href="/pa/247/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="247 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1009574" data-case-paths="/pa/247/0356-01">247 Pa. 356</a>, 93.

While it is true that an executor should account in a year and may be required by the court to convert in a year for the purpose of then making distribution, the rule we are considering is that to be applied by a trustee after he has received the trust property at the audit of the executor’s account.</p>

Not- only did the trustees constantly and continuously consult with the officers and employees of the trust company, but they consulted other bankers, brokers, and a City official — all of whom advised and evidently still -advise against conversion. At no time is- it apparent in the testimony that the retention by the trustee was by way of speculation, and to hold on in order to receive a better price than the securities were reasonably worth. Upon the contrary, the testimony reveals that the retention was a bona fide effort to retain until such time as a sale of the securities would realize what the Trustees deemed to be their true value. However. mistaken their judgment may have proven — - a hindsight which may not be substituted for foresight— there can be no question that these fiduciaries, to the best of their ability, and with the assistance of the best advice they could- obtain, acted with common skill, common prudence and common caution.” There is no contradiction of importance in the evidence.</p>

      <em>.All .agree </em>that “non-legal securities should be converted promptly, <em>in the absence of exceptional circumstances”. </em>This record, in my opinion, presents such circumstances.. The testator died about eleven months after- the beginning of the depression. Neither in his will made, on January 27, 1930, nor in his codicil made on September 13, 1930, did he direct ‘his executor or trustee to sell his non-legal. securities at any given time. The-executor’s account was adjudicated in October, 1931, and the trustee then received the non-legal securities. At that time no one foresaw that the depression which began in October, 1929, would last a decade or more. Periodic depressions have always occurred in this and in all other countries and the records show that (excluding the 1929 depression) their average duration has been 5.3 years. Before 1935, none here lasted more than six years.. In 1931 and . 1932 the then chief magistrate of the nation announced frequently to the American people that, “prosperity was-<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>just around the corner.” There was a virtual unanimity of expert financial opinion in 1931 and 1932 that the <em>market </em>value of securities was then far below their <em>mtrvnsio </em>values and that the worst of the depression was over. It is now generally agreed that “the bottom” of the depression was reached in 1932. The “era of low prices extending for eight years or more” which was not visible to the keenest /oresight in 1932 is visible to the most obtuse <em>hindsight </em>in 1941. The prevailing view in 1930, 1931 and 1932 was that the depression was “only temporary”, that it was a “panic condition”, and that it was “abnormal”. In the light of history that conclusion then appeared to be sound.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Most people held on to their stocks as long as they could during the depression years (as did this testator during the eleven months of the depression which preceded his death) and millions of others in 1930 and in following-years invested their money in stocks selling at prices generally considered abnormally low. In those times even the acknowledged prudence of an individual afforded him little or no protection against economic disaster. The circumstances were in that era so exceptional that this trustee in declining to sell the stocks in question at prices which he with good reason regarded as being far below their real value was, in my judgment, exercising, as the court below found, “common prudence, common skill and common caution.”</p>

A fiduciary is not compelled to jettison seasoned investments during a temporary panic.” From the point of view of this trustee, <em>those </em>circumstances <em>existed </em>when he refused to sell. The investments -were certainly well’ “seasoned” and there- <em>was </em>“a reasonable likelihood of an early return to stable conditions.” All leaders in government and in finance were optimistic in their predictions as to the depression’s early ending.</p>

(5) the general state of the market, as, for example, whether ,the prevailing prices are generally considered unduly low in the case of a general depression or are considered unduly high.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Scott further says: “Where the trust estate includes securities which are not proper trust investments, the trustee is not liable for failure to sell them where panic conditions prevail, even though the securities have a ready market.. The trustee is not bound to jettison securities. Any delay in the sale of securities which are not proper trust investments involves, to be sure, a certain element of risk. Although the . trustee may reasonably believe that the securities will rise in price, there is always the chance that they may fall. For this reason the securities are not proper securities for the trustee to purchase for the trust. It is arguable that since the purchase would be speculative the retention is equally speculative, and. that the trustee should be under a duty to sell them immediately.

A considerable part of his estate consisted of non-legal securities. Although he lived through a part of the national economic depression, which began in October, 1929, and although <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>he made his will during its continuance, and did not die until almost a year after it started, he did not authorize his executors or trustees to retain the non-legal securities in his estate. After testator’s death, the trustees did not convert the securities, even after they had received them as trustees from themselves as executors, and year after year, although most of them were daily marketable, they did not convert them, and after seven years of such failure, in December, 1938, the petitioner, Caroline Y. Byrne, a life tenant, for herself and minors, interested in the estate, filed her petition demanding an accounting and surcharge. The burden of proof was upon the trustees to show that they had acted according to law in retaining the securities, and the auditing judge concluded they had not maintained that burden and surcharged them.</p>

He found, that without any authorization to do so, the trustees retained these securities for this long period of time; and doubtless this finding was based, inter alia, on the testimony of John Casani, one of the trustees, that they were determined not to sell them until they returned to their inventory value. He testified that “regardless of what loss may be incurred, or regardless of what the operating statement of the company showed”, he was “still of the opinion that they should still hold that stock”. I have carefully examined the record and found that the findings of fact are convincingly supported by the testimony. The auditing judge applied the principles of law applicable to the facts as stated by this Court in <em>Seamans’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/333/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="333 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1187910" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0358-01">333 Pa. 358</a>, and properly directed a surcharge. Exceptions to the adjudication, after argument, were dismissed by the court en banc, and the adjudication affirmed, with a slight modification not pertinent to <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>the question here under consideration. In its opinion, the learned court below said, inter alia: <em>“Seamans’ Estate, </em>however, definitely rules' that the fiduciaries, no matter how dutiful and vigilant, in the absence of exceptional circumstances (and there are none) must <em>promptly </em>convert non-legals. We are unanimously of the opinion that the auditing judge, under existing authority, was constrained to rule as he did. We find no error in his findings of fact and conclusions of law, which we affirm.” Three months later that court, on its own motion, directed a reargument, and some months thereafter rendered another opinion (to which Judge Bolger, and Judge Ladner, the auditing judge, entered a vigorous dissent), in which it reversed its former decision, disregarded the findings and conclusions of the auditing judge, and sustained the exceptions of the trustees. In explanation, the court said in its second decision: “After our decision (supra), and before appeal, the Supreme Court filed two opinions: <em>Clabby’s Estate, </em>12 A. 2nd 71 [<a href="/pa/338/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="338 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1199945" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0305-01">338 Pa. 305</a>] and <em>Shipley’s Estate, </em>12 A. 2nd 343 [<a href="/pa/337/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="337 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1197274" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0571-01">337 Pa. 571</a>]. As these cases employ language which is apparently at variance with what was written in <em>Seamans’ Estate, </em>this court, upon its own motion, directed a reargument.” Thus, it clearly appears that the learned court would have refused a reargument and would have stood upon its original decision, affirming the adjudication of the auditing judge, were it not for the sole fact that it was of the opinion that we had reversed or modified controlling legal principles enunciated in <em>Seamans’ Estate. </em>The view of the court in this respect was entirely mistaken. The majority opinion of our Court, concurred, in to this extent by this dissent, shows that <em>Shipley’s Estate </em>and <em>dabby’s Estate </em>are distinguishable on their facts from <em>Seamans’ Estate, </em>and, further that <em>Seamans’ Estate </em>has not been overruled or modified. In <em>dabby’s Estate </em>there was power given by the will to the trustee to dispose of the non-legal securities <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>at his discretion and also there Avas acquiescence on the part of the beneficiaries for the trustee to retain them. In neither the present case, nor in <em>Beamans’ Estate, </em>was there either authority given to retain or acquiescence. We said in <em>Clabby’s Estate </em>(p. 314) : “The case of <em>Taylor’s Estate, %<a href="/citations/?q=11%20Pa.%20518" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="11 Pa. 518">11 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=11%20Pa.%20518" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="11 Pa. 518">Pa. 518</a>; <em>Kelch’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/318/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="318 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="1159628" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0296-01">318 Pa. 296</a>, and <em>Seamans’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/333/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="333 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1187910" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0358-01">333 Pa. 358</a>, have no direct application because they involved the retention of nan-legal securities by fiduciaries who had no such discretionary power.” In <em>Bhipley’s Estate </em>there was complete acquiescence on the part of the beneficiary and, for that reason, <em>Beamans’ Estate </em>was not in point. It seems to me the only thing now to do, in this situation, is to remit the record to the court below so that it may correct its error and reinstate the adjudication of the auditing judge as originally confirmed by it. Instead, however, the majority of our Court has affirmed the second decision and absolved the trustees of all liability.</p>

We said no such thing. It would be a very casual reader who would conclude that by the use in a footnote of Comment b, section 230, Restatement of Trusts (which itself does not fix a year as the rule) we meant by the reference that we so intended. Our prior cases show that Ave could have had no such intention. In <em>Beamans’ Estate </em>one year Avas the time fixed in which conversion should have been made; in <em>Btewart’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/110/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="110 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="543705" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0410-01">110 Pa. 410</a>, we said that almost four years was not too long under the circumstances to have held the securities; in <em>Borell’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/256/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="256 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="1030730" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0523-01">256 Pa. 523</a>, it was decided that two years after death of testator was a proper time; and in the present case the auditing judge fixed three years as the time in which the trustees should have converted. In <em>Beamans’ Estate </em>we <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>lield, following and amplifying the existing law, that a trustee must sell non-legals promptly, that is, within a reasonable time, and that what is to be determined in a given case as a reasonable time depends upon the facts and circumstances of that case; in other words, that non-legals must be sold promptly or with reasonable diligence, unless there is authority to retain, acquiescence of beneficiaries, or other unusual circumstances. We decided that, under the facts there presented, one year was a reasonable time in which those trustees should have sold. In that connection we said (p. 366) : “Certainly by the end of a year after he received the stock . . . appellant [trustee] should have realized that the probable duration of the depression could not be foretold, but that it certainly was not merely a temporary condition and that any conclusion as to whether stocks would recover or sink to still lower level could be based only on guesswork.”</p>

It is not to be left to the discretion or determination of the fiduciary alone. There is no doubt a trustee must determine the time to sell or hold, <em>but he does it at his own risk, </em>and is liable if later it is found that he did not convert promptly under all the circumstances. The majority opinion seems to ignore the requirement of prompt conversion. It does not place such condition in the “general rule”, which it claims to be “common prudence, common skill and common caution”. It makes ordinary negligence the rule of liability, seeming only to require good faith. This destroys the fundamental difference between legáis and non-legals. It makes no distinction between authorization to retain and where no such authority is given. In short, in my view, all the benefits and pro<a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>tection now given such beneficiaries is destroyed by the removal of. the distinction between legal and nonlegal securities, thus permitting fiduciaries to treat both types alike, and as if they were their own property. In <em>Seamans’ Estate </em>we said (p. 362) : “Notwithstanding the broad tenor of some of the language thus quoted, a fiduciary is not justified in inferring that the principle which exempts him from liability for acts performed in good faith and with ordinary prudence necessarily applies wherever there is a failure to convert non-legal securities within a reasonable time. The law imposes limitations upon ‘ordinary prudence’ in such cases in order to preserve the differentiation between non-legal and legal securities, and between fiduciaries and others as to the right to speculate. The mere fact that a trustee may honestly believe that an unauthorized security will appreciate in value at some more or less- remote period is not sufficient justification for his retention of it in the trust estate, and ‘common prudence’ or ‘normally good judgment’ must not be deemed to confer such latitude of discretion.”</p>

The will was silent as to the nature of the investments to be held for the benefit of the residuary trust. , In October; 1981, upon audit of the account of Collins and Casani as executors, certain non-legal corporate stocks and bonds which had comprised part of the investments which testator had made in his lifetime were awarded in kind to them as trustees. On February 1, 1939, they, at the demand of the life tenant, filed their first account, showing that they had retained, the greater part of these securities and that they were then of greatly impaired value. The life tenant and the trustee ad litem demanded a surcharge. The auditing judge, considering each of the securities separately, found that by October, 1933, it was apparent that there was no <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>reasonableJikelihood of an early return to stable market conditions which would restore normal values and therefore, at that date, a reasonable period had elapsed for the conversion of the non-legal securities into investments authorized by law and that the trustees must be surcharged for not having by that time effected such conversion. Just as in <em>Seamans’ </em>Estate■, the trustees here in December, 1931, turned over the possession of the securities to a trust company under an agency agreement whereby the latter collected the income, made investments (subject to the approval of the trustees) and provided an advisory service. The same inference raised there that the trustees must therefore have felt that they were relieved of the duty of watchful observation is equally applicable here. And similarly; the testimony of the trustees that they watched quotations, consulted with officers of the trust company, and sought the opinions of others as to the desirability of retaining these securities, is not convincing of their desire to comply with the legal requirement of prompt conversion nor a proper excuse for failure to do so. A witness, called in the trustees’ attempt to have corroborated the fact that they had sought the advice of experts, instead contradicted the trustees in material respects. That these trustees deliberately, and even stubbornly, retained, these securities when they knew or should have known they were bound to sell, is clearly manifested by Casani’s testimony,. that he was determined not to convert the investments until they had returned to their inventory value, irrespective of what losses were incurred and regardless of what the operating statements of the various corporations showed from time to time. Moreover, Casani, who undoubtedly was the dominant trustee, treated the securities almost as his own property. He had a remainder interest in the trust principal and hence might be inclined to engage in speculation in the hope of regaining some of <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>the lost value. These trustees did not consult with the life tenant or any other beneficiary, ■ during this extended period during which they retained the securities, in order to ascertain their desires and wishes in connection with such retention. Testator did not authorize the retention of the securities and therefore it must be presumed that he intended the trustees to follow the course which the law required of them, especially since his will was executed in 1930, after the depression had set in and stocks and bonds were, to say the least, most unstable. All the securities were marketable at all times, and yet for years the trustees retained them in face of failing dividends and decrease in values. Thus, they treated the securities as legal investments, and ignored their duty to convert promptly or within a reasonable time.</p>

It is a generality which applies to <em>every </em>act, of whatever nature, which a trustee is called upon to perform, but there are also, of course, a multitude of special rules, or requirements of the law, governing <em>particular </em>problems of trust administration. While the phrase in question may constitute sufficient guidance for the conduct of a trustee who is authorized to retain non-legal investments<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a> it certainly does not express the exact or categorical duty of one not so authorized.</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[305,906,1148,642]]]'>From the law of negligence there may be advanced an analogy. There the general principle is that every one must act with “ordinary care.” But the law does not rest content with this generalization, which is obviously too vague to serve as a standard of conduct in particular instances. Accordingly, in its application, it is crystallized into subordinate rules which fix absolutely and precisely the requirements of “ordinary care” under particular circumstances; for example, that before crossing a railroad track one must stop, look and listen, and in alighting from a car one must wait until the vehicle has come to a stop.</p>

To this question the authorities give practically a unanimous answer* namely* <em>that he convert them, within a reasonable time: </em>Restatement of the Law of Trusts, section 230. In the majority opinion it is said that <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>“if non-legal investments are received without authority to retain them, they must be converted into- legáis with reasonable diligence,” but it is explained that “with reasonable diligence” means “within a reasonable time considering the circumstances.”</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[148,636,1149,1303]]]'>We thus arrive at the real crux of the present problem — “What is a “reasonable time” in which to convert?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">3</a> In determining that question there' is need again for greater particularization, because, in the ■ domain of law, , a “reasonable time” varies widely according to the particular field to which it is applied, ranging, for example, from 24 hours in which to deposit a check to several days, months, or even years in which to seek redress at law or in' equity for various types of grievances. In <em>Seamans’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/333/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="333 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1187910" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0358-01">333 Pa. 358</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20208" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="5 A.2d 208">5 A. 2d 208</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_4" id="ref_footnote_4_4">4</a> where the doctrine of “reasonable time” was accepted as the governing principle established by the authorities, it was pointed out that there is “no rigid criterion” as to the time'in which a fiduciary must convert non-legals, and that “each case must depend largely upon its own circumstances,” but that, <em>in the absence of exceptional circumstances, </em>they should be converted promptly. Under the facts of that particular ease it was held that a year was the limit of time in which the securities should have been converted,' but - there were suggested various types of conditions- and circumstances under which a fiduciary would bé excused from converting nomlegals within that or any other definite period.</p>
    <p id="b516-3" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[296,363,1150,2011]],["BL_517.1",517,[165,357,1149,1074]]]'>
      <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>It is in its .application of the rule of “reasonable time” to the facts of the present case, that, to my mind, the majority opinion represents a complete departure not only from <em>Seamans’ Estate </em>but from all other Pennsylvania authorities, and from those, generally speaking, of other jurisdictions. Here the trustees retained non-legal securities from the time they received them in the trust until the audit of their account, a period of approximately eight years, and apparently they are still retaining them. The result is that Lehigh Valley E. E. bonds, inventoried at 91%, declined to a low, when the account was filed, of 11%; General Electric Company stock from an inventory value of 71% to a low of 27%; United Gas Improvement Company stock from an inventory appraisement of 36% to a low of 8%; Union Traction Company stock from an inventory price of 26% to a low of 1%. All these securities were listed on the exchange and could have been sold at any time on a telephone call to a broker. Why were they not sold? One of the trustees testified -that “we were merely trying to get for this estate the inventory figures of 1930.” And on what did the trustees rely as justifying the optimism which this objective implied? The information they received by “following the market” and interviewing brokers. The gist, therefore, of the present decision is this: that a trustee, having no authority to retain non-legal investments, may nevertheless hold them for eight years, and presumably for any greater length of time, if stock brokers advise him that in their opinion better prices might be obtainable at some more or less remote period in the future. If this is not speculation I fail to discern the difference, for I do not see how it is distinguishable from that of any individual owner of securities who holds them in the hope or expectation that they will rise in price. We are not dealing here with the situation referred to in <em>Seamans Estate, </em>of a security <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>“abnormally depressed in -value because of a.general economic and financial collapse, so that a sale can be effected only at a sacrifice, but there is a reasonable likelihood of an early return to stable conditions which will restore the normal value.” How can any one. pretend that an era of low prices, extending for eight years and more, represents a temporary depression due to a panic or other abnormal .situation? How can any one say that a higher range of prices prevailing over a course of years indicates any more the “real” values of securities than a lower range existing over another long period of years? How can any one claim that the prices .of securities in “boom” years, years of. financial hysteria, are more truly representative of intrinsic values than the prices prevailing in duller or more conservative periods? If these trustees are to be allowed, as apparently they are by the present decision, to continue to .hold non-legal securities until they realize “the inventory figures of 1930,” what likelihood is there that the securities will ever be converted?</p>

What is the- difference, if that opinion correctly represents the law, between the obligation of a trustee to convert nonlegal securities in a case where he is <em>not </em>given authority to retain them and one where he <em>is </em>given such authority? In the opinion of the court this day handed down in <em>In the Matter of the Estate of Thomas Clews Stirling, Deceased, </em>in which it is held that the fiduciary <em>was </em>given authority to retain non-legals, the duty to convert them was properly said to be measured by “common prudence, common skill and common caution.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_5" id="ref_footnote_4_5">5</a> In the present case, where admittedly no such authority was given, only the same measure of duty is applied, and no adequate attention is paid to the additional and <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>more positive obligation of conversion within a reasonable time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_6" id="ref_footnote_4_6">6</a> Certainly no one has' heretofore supposed that the'express grant by testators of authority to their executors and trustees to retain or to invest in nonlegal securities-is a-provision which adds nothing to the powers which such fiduciaries- would otherwise ■ enjoy. On 'the contrary, every intelligent' testator has presumably had in mind that his executors and trustees would not- be allowed by the law to retain such securities unless permission was given in the will.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[276,906,1147,587]]]'>In conclusion, I think it can confidently be -stated that there is no case in the' books, as far as the law of Pennsylvania is concerned, which goes to the length of the present decision in exonerating a fiduciary who, without authority to retain non-legal investments salable at all times on a public exchange, nevertheless retains them for eight years and indefinitely into the futuré; merely in the hope or belief, based on the opinions of stock brokers, that they will again reach values attained years before during a notoriously speculative period.</p>
