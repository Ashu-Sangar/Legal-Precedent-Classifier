There is nothing in the records sent up with the answers to this court to show that the charges of breaking and entering with felonious intent did not constitute separate and distinct acts. They show that there was a separate and distinct prosecutor on each indictment. While they were all committed on the' same day, there is nothing in the records which requires a finding that they were not separate and distinct offenses. See <em>Com. ex rel. Otten v.
