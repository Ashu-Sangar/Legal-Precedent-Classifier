They were given to trustees “with power to collect, receive and receipt for the rents and royalties arising therefrom and to keep a separate account thereof as Trustees, apart from their account as Executors and from time to time distribute the same amongst my Children above named or their heirs equally: that is to say that if any of my said children should die before or after my decease, his or her share shall descend to his or her heirs at law.” It may be noted, in view of later provisions of the will, that in paragraph C testator dealt only with mining rights and the income there<a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>from, and not with the fee of the land in which the mining was to be done; it is necessary to look elsewhere in the will for his disposition of his remaining estate in the land. In paragraph D, testator added to the trust property “all the coal fire-clay and other minerals whatsoever” in three tracts of land; in two of them, in Beccaria Township, he owned undivided half interests; the third, he describes as in Goshen Township and known as “my Shawsville Property.” He devised them “In Trust Nevertheless, to make contracts of lease for the operation of the coal fire-clay and other minerals, thereon' or any part thereof, upon such terms of royalty and for such periods of time and upon such conditions for the operation thereof as to the said Trustees may deem for the best interests of my estate, with power to renew, alter, change or annul contracts in force and expiring after my decease; to sell and convey said coal fire-clay and other minerals, ... so that the purchaser shall take an absolute title in fee. Provided however and it is my will and this bequest in Trust, is expressly made and conditioned, that my said Trustees shall not sell the coal or minerals in under or upon the property in Goshen Township aforesaid until twenty years after the date hereof.” The will was dated October 14,1903.</p>

It will be noted that while paragraph <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>D dealt only with mineral rights, paragraph E ordered the sale of the rest of the testator’s estate in the same land. Paragraph F ordered his executors to sell at public or private sale at prices satisfactory to them, “all my remaining real estate interests not hereinbefore specifically devised . . .” reserving however* “the minerals under those tracts under which the coal fire-clay and other minerals have been devised and bequeathed in trust by this my Will.” Paragraph G directed his executors to perform any contracts for the sale of land made by him during his lifetime. Paragraph H directed the executors to pay taxes “upon all my real estate from year to year out of any moneys in their hands, as well upon the minerals devised and bequeathed in Trust as aforesaid, as all other real estate interests. Provided however; that as soon as the coal fire-clay or other minerals held in trust as aforesaid shall be leased, that then the Trustees shall apply enough of the proceeds from the leasing thereof to first pay all taxes thereon before dividing and distributing the rents or royalties arising therefrom.” Paragraph I provides: “It is my will and I do hereby order and direct that all my estate remaining after payment of my debts and funeral expenses and the distribution of the County National Bank stock' in manner as aforesaid ; shall be equally divided amongst my ten' children aforesaid share and share alike,” subject to the amounts of advancement then specified in detail and subsequently changed by the second codicil and as affected by paragraphs J and K.

Mining, properties,* such. as those constituting the .second class, are frequently referred to as wasting assets,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the rents and royalties (or the proceeds resulting from the exercise of the power of sale) in effect exhausting .and representing the property.. The will shows that testator intended his children to share equally in the second class of, the property, though held in trust, just as he. gave them, though not in trust, all the rest, of his property. He appears to have been con cerned-entirely with the welfare of .his children to whom he gave:his property in equal shares; he was apparently not interested in the class of unnamed and unascertained “heirs” to whom the share of a deceased child would “descend.’’ He .had obviously concluded that: this mining property could be most advantageously enjoyed by his children if he turned it over to trustees for .administration as a unit instead of devising it to <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>them in fee to he administered as the separate property of each of ten children with the resulting difficulties probably incident to separate management of undivided interests by a number of owners who might not always be in agreement. The device of the trust accomplished this unity of operation, and administration and, at the same time, resulted in the desired equality of distribution among the children. On the death of the last child, this purpose will have been accomplished. The administration of the mining rights might, of course, terminate before the death of his last surviving child on the earlier exhaustion of the mineral's or if the trustees exercised the power of sale.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The provision in paragraph D that the minerals in the Goshen Township tract could not be sold until 20 years after the date of. the will is not inconsistent with this view. He intended, so long as rents and royalties were received, that they be distributed to his children which necessarily meant until the death of the last suryiVor. He did not provide, as the learned court held, that the trust should continue after the death of all his children. The court may not imply from the words used that he intended to create a trust of questionable legality when they •support, as in fact they doj an interpretation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> consistent with a lawful disposition of the property.</p>

The learned judge also thought that as the trustees might avoid exercising the power óf sale within a reasonable time, the trust, for thát reason, was'unlawful and that, in this case, “more than the reasonable time required to effectuate a sale of these properties and the termination of the trusts involved has already passed, and. that for this reason they should now be terminable upon the application of less than all of the parties interested.” For the reason already stated we cannot affirm tlrat conclusion.. The power of sale was an administrative power exercisable during the period <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>of the trust; which has not yet expired. A number of testator’s children are still living; each is entitled to receive from the trustees a tenth share of the net rents and royalties.'
