An example of this was Kessler’s prosecution of Mrs. Ann Hodgson Thomas on a charge of larceny. It had been customary for the appellants to visit the office Of the “Daily Local News” whenever they desired' and to use the stamps and stationery of the company. They had done this when the testator managed the newspaper. The trustee directed the office manager to refuse the appellants any further stamps or stationery. These instructions were not communicated to the appellants. Mrs. Thomas and her mother went to the office and when their request for some stationery was refused, they took 12 sheets of paper and three envelopes from the desk. When Kessler learned-of this, he appeared before a Justice of the Peace, nine miles away from West Chester, and swore out a warrant for the arrest of Mrs. Thomas, charging her with larceny of the stationery. The grand jury ignoréd the bill and placed the costs of prosecution upon Kessler. Shortly after bail had been entered by Mrs. Thomas, an article appeared in the “Daily Local News” with Mr. Kessler’s approval, which carried the heading: “Woman Charged With Serious Larceny”. Later Mrs. Thomas brought an -action against Kessler for malicious prosecution and the'jury at- the second trial brought in a verdict in the sum of $500. (At the <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>first trial plaintiff had been nonsuited. See <em>Thomas v.

The court below characterized Kessler’s conduct in this matter as “tactless in the extréme”. We think appellants’ characterization of this action much more appropriate, to wit: that it was “wanton maliciousness for which there can be no justification found.”</p>
    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[161,896,1150,1028]],["BL_278.1",278,[291,342,1147,589]]]'>Another example cited as indicating maliciousness on the part of Kessler toward these beneficiaries was an action in ejectment which he instituted. Kessler sent a letter to the three beneficiaries in reference to three pieces of real estate, which they were using. One piece of real estate was in the Wilhelmina Hodgson Estate, of which appellee was also appointed substituted trustee on the petition of the two granddaughters. Another piece of real estate was part of the corpus of the instant trust estate and the last piece of real estate, a life estate, was vested in one of the appellants by the terms of the will of Wilhelmina Hodgson, deceased. Kessler had no control or interest whatever in the life estate of the last mentioned piece of real estate. When the three appellants refused to execute an agreement authorizing the use by Kessler of the three pieces of real estate, he caused an ejectment proceeding to be started against them for the real estate in which Mrs. Hodgson lived. After appellants consulted with their counsel, <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>an agreement was prepared and willingly executed by all of the appellants, authorizing the use by him of the first two mentioned pieces of real estate, excluding any mention of the real estate owned by the life tenant. The ejectment proceedings were thereupon terminated. The court characterized the institution of these ejectment proceedings as “ill-advised and unnecessary” but held them not to be substantial grounds for the trustee’s removal. This, action on the part of the trustee showed marked hostility toward these appellants and was entirely unwarranted.'</p>
    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[284,945,1153,1407]],["BL_279.1",279,[184,339,1146,100]]]'>. It was shown that Kessler changed his attitude toward Mrs. Hodgson and her daughters immediately after his appointment as trustee, that he boasted to them that he “had practically everything” and they “had nothing.” He told Mrs. Hodgson that he was going to take her home away from her and she would have to live in an apartment. Mrs. Hodgson testified (and her testimony was not contradicted) that Kessler said: “He was going to take my home from me and make apartments out of it, and he was moving in there himself and he would give us thirty days to vacate.” He also attempted to direct Mrs. Hodgson how she should vote and told her she “could not be buried in the Hodgson plot in Oakland Cemetery,” where Mrs. Hodgson’s husband and other relatives are buried, and that she would “have to attend” a certain church. From the testimony it appears that Kessler almost as soon as he was clothed with the authority of a trustee started out to make himself personally offensive to Mrs. Hodgson and her daughters and that his effort was completely successful. It is inconceivable that this or any other testator would ever want his kindred who were the special objects of his bounty subjected to such contumely as this trustee has visited upon testator’s daughter-in-law and grandchildren. The trustee and the chief beneficiaries of this trust are no longer on speaking terms, and it is therefore <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>impossible for them to confer in any spirit of amity and helpfulness on matters relative to.the trust estate.</p>

The mere fact that there is such friction or hostility is not necessarily a sufficient ground for removal, since..otherwise the beneficiaries could by quarreling with the trustee force him out. Thus in <em>Forster v. Davies, </em>4 DeG. F. &amp; J. 133,139, Lord Justice Turner said: H certainly cannot agree with.the argument at the bar that the mere fact of there being a dissension between one of the several cestuis que trust and the trustee is a sufficient ground for this, court removing that trustee from the trust, because the consequence of that would be that one cestui que trust might at any time raise a quarrel with the trustee and thereupon come to this court to discharge the trustee and remove him from the trust upon the ground of the impossibility of their acting together. It would be the duty of the court, as I conceive, in all cases of that description, to inquire and ascertain from whose,fault that dissension or that cessation of friendly, intercourse has arisen.’ On the other hand, where there is such friction or hostility as seriously to impede the. proper performance: of the trust, especially if the trustee is at fault, the trustee will be removed.”</p>

It was a trust by the appointment of the debtor, and the trustee ought not to have continued in it a moment after the confidence1 of the creditors in him was withdrawn. It is not material that hé was innocent of actual misfeasance; his conduct ought to meet the approvakof those whose interests were to be promoted, for his whole duty was to them. His very obstinacy in holding on to his office in defiance of their wishes not only shows an absence of that sensitiveness1 to imputation-generally-possessed by the-self-respecting, but of itself warranted suspicion'of loyalty to the interests - of those for whom he professed' to act. As said.-by Lord Nottingham, in <em>Uvedale v. </em>Ettrick, 2 Cases in Chancery 130, Hie liked not that a man should be ambitious of a trust, when he could get nothing but trouble by it.’ ” In <em>Neafie’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/199/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="199 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="922673" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0307-01">199 Pa. 307</a>, 313, this court said: “If his [the trustee’s] management of the trust justly subjects him to criticism and to a lack of confidence by the cestui que trust, he should nót'bé continued in control of the estate.

After Kessler was sued by Mrs. Thomas for malicious prosecution he caused a scire facias to be issued bringing in the publishing corporation as an additional defendant. The jury absolved the additional defendant and rendered judgment against Kessler for $500. Judgment was duly entered and the costs amounting to $193.00 were paid by Kessler, but, as he testified, he paid “none of the expenses arising out of the case of Anne H. Thomas v. Wm. R. Kessler, but all were paid by the publishing company.” On the very day that Kessler was served by the sheriff with a writ of capias ad respondendum, together with an affidavit to hold to bail and a statement of claim in the case of Anne Hodgson Thomas v. Wm. R. Kessler, in which case Mrs. Thomas was suing for the recovery of $50,000 on a cause of action growing out of her arrest on the charge of larceny, Kessler called together the members of the executive committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, which consisted of himself, Paul J. Guthrie, ánd Thomas J. Mullany, the latter being the attorney who was Secretary and Treasurer of the company and Kessler’s personal counsel and who as the possessor of a “general brokerage license” handled all of the insurance of the company. At this meeting this committee passed a resolution that the company assume “all liability for the payment of any judgment which may be obtained against” Kessler, and “Further resolved that <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>the action of the officers in this corporation in having already this day posted cash hail of $500 in Mr. Kessler’s behalf out of the funds of this corporation be and the same hereby is appfoved and adopted,” and “further resolved, that the proper Officers of this corporation are hereby authorized and empowered to pay for any and all court costs, attorney’s fees, witness fees, or other costs or fees of any kind which may be incurred in the defense of this case throughout, Mr. Kessler being hereby authorized and empowered to pay any and all such expenses as and when incurred, in his sole discretion.” This action of the executive committee was subsequently approved by the Board of Directors, which board was elected by the votes of Mr. Kessler, who, under the will of testator, votes in his capacity as trustee the stock of the company for the election of directors, the four oi'iginal directors named in the will no longer serving as such. In other words, Kessler, whose relationship to this company is that of trustee, took action as trustee to impose upon the company the entire financial burden, no matter hoAv great it might be, of the litigation which he had precipitated upon himself <em>personally </em>by his tort. By virtue of this resolution, if Mrs. Thomas had recovered $5,000 or any other large sum, the judgment would have been paid by the company, as the $500 judgment recovered <em>was </em>paid. The effect of this was to penalize the three chief beneficiaries of this trust for Kessler’s Avrong done to one of them. This action is a violation of the law. The Restatement of Trust, sec. 247, comment (a), states, inter alia: “The trustee is personally liable to third persons for torts committed by him in the course of the administration of the trust.” Comment (d) states: “If the trustee was at fault in incurring the liability, he is not entitled to indemnity.” In the instant case the trustee took steps to- place the entire financial liability for his fault upon the trust estate even before the question of his liability to Mrs. <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>Thomas was adjudicated. His action showed that either he had no proper conception of his duty under his fiduciary relationship to this trust estate or he defiantly breached that duty.- The $693 which Kessler saddled upon the company to reimburse him for the judgment and costs the jury imposed on <em>Mm, personally </em>in this malicious prosecution case, and any other costs incident to the same suit -and saddled by Kessler on the company, make him properly the subject of a surcharge against him as trustee.

Kessler acquired due bills on 15 hotels in Florida, Atlantic City, Philadelphia and in the Pocono Mountains of ' the. face value of $1,807.80; for $271.19. The latter was the exact amount of the commissions paid by- the publishing company to the. advertising agencies which secured this business. Therefore the company supplied $1,807.80 worth of advertising to various hotels and received absolutely nothing for ifcwhile. Kessler received $1,807.80 worth of hotel accommodations and food for it. We cannot agree with’the court below that “the corporation lost nothing in the due bills that respondent purchased,- though it was testified that oné such due bill was sold, for 50% rather than the 15% of its value that respondent paid for those that he bought.” It is idle to say' that setting up and printing advertisements cost á newspaper nothing. If other .advertisers paid- for their space with, due bills and Kessler proceeded to appropriate these also to his own personal use after paying the. company 15%' of,their face Value, this 15% yielding only enough to pay for the securing of this business,: the .company would, soon be' drained' of. its financial life blood, which, is payments for advertising. <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>Kessler’s use of these due bills to his own personal gain was clearly a breach of trust and subjects him to a surcharge for their fair value less what he paid for them.</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[254,525,1153,1622]]]'>Complaint is also made of the bonuses paid out of thé earnings of the company to both this trustee and his personal counsel, who resided in Philadelphia. For the following years the trustee received, respectively, the following bonuses:- 1936, $250; 1937, $500; 1938, $400; 1939, $400; totaling $1,550. His counsel received total bonuses for the years 1936, 1938 and 1939 of $650. In 1936 Kessler received a salary of $75 a week. He also received certain payments (apparently legitimate) on account of “mileage” and “expenses.” There is also some testimony of his about certain employees who worked nights when election returns were given out as receiving “time and half time according to their weekly pay” and lie said that “on these occasions” he “was compensated on the same basis as the others.” Just why Kessler, the chief executive of this company, and his counsel should receive “bonuses” and he should' receive extra pay for “overtime,” is not clear and is a matter about which the life tenants are justified in inquiring about. The practice of the administrator of this trust directing, or even permitting, his personally chosen Boárd of Directors to pay him and his counsel annual bonuses is not compatible with his fiduciary status in respect to the trust property committed to his keeping. As to these bonuses, the court below said: “The good taste of his action in accepting the ■ bonus that he did, especially after his salary had been increased to what is certainly a full and fair one, is open to serious question when it is considered that every dollar thereof comes out of his beneficiaries’ pockets.”</p>

The annual insurance premiums amounted to about $1,000.

In the year 1938 the net income after deductions and depreciation amounted to: $5,850.66 and the dividend declared amounted, to $6,000. In the year 1939 the net income after depreciation and all deductions amounted to $3,467.23 and during that year a dividend of $6,000 was declared.:-Depreciation has been set ñp oh the- books of the corporation ih the sum of $8,247.72 each year appellee has been in' office. As of the end of the year 1939 the total depreciation is set up 'on the books as $117,771.23 as against fixed assets carried on the books in the sum of $151,120.04. - The1 corporation carries an investment account which at the end of 1939 totaled $118,338.62. A principal item in the investment account consists of 411 shares of the Chester County Building and Loan Association, carried on the books at its phid-in: value, $53,841.00, which shares of stock matured in-December 1940 and in May 1941, in the sum of‘approximately <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>$82,000.00, against which, -there has been made a loan of $35,000.00.” Appellants say further: “With the above figures in mind, it will be noted that many thousands of dollars earned by the corporation. since the death of William H. Hodgson have not been declared as dividends and which at the time of- appellee’s appointment as substituted trustee approximated $65,000.00, conceding the depreciation figure- to be fair.” They also contend on this point as follows: “Disregarding the interests of the life tenants and well knowing that the funds received from the matured Building and Loan stock Avere not necessary .to the financial stability of the neAvspaper corporation,, appellee permitted the corporation to invest a large part of those funds-in a .building known as the. Farmers and Mechanics Building; forty-seven thousand dollars of the corporation’s money has been in-tested in that building, every dollar of-which was, earned during the life estates. ■ It was not necessary to' wait until the Building and Loan shares matured to ascertain the rights of. the life tenants. If it was necessary, and a proper corporate move to expand, the newspaper business by the purchase of- the Farmers and Mechanics Building, appellee should have taken immediate'steps to see that the life tenants Avere not discriminated against either by the declaration of a stock dividend or by some other means to protect their interests.” As to this the court below said: “It is not believed that the above transaction constitutes .a contributing, cause for removal of respondent. Whether it Avas a wise business move or not Ave are not. prepared to say. We do say. however that we are not convinced that it-was unwise to the extent that it shows that respondent, is no longer fit to administer this trust.” ■</p>
