      <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>\ A heavy snow had fallen in Scranton on Thanksgiving Day, 1938, making ideal coasting conditions for children, of which they took advantage for a number of days. On November 29,1938, on a clear and cold winter night, Calista. Smith, then sixteen years and three months, of age.,, and Anne Donovan, then fourteen years and eleven months of age, borrowed a sled, and, starting at the intersection of Prospect Avenue and Palm Street, coasted west on Palm Street until they collided • with defendant’s car being driven north, on Pittston Avenue. The Smith girl was lying, prone on the sled while the Donovan girl was kneeling between the legs of the former-and holding a bar on the side of the sled. They met with severe injuries, those to the Smith girl -being such as to probably render her helpless for the rest of her life.</p>

Thirty- or more children were coasting on Palm Street .on the evening of the accident, as they had been for several days before, and invariably the sleds were stopped by the ashes until these two girls descended the hill. The ashes failed to stop the momentum of their sled and they passed into Pittston Avenue with the distressing results mentioned.- The negligence alleged and. relied upon by the plaintiffs was that the defendant drove his car at an excessive rate of speed and did not have it under proper control at a street intersection where he knew, or ought to: have known, -that children were gathered in considerable numbers and were engaged in coasting.

He had a customer in that locality and was familiar with it, particularly with its topography. He passed the intersection every weekday at least twice and knew that the streets coming into Pittston Avenue, particularly Palm Street, descended at a stiff grade to the avenue, thus affording an ideal street, from the standpoint of children, for coasting. The children had been using the street to a considerable extent for five days. A police officer testified that from a point on Pittston Avenue thirty feet south of the southerly curb line of Palm Street he could see the surface of Palm Street to the east, for eighty or ninety feet, while an assistant city 'engineer who had made measurements testified that from a point in the easterly cartway of Pittston Avenue and sixty feet south of the curb line of Palm Street, a person riding in an ordinary car could see the surface of Palm Street for seventy-eight feet to the east. The view of Palm Street was extended as one advanced north on Pittston Avenue. There were at the time at least thirty children coasting on the hill and five or six sleds passed down just before that of the minor plaintiffs, one going immediately in front. There were at least eight children standing with their sleds at the foot of the hill, as expressed by one witness, or at the corner, as expressed by another. Considering the knowledge which the defendant had of the use of the street and his familiarity with the surroundings, it is our <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>opinion that the court was not justified in saying as a matter of law that the defendant neither knew nor ought to have known that children were coasting upon this street.

Where, under the undisputed facts, coasting upon a street is clearly and manifestly dangerous, it may be the duty of the court to so declare as a matter of law, but, where the evidence is conflicting, and the inferences to be drawn are not clear, the question whether plaintiff has exercised care and diligence to avoid danger while coasting, such as to be expected of a reasonably careful and prudent man under like circumstances, is for the jury”: <em>Idell v.

We cannot say that the conduct of the plaintiffs did not conform to that of a reasonable person of like age under like circumstances.

The neighborhood was residential im character, but Pittston Avenue was a heavily-travelled street,- and to prevent those .sledding on - Palm-Street from endangering themselves and: others by dart<a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>ing into the intersection, the police had placed a wide belt of ashes on the hillside to halt the sleds forty feet from the crossing.</p>

It is, therefore,: apparent that, just before , they reached the intersection, these young ladies were upon the side of the hill, nearest to the approaching vehicle of defendant, and close, behind the twenty-eight inch terrace of the house on the corner. In view of the position of the minor plaintiffs upon the sled, one lying prone and the other kneeling and bending over to grasp the side bars, and in view of the further fact, as admitted in argument before the court below, that the south curb of Palm Street was an additional ten inches in height, they could not have been visible to, .a motorist approaching from the south, on Pittston Avenue, even were his view not completely obstructed by the corner dwelling and trees. There is absolutely no evidence whatever that defendant saw, or could have seen, these young ladies before they crossed the sidewalk line of Pittston Avenue.</p>

But not one of the witnesses testified- that the <em>entire surface </em>of Palm Street would have, been, visible to such motorist <em>between the intersection and the farthest points• described, </em>or that -coasters, crouched upon their sled as were the minor plaintiffs, travelling, after dark, upon the south side of Palm Street, would have been visible above the elevation of thirty-eight inches from the street level to the top of the terrace, this height being further increased by the depth of the snow- thereon. It is- clearly apparent, therefore, that the plaintiffs have failed' to prove that defend<a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>ant could have seen <em>this </em>sled, or that <em>any </em>sled was within the alleged range of visibility at the time of his approach.</p>

They Completely overlook the fact that there is no evidence whatever that defendant had ever seen persons coasting on this hill at any time. It certainly cannot be inferred that he had knowledge of its use for that purpose merely because it afforded “an ideal street, from the standpoint of children, for coasting.” Obviously a motorist is not. bound, to know that there is coasting on every hill or decline which might, or might not, prove attractive to children. .</p>

That he had his car under control, and that ¡he-was proceeding at a reasonable speed appears clearly from the undisputed evir dence that he came to a stop within six or eight feet' from the point of collision. In view of the slippery condition of the street, this physical fact effectively negatives the existence of a lack of due care on his part. See <em>Justice v.

They resided in the vicinity and were familiar with the dangers of the hill. They were not small children, but young ladies attending high school and thoroughly capable'of appreciating these- dangers. That they descended the hill at great speed is established conclusively by the fact that theirs was the only sled which pássed through the twenty-foot protective belt of ashes, crossed the further intervening twenty or twenty-two feet and entered the intersection. The same fact is illustrative of their lack of control over the sled, or their indifference to its perilous progress. Although -it travelled a distance of more than twenty feet- after passing through the ashes, it does not appear that-these young ladies made hxiy effort whatever to <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>bring it to a stop, to deflect its course from the intersection, or to abandon it at the approach of danger.</p>
    <p id="b55-4" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[197,465,1149,1023]]]'>While it is true, as the majority points out, that sledding upon a public street is not in every case negligence per se, it cannot be said that those who engage in this sport may do so at dangerous intersections without observing the ordinary rules of care which are imposed upon all users of the highways, whether travelling in conveyances or on foot. Had another automobile, bicycle, or motorcycle, entered this crossing at the same speed and so obviously out of control as the sled- of the minor plaintiffs, there is no doubt that its operator would have been guilty of negligence. Nor would a pedestrian, so reckless of his own safety and' so heedless of the approach of a vehicle on the intersecting streets have been permitted to escape the consequences of such lack of care. The majority has suggested no reason why coasters (particularly of the ages of these young ladies) should be relieved from these common requirements of prudence, and be treated as a special class immune from fault.</p>
