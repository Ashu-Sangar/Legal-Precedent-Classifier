The schedule of distribution was approved February 16, 1940. Petitioners averred that they “are doubtful as to the propriety of retaining” 19 of the investments received; that they “are of the opinion that such non-legal securities should not now be sold . . they asked a decree “under Section 49 (e) 2 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, as amended, (20 PS 866), permitting them to retain the securities ...” Their petition was dismissed and this appeal was taken. The guardian ad litem appeared in this court in support of the decree dismissing the petition.</p>

    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[182,523,1148,1027]]]'>In disposing of the petition now before us, the court referred, among other matters, to the principle applied in proceedings under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act of 1923, P. L. 840, 12 PS section 831 et seq., as amended; and stated that section 49 (e) 2 was intended to authorize the court to entertain the. petition where, as in declaratory judgment proceedings,, an. actual controversy or antagonistic claims existed between contending parties which indicated imminent and inevitable litigation, but that the petition disclosed “no controversy nor the ripening seeds of one.” Lastly, the court pointed out that “the exparte statements contained in the petition concerning the ‘pro ¡and con’ of the wisdom of selling or retaining the securities, would not of themselves constitute sufficient dnta to enable the court intelligently to pass qpon the application. Far more expert investigation and analysis would be required, and would possibly necessitate a reference to a Special Master.”</p>

Super. 115" data-case-ids="1014249" data-case-paths="/pa-super/134/0115-01">134 Pa.

L. 363, 20 PS section -2241, confers extensive jurisdiction over a minor’s estate. . Assuming, but not deciding, that the case is within the Act, the question is whether abuse of discretion appears. In <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>determining whether discretion was judicially exercised in dismissing the petition, it is necessary to consider exactly what petitioners propose to accomplish. The allowance of the petition would constitute authority to retain non-legals and would shift the burden of proving want of due care from the fiduciary to the minor if loss resulted. It is important to note that the term of the trust is now very short; the minor will be of age in a year and a half. In view of that fact, an element of practical importance for consideration is whether, for the purpose of transferring the' burden of proof to the minor, her income during that comparatively short period, should be reduced by the cost of the inquiry necessary, as was said below, to enable the court properly to exercise the discretion vested in it by the statute. It is quite apparent from an éxamination of the list of the securities in the light of reports concerning them quoted in the petition, that a master would be necessary and that he would be required to consider each of the 19 investments in detail for the purpose of advising the court. The expense of such a reference, including counsel fees of both petitioners and the guardian ad litem, would probably be a sum entirely disproportionate to the value of the ultimate result reached. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>
