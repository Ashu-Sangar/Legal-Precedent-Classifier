Kaufman intervened as a beneficial owner of the shares. The issues were tried in the court below before a jury and a verdict was directed in favor of defendants.

It was formed in 1933 by plaintiff, Kaufman and their attorney Ray. Plaintiff advanced all of the original capital, accepting Kaufman’s note for óne-half thereof; which has been paid with interest. There are 250 shares of capital stock outstanding. Kaufman owns 22 of these, and his wife, .100. Plaintiff owns 12 shares, and his son, 110. The remaining six shares, which are the subject of this controversy, Were issued to Ray on September 15, 1933, without consideration/to enable him to serve as a director.

They asserted that, when the corporation, was formed it was agreéd that plaintiff and Kaufman were each to control a one-half, interest, and that the stock was to be equally divided between them or ■ their' nominees. In corroboration of this, it was shown by defendants that <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>the profits of - the business had ■ been ■ shared equally, and that each had contributed one-half of the capital.</p>

The stenographer testified that- she delivered the book to Kaufman. Kaufman, Miss Wiley&gt; the bookkeeper of the corporation, and one Harry Cohen, its “controller”, asserted that the certificate remained in the stock book until 1938, when Cohen discovered that it was missing. Missing also was a letter dictated by Bay and placed with the certificate, stating that he had ho'financial interest in the stock, but held it as trustee for Kaufman and plaintiff, each of whom was entitled to three shares, and that it was to be transferred by him at the direction of the two beneficiaries jointly. The contents of this letter were proved by the testimony of Bay, his stenographer, Kaufman, and Cohen, no copies having been found. On one occasion, in 1937 or 1938, Miss Wiley testified, plaintiff’s son obtained possession of the stock book, but she said did not examine it before he received it or upon its return to determine whether the certificate and letter were within it. Bay discláimed any personal interest in the certificate, but stated that he had not delivered it to plaintiff or to anyone representing plaintiff. Cohen stated that in 1939 -he discovered that the stock was in plaintiff’s possession, and that he and Kaufman consulted Bay, who assured them that plaintiff’s possession was unlawful and that no valid transfer to him could have been effected.</p>

He denied that Kaufman had any interest in the shares, or that any agreement of trust had been entered into by the parties. The fact that he claimed ownership of 128 shares, more than 51% of the stock, he explained by . stating that Kaufman had agreed to give up one-half share in order to permit Ray to hold six. Plaintiff testified that he received the stock book from Ray on September! 15, 1933,' but that he had Miss Wiley put it in the corporation’s vault for safe-keeping, and personally detached the certificate a few weeks later.. His statement that it had: been in his wife’s wall safe from 1933 until it was presented to the corporation for transfer on January 3,1940, was corroborated by the testimony .of Mrs. Leff, his wife.</p>
