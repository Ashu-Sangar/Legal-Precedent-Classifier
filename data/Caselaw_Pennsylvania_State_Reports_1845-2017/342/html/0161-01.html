The plaintiff is the widow of Luigi Gilberti who died January, 1938, testate, leaving his property to plaintiff, his second wife, and legacies of $5.00 each to Ms six children by a former marriage. These six children, who take on the death of the plaintiff, are co-defendants with the trust company. The case appears to have been most carefully considered by the learned chancellor and the court in banc, who, in the adjudication and in the opinion on exceptions, have so fully covered every phase of the case now presented on appeal that we can add nothing to what was said below. Briefly, the bill was based on averments of conspiracy of appellant’s counsel, her interpreter, defendant trust company’s officers and defendant children to defraud plaintiff. The findings of fact, based on evidence and not challenged <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> by assignments of error, not only completely negative such suggestion, but show that there was no foundation for the <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>suit. The rule is settled that to set aside an instrument on the ground of fraudulent misrepresentation, the evidence relied on to establish it must be clear, precise and indubitable: <em>Foley v. Wasserman, </em><a href="/pa/319/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="319 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="1162269" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0420-01">319 Pa. 420</a>, 424, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20A.%20595" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="179 A. 595">179 A. 595</a>; <em>Broida v.
