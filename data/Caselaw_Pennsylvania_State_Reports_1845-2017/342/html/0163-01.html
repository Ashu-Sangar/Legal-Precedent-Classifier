The crossings were ordered abolished by the Public Service Commission, predecessor to the Public Utility Commission, by an order dated March 8, 1937. The order also provided for the construction of a new main highway between the boroughs, a- distance of about two miles. The Commission imposed liability for the cost of the improvement on parties<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> interested; one of the provisions of the order was: “That the County of Northampton pay all compensation for damages due to the owners of property, exclusive of the-respondent railroad companies and the Borough of Portland!, for property, taken, injured or destroyed in the execution of this improvement.” The county did not appeal from the order. Arthur Bartron, claiming that property owned by him was taken for the improvement, applied to the Commission- for- compensation, whereupon the Commission, pursuant to section 411<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> of the Public Utility Law, 1937, P. L. 1053, 66 PS § 1181, submitted the determination of claimant’s damage to the court of <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>common pleas of Northampton County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Viewers were appointed, who, in January, 1939, filed a report awarding $3,500 to Bartron “as damages for the taking of land.” The county appealed from that award; the parties joined in’ an issue to determine “what damages, if any, was plaintiff entitled” to receive; the case was tried and the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $6,750. The county filed motions for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v. The motion for judgment n. o. v. was granted on the ground that the Commission had no jurisdiction to make the order requiring the county to pay the damages. This conclusion, if we correctly understand the opinion of the learned court below, was based on the proposition that, although the Commission had exclusive jurisdiction to direct the abolition of grade crossings and the. payment of the cost. of such abolition, the damage to the plaintiff’s property was not the result of the abolition of the grade crossings but of the construction of the new portion of the highway between the two boroughs which was not necessary to the adjustment required by the separation of the grades alone.</p>

L. 1374, Article V, section 12, and July 17, 1917, P. L. 1025) and that proceedings for abolishing such crossings were required to be instituted before the Commission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> See also Public Utility Act 1937, P. L. 1053, Article IV, section 409 et seq., 66 PS § 1179 et seq.. There can be no doubt, therefore, of the right of the Commission to enter upon the inquiry submitted to it by the parties to the proceeding; it had jurisdiction of the cause of action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> . The legislature provided that a party aggrieved by the order of the Commission may appeal to the Superior Court; this provision (1915, P. L.-779, 7.81-782) directed that “Within thirty days after filing of any finding or determination by the commission, or after the date of service of any order, . . ,- any party to the proceedings affected thereby may appeal therefrom to the <em>Superior Court. . . . </em>The said court is hereby, clothed with exclusive jurisdiction throughout, the Commonwealth for the purpose of hearing and determining any and all said appeals.....All appeals to the <em>Superior Court </em>shall be by petition to. said court, setting forth specifically and concisely the error or errors , assigned to the finding, determination, or order of the commission. ...” When the Commission made the order imposing the challenged obligation, the county, if dissatisfied, should have'appealed to the Superior Court and. com<a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>plained of the error now relied on. If the county had complied with the statute and brought the matter to the attention of the Superior Court, the error, if there was one, could have been corrected. By not appealing, the county allowed the order to become final; that is, the obligation to pay the damages became an adjudicated fact: compare <em>Pulaski Ave., </em><a href="/pa/220/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="220 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1005837" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0276-01">220 Pa. 276</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.%20749" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="69 A. 749">69 A. 749</a>; <em>Breuninger v.

That rule is applicable to this record. The legislature had provided the only method of separating the railway and highway grades and had conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the Commission; it was therefore necessary to apply to the Commission to accomplish the separation; anyone aggrieved was likewise bound to follow the prescribed procedure for review of the grievance. The statute did not confer on the county a right to elect whether to test the order by appeal to the Superior Court or to ■ test it later in the common pleas proceeding to assess damages.</p>

But it must not be forgotten tlrat our contention. is. directed to. .something entirely different and that is, that the imposition of payment of damages to property unrelated and not adjacent to any of the grade crossings eliminated, abolished or affected, nor to property taken or appropriated for any approaches thereto (outside of the general scheme of state highways), was entirely beyond the jurisdiction and power of the Commission.”</p>
