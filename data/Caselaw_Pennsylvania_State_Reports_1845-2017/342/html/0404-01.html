Payment was refused upon the grounds that the insured was not in good health at the time the policy was applied for and issued, and that he gave false and fraudulent answers to medical questions in his application. The case was tried in the court below and the jury found for plaintiff. A new trial was awarded by the court en banc, but defendant has taken this appeal from the refusal of its motion for judgment, n. o. v.</p>

He was asked the following question by the defendant’s medical examiner: “20. State every physician or practitioner whom you have consulted, or who has prescribed for or treated you in the past five years for any ailment, serious or not serious.” The insured answered, “None”. In answer to the question: “22. Have you stated in answer to question 20 every physician or practitioner consulted during the past five years and dates of consultation?”, he answered: “Yes”. These questions and answers formed part of the application, which the insured signed and affirmed to be true. The policy issued on May 20, 1938, with the proviso that it should not take effect unless received during the insured’s “continuance in good health” and until the first premium should have been paid under the same circumstances. <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>The Insured died within eight months of the effective date appearing on the policy.</p>

Dr. Robert Denison testified from his records that the insured had consulted him nine times from October to December, 1934, complaining of nervous and digestive disorders, with pains and a hollow feeling in his chest. Dr. Denison examined his heart, and directed him to obtain a cardiogram reading. During October he found the insured’s blood pressure high. In November, another examination disclosed “poor heart tones” and lowered blood pressure, and the physician prescribed digitalis, a heart stimulant.</p>

Although the doctor found no definite evidence of heart trouble, he stated that the insured was “heart conscious”, and that on one visit his heart action was irregular and a heart tonic was given. The office memoranda or records of this physician, made at the time of consultation and including a statement of the insured’s complaints, the results of his examination, and the treatment prescribed, were admitted by the trial judge as documentary evidence of the facts therein contained under the Uniform Business Records as Evidence ,Act of May 4,1939, P, L. 42, 28 PS section <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>91.

We think in so doing the court below mistook the effect of our decisions. The rule governing cases of this sort was set forth in <em>Evans v. Penn Mutual Life Ins.

      <em>circumstances that he must have been aware of their falsity, </em>the court may direct a verdict or. enter judgment for the insurer.” (Italics added.) Thus, where it is established by uncontradicted documentary evidence that the insured has consulted physicians so frequently, or undergone medical or surgical treatment so recently, or of such a serious nature, that a person of ordinary intelligence could not have forgotten these incidents in answering a direct and pointed question in an application for insurance, bad faith may be inférred as a matter of law if the insured denies in his answer that any physician has been consulted, or medical or surgical treatment has been received during the period of inquiry.</p>

The credulity of the court cannot be taxed too far by pleas of forgetfulness. Thus in <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America v.

    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[286,682,1154,1516]]]'>If any doubt exists upon this point it is resolved by the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, section 1, which expressly- applies to the records of “every kind of business, <em>profession, </em>occupation, calling, or operation of institutions, whether carried on for profit or not.” .(Italics added.) Section 2 provides: “A record of an act, condition or event shall, in so far as relevant, be competent evidence if the custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of-.its preparation, and if it was made in the regular course of. business at or near the time of the act, condition or event, and if, in the opinion of the court, the sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as,to justify its admission.” The legislature certainly intended thereby an. extension, of the old f‘shop-book” rule, and to make professional records competent documentary evidence under the circumstances set forth. We agree with plaintiff that the Act did not intend to make relevant that which is not relevant, nor to make all business and professional records competent evidence regardless of by whom, in what manner, and for what purpose they were compiled, or offered. We do' think, however, that the Act makes competent- the records of these physicians as documentary evidence of .the matters we have indicated, and that it: applies as well to the records, of prescriptions prepared by the pharmacist, and to=the cardiogram prepared by Dr. Ohlson.- ■</p>

They do not establish the fact that the insured took the medicine prescribéd, but that medicine was pre<a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>scribed for him. The pharmacist’s records show that these prescribed medicines were obtained by him. The cardiogram, properly identified by the doctor as a record of the insured’s heart action, was documentary proof that he followed the direction of Dr. Denison and had such a record made. The fact that it was identified by oral testimony does not destroy its documentary nature, for, as the Act of 1939 recognizes, all records must be similarly identified and the method of their preparation explained by the testimony of witnesses.</p>

The fact that the person who made the records was, in each ease, available to testify does not eliminate the basis for the admission of the written proof. As pointed out by Dean John Henry Wigmore in the most recent edition of his work on Evidence (section 1421), documents may be admitted in proof of facts to which the writer of the document could be called to testify, where the circumstances indicate that his recollection would be less reliable than the notations made by him at the time the events occurred. “The assertion may be such”, the learned author states, “that we cannot expect, again or at this time, to get <em>evidence of the same vatue </em>from the same or other sources.” And his observation relative to hospital records (section 1707) is equally applicable to busy physicians in private practice: “Moreover, amidst the day-to-day details of scores of hospital cases, the physicians and nurses can ordinarily recall from actual memory few or none of the specific data entered; they themselves rely upon the record of their own action; hence, to call them to the stand would ordinarily add little or nothing to the information furnished by the record alone.” In <em>Loder v.

Co., </em>supra, physicians <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>gave oral testimony based upon hospital records which were offered in evidence and received as documentary proof.
