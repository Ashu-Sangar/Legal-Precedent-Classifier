The first example is of án inherently unlawful act; the second is of an act (driving a car) not unlawful in itself but done without due caution, i. e., in an unlawful manner. In <em>Com. v.

Blackstone in his Commentaries, Lewis Ed., Book 4, star page 192, says: “The second branch, or involuntary manslaughter, differs also from homicide excusable by misadventure in this, — that misadventure always happens in consequence of a lawful act, but this species of manslaughter in consequence of an unlawful one. . . . So, where a person does an act lawful in itself, but in an unlawful manner, and without due caution and circumspection, as. when a workman flings down a stone or piece of timber into'the street and kills a man, this may be either misadventure, man<a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>slaughter, or murder, according to the circumstances urn der which the original act was done.
