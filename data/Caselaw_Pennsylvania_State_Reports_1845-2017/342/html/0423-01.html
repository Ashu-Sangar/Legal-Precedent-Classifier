By so doing, the. following-facts'are found: The accident happened at about . 11 o’clock on the morning of October 29, 1938, on Route 222 in the village of New Providence, Lancaster County, where the single-track, branch railroad of defendant-company, running from Lancaster to Quarryville, intersects the highway at almost .a right angle.- -The' highway runs approximately north, and south at; this point and approaches the railroad track from ;the north- on ian -aSr cending grade.:. The automobile- was traveling .south <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>and the only indications of the proximity of the crossing to one driving in that direction were the usual railroad warning sign beside the highway approximately 300 feet north thereof and a “stop, look and listen” sign about 10 feet from the track. Houses and trees line both sides of the road for some considerable distance up the grade to the crossing; and the track can be seen only when within a very short distance of the crossing by one driving south toward it. The train, traveling westwardly and consisting of an engine and tender running backward and drawing several freight cars and a caboose, after striking the automobile, pushed it along the track for about 110 feet before it was brought to a stop, seriously injuring minor plaintiff. Furthermore, at the time of the collision, the fireman, sitting on the side of the engine cab toward which the machine approached, had his back to the crossing.</p>
    <p id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[277,1257,1151,1187]],["BL_449.1",449,[179,357,1151,2122]],["BL_450.1",450,[283,366,1142,151]]]'>A careful review of the evidence offered on behalf of plaintiffs in regard to the warning given of the approach. of the train reveals that while there was some conflict in the testimony as to whether or not one or two blasts of the whistle were sounded prior to the accident, as well as to the distance the automobile was from the crossing when the only or final warning was given; nevertheless, they all practically agreed that there was no warning whatever :soundéd for some time before the automobile and the train collided. There is positive testimony of three witnesses that they heard two blasts of the engine whistle, the last of which was about one minute or more before the accident. This testimony, together with the other evidence that the train was traveling toward the crossing at a speed of about 15 miles per hour, clearly indicates, if believed, that when the last blast was given, (i. e. a minute or more before reaching the crossing) the train whs at least 1320 feet from the intersection. The physical facts demonstrate that if the train was that distance from the point where it crossed the highway,: it was entirely out of sight of the crossing, there being a curve in the <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>track about 200 feet therefrom'. 'Moreover, there was testimony to indicate 'that the automobile shortly before and at the time of the collision ■ was traveling at a speed of about 30 miles per hour. ' This, if true, would obviously indicate that the machine was at least a half mile — 2.640 feet — from the crossing a minute or more before the accident, when, it was said, the last signal was given. Thus, by following the line of the railroad and the highway, this testimony, if believed, would indicate that there was a distance of at least 3,960 feet, or three-fourths of a mile, between the automobile and the train. Of course, it was then impossible to see the train from this position of the automobile on the highway. The record shows that the testimony of all these witnesses with respect to the failure to continue to signal the approach of the train was not merely of the negative type frequently criticized by this; Court as insufficient, but- was of a positive character based on actual and attentive observation. Therefore, ■ if the Court were to say that the warning, testified- by plaintiffs’ witnesses to ■ have been given; was adequate, under the circumstances here present, it would be a flagrant infringement upon the province of a jury-to determine disputed facts. It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that a jury would not be justified in finding that there was a considerable -interval between- the last blast of the whistle and the collision, and that the lapse. of such a period of time rendered the warning inadequate in view of the concealed nature of the crossing and the relative slow speed at which the train-was moving., This -is accentuated by the fact that the driver of the car and his guest passenger were strangers to this crossing. . Furthermore, it must be -borne in mind that “Whenever there is a conflict of testimony, or, for any cause, there is a reasonable doubt as to the facts, or as to the inference to-be drawn from them, negligence is always a question for the jury”: <em>Howett v. Phila. Wil. &amp; Balt. R.

Pennsylvania R. R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/150/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="150 Pa. 73" data-case-ids="834474" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0073-01">150 Pa. 73</a>; <em>Cummings v.

In either event, the question is whether the warning is <em>timely </em>in view of all the circumstances. It cannot be said as a matter of law that thé mere fact that'the whistle was blown at some indefinite time prior to the accident discharged the duty of defendant company. In <em>Crane v. Penna. R. R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/218/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="218 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="999663" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0560-01">218 Pa. 560</a>, it was said, (p. 568) : “In the present case while there was agreement between the witnesses that the whistle of the engine was sounded at or near 'the whistling post, inore than a half mile west of the crossing, there was very positive disagreement as to whether it was sounded more than once, or'whether any signal by bell had been- given. . . . <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>It could not be said as matter of law that the one whistle which witnesses on both sides agree was given, was an adequate warning; therefore it became a question for the jury to determine from all the evidence in the ease whether the defendant had come short of its duty in this regard, and.a submission of the question was unavoidable.” And in <em>Mellon v. Lehigh Valley R. R., </em><a href="/pa/282/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="282 Pa. 39" data-case-ids="1088394" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0039-01">282 Pa. 39</a>, where this Court refused judgment for defendant n. o. v.,. it was categorically stated (p. 42) : “Merely blowing the whistle eighteen hundred feet from the crossing, as plaintiff testified, could not be held a sufficient warning.” .</p>
