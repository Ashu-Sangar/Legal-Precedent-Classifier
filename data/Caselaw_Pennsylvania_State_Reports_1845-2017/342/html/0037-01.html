F. Sulzer.” When the scire facias was issued thereon in 1937, it Avas directed against “Estate of Agustavus W. F. Sulzer.” Gustavus W. F. Sulzer was the last registered owner. He died December 26, 1909, devising the property covered by the lien to Herbert It. Sulzer and Herman W. Sulzer, appellees before us, in trust. They did not register as owners. The sheriff’s return to the writ was “Posted and advertised” on days named “nihil habet as to defendant.” Judgment was entered on the scire facias for want of an affidavit of defense against the Estate of Augustavus W. F. Sulzer, and a levari facias was issued with the same designation. ■ This writ was stayed upon appellees’ petition, in which they set forth that they had no notice or knowledge of the entry of judgment on the lien and asked that the judgment be stricken off. Time was requested to raise money to pay the taxes, admittedly due. The ground of their petition was that the scire facias and judgment did not correctly name the registered owner. The Court of Common Pleas dis<a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>charged the rule to strike off. The Superior Court, on appeal, reversed the lower court, but did not .hold the lien invalid. The effect of this decision is to deny the right of the city to collect the taxes represented by the lien, as the time within which it is required to issue a scire facias to continue.the lien had expired: <em>See Phila. v.
