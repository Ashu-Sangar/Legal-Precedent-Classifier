Appellant acknowledged the notice, denied the right of the Commission, to compel compliance without compensation and stated that it would perform the work “under protest and hold the Commission liable for compensation therefor.” After completing the work, appellant applied for <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>.viewers do; assess, the - damáge. ■ On motion of the.

    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[295,626,1150,418]]]'>Appellant contends that it is entitled to compensation under the Act of 1931, and that the refusal to appoint viewers to assess its damages, in the circumstances stated, results in taking its property without just-compensation, prohibited (1) by the Constitution of Pennsylvania, (2). by. the. due process clause of-the 14th Amendment and (3) by the contract clauses of-both federal and state-constitutions. ■</p>

The portion of the bridge and the approaches to it in the City of Philadelphia are part of the highway system of Pennsylvania: <em>Com. e(p rel.

Appellant’s -structures and appliances-involved were within street lines and have been relocated and reconstructed- within street lines. The consent ordinances conferred no franchise, interest or estate in any particular portion of the streets; on the contrary the grant was expressly subjected to municipal regulation as will appear later. To require appellant to remove -its conduits from one location .in the street to another, or, in other words, .to require it to surrender, in the course of the general improvement, of the highway system, the space in which a conduit was constructed in one part of the street and permit its reconstruction in another, was therefore not,a taking of property; after the reconstruction, the appellant enjoyed the same street franchise under its -consent ordinances as it had. enjoyed before. The cost of the reconstruction or readjustment of facilities was of course a consequence of the Commission’s action but neither the statute nor the constitution requires the Commission to reimburse for such consequential expenditures.</p>

L. 580, 36 PS § 3503, which provides that, if unable to agree with the owner upon terms for the acquisition of real property, the Commission- may acquire, it pursuant to provisions of the Act of 1919, P. L. 814, 36 PS § 3421 et seq. There is no support for that argument because, as we have said, no property has been taken and it has been held that the Act of 1919 makes no provision for compensation for consequential damages:. <em>McGarrity v.
