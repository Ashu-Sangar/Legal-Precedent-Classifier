Mack, who is the appellant here. The latter took a Civil Service examination for the Police Department of Du Bois, a City of the Third Class, in April, 1938, and was appointed by the City Council from a qualified list on July 19,19,39. He served on the police force until Jánuary 17, 1940, when he was discharged by Mayor W. L. Hoover, who had opposed his appointment to the force. His place on the police force was taken by Edward Wilcox, a Sanitary Inspector in the Health Department. He held this position in that department by virtue of the fact that he was. ah incumbent when the <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>Third Class City Code was enacted on June 23, 1931, P.

The appellant petitioned the court below for a writ of alternative mandamus and asked the cóurt to determine whether he, “although lawfully elected policeman,” had been legally removed from that position.. It-is appellant’s contention that the ordinance so far as it attempts to deprive him of his position as policeman is nugatory.</p>

We do not so interpret it. This section gives the Mayors the power in times of emergencies to transfer from the regular police force a detail to be known as “sanitary police” and to return the members of this detail to the duties of regular policemen when their services as sanitary policemen are no longer required. It does not confer upon the Mayor power to give a sanitary officer the status of policeman.</p>

    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[271,687,1151,914]]]'>The City of Du Bois has the undoubted right to reduce, as- a measure of economy, the number of its policemen. It also has the right to assign a policeman to duties as a sanitary officer, for the Third Class City Code so providesj but it has no right to appoint to its police force a person who has never qualified under Civil Service rules for a policeman’s position.' The fact that a man is a sanitary inspector no more legally- qualifies him for the position of policeman than would the fact that he was a sewer inspector. Sanitary inspectors may be metamorphosed into policemen but there is more to the process than the mere enactment óf an ordinance by the Du Bois City Council. A municipal ordinance cannot dispense with the Civil Service Examination which section 4401 of the Third Cláss City Act says is a prerequisite to an appointment “to any position' whatever in the police department.”</p>
    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.6",318,[268,1613,1151,701]]]'>: To transfer “the occupant of the office of sanitary inspector to the police department” and make him- a member of the Bureau of Police with the rank: of sergeant, was an attempted nullification of the Civil Service Law. If this ordinance is legal, any person who is serving in any other department of the municipal government can be made a policeman by fiat of. council, regardless of his lack of qualifications. A man 70 years of age might under the civil service rules qualify for the position of sanitary inspector or for á position in the engineering department, and yet fall far short of- qualifying for the position of policeman,, whose age limit on entering this service in Du Bois is 35 years.</p>

      <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>measure. It has the substancé of illegality, and in sections 3 and 5 it has-also the surface of- illegality.- The law does not permit the city of Du Bois to remove under any guisé a policeman In order to give his status and emoluments to a sanitary inspector. Appellees in their paper book describe the process of transforming a Sanitary inspector into ar policéman as follows :' “On January 8, 1940, ordinance known as Ordinance No. 647 went into effect, by which- the number of policemen was fixed at six, including the Sanitary Inspector, <em>'whose person and ditties-'were </em>combined with the <em>Police Bureau, </em>and <em>appellant1 was </em>dismissed.” (Italics supplied.) The “plain English” of this is that the job of appellant, a duly qualified policeman under Civil Service protection, was arbitrarily taken away from him to niáke a place for a man‘who never legally qualified for a policeman’s job, all this being done in the name of “economy.” Tó economize in public expenditures- is commendable but no economy incident to officiaP action can ever condone its illegality. If what was done here by the Du Bois council is judicially legálized, there would be'no impediment to the council’s appointing: <em>site </em>sanitary inspectors, abolishing the present police force and transferring the “persons and duties” of the former to the Bureau of Pólice; giving to each “person” respective rank from "police chief to patrolman. The action of the Du Bois City-Council does violence to both the spirit and the letter of the Civil Service Law. The language of Judge Cabdozo in <em>People v. Williams, </em><a href="/ny/213/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="213 N.Y. 130" data-case-ids="68822" data-case-paths="/ny/213/0130-01">213 N.

E. 49</a>, is applicable here: “We think that if a new position, similar to the- relator’s, was created -at'-the same time that the-relator’s was abolished, the commissioner was required, in filling -the new position, to prefer the relator over others. The law will not permit him, for the purpose of ousting.the relator and installing some one else to reduce the positions with one hand and increase them with the other.”</p>

The facts in that case distinguish it from the case now before us, where the appellant policeman was avowedly dismissed" so that his position might be given tó a sanitary inspector. In <em>Storm, v. City of Scranton, </em><a href="/pa-super/77/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="77 Pa. Super. 283" data-case-ids="648337" data-case-paths="/pa-super/77/0283-01">77 Pa.

[and] the mere addition of the duty, in his available, time, of assisting in other police work did not change the character of his position or deprive him of the civil service - status, he already had” as sanitary inspector. We are not now concerned with Wilcox’s status as a <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>sanitary inspector. We are concerned only with the removal from office of a duly qualified policeman so that, as the city council declared by ordinance on January 8,1940, the Sanitary Inspector “shall be transferred to the police department and become.a-member of the bureau of police with the rank of sergeant.” (The promotion to “assistant chief of police” soon followed.) Unless this action of the appellees is reversed, the Commonwealth’s promise expressed, in section -4408 of the Act of June 23, 1931, P. L. 932, at page 1113; that “all employes subject to civil service shall be subject to” discharge only after being found guilty by the city council, of charges made against such employes, is illusory.</p>
