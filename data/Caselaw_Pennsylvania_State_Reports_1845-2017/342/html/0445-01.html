It made a loan to defendant in the sum of $325, repayment to be in twelve monthly instalments of $32.08 each, aggregating $384.96; this amounted to a charge for interest and fees of about 35% per annum, which was more than twice as much as would have been permitted under the terms of the Consumer Discount Company Act of April 8, 1937, P. L. 262. Plaintiff had never applied for a license under that act, and defendant, claiming that a rate of interest in excess of 6% per annum was therefore illegal, refused to make the payments called for. by the agreement. This suit was brought by plaintiff to recover the entire debt, the maturity, of which was accelerated by virtue of á provision to that effect in the contract. It was agreed by the parties, in a case stated, that if the court be of opinion that the Consumer Discount Company Act was constitutional, judgment should, be entered for plaintiff for the amount of the loan with interest at the rate of 6% per annum only, or a total of $349.38, but if the act were found to be unconstitutional judgment should be entered in the full amount of $384.96.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The court, deciding that the act was constitutional, rendered judgment for the lesser sum.

There are elaborate provisions for annual reports by the licensees to the Secretary of Banking, for examinations by that official of their books and affairs, and for the revocation of licenses in case of violation of the provisions of the act or for other spe<a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>cified causes.

Excluded from the operation of the act are banking institutions, building and loan associations, credit unions, persons or corporations licensed under the Small Loans Act of 1915 or by the Secretary of Banking under the provisions of any other statute; there are also excluded bona fide sales of personal property by a person regularly .engaged in the sale of such property wherein the purchaser may pay any part or all of the purchase price in stated instalments, and also bona fide sales under conditional sale contracts, leases or bailments.

L. 1012, regulating the business of loaning money in sums of $300 or less to persons pressed by lack of funds to meet immediate necessities was not invalid as special legislation. The court there reiterated the well-known principle (p. 136, A. 506) that “Classification is a legislative question subject to judicial revision only so far as to see it is founded on real and not merely artificial distinctions, and, if the distinctions are genuine, the court cannot declare the classification void, though they may not consider the basis to be sound. The test is not wisdom, but good faith, in the classification.” Considering the question whether there <em>was </em>a genuine distinction between loans under and those over $300 the court concluded (p. 137, A. 507) that the.legislature had properly recognized that small loans “are necessarily attended with greater risk than is ordinarily incident to lending money by banks, pawnbrokers and others who loan only on approved collateral. <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>The fact that loans of this nature rarely exceed the sum of three hundred dollars is admitted, and the adoption of the amount named as a limitation affords a proper criterion for a classification in so far as the peculiar nature and character of the business is concerned.” In <em>Engel v.

S. 128</a>, where the question was as to the validity of a statute requiring a license for those engaged in the business of receiving deposits for safekeeping, but exempting persons where the average sum received on deposit was not less than $500 during the preceding year, the act was sustained, and in the course of his opinion Mr. Justice Holmes said (p. 138) : “It is true, no doubt, that where size is not an index to an admitted evil the law cannot discriminate between the great and small. But in this case size is an index. Where the average amount of each sum received is not less than five hundred dollars we know that we have not before us the class of ignorant and helpless depositors, largely foreign, whom the law seeks to protect.”</p>

In other words, is there a justifiable basis for the legislature’s present selection of $1,000 as the criterion for differentiating classes of loan transactions in regard to permissible rates of interest and other regulations? No one, of course, can say that that amount is the exact point at which all loans change from one character or nature to another, but legislation dealing with social and economic problems cannot be expected, and is not constitutionally required, to be of mathematical exactitude. There are bound to be twilight zones furnishing support to critics who cavil at the want of scientific pre<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>cisión in tlie law. At least it may be said that in the case of the classification adopted in the Consumer Discount Company Act of 1937, as in that embodied in the Small Loans Act of 1915, the legislature did not <em>create </em>distinct classes but merely recognized the fact that they existed. Within the past few decades, beginning with studies published by the Russell Sage Foundation, there has grown up an impressive literature— the product of extensive social welfare research by economists and sociologists — dealing with the subject of consumer credit, consumers’ loans as distinguished from producers’ or commercial loans, and small loan legislation in general.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> From this it appears that there are well-marked differences between consumers’ and commercial loans in regard to the type of borrower, the nature of the security, and the terms upon which the credit is given. Consumers’ loans are apt to exceed $1,000 in amount only in the rarest instances. Such loans are made to persons who desire the money for household or personal objects, for example, to finance the purchase of automobiles or furniture and equipment for the home, or to pay insurance premiums, doctors’ and hospital bills or other items of emergency indebtedness. The usual type of borrower is a clerk or artisan capable of earning a modest living but without sufficient credit or the kind of collateral which would ordinarily be acceptable to a bank. Repayments are generally in monthly instalments. By means of <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>such loans a large portion of tbe population, estimated at more than eighty per cent, has access to credit. Producers’ loans, on the other hand, usually greater than $1,000 in amount, are made to commercial and industrial establishments on the basis of business credit. The borrowers are persons with capital resources. The loans are for short-term periods and repayable at one time instead of in instalments. If the law did not provide for higher charges on consumers’ loans than on the larger commercial loans that type of credit probably could not exist, because the risk is obviously greater, the security is not so good, the duration of the loan is longer, and the operating expense necessary to investigate the borrower and to collect the periodic instalments is considerably higher.®</p>

Moreover, the Consumer Discount Company Act was passed on the basis of a report made by the Secretary of Banking to the House of Bepresentatives on small loan companies and consumer credit, in which report the Secretary said: “We must, if we are to serve the public fully, . . . provide agencies to lend between the $300 limit imposed on the small loan companies and the $1,000 character loan which the average bank in our industrial and commercial centers sometimes finds difficult to lend. . . . The legislature, in seeking to provide adequate consumer credit, should be guided by two basic rules: the borrowing public must be protected against extortionate interest charges and the rates allowed must be sufficient to permit the lender to earn a fair return on his invested capital. Experience has shown that it is impossible to apply the first rule without also employing the second. ... To provide a credit agency for loans up to $1,000 the Department recommends to the legislature the authorization of companies to be known as Consumer Discount Companies. . . . The Department believes that the establishment of such agencies in Pennsylvania will serve a useful purpose and meet a real need. They should enable prospective purchasers of automobiles and the more expensive types of household furnishings to obtain credit for such purchases at a standardized rate of interest far lower than that generally prevailing throughout the Commonwealth today.” The court below was therefore well justified, in the course of its opinion, in asking the question: “Shall we say, Avithout any precise knowledge on the subject, in the face of literature on the subject to the contrary, <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>and also in the face of an extensive report of the Secretary of Banking, made by direction of the House of Representatives, that there is now no need for a further regulation?” And the court properly answered its own interrogatory by saying that “To do so would be to substitute the judgment of the court for that of the legislature acting on a fact-finding report.”</p>

It is to be noted that similar exemptions were contained in section 7 of the Small Loans Act of 1915 as amended by the Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 989, and also in section 30 of the Pawnbrokers Act of April 6, 1937, P. L. 200. These exempted institutions, all of which are covered by other legislation, differ from consumer discount companies in various ways, notably in the kind of collateral upon which their loans are ordinarily made. Such discrimination between different types of lending institutions is not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment as denying the equal protection of the laws: <em>Griffith v.

Of course, all sale or lease contracts which extend credit are, to a certain extent, akin to the making of loans, but where a greater charge is exacted in the case of a sale on credit than in a cash sale it is included in the selling price of the article. It being uniformly held that sellers are free to contract with buyers as to the terms and conditions of sales, the financing of sales of merchandise by the extension of credit has never been considered subject to the prohibition of usury or to regulations applicable to banking and loan transactions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>
