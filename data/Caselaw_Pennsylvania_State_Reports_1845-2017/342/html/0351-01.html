After hearing, the court, below disallowed, the claim, ruling that the evidence,adduced by the Commonwealth was not. sufficient to overcome the presumpr tion of payment arising from the lapse o.f thirty-three to fifty years between the time of ,the expenditures and when the claim therefor was presented at the audit.

It must meet the burden of proof, its evidence must be relevant, - material, the best attainable, and must be presented in due order under the regular rules of procedure. In all such respects it stands upon the same . footing as ordinary litigants. Statutes <em>•. </em>of limitation do not apply to it, because the maxim <em>nullum tempus ocourrit .regi </em>though probably in its origin -a part of royal prerogative has been adopted in our jurisprudence as, a matter of important public policy. But rules of evidence and legal presumptions are not changed for or against the state as a suitor. A statute of limitation is a legislative bar to the right of action, but the presumption of payment from the lapse of time is not a bar at all but simply a rule of evidence, affecting the burden of proof: <em>Miller v.

Moreover, although it has never been held that any lapse of time, however great, will render the présumption so conclusive that it may not be rebutted, it has been repeatedly held that where, as in the present case, there has been a lapse of more than thirty years, it is, in legal effect, so well nigh conclusive as to require the very clearest and most explicit kind of proof to dislodge it.

The record in the present case discloses no direct evidence whatever as to non-payment of the Commonwealth’s claim, the only evidence offered in support of the claim consisting of- an itemized statement certified by one J. Paul Templeton, agent of the Department of Revenue at the Harrisburg Hospital, to be a true and correct statement, prepared from the <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>Hospital's “accounts receivable” ledgers, showing the amounts paid to the Hospital by the Commonwealth for the maintenance and support of the decedent, and a stipulation of counsel admitting that none of the accounts filed by the decedent's committee on May 1, 1891, June 4, 1900, and August 26, 1938, shows any payments to the Commonwealth, the County of York, or the Harrisburg State Hospital, which accounts it is contended “were an admission by the debtor made through persons legally appointed by the court to represent her and to pay debts of just this nature”.</p>

L. 704, section 3; <em>Harnish’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/268/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="268 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="1061561" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0128-01">268 Pa. 128</a>, 131), as to which there is no dispute. Nor are we able to follow the Commonwealth’s argument that, because the accounts filed by the decedent’s committee show no payments on account of its claim, they constitute admissions of non-payment. The accounts filed May 1, 1891, and June 4, 1900, are clearly of no . aid to the Commonwealth’s case, for, as was pointed out in <em>Gregory v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/121/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="121 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="561239" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0611-01">121 Pa. 611</a>, at 622, “the facts and circumstances relied on to rebut the presumption must necessarily be within twenty years before suit is brought”. While the account filed August 26, 1938, is some indication that the charges for the decedent’s maintenance from June 4, 1900, to September 23, 1906, the date of her death, were not met by her committee out of her individual estafé, it is not sufficient to overcome the presumption for the obvious reason that it fails to take into account the well known fact that charges of this character may be, and frequently are, otherwise paid. See <em>Lefever’s' Estate, </em><a href="/pa/278/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="278 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1080550" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0196-01">278 Pa. 196</a>, 198. In this connection, there is a significant lack of evi<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>deuce of. any demand ever having been made upon the decedent’s committee or upon any person legally charge: able with the cost of her maintenance, and no evidence whatever tending to show that such demands would have been futile or otherwise satisfactorily accounting for the omission of the Commonwealth in thus attempting to enforce its claim.</p>

Since, as already indicated, the evidence relied upon is, in our opinion, clearly not of the character required under these .circumstances, it follows, that the court below committed no error in disallowing the claim.</p>
