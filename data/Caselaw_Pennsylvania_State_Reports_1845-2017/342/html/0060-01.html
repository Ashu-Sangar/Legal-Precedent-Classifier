To this petition an answer was filed by the Grand Castle, Knights of the Golden Eagle of Pennsylvania, hereinafter referred, to as the Grand Castle, asserting that “the. petitioner [i. e., the Friends] was instituted and received its charter from respondent on October 28, 1884; it being so instituted as a subordinate lodge of respondent.” Its answer contains certain new matter reading, inter alia, as follows: “8. Respondent, Grand Castle ... is . the Grand ¡Lodge and superior body of an organization commonly known as Knights of the Golden Eagle of the State of Pennsylvania, and the parent organization of petitioner.- 9. Petitioner is one of the many subordinate associations or lodges in said organization. 10.

The act of incorporation by the Grand Castle was a nullity in so far as. its relationship with the subordinate lodges and their constitutent members was concerned. The respective rights and liabilities of the parent and subordinate organizations to each other remained unchanged and the obligations assumed by each to the other and toward their members continued. Moreover, that status was recognized by all parties in interest without qualification. The Grand Castle continued to function as a parent organization in the same manner as it did before incorporation. -This was done with the knowledge, consent and approval of the constitutent bodies. The petitioner recognized the Grand Castle as a superior body under which it operated. In fact, in; a vain attempt to secede* the petitioner itself became incorporated in 1917. . . . It must be conceded that the Grand Castle could not escape its obligations to the subordinate bodies and their members by assuming a corporate form. The converse is likewise true. The subordinate bodies and their members remained bound to the parent body that had created them and to whom they were obligated by contract. The- incorporation, therefore, effected a change not. in identity but merely in legal form. Both in law and in fact the obligations to the parent body, which the petitioners had assumed originally were not affected in any way: <em>Commonwealth v. Heilman, </em><a href="/pa/241/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="241 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="976076" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0374-01">241 Pa. 374</a>; <em>Nokomis Tribe No. 307 v.

In that- case Judge Atjdenkied of the court below pointed out: “In the 5th section of the Act of March 1, 1870, by which the state council of Pennsylvania was granted corporate powers, it was provided that the by-laws of that organization should continue to bind the corporation until altered, amended or abrogated. ... . The object' in this was not to sever the relations of the state council with the rest of the order but for certain purposes, to give it legal personality.” This court took the- same view, stating that the Act of 1870 “did not create a new society, nor was it the foundation of a new organization: It simply gave corporate form to an unincorporated branch- of a society already in existence. . :. J The. manifest intention was to preserve the old order, and to make the incorporated branch an integral part of it. This . . . was the view accepted and acted upon by the national council, state council and members of the order from the time the act .was passed in 1870 until the difficulties arose which gave rise to the present controversy.”</p>

L. 289, effects a change not of identity but of legal form of the subordinate body and does not in any way affect the obligations to the state and national councils which the unincorporated body had originally assumed and which were inherent in its status as a component part of the fraternal organization. We said: “The court below found that after Nokomis Tribe obtained its charter- of incorporation in 1919, it continued in all respects as before so far as its relations with the state and national councils were concerned, paying its per capita tax, electing its representative to the state council, using the name <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>under which its fraternal charter had originally been granted, and, in general, maintaining its operation in accordance with the constitution and by-laws of the unincorporated association. Its charter from the State of Pennsylvania was obtained upon the representation that the Tribe was under the control of the parent bodies of the Order and subject to their laws.” In other words, the mere incorporation of a subordinate body does not destroy its subordinate character when it chooses to remain subordinate.</p>

On June 25, 1917, when petitioner became incorporated, it was the purpose of petitioner to - relieve itself of its obligations to the Grand Castle in so far as its property and funds were concerned. ... 8. Since 1919 or two years after the incorporation of petitioner, it failed to send to the Grand Castle a statement of its arrears, of its per capita tax and copy of the proceedings, and as a result of refusal to pay its per capita tax, the Grand Castle refused to give it a password. 9. Only on two occasions since January 1, 1920, to wit, February 28, 1927, and June 14, 1927, has a district grand chief visited the subordinate lodge. 10. No ballots were supplied by the Grand Lodge to the subordinate lodge to be used for voting of officers thereof. ... 15. The Grand Castle made a number of demands upon the petitioner for the payment of the per capita tax and in 1926 directed an attorney to write a letter to the petitioner demanding the tax and suggesting if it was not paid, an action for dissolution might be brought. This was not followed up by any action.” The first conclusion of law of the court below is as follows: “The Grand Castle . . ., is a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of which the Chosen Friends Castle No. 33 is a subordinate lodge.” In the light of the above quoted findings of fact, it must be <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>concluded that the Chosen Friends Castle No. 33 proved itself a very insubordinate “subordinate”.</p>
    <p id="b90-4" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[272,468,1153,1626]]]'>Appellee relies on the case of <em>Grand Castle, Knights of the Golden Eagle, v. Taylor et al., </em><a href="/pa/278/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="278 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1080543" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0009-01">278 Pa. 9</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.%20210" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="122 A. 210">122 A. 210</a>. Apparently there was no disclosure in that case that the Grand Castle, Knights of the Golden Eagle, was incorporated under the Act of 1874. The court treated the Grand Castle as an unincorporated association. The opinion was predicated on the assumption stated in its very beginning that “defendants comprise the full membership of Altoona Castle,. a subordinate association in a fraternal beneficial organization, of which plaintiff, appellant, is the parent body.” In other words, the fact which was' assumed and apparently conceded as the starting point in <em>that </em>case is the fundamental <em>fact in issue </em>in <em>this </em>case. The opinion in that case refers to “the compact to which defendants subscribed upon becoming members of the Knights of the Golden Eagle,” and says that' it “stipulates certain benefits to be enjoyed and obligations to be; assumed, one of which is, upon a dissolution of their subordinate association, to pass over all funds to the Grand Castle, so that body may continue in its own proper way to carry out the general trust on which such funds had theretofore been held, and this obligation defendants must perform.” The appellant here after being incorporated in June, 1917, neither expressly nor by implication of law subscribed to any such compact. Appellant was a free agent and was subordinate to no other lodge. It was certainly not subordinate to the appellee, for the latter under its charter had no rights of “overlord-ship” in respect to other lodges.</p>

The respective rights and liabilities of the parent and subordinate organizations to each other remained unchanged and the obligations assumed by each to the other and toward their members continued. . . .

The unincorporated body known before 1895 by the same name as that which the appellee now bears ceased to have any legal existence in 1895. It is no party to this proceeding. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania denies to this appellee any right to operate as a “supreme lodge”, for a corporation has no powers except such as are bestowed by the grant contained in its charter. Every charter when read with the statute from which it derives its being designates a certain field of corporate activity; by clear implication engaging in any other field of activity is prohibited as “ultra vires”. Appellee’s demand on the corporate appellant as a lodge “subordinate” to it for the latter’s property upon its corporate dissolution is a demand which this Commonwealth will not enforce. A corporation exists as an objectively real entity<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and <em>its </em>property is as much within the protection of the law as an individual’s property.</p>
