    <p id="b160-16" data-blocks='[["BL_160.20",160,[296,2259,1147,101]],["BL_161.1",161,[170,362,1150,321]]]'>There was sufficient evidence to determine whether the crosswalk, on which plaintiff was injured, was kept <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>in the condition required by law. The verdict establishes that the city failed in its duty.. The complaints noAv are that the amount of the verdict, $7,000, is excessive; that only one judge sat at the argument for the neAv trial, and that the Act of July 1, 1937, P. L. 2547, 53 PS §2774, was misunderstood.</p>
    <p id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[168,694,1154,1468]]]'>(1) The amount of the verdict is questioned on two grounds: (a) that it is excessive and (b) that there was error in charging “If you give any award for pain and suffering in the future you must reduce, the amount of it to what it is worth at present. Apply the rule of present worth. ...” That of course was an erroneous instruction <em>(Yost v. West Penn Rys. Co., </em><a href="/pa/336/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="336 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1195644" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0407-01">336 Pa. 407</a>, 410, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20368" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 A.2d 368">9 A. 2d 368</a>), but, as it was favorable to the city, the error was harmless. The complaint that the recor&lt;d does not justify a verdict in the sum of $7,000 is serious. The plaintiff was a widow, 54 years of age, at the date of the injury, employed on a WPA sewing project earning $60.50 per month. She had been engaged in that occupation for two months, but, up to the time of the trial, had not again been so employed. There is nothing to show that she had not since been capable of performing the same kind of work. Prior to the WPA employment, she kept her own house and “done day Avork — work by the day . . . house cleaning, scrubbing, and washing and ironing” — -but there is no evidence to show how much of her time was so occupied,' and no evidence to show what compensation she received. Before an adult may recover for loss of future earning power there must be evidence that will support a verdict based on it: <em>Campbell v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/252/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="252 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="1021603" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0387-01">252 Pa. 387</a>, 390, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.%20456" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="97 A. 456">97 A. 456</a>; <em>Zimmerman v.

    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.6",161,[167,2172,1152,208]]]'>We think the amount of the verdict rendered cannot be supported and that we must apply the provisions of the Act of May 20, 1891, P. L. 101,12 PS § 1164, and cases construing it.</p>

      <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>Plaintiff suffered a transverse fracture of the right femur. In treating the injury it was necessary to keep the bone in place by weights attached to a Kirschner wire inserted in a hole drilled through the lower part of the leg; her leg was suspended in that way for about eight weeks with resulting pain and discomfort. She was discharged from the hospital three months after the accident and for about two months used a wheel chair and, later, crutches. At the time of trial, two years after the date of injury, she was still slightly lame as the result of a shortening of the leg and used a cane. The doctor testified that this condition would be permanent. There was, of course, pain and suffering. Expenses for medical, hospital and nursing services in the sum of $702.00 were proved.</p>

Instead of subjecting the parties to the expense of further litigation we think, in the light of the record, that the plaintiff will be adequately compensated by a judgment in the sum of $5600.</p>
    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[292,1447,1148,417]]]'>(2) There is nothing whatever in the objection that the motion for a new trial was not heard by the court in banc. The rule requiring such a hearing is well settled <em>(Iacovino v.

At the call of the list on June 3, 1940, the case was continued at the request of the parties concerned and marked for argument for July 17, 1940. Subsequently, in accordance with Lackawanna County Rule of Court No. Ill, counsel for each party separately filed praecipes directing the Prothonotary to place the case on the list for argument on the said date, July 17, 1940.</p>

During the summer vacation, Motion Court is held once a week, on Wednesdays, and one Judge is assigned to preside over sessions of Motion Court for specific periods of thé summer vacation. In this instance the Hon. T.- L. Hoban was the Judge assigned to preside at Motion Court during the month of July, 1940, and the other Judges were on vacation.</p>
