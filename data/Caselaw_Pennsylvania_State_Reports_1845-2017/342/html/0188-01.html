In. adjusting conflicting seniority rights of plaintiffs and the other employees of defendant*, the agreement, referred to above, was made by the Order of Railway Conductors and the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, providing, in the words of the. bill, that “for the purpose of seniority of, employees”, the. transferred branch “should be treated as an individual railroad unit and that the plaintiffs . herein should have seniority over any other employees of the Monongahela Railroad Company,, in so far as said Chartiers Southern Branch was concerned.”</p>

      <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>In 1930, the defendant company constructed an extension to the transferred branch. For about nine years thereafter the extension, .for seniority purposes, was treated as part of the branch originally transferred, and plaintiffs enjoyed the preferential rights claimed under the agreement. During this period, the Order of Railway Conductors was the certified bargaining agent for the class of employees represented by plaintiffs. In February, 1939, however, a new election resulted in the certification of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen. The learned court below found that “Immediately after the election of BRT as bargaining representative for ■ the employees of Railway, it was requested and demanded by such bargaining agent that Railway equalize employment among all its employees as to the Extension by considering it a part of the general trackage of Railway, whereby plaintiffs would not be entitled to prior seniority but only to such rights as would arise under their roster date of January 1, 1927, and that plaintiffs be excluded from employment on. the Extension until, such time as other employees of the Railway had been equalized in number of work hours enjoyed by plaintiffs under their claim of prior seniority. . . . To this construction of the agreement, ... Railwhy acquiesced and, at the request of BRT, replaced three of plaintiffs with employees from other portions of its system, thus depriving plaintiffs of the rights of prior seniority which they claimed and which they had enjoyed for some nine years over Extension.”:. ,</p>
    <p id="b213-3" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[181,1947,1150,537]]]'>One difficulty with plaintiffs’ position is that the defendant, against whom an injunction is asked, was not a party to the only contract pleaded or proved. It was signed only by representatives of the two competing associations of employees. Plaintiffs contend that the Monongahela Railway has adopted this contract as its own by recognizing its provisions, as stated; but the proofs only show that the Railway’s policy has been to accede to the seniority demands of the certified bargaining agent.</p>
