On October 15, 1986, at approximately 8:45 a.m., Appellant, Alix Lockhart, was proceeding south on Cameron Road in Lawrence County en route to Slippery Rock State College where she was attending classes. At that time, she was proceeding downhill through a series of curves, commonly referred to as an “S-curve,” and as she exited the final curve she encountered a garbage truck situated diagonally across her lane of travel. The garbage truck was being operated by Appellee Norman Allen who, at the time, was in the scope of his employment with Appellee Gerald List, t/d/b/a List Refuse Service. Upon seeing the garbage truck, Mrs. Lockhart <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>applied her brakes but was unable to avoid colliding with the truck. She sustained serious injuries as a result of the accident. In addition, both her vehicle and the garbage truck were damaged.</p>
    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[259,547,1159,943]]]'>Following the accident, Mrs. Lockhart and her husband initiated the instant negligence action against Appellees. It was the Appellees’ defense that Mrs. Lockhart violated the assured clear distance ahead rule in failing to drive at a speed which would enable her to stop within her assured clear distance. Appellants countered that Mrs. Lockhart should be relieved of responsibility since the garbage truck presented a sudden emergency to which she reacted in a reasonable manner. The trial court instructed the jury on the assured clear distance ahead rule, but denied Appellants’ request for a charge on the sudden emergency doctrine. The jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of the Appellees. In post-trial motions, Appellants complained, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury on the assured clear distance ahead rule yet refuse to instruct on the sudden emergency doctrine and further, that the instruction as given on the assured clear distance ahead rule was legally incorrect. The trial court denied Appellants’ post-trial motions.</p>

As for the second alleged error, the trial court found that the instruction given was a complete and correct statement of the assured clear distance ahead rule.</p>

Initially, the Superior Court agreed that the sudden emergency doctrine was inapplicable here, one, because “as a matter of law, any emergency which arose was caused by Mrs. Lockhart driving her car at too great a speed to stop before crashing into List’s truck” and two, because “Mrs. Lockhart provided no testimony to the effect that the garbage truck was in <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>motion when it first came into her view.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (memorandum opinion pp. 12-13).

The principles governing our review of such matters is well established. First, in reviewing a claim regarding error with respect to a specific jury charge, we must view the charge in its entirety taking into consideration all the evidence of record and determine whether or not error was committed and, if so, whether that error was prejudicial to the complaining party. <em>Reilly by Reilly v. SEPTA, </em><a href="/pa/507/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="507 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1792334" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0204-01">507 Pa. 204</a>, <a href="/pa/507/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="507 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1792334" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0204-01">489 A.2d 1291</a> (1985). Error will be found where the jury was probably misled by what the trial judge charged or where there was an omission in the charge which amounts to fundamental error. <em>Sweeny v. Bonafiglia, </em><a href="/pa/403/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="403 Pa. 217" data-case-ids="1299503" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0217-01">403 Pa. 217</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.2d%20292" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="169 A.2d 292">169 A.2d 292</a> (1961); <em>Voitasefski v.

Additionally, in reviewing a claim regarding the refusal of a court to give a specific instruction, it is the function of this Court to determine whether the record supports the trial court’s decision. The law is clear that a trial court is bound to charge only on that law for which there is some factual support in the record. <em>Hamley v. George, </em><a href="/pa/365/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="365 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="1225621" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0543-01">365 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20181" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="76 A.2d 181">76 A.2d 181</a> (1950). We note further that it is not the function of the trial court in charging a jury to advocate, but rather to explain the principles of law which are fairly raised under the facts of a particular case so as to enable the jury to comprehend the questions it must decide. <em>Hrivnak v. Perrone, </em><a href="/pa/472/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="472 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1727739" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0348-01">472 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="472 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1727739" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0348-01">372 A.2d 730</a> (1977).</p>

A sharp curve in the roadway presents similar problems; certainly a driver entering or exiting such a curve will often reach a point at which there is virtually no <em>guaranteed </em>clear distance ahead. The assured clear distance ahead rule if taken to the extreme would, under such circumstances, provide that <em>any </em>forward movement would violate the rule where a driver’s vision is impaired by such topography. This would be an incorrect interpretation of the rule. The assured clear distance ahead rule has never been interpreted by this Court as imposing a duty upon a driver to anticipate any and all possible occurrences, however remote. Rather, a driver is required to anticipate only that which is reasonable. <em>Schofield v. Druschel, </em><a href="/pa/359/0630-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="359 Pa. 630" data-case-ids="473089" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0630-01">359 Pa. 630</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20919" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="59 A.2d 919">59 A.2d 919</a> (1948) (having one’s car under control means that in any situation reasonably likely to arise, he will be able to stop his car before doing injury to any person or property); <em>Long v.

McKay, </em><a href="/pa/396/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="396 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1284868" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0183-01">396 Pa. 183</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20265" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="152 A.2d 265">152 A.2d 265</a> (1959). The sudden emergency doctrine is frequently employed in motor vehicle accident cases wherein a driver was confronted with a perilous situation requiring a quick response in order to avoid a collision. The rule provides generally, that an individual will not be held to the “usual degree of care” or be required to exercise his or her “best judgment” when confronted with a sudden and unexpected position of peril created in whole or in part by someone other than the person claiming protection under the doctrine. <em>See Amodei v. Saunders, </em><a href="/pa/374/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="374 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="1241446" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0180-01">374 Pa. 180</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.2d%20362" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="97 A.2d 362">97 A.2d 362</a> (1953). The rule recognizes that a driver who, although driving in a prudent manner, is confronted "with a sudden or unexpected event which leaves little or no time to apprehend a situation and act accordingly should not be subject to liability simply because another perhaps more prudent course of action was available. Rather, under such circumstances, a person is required to exhibit only an honest exercise of judgment. <em>Noll v.

The purpose behind the rule is clear: a person confronted with a sudden and unforeseeable occurrence, because of the shortness of time in which to react, should not be held to the same standard of care as someone confronted with a foreseeable <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>occurrence. It is important to recognize, however, that a person cannot avail himself of the protection of this doctrine if that person was himself driving carelessly or recklessly. <em>Chadwick v.

This particular curve, together with the topography of the roadway, rendered it impossible for motorists traversing the curve in either direction to ascertain what was on the other side of the curve until they were well within the curve. It was the plaintiff’s contention that the assured clear distance ahead rule should not apply because she was confronted with a sudden emergency. The evidence presented in that case, however, consisted of expert testimony which established that plaintiff was driving at an unsafe speed. Specifically, the expert testified that a motorist traveling 30 m.p.h. such as plaintiff, would require a minimal stopping distance of seventy-seven (77) feet and that the average stopping distance was one hundred and one (101) feet. There was also testimony that plaintiff’s assured clear distance at the time of the accident was approximately thirty (30) feet. Thus, the expert testimony established that plaintiff was driving at a speed which would render her unable to stop within her assured clear distance. On those facts, the trial court in <em>Haines </em>found that plaintiff had violated the assured clear distance ahead rule and <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>was, therefore, contributorily negligent <em>as a matter of law. </em>On that basis, the trial court in <em>Haines </em>also found that the sudden emergency doctrine was not applicable reasoning that the plaintiffs violation of the assured clear distance rule rendered the sudden emergency rule inoperable since plaintiff herself created .the emergency by driving too fast.</p>

Mrs. Lockhart testified that her speed just prior to entering the curves was approximately 45 m.p.h., but that she took her foot off the accelerator as she descended the curves. As she exited the last curve, she encountered the garbage truck which was positioned diagonally across both lanes of travel. Fairly viewed, the testimony presented indicates that Mrs. Lockhart was proceeding between 40 and 45 mph at the time she first viewed the garbage truck.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Mrs. Lockhart testified that she was unsure as to whether the garbage truck was moving at the time of the collision because the collision occurred so quickly. Mr. Allen, the driver of the truck, testified that immediately prior to the collision he had his truck in motion but that just seconds before impact he had come to a stop.</p>

We think, however, that a properly drawn instruction explaining the sudden emergency doctrine, in thé proper circumstances, only serves to further clarify for the jury the applicable law. The doctrine itself is far from complex. It does not obliterate the "reasonable man” standard or serve to excuse one from fault, but rather explains to the jury the standard by which to judge the person's behavior in consideration of the emergency. It must be remembered that the doctrine is not applicable where the person claiming it as a defense was negligent in creating the emergency. As such, we discern no inconsistency between the sudden emergency doctrine and the comparative negligence scheme which exists in Pennsylvania. Moreover, the doctrine has been recognized in Pennsylvania since 1854 and has most assuredly survived the advent of comparative negligence in this Commonwealth.</p>
