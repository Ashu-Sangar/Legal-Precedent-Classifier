Essel filed a fatal claim petition with the Bureau of Worker’s Compensation requesting compensation based on the death of her son, Brian K. Adams, who died as a result of work-related injuries on October 2, 1990. At hearings before a referee, claimant testified that she is a sixty-year-old widow, that her son provided financial support for her from 1989, while he was in the Navy, until his death in October 1990. He was discharged from the Navy in August 1990, moved in with his mother <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>shortly thereafter, and went to work for Lineal Industries. Mrs. Essel also introduced evidence of her income and expenses. Her expenses included monthly mortgage payments ranging from $193.79 to $387.58 for a vacation home-trailer purchased in 1987 for $13,500. The referee found that the son was single, without dependent children, living with his widowed mother, and earning $425 per week at the time of his death. He also found that the mother’s average monthly income was $1322, her average monthly expenses were $1400, and that her son contributed approximately $583 per month to his mother from January 1990 through September 1990. The referee concluded, therefore, that Mrs. Essel had sustained her burden of proof that she was partially dependent upon her son at the time of his death and that she was entitled to compensation under the fatal claim petition.</p>

Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that the cost of Mrs. Essel’s vacation trailer-home was not an ordinary necessity of life and, therefore, should have been excluded from the referee’s calculation of expenses. Had it been excluded, Mrs. Essel’s expenses would not have exceeded her income and she would not, therefore, be “dependent” under the act.</p>

Mrs. Essel is not a child, brother, sister or widow of the deceased; rather, she is, in the terms of the statute, a “dependent.” Benefits to Mrs. Essel, therefore, are payable under the portion of the statute governing dependents. The statute terminates a “dependent’s” benefits upon death or remarriage. It does not provide other possible conditions for termination, as it does for children, brothers, sisters, widows and "widowers. We conclude, therefore, that once benefits are paid to a parent who is dependent, they are payable until the parent’s death or remarriage.</p>

    <p id="b916-4" data-blocks='[["BL_916.4",916,[279,582,1153,410]]]'>It will be recalled that Commonwealth Court in <em>Leipziger v.

This means, simply, that when normal monthly bills extant at the time of the child’s death are set off against normal monthly income of the parent, there is a deficit, absent the child’s contribution. Further, in order to qualify as “dependent,” these regular monthly expenditures must be reasonable in light of the life circumstances of the parent at the time of the child’s death.</p>
    <p id="b916-6" data-blocks='[["BL_916.6",916,[270,1565,1156,786]]]'>Here, the purchase of the trailer-vacation home occurred three years prior to the decedent’s death while Mrs. Esser’s husband was still living. The record indicates that Mrs. Essel acquiesced in her late husband’s desire to purchase the property. The total purchase price of the trailer-vacation home was $13,500 and it was to be paid off at the rate of approximately $194 per month over a period of seven years. Mrs. Esser did not incur this expense after her son’s death, but rather, it was a financial reality and a financial burden at the time of his death. Further, it was an expense appropriate to her life circumstances that was incurred at a time when she reasonably expected to be able to afford it. It is not, therefore, an unreasonable expense and is includable in her expenses for purposes of calculating her dependency under the act.</p>

Average monthly expense for utilities over twelve months was $204 and for the two months claimant’s son lived with her, utility expense was $170 per month.
