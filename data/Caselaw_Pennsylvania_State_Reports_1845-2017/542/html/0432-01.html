        <em>. </em>Appellant argues that since Appellees presented no evidence of prejudice at the trial level, we should order the trial court to reinstate Appellant's action. However, since the trial court did not address the <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>question of prejudice, we find that the appropriate course is to remand this matter to the trial court to make that factual determination.</p>

The inconsistency between the first clause, making the statute of limitations applicable to equity actions, and the second clause, indicating that nothing in the statute shall “modify the principles of ... laches ... heretofore applicable in equity matters” is readily apparent. I would respectfully suggest that the General Assembly clarify its intention by redrafting this provision.</p>
