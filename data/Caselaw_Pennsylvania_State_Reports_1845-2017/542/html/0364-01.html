After reviewing those factors, the Commonwealth Court agreed with Employer that even though the first two prongs had been established by the testimony, Claimant’s medical testimony was legally insufficient because it failed to establish that the “incidence of his lung disease is substantially greater in his occupation than [is present] in the general population.” <em>Armco, Inc. v.

Such employer assumes a higher degree of responsibility to its employees for engaging in such endeavors, and the application of the discovery rule to such distinct occupational diseases is clearly consistent with this legislative recognition. The latent and insidious nature of an occupational disease, goes to the disease itself, the work-relatedness is presumed or already established.</p>

Unfortunately for the worker, this is a distinction without a difference. An employee, such as Mr. Mattern, who does not suffer from an occupational disease, and, thus, does not benefit from the discovery rule, knows of his disability but does not know of the relatedness of his injury to his employment. However, in these type of injury cases, the employer has not been put on notice and, thus, not had an opportunity to consider the consequences of their liability for this class of injury. Therefore, in my view, a decision to extend the discovery rule to this type of injury, such as the one at bar, requires consideration and action by the General Assembly, rather than by the judiciary.</p>
    <p id="b696-4" data-blocks='[["BL_696.4",696,[264,1213,1170,786]]]'>The resulting harshness of the General Assembly’s apparent oversight when amending Section 315 places an employee, such as Mr. Mattern, in the anomalous position of having to give notice and file a claim even though neither he nor the employer knows that the employee’s injury is work-related. Here, Mr. Mattern’s benefits will be denied even though he filed a petition immediately after he became aware that his injury was work-related. In light of the remedial nature of the Act, and in fairness to claimants who do not suffer from latent and insidious occupational diseases where coverage would be available, but do suffer from work related injuries of a latent and insidious nature, there is no valid reason to grant coverage in the former but deny coverage in the latter. The discovery rule should be applicable in the latter situations in . order to eliminate such absurd and unfair results.</p>
