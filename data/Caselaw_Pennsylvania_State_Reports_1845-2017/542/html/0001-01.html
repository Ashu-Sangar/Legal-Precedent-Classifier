Appellees argue that food and beverages are necessary and proper for the accommodation and convenience of its patrons, employees, and the public, and that therefore food and beverages must be construed to be a necessary and integral part of public utility service for purposes of determining whether the exclusion applies. The Commonwealth Court below in comparing 66 Pa.C.S. § 1501 with 72 Pa.S. § 7201(o) found that food and beverages were “directly used” in the rendition of appellees’ public utility service and that these items were “necessary and proper not only for the <em>‘accommodation </em>’ of both passengers and crew but for their <em>‘convenience </em>’ as well.” <em>USAir, </em><a href="/pa-commw/157/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="157 Pa.

A review of the statutes in question clearly reveals that the broad public policy language of § 1501 was enacted as a preventive measure to ensure adequate and safe public utility services, while § 7201(o) was specifically enacted to determine whether certain items are excludable under the use tax.</p>

As the Board of Finance and Revenue argues, this holding essentially creates a giant tax loophole for utilities because virtually anything purchased for the accommodation and convenience of its patrons or employees could be excluded from the use tax. Arguably this interpretation could extend even to the office water cooler. If the legislature intended to provide such a broad exclusion, it <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>would not have required that the utility use the item “directly” in the rendition of the public utility service, which in this case, is transportation by air, not distribution of food.

Due to the very nature of in-flight food service, we do not disagree with appellees’ interpretation of the first prong of this test. However, the second tier of the analysis is much more troublesome. Appellees argue that a causal relationship exists between the use of food and beverages and the utility service because public utilities are “statutorily mandated” to furnish services “ ‘as shall be necessary or proper for the accommodation [and] convenience’ of its patrons and staff.” <em>USAir, </em>157 Pa.Commw. at 310, 629 A.2d at 303. Once again, this argument relies solely on the general provisions of § 1501 instead of § 7201(o ) which expressly limits that which may be excluded from the use tax.

In addition, the facts as stipulated by the parties clearly supports the Board of Finance and Revenue’s position that appellees’ vendors are in fact “caterers.” The record reveals that after the food is ordered from the wholesalers and purchased <em>by the vendors </em>it is delivered in bulk to the vendors at the various locations. The vendors then prepare the raw food such as salads and fruit by cleaning, cutting, and removing the unwanted pieces before placing and arranging the food on plastic disposable containers. The containers are also supplied with non-food items which are purchased by appellees, including plastic utensils and napkins, before the containers are covered with <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>lids or foil. Heated foods are prepared by the vendors by thawing, partial cooking or warming of the meats, fish or vegetables, which may also include adding sauces or garnishes. The heated meals are then placed in a reusable service tray, which are owned by appellees and delivered to appellees aircraft at 180 to 190 degrees. The food then becomes consumable at 140 degrees. Appellees’ flight attendants only remove the outside of the containers from the heated meals and serve them to passengers during flight. The vendors also prepare snacks such as sandwiches in cardboard boxes with the associated non-food supplies. All food and beverages are consumed within approximately one hour after delivery to appellees. (R.R., <em>American Airlines </em>at 6a-17a, <em>USAir </em>at 12a-18a).</p>

In <em>Fleet Pizza, </em>the Commonwealth Court held that sales of home delivered pizzas were not catered and thus, not subject to the sales and use tax under § 7204(29). Specifically, the Commonwealth Court noted that home delivery did not amount to catering because the pizzas were not accompanied by utensils, napkins, flatware, condiments or other accessories. <em>Fleet Pizza, </em><a href="/pa-commw/119/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="119 Pa.

Appellants argue that since they in fact purchase the related non-food items directly from the wholesaler and supply these items to the vendors, the vendors are not caterers under the Tax Code. However, service of non-food items by the person functioning as a caterer is not specifically required by the statute or guideline in question. 72 P.S. § 7204(29); 61 Pa.Code § 49.1(a). Rather, the analysis relies on the preparation of ready-to-eat food that is served for a particular meal and at a separate location. Regardless of whether the related non-food items are purchased from a separate vendor or the vendor itself, the entire process ultimately results in food which is fully prepared by the vendors and ready-to-eat. This is corroborated by the fact that the <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>vendors are instructed by appellees to include the non-food items with the prepared food before it is served. More significantly, the prepared meals are intended for immediate consumption for a specific meal at a location other than where the food is prepared. Accordingly, whereas the vendors’ activities clearly amount to that of a caterer, appellees’ purchase of the prepared food and related non-food items are taxable under Pennsylvania sales and use tax.</p>

So long as meals served on commercial air flights are served with consideration for (1) the proximity of the flight to normal meal hours and (2) the length of the flight, I would hold that the meals are used in the “direct operational function” of providing air service, and are, therefore, non-taxable. Even the department’s guidelines for determining “direct use” compel this result: such meals are in physical and time proximity to the service. There is certainly a causal relationship between providing meals and the need of people to eat. See 61 Pa.Code § 32.34(a)(1).</p>
