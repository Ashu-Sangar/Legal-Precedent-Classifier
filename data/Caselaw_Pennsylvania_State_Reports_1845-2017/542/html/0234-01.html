At the end of the demonstration, Johnson <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>unfurled an American flag, doused it with kerosene, and set it on fire while fellow protestors chanted anti-American slogans. Johnson was arrested and charged with desecrating a venerated object in violation of the Texas Penal Code. He was later convicted on this charge. On appeal, Johnson challenged his conviction on the grounds that it violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The United States Supreme Court held that burning the flag as part of a political demonstration was expressive conduct within the protections of the First Amendment. <em>Johnson, </em><a href="/us/491/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="491 U.S. 397" data-case-ids="6214891" data-case-paths="/us/491/0397-01">491 U.S. at 405-06</a>, <a href="/us/491/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="491 U.S. 397" data-case-ids="6214891" data-case-paths="/us/491/0397-01">109 S.Ct. at 2540</a>.

Thus, the Commonwealth’s application of Section 2102 to Ms. Bricker’s display of the flag must undergo scrutiny under the <em>O’Brien </em>test. Most important, in this context, is the requirement that the Commonwealth present an interest in regulating expression unrelated to the suppression of free expression. The only interests advanced by the Commonwealth in regulating Ms. Bricker’s conduct are “to defend the physical integrity of the flag”, Appellant’s Brief at 13, and “to protect the symbolic value of the flag”, <em>Id. </em>at 14. These are the identical interests that the <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Eichman </em>Courts explicitly found related to the suppression of free expression under the third prong of <em>O’Brien.

We in no way endorse the shoddy and disrespectful treatment of the American flag by Ms. Bricker. We are mindful of the fact that the flag is an important symbol to millions of Pennsylvanians, particularly those who fought for it in our nation’s armed forces. Indeed, our Commonwealth has a unique relationship with the flag as it was here, tradition holds, that a Pennsylvanian, Ms. Betsy Ross, designed the first flag. Despite this long and deserved place of honor for the flag in this Commonwealth, we cannot find that Ms. Bricker’s private display of the flag in her own home merits criminal sanction. Tolerance of Ms. Bricker’s disrespectful treatment of the flag is what separates this nation from those that routinely punish dissident voices for the smallest infractions against the national orthodoxy. Instead, we agree with the United States Supreme Court that “[w]e do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration, for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem represents.” <em>Johnson, </em><a href="/us/491/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="491 U.S. 397" data-case-ids="6214891" data-case-paths="/us/491/0397-01">491 U.S. at 420</a>, <a href="/us/491/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="491 U.S. 397" data-case-ids="6214891" data-case-paths="/us/491/0397-01">109 S.Ct. at 2548</a>.

In fact, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Eichman, </em>only discussed the government’s interest, as quoted at length by the Concurrence, once it had determined that flag burning was symbolic speech within the protection of the First Amendment. In a casé of non-expressive conduct such an analysis is not implicated. Essentially, the Concurrence sets forth the syllogism that because the government’s interest in regulating the physical integrity of the flag is always related to the suppression of free ideas, any use of the flag must express an idea and, therefore, our statute is facially unconstitutional. However, this argument collapses under the weight of its own lack of logic. Where the use of the flag is non-expressive, we are not concerned with the interest the government has in regulating free expression as the First Amendment is not implicated.</p>
