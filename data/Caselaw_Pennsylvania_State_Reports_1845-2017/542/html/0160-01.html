Later that day, appellant and Rodriguez argued once again in front of Rodri<a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>guez’ home. When Rodriguez’ sister, Diane Hernandez, attempted to block appellant’s path and prevent him from entering the house, appellant kicked her in the stomach and knocked her to the ground. The police were called and soon arrived. Although they attempted to arrest appellant, he was able to elude them by jumping out of a second story window and fleeing the area.

Appellant argues that the trial court’s denial of his severance motion impermissibly allowed the Commonwealth to proceed against appellant for the murder of Officer Montijo in the same trial that it prosecuted appellant for his assaults against Jose Rodriguez and Diane Hernandez. Appellant argues that the admission of the facts and circumstances of the earlier assaults was unnecessary for the Commonwealth to prove any issue related to the killing of Officer Montijo. Appellant claims that the admission of evidence relating to these prior bad acts painted him as a person of bad character with a propensity toward violence and that such evidence was so prejudicial he was deprived of a fair trial.</p>

Appellant argues that since no such nexus was established the evidence had no probative value, or, in the alternative, that the photographs still should have been excluded because the prejudice caused by the introduction of those photographs far outweighed their probative value.

First, appellant asserts that the prosecutor committed misconduct when, over defense counsel’s objection, he asked a defense expert psychologist if his opinion that appellant felt remorse for Officer Montijo’s death would change if he knew about a post-verdict exchange between appellant and Officer Montijo’s family. The basis of this argument is that post-verdict, appellant made an obscene gesture at members of the victim’s family by raising his right middle finger to them and told them that the slain officer “got what he deserved.” During the penalty phase, appellant presented this psychologist to testify that appellant felt remorse for Officer Montijo’s death in an effort to persuade the jury to mitigate their consideration of appellant’s penalty for Officer Montijo’s murder. Appellant argues that the hypothetical was improper because there was no evidence of record supporting the hypothetical as required by <em>Commonwealth v. Petrovich, </em><a href="/pa/538/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="538 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="475529" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0369-01">538 Pa. 369</a>, 372, <a href="/pa/538/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="648 A.2d 771" data-case-ids="475529,7874552" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0369-01,/a2d/648/0771-01">648 A.2d 771</a>, 772 (1994) (an expert may give his opinion in response to a hypothetical, provided that the set of facts assumed in the hypothetical is eventually supported by competent evidence). However, the issue of appellant’s remorse (or lack thereof) for Officer Montijo’s death was not introduced until the defense put its psychologist on the stand. The prosecution, therefore, had no opportunity to present the testimonial evidence of appellant’s confrontation with Officer Montijo’s family before posing the hypothetical to the psychol<a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>ogist. At a sidebar conference, the Commonwealth informed the trial court that it was prepared to offer the testimony of 20 potential witnesses to prove the occurrence of the post-verdict event. Upon learning of the basis of the Commonwealth’s hypothetical, the trial court ruled that the Commonwealth’s question was proper and that the Commonwealth could present the evidence on the incident if the expert testified that it might alter his opinion. The prosecutor committed no misconduct on this point because a good faith basis for the hypothetical existed at the time the question was posed. <em>Petrovich, supra. </em>After the sidebar discussion, the expert, upon further cross-examination, refused to apply the term “remorse” to appellant’s feelings regarding his murder of Officer Montijo. On this basis, the trial court ultimately ruled the issue moot and declined to let the prosecutor continue to proceed with this line of questioning. Under these circumstances, the prosecutor clearly did not commit misconduct merely by posing his hypothetical question to test a defense expert’s opinion.</p>

The essence of the prosecutor’s argument was to convince the jury to sentence appellant to death as a form of retribution for the ills inflicted on society by those who sell drugs.

This, we believe, went far beyond the permissible limits of oratorical flair and aggressive advocacy. <em>See Commonwealth v. Chambers, </em><a href="/pa/528/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="528 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1829794" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0558-01">528 Pa. 558</a>, 584, <a href="/pa/528/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="528 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1829794" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0558-01">599 A.2d 630</a>, 643 (1991) (prosecutor’s statement to jury during closing argument of sentencing proceeding that the Bible says “and the murderer shall be put to death” was prejudicial error). Because appellant correctly argues that the prosecutor’s comments during the penalty phase were so prejudicial as to deprive him of a fair penalty determination, we find that trial counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to object to these comments which left the jury with a fixed bias against appellant based upon comments not grounded in evidence of record. Further, we believe that counsel’s failure to object was more susceptible to causing an unfair penalty determination since, here, the jury found two mitigating circumstances and only one aggravating circumstance. The prosecutor’s comments were such that they could have impermissibly shifted the balance in favor of a death sentence. Therefore, since trial counsel could not have had a reasonable basis for not objecting, we find trial counsel ineffective. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s "Statement of Questions Involved" section of his brief also includes a reference that the trial court denied him a fair trial by permitting the prosecutor to repeatedly question witnesses as to appellant’s propensity to carry weapons. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at iii, 32. However, appellant fails to even mention this claim again (much less develop this claim) in the "Argument” section of the brief. Accordingly, the claim is waived. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Appellant does not assert in his "Statement of Questions Involved” section of his brief that trial counsel was in any way deficient for failing to take certain measures to remove or reduce the prejudice caused by the prosecutor's alleged misconduct. Therefore, we will not consider the fleeting and sporadic interjections in the Argument section of his brief that counsel was ineffective for failing to move for a mistrial. Pa.R.A.P. 2116(a). <em>See also Baker, <a href="/pa/531/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="139" data-cite="531 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1834316" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0541-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/531/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="531 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1834316" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0541-01">531 Pa. at 562</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="531 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1834316" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0541-01">614 A.2d at 673</a> (generalized claims of ineffectiveness without particularized analysis must be rejected). Moreover, notwithstanding appellant’s failure to explicitly develop a claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness, the alleged prosecutorial misconduct during the guilt phase did not entitle him to a new trial <em>(see </em>discussion infra); hence, trial counsel’s failure to request a mistrial caused no prejudice, thereby effectively voiding any claim of ineffectiveness on this basis. <em>See Edmiston, <a href="/pa/535/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="142" data-cite="535 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1841472" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0210-01">supra</a> </em>(defendant must prove that trial counsel’s ineffectiveness prejudiced his defense).</p>
