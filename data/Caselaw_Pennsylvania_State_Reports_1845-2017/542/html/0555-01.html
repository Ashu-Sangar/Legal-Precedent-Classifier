It also found that the instant action was based on theories of trespass and constitutional torts and raises the issue of whether the police power was actually validly exercised. It concluded that the eminent domain action did not litigate nor decide the issue of whether the Owners’ constitutional rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated; therefore, the instant action was not barred. The court also found that based on the evidence, a jury could find that the Chief Housing Officer was a high-ranking, policy-making official for whose actions the jury could impute municipal liability to the City. Moreover, it found that a jury could find a pattern or series of acts by the City which denied the Owners their constitutional rights. Accordingly, it affirmed the jury verdict in favor of the Owners.</p>
