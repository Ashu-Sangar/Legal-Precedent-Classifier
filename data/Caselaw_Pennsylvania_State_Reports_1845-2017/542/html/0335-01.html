    <p id="b651-12" data-blocks='[["BL_651.12",651,[191,1333,1148,687]]]'>On March 28, 1995, the Wilkinsburg Education Association et al. (hereinafter “the union”) filed a complaint in equity and a motion for preliminary injunction in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. The union sought to prevent the Wilkinsburg School Board from entering into a contract with Alternative Public Schools, Inc. (APS) for operation and management of Turner School. Argument on this complaint was conducted the next day, and was limited to legal argument only. The board objected to proceeding without an evidentiary hearing, but the chancellor determined that a hearing was not necessary because only matters of law were at issue. The controlling statute was the Public School Code of 1949, 24 P.S. § 1-101 et seq.</p>

The chancellor also determined that the harm alleged was both immediate and irreparable, particularly harm to the plaintiff-taxpayers, who might not be able to recover any monies paid to the corporation, and that there is no provision of the School Code which authorizes a school district to enter into a contract with a private entity for the education of children who live in the district. The chancellor also found that an injunction would preserve the status quo and that the union was likely to prevail on the merits. Based on these findings, the chancellor issued a preliminary injunction and ordered that any appeal would not act as an automatic supersedeas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

On May 5, 1995, Judge Kelton, of Commonwealth Court, reinstated the automatic supersedeas which had been removed by the chancellor, based on his view that it was error to grant the preliminary injunction without holding a hearing, particularly on the issue of <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>irreparable harm. Judge Kelton also noted, but did not decide, that Section 1124 of the School Code, which grants the board certain powers, was claimed by the board as authority <em>for </em>its acts, thus raising an issue as to whether the chancellor was correct in finding that the School Code did not authorize the board’s acts.</p>
    <p id="b653-4" data-blocks='[["BL_653.4",653,[243,643,1147,839]]]'>On July 17, 1995, a three-judge panel of Commonwealth Court, with one judge dissenting, affirmed the chancellor’s preliminary injunction. Commonwealth Court’s affirmance was based on the view that no evidentiary hearing was required since all material facts were undisputed, and that immediate and irreparable harm could be determined from the fact of the proposed contract. Additionally, Commonwealth Court stated that the chancellor need not rule on the merits of the controversy at the preliminary injunction stage, but only that the claim raises substantial legal questions. Moreover, Commonwealth Court held that the public interest was defined by the School Code, which requires that the board not take any action not authorized by the School Code. The court’s order affirmed the chancellor’s original order.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The board filed an application for reconsideration on July 19, 1995.

On the same day, the chancellor found the board in contempt and ordered that certain actions be taken no later than August 28, 1995. In response to a supplemental emergency petition to assume plenary jurisdiction, this court then stayed all contempt proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.4",654,[226,944,1151,301]]]'>The board raises three primary arguments on appeal. First, it claims that it was error to enter the preliminary injunction on the grounds, inter alia, that a hearing was necessary before an injunction could be issued. Our standard of review in the issuance of a preliminary injunction is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b654-5" data-blocks='[["BL_654.5",654,[260,1278,1117,685]]]'>Unless there were “apparently reasonable grounds” for the trial court to believe that it was presented with a situation of “urgent necessity”, it should not have issued the preliminary injunction. The two most important factors to be taken into account in this determination are first, whether an immediate and irreparable harm is actually threatened, and second, whether greater harm is caused by issuing the injunction than by refusing it. This limitation on the hearing court’s exercise of its equitable powers is warranted because the relief is being sought prior to a final determination of the merits of the case and without a complete development of all of the facts upon which a final judgment will depend.</blockquote>
