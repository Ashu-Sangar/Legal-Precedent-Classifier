The reliability of the prior inconsistent statement is further strengthened by both the testimony of B.M. and appellant’s statement in which he confessed to performing oral sex on B.M. and his grandson. B.M. testified, consistent with his prior statement, that G.W. was present at the time appellant performed oral sex on him. This corroborates the portion of G.W.’s statement in which he said he stood guard while his grandfather performed oral sex on G.W. Moreover, appellant’s own signed statement corroborates the prior statement of G.W. Therefore, G.W.’s prior statement had sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant its admission under the Tender Years Hearsay Act.

In fact, on September 6, 1990, appellant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to prevent the Commonwealth from introducing the statement into evidence in the event that the victim denied having made the statement. In that motion, appellant stated that the victim was eight years old at the time the statement was made and stated that the defense believed that the Commonwealth intended to introduce the statement at trial. Thus, his own actions to exclude use of the statement as substantive evidence demonstrate that he had sufficient notice that the statement could be admitted as a hearsay exception under the Tender Years Hearsay Act.

The circumstances under which the statements were made combined with the corroboration from the statements of both B.M. and appellant <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>provide sufficient indicia of reliability to make the statement admissible under the Tender Years Hearsay Act. As with all exceptions to the rule forbidding the admission of hearsay evidence, once the statement or other evidence is accepted as an exception to the hearsay rule, then that statement or evidence becomes substantive evidence and, if relevant, is admissible in the trial of one accused of criminal conduct. The Tender Years Hearsay Act provides a hearsay exception in Pennsylvania and G.W.’s statement is admissible as substantive evidence in the trial of appellant, notwithstanding the rule espoused by this Court in <em>Lively, <a href="/pa/530/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="530 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="1833065" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0464-01">supra.</a></em>

    <p id="b647-4" data-blocks='[["BL_647.4",647,[234,944,1144,206]]]'>Accordingly, I would hold that the statement was admissible as substantive evidence and affirm the order of the Superior Court affirming the judgment of sentence, albeit on different grounds.</p>

In view of the fact that the child’s statement was provided and the child’s age at the time the statement was known, defense counsel, who is charged with knowing the law of this Commonwealth as an attorney admitted to practice in the Commonwealth, should have been on notice that such statement could be used under the Tender Years Hearsay Act at the time such information was first provided by the prosecution.</p>

There is no indication that the Commonwealth knew that the witness would change the testimony prior to the time the child took the witness stand. Because the Commonwealth was surprised by the testimony, they could not have given additional advance notice of their intention to introduce the statement.</p>
