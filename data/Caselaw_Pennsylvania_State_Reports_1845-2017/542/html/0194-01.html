In December of that year, Dr. Garcia referred him to Dr. Jay Paul, who performed a fiberoptic bronchoscopy on Baumgart in January of 1985. The procedure enabled Dr. Paul to obtain a pleural biopsy which, upon examination, was diagnosed as mesothelioma. Baumgart and his wife were aware of the diagnosis of mesothelioma before the end of January, 1985.

We have held that the statute of limitations begins to run as soon as the right to institute and maintain a suit arises; lack of knowledge, mistake or misunderstanding does not toll the statute of limitations: <em>Pocono International Raceway, Inc. v.

Appellant, however, had approximately 22 months after the decedent’s death to investigate the specific causes of the injury and to commence an action. The discovery rule does not operate to exclude from the limitations period the time following the occurrence of an injury when, due to the injury, it would be impractical for a party to seek out the cause. Rather, the limitations period set by the legislature includes adequate time to deal with the injury and investigate its cause in time to commence an action. To decide otherwise would be to hold that the limitations period commences not with the occurrence of the injury, but at an indeterminate time thereafter, allowing a reasonable time to cope with the effects of the injury.</p>

Dr. Balinchak stated in his notes that the “patient is a pipe smoker and denies any exposure to asbestos.” (R.R. at 154A). Mr. Baumgart was hospitalized once again on March 19, 1985, and remained in the hospital until his death on March 31, 1985. During this final hospitalization, he was in respiratory failure and required intubation. The cause of his death was massive pleural effusion and mesothelioma.</p>

Appellees argued that the decedent was diagnosed with mesothelioma in January of 1985 and the diagnosis was confirmed several weeks later in February 1985. Thus, Appellees assert that the two year statute of limitations commenced in January or February of 1985, and, therefore, expired before Appellant initiated her third party action in March of 1987. The trial court agreed that the Appellant had commenced her third party action beyond the two year limitations period. The court rejected Appellant’s claim that neither she nor her husband became aware of the connection between his mesothelioma and his occupational disease until after his death on March 31,1985.</p>

A en banc panel of the Superior Court reversed the trial court’s grant of summary judgment as to the wrongful death cause of action. The panel correctly noted that the two year statute of limitations period for a wrongful death claim begins to run at death. Thus, the court held that the third party action, filed on March 26,1987, fell within the limitations period as it was filed within two years of Mr. Baumgart’s death on March 31, 1985. However, the panel affirmed that part of the trial court’s order dismissing Appellant’s survival action against Appellees as having been filed beyond the two year limitations period. Appellant argued that the two year limitations period was tolled in this case because neither she nor her husband discovered the cause of her husband’s death until after he died. The Superior Court refused to apply the “discovery rule” to this case in the manner suggested by Appellant, holding that the Appellant and the Decedent failed to exercise due diligence in discovering the cause of his mesothelioma once the condition had been diagnosed. This Court granted allocatur, and I would now reverse.</p>

I cannot agree that, as a matter of law, reasonable minds could not differ over the whether Appellant and the decedent exercised reasonable diligence. This Court has stated that the discovery rule is particularly applicable when the plaintiffs failure to discover the cause of an action is the result of “blameless ignorance.” <em>Pocono Intern.

Throughout this short period, the decedent was engaged in the dying process. The record establishes that the decedent was in pain for much of this period and under the influence of medication. I believe that a jury could easily find the decedent’s failure to <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>discover the cause of his injury during this difficult period was due to “blameless ignorance” rather than “somnolence.” Thus, this is not a case where reasonable minds could not differ and, therefore, I would hold that the trial court erred in finding a lack of reasonable diligence as a matter of law. Certainly, this is not the type of case where the right to a grant of summary judgment is “clear and free from doubt.” <em>Hayward v. Medical Center of Beaver County, </em><a href="/pa/530/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="530 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1833007" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0320-01">530 Pa. 320</a>, 324, <a href="/pa/530/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="530 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1833007" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0320-01">608 A.2d 1040</a>, 1042.

    <p id="b523-4" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[201,927,1149,574]]]'>The Opinion in Support of Affirmance argues that the discovery rule should not apply to the instant case because the Appellant knew of the cause of the decedent’s illness within the limitations period. It is also argued that we should take a retrospective view and determine whether the party seeking the discovery rule knew of the cause of his illness within the limitations period. If so, the Opinion in Support of Affirmance would hold that the party could have filed suit within the limitations period and, therefore, is not entitled to the benefit of the discovery rule. This approach creates several practical problems.</p>

Under the construct advanced by the Opinion in Support of Affirmance, this party could have filed suit within the limitations period and, therefore, is not entitled to the benefit of the discovery rule, although only having a day or a week to bring his cause of action. This somewhat exaggerated, although certainly plausible, hypothetical points to the weakness under this approach; it deprives the affected party of the full limitations period in which to bring his suit. Instead, a party may be left with a dramatically curtailed limitations period. Another hypothetical further demonstrates the weakness of the position espoused by the Opinion in Support of Affirmance argument. Theoretically, a party could discover the cause of his disease a week after the expiration of the limitations period. Apparently, the Opinion in Support of Affirmance <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>would apply the discovery rule and accord this party the full benefit of the two year limitations period because he could not have filed suit within the statute. What a difference a week or two makes under such an argument! I simply do not believe that the limitations period should be based on a retrospective determination of whether a party could have filed suit before the expiration of the limitations period.</p>
