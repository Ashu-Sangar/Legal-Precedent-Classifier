At the time period in question, Appellant and Stanley were residents of a rooming house at 2516 Peach Street in Erie, Pennsylvania. Their rooms were directly across the hall from one another, and they shared a common sitting room/kitchen with each other and one additional resident of the third floor.</p>

Stanley invited Gaffield to share his room. While staying with Stanley, Gaffield met Appellant and his co-defendant, Daniel Funt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> According to Gaffield’s testimony, he, Appellant, and Funt were sharing a drink together in the common area late on the afternoon of October 1, 1992, when Appellant and Funt attacked him from behind, without provocation. Gaffield testified that he was severely beaten and rendered unconscious. At the time of the beating he had been wearing black jeans and a tee shirt. Upon regaining consciousness Gaffield realized that his own clothes were missing, and he was clad in a <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>pair of pants that were too large, that he did not recognize, and no shirt.</p>

Gaffield awakened at some point on Friday to find that Stanley and a woman, Marlena Valenta, were also in Stanley’s room. Stanley and Marlena were sharing a bottle of vodka and offered some to Gaffield; he declined. Gaffield testified that his injuries caused him to remain on the sleeping bag, wavering in and out of consciousness, for the entire day of October 2nd.</p>
    <p id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[209,947,1150,1103]]]'>At some point around 2:30 a.m., October 3, 1992, Gaffield was awakened when the door to Stanley’s room was kicked open by a man wearing a mask who entered the room and proceeded to severely beat Stanley. A second man was standing in the doorway holding a flashlight during the beating. The beating lasted about one minute and the man left. A few minutes later, a second man entered the room with a hood over his head. The second man also beat Stanley and kicked Marlena in the head. Gaffield said the man tried to beat him but stopped after only hitting him once in the face and once in the chest because Gaffield told the man he had already been beaten. This second attack also lasted about one minute. Another brief pause occurred and then a third man entered the room. The third man was positively identified by Gaffield as the Appellant. Gaffield also identified a pair of light colored shorts with thin stripes that Appellant was wearing during the attack. Gaffield testified that Appellant knocked Stanley to the floor, then picked Stanley up from the floor and continued to beat him, finally dropping Stanley back on the floor at the foot of the bed. During this final encounter, Gaffield begged Appellant to stop.</p>

If you F with our cocaine and money again, we’ll come back and kill you.” After that, the Appellant came back into the room and acted unaware of what had transpired. Appellant attempted to offer Stanley assistance and then took Marlena <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>by the hand and led her back to his own room across the hall. Gaffíeld testified that he and Stanley then went to sleep. Later that morning, Saturday, October 3, 1992, at 9:00 a.m., Gaffield walked across the street to the Rite-Aid pharmacy seeking assistance. The manager of Rite-Aid called an ambulance and Gaffield spent the next ten days in intensive care with multiple rib fractures, contusions, and punctures in both lungs. According to Gaffield, Stanley refused to seek medical attention.</p>
    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[241,859,1153,532]]]'>Marlena Valenta testified to the same scenario of three separate assaults as Gaffield. However, Marlena testified that Gaffield was kicked by the second assailant. Marlena also identified Appellant as the third assailant. After being led into Appellant’s room, Marlena observed Daniel Funt with what appeared to be fake blood on his face. Funt told Marlena that he had chased three black men out of the building and had been injured in the process. Marlena testified that after having a drink to calm her nerves she went to sleep.</p>

Appellant told Marlena that Gaffield had gone to the hospital in an ambulance and that Stanley was resting. On three separate occasions during the course of the day she observed Appellant fill a large glass with vodka which he said he was giving to Stanley. Marlena testified that except for a brief period of time on Saturday morning when she was sent to the home of Appellant’s wife, Chris Paolello, Appellant kept her in his room.</p>
    <p id="b374-7" data-blocks='[["BL_374.6",374,[232,2007,1155,367]]]'>On Sunday morning, Appellant again sent Marlena to his wife’s house, which was across the street from the rooming house. While with Appellant’s wife, Marlena learned that Stanley’s body had been found in the alley. When she returned to Appellant’s room, he told her to stay quiet because she might incriminate herself. Marlena stayed in Appellant’s room through Monday morning.</p>

While at the office, she told the story of the beating to Hugh Price who was also waiting at the office to register for benefits. The conversation was triggered by the fact that Mr. Price was reading the morning paper containing a story on the discovery of a body in the alley off Peach Street. Marlena told Price she was there and knew about the body. Marlena also told the story of the beatings to Cheryl Moore an employee of the welfare office who conducted the interview with Marlena. Officer Gerald McShane testified that he received a phone call from Price on October 5, 1992 relating the conversation with Marlena, identifying her as a possible witness in the death of James Stanley.</p>

Appellant denied knowing anyone by that name and when Detective DiPaulo asked the identity of the woman in Appellant’s room he initially said it was his wife, then amended that to his girlfriend; finally Appellant admitted that it was the woman <em>diej </em>were looking for. Marlena agreed to cooperate with the Detective and left the building in his custody. Before leaving the rooming house, the Detective searched Appellant’s room and Daniel Hunt’s room.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In Funt’s room the Detective observed a vial containing fake blood.</p>

Richardson testified that Appellant seemed nervous and also said that Appellant had ignored him before Stanley’s death, but afterwards came to him often during the police investigation. On October 6, 1992, Richardson told police about his conversations with Appellant.</p>

In October of 1992, while Brian was a resident of the Erie County jail, Linda discovered a pair of men’s white shorts with thin stripes in her barbecue grill. Linda testified that Sue Brasington, a girlfriend of Anthony DeFranco, placed the shorts in the grill. After discussing the matter with Brian, Linda put the shorts in a plastic bag and placed the bag in the trunk of her car. On October 14, 1992, after further discussions with Brian, Linda arranged for the Erie police to retrieve the shorts.</p>

Both Allen Gaffield and Marlena Valenta identified the shorts as being the same as the shorts worn by Appellant at the time Stanley was beaten. Christine Tomsey, a forensic scientist, conclusively matched the DNA in the blood found on the shorts with that of James Stanley, and further conclusively excluded the DNA in the blood stain on the shorts from matching the DNA of Appellant.</p>

Cooper testified that Appellant approached Cooper during his martial arts exercises; Appellant ostensibly sought to work out with Cooper as he professed a background in martial arts. Cooper testified that Appellant admitted to him the role Appellant played in the death of James Stanley. According to Cooper, Appellant was concerned that he would be linked to the death of Stanley because Anthony DeFranco had given Appellant’s bloody shorts to Brian Marlowe, who in turn had delivered them to the police. Cooper testified that Appellant told him that he, DeFranco, and another guy beat Stanley. The two other people began the beating while Appellant waited in the hall listening. Ap<a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>pellant was the last person to deliver blows to Stanley. Cooper asked Appellant why he had done this, and Appellant responded that he was angry with Stanley for bringing Gaffield into the rooming house and letting him stay there without paying rent. Appellant told Cooper that Gaffield was noisy and always drunk.</p>
    <p id="b377-4" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[182,653,1147,624]]]'>Appellant told Cooper that after the beating he was concerned that the police would investigate because of the noise and find Stanley and Gaffield all beat up. Appellant said Stanley wanted to go to the hospital but Appellant wouldn’t let him and instead kept giving Stanley vodka until he couldn’t drink anymore. Appellant said he told Gaffield to go to the hospital but told Stanley, “the only doctor your going to see is this vodka.” Appellant then told Cooper that he and the two co-conspirators dumped Stanley in the alley. Cooper asked Appellant why he killed Stanley, and Appellant responded “he was just a drunk from out of town, beat to death and died, and that’s all we thought it would come to.”</p>

While searching the immediate area for evidence, an officer discovered a tee shirt and black jeans in a burn barrel near the body.

He testified that death was equally attributed to two causes: trauma and alcohol poisoning. The doctor testified that death ultimately occurred through respiratory failure. Stanley had received multiple trauma wounds, with fifteen (15) separate rib fractures on the right side, and twelve (12) separate rib fractures on the left side of his body. At the time of death, the blood alcohol level in Stanley’s body was 3.9%; in the doctor’s opinion, 3.6% blood alcohol is lethal. At the time of death, Stanley had a full bladder with an <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>extremely high alcohol-urine content which led the doctor to conclude with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Stanley was in an alcohol induced coma at the time his respiratory system shut down, thus, bringing about death.</p>

From the evidence presented, it is reasonable to conclude that in the present case, Appellant and his co-conspirators developed an elaborate scheme to beat Stanley and lay the blame on three persons allegedly in a gang known as the “Hood.” This scheme involved the use of masks and fake blood. Then, in an effort to divert blame from themselves regarding the beating, Appellant, along with the co-conspirators, knowingly caused Stanley to swallow a lethal dose of alcohol and dumped his body in an alley. By leaving the bruised and alcohol filled body in the alley, Appellant planned that the police would assume Stanley had brought about his own demise through drinking. As Appellant told Cooper: “He was just a drunk from out of town, beat to death and died, and that’s all we thought it would come to.” Sufficient circumstantial evidence was presented to the jury from which they could reasonably conclude that Appellant and his <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>co-conspirators knowingly denied Stanley necessary medical treatment, and instead forced him to ingest a lethal amount of vodka, purposely and intentionally causing his death. We find the evidence was sufficient to establish that Appellant killed James Stanley, and that the killing which occurred by deliberate, willful, premeditation, was murder in the first degree.</p>

Sufficient evidence to support the application of the aggravating circumstance of creating a grave risk of harm to persons other than the murder victim, has been found by this Court in those instances where the other persons are “in close proximity” to the decedent “at the time” of the murder, and due to that proximity are in jeopardy of suffering real harm.

The fact that Gaffield actually was injured prior to the death of Stanley under these circumstances is irrelevant.
