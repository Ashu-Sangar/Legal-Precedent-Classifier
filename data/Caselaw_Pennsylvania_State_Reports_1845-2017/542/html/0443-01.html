The children are Royce Edward Rowles, born March 17, 1988, and Kaitlyn Louise Rowles, born May 2,1990, of Michelle A. Rowles, appellant, and David E. Rowles. In December, 1989, the parents, David and Michelle, together with their only child, Royce, moved into the home of David’s <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>parents, Blair and Julia Rowles, and sister, Donna Jean Rowles, appellees. In July, 1990, two months after Kaitlyn was born, in order to resolve marital problems without affecting the children adversely, the parents moved out of the grandparents’ home, leaving the children in the physical custody of the grandparents.</p>

The record confirms that the mother had <em>daily </em>contact with the children during the period they were in the custody of the grandparents. The mother routinely spent several hours in the grandparents’ home with her children after work until bedtime, and her children visited her home for overnight visits on alternating weekends. It is readily apparent that the mother was very much a part of the stable environment the children enjoyed while residing with the grandparents. To transfer custody to the mother would change little more than the children’s sleeping arrangements, for the mother has been a daily part of the children’s lives; moreover, the record <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>reflects the grandparents’ agreement that, if the mother were awarded custody, they would continue to care for the children on a daily basis between the hours of school and the mother’s return home from work.</p>

The courts exaggerated the length of time the grandparents had custody<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and totally ignored the mother’s participation in that stable environment. This factor cannot be viewed as one which strongly indicates grandparental custody over parental custody. On the other hand, the courts appear to have given no weight at all to the parental relationship asserted by the mother. There is absolutely nothing in the record which casts doubt on the expectation that she bears normal human solicitude, care, devotion, and love for her offspring nor any fact which would justify denying the “special weight” and “deference” that are normally to be accorded the parent-child relationship. We cannot avoid the conclusion, on the record of this case, that the parental relationship is by far the most weighty factor in the custody determination, and that the countervailing consideration of the stable home provided by the grandparents is comparatively insignificant as the mother was a constant part of that stable environment. It is therefore necessary to reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand the case for the trial court to grant custody to the mother and to order visitation and other appropriate relief consistent with this opinion.</p>

Indeed, the majority opinion recognized as much, stating: "Experience has taught the unhappy lesson that the parental relationship is not an infallible guarantee that the parent will provide the care and concern essential to a child’s proper development.” <em>Ellerbe, </em><a href="/pa/490/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="490 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1763810" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0363-01">490 Pa. at 368</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="490 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1763810" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0363-01">416 A.2d at 514</a>.</p>

The subject in <em>Ellerbe </em>had resided with her grandmother for nine of her eleven years. Likewise, in <em>Albright, </em>the children had lived with their mother or grandparents for ten years; when the mother died, the court awarded custody to the grandparents rather than the father. In <em>Snarski, </em>grandparents merited custody after the child had lived with them for six and one-half of his eight years and the father proved himself to be an ineffectual parent in several respects. By contrast, the children in this case were in the custody of the grandparents from July, 1990 until November, 1992, when the mother filed her petition for custody. This two-and-a-half-year period is a far less significant period than that of <em>Ellerbe, Albright, </em>or <em>Snarski.</em>

My position is based on the view that the presumption is grounded not in a possessory or proprietary interest, but rather is an outgrowth of parents’ responsibility for their children. This is the direction of the Majority in <em>Ellerbe v. Hooks, </em><a href="/pa/490/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="490 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1763810" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0363-01">490 Pa. 363</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="490 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1763810" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0363-01">416 A.2d 512</a> (1980). Even with the presumption, if the facts of a particular matter clearly demonstrate that parents are failing to perform their responsibilities, or are doing so inadequately, the best interests of the child dictate placement with a third party. Thus the presumption does not “becloud the ultimate concern,” as the Majority here charges, since the problem only arises where the outcome is already in doubt, i.e., where it is not immediately apparent where the best interests of the child lie.</p>
    <p id="b766-7" data-blocks='[["BL_766.7",766,[287,1585,1152,490]]]'>Moreover, there is no particular advantage in dispensing with “presumption,” a term readily understood by the bench and bar given its underpinnings, in order to replace it with a “significant factor,” which does not recognize the source and importance of the parental interest. This diminution of emphasis could well prove extremely problematical where a third party seeks custody from otherwise adequate parents based on a belief that, e.g., the children are being provided with “wrong” or inadequate religious instruction.</p>
