Rather, appellant claims he only had the intent to injure him, but that death occurred as a result nonetheless. As in all cases in which the death penalty has been imposed, this Court is required to independently undertake a review of the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth v.

When Ms. Carr told her fiance, the victim John McDonald, about the incident, McDonald became upset and went in search of Rocky or Billy. The victim found Rocky on a neighbor’s porch and began to argue with him about the porch touching incident. Lamont “Wayne” Bruce, one of appellant’s co-defendants who was at the neighbor’s house, told the victim and Rocky to leave his aunt’s house because it was “disrespectful.” The victim’s uncle, seeing the argument at the neighbor’s house, walked over to the neighbor’s house, pulled the victim away, and walked with him a bit to calm him down.</p>

After the police departed, appellant and Robert Holmes returned to the victim’s uncle’s porch where Ms. Carr was standing, and one of the men — the witness did not know which one — said that “he didn’t give a fuck about his bitch, and the man was going to die tonight,” (N.T. 5/27/92, a.m. at 59).

Here, the aggravating circumstances found by the jury were that in the commission of the offense, appellant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7); and appellant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9).

Mr. Padova, counsel for Robert Holmes, also specifically stated that he wanted the issue left alone at that point. Mr. Mandell, appellant’s attorney, did not respond to the court's offer at all. The trial court stated to counsel at sidebar that it was willing to tell the jury that the statement concerning the bribe was “hearsay and therefore they should totally disregard it.” (N.T. 5/28/92 at 59-60).
