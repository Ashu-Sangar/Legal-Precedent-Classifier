In April of 1989, Sun Pipe Line again entered the woodlands without permission and expanded the width of the easement in excess of 40 feet. Appellants contend that they were unaware of the existence of the underground pipeline at the time they purchased the premises and remained so until Sun Pipe Line entered the premises in 1987.

Following pleadings, appellants filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that they were sole owners of the premises and that Sun Pipe Line was statutorily barred from asserting any right or interest in the premises pursuant to the unenclosed woodland statute, 68 P.S. § 411.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Sun Pipe Line filed a cross-motion for summary judgment alleging that: (1) at the time the easement was entered, the grantor intended the easement to be perpetual, (2) an easement had been created by implication, or (3) a prescriptive easement had arisen over appellants’ property.

The Superior Court also found that the trial court correctly determined that an easement had not arisen by implication. However, the Superi- or Court determined that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether a prescriptive easement had arisen over the premises. Specifically, the Superior Court found that a genuine issue existed as to whether Sun Pipe Line’s use became hostile to all subsequent owners of the premises. Thus, the Superior Court vacated the trial court’s order granting appellants’ motion for summary judgment and remanded the matter for trial on the merits.

In the instant matter, appellants established through their affidavit, the affidavit of their surveyor, Gerald Fisher, and through aerial photographs taken in 1959 and 1987, that the premises were in fact heavily forested, that appellants intended to preserve the natural setting of the premises, and that the premises were not enclosed by a fence or any other artificial barrier. Moreover, the trial court held that Sun Pipe Line failed to produce competent evidence demonstrating that the premises were not unenclosed. Accordingly, because the acquisition of a pres<a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>criptive easement through unenclosed woodland is strictly prohibited by 68 P.S. § 411, the trial court correctly determined that all genuine issues of material fact in this matter were resolved. Therefore, the order of the trial court declaring that appellants are the sole owners of the premises and that Sun Pipe Line has no right to or interest in the premises is hereby reinstated.</p>

The first is a twenty-eight acre parcel which now includes appellants' residence. The second, which is catercorner to the first, is a five acre parcel of land. The underground pipeline traverses this second parcel of land. Although both parcels are heavily forested, the second is more densely forested than the first.</p>

Specifically, Sun Pipe Line asserts that the unenclosed woodland statute was inappropriately raised by appellants as New Matter which was appended to their Reply to Sun Pipe Line’s New Matter. Sun Pipe Line, however, failed to raise an objection to this alleged defect either by preliminary objection, answer or reply; thus, the objection was waived. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. 1032(a) (a party waives all objections to pleadings which are not presented either by preliminary objection, answer or reply).</p>

It is equally apparent that the circumstances of the 1930 easement did not transform the permissive easement into an easement by implication since an implied easement may arise only where the terms of the grant and the surrounding circumstances show that the intent of the parties was to create an easement by implication. <em>Nord v.

In this regard, Sun Pipe Line contends that during the prescriptive period it conducted various tests to evaluate the strength and integrity <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>of the pipeline. Sun Pipe Line also asserts that in compliance with federal regulations, it conducted regular inspections of the pipeline in order to check for leaks, line exposures, obstructions, etc. These inspections were primarily carried out by aerial surveillance although in some instances Sun Pipe Line contends that it utilized "line-walkers”, who actually walk along the length of the pipeline in order to inspect the surface conditions. However, as discussed <em>supra </em>at n. 3, Sun Pipe Line's affidavit fails to demonstrate that these specific measures were carried out along the easement in question. Moreover, regardless of the lack of specificity in the affidavit, as discussed, 68 P.S. § 411, precludes prescriptive easements over unenclosed woodland.</p>
