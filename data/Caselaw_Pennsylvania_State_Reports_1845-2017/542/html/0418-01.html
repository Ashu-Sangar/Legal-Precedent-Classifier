Under the majority approach, the magistrate no longer serves the critical function of reviewing the affidavit to ascertain with a neutral and independent eye, whether a reasonable basis has been established for relying upon the informant’s information regarding the existence of evidence of criminality in the location to be searched. Not only does the majority position relieve the affiant of any obligation to corroborate the information, the affiant is further relieved of the duty to ascertain that the evidence is at the location to be searched at the time the warrant is to be executed. The magistrate now serves no other purpose than to rubber stamp the affidavit of probable cause whenever the affiant swears to the past reliability of the informant.</p>
