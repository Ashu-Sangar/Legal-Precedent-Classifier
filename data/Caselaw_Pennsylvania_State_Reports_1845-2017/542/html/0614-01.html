Ruth Bass, the personnel manager’s assistant, administered the floater program. Floaters did not have a centralized office of their own. Instead, a floater would report to the department of Alcoa where assistance was needed. The work space for a floater could be either an office or a bullpen area with more than one individual sharing the space. A floater had use of a desk, and exclusive use of a telephone depended on the number of people in the work area.</p>

Wilson became hysterical and her husband was contacted. After her husband arrived, Wilson left with a description of the available job.

In her deposition testimony of December 4, 1990, Dr. Greenwald indicated that Wilson had made very slow progress during the three-year period of treatment and was moderately depressed. Dr. Greenwald concluded that work was the source of her self-esteem and that Wilson’s problems began in 1985 with the loss of her position when her boss was transferred to Mexico. Wilson experienced a loss of responsibilities and social contacts as a result.</p>

Wilson has identified actual employment events that occurred after her administrative assistant position was eliminated due to the transfer of her boss, but has failed to establish that the events were abnormal working conditions. An abnormal working condition is not established by evidence that a displaced employee was unable to obtain an identical job with his same employer. We reject the interpretation of <em>Martin </em>suggested by Wilson that would allow any change in the status quo of an employment situation to be compensable simply because a claimant established that the change was actual, rather than imagined or perceived, and resulted in psychic injury.</p>

Martin was employed as a professional fundraiser for nonprofit organizations and was assigned to handle a campaign for the University of Michigan. He experienced problems with the campaign due in part to conflicts with the University’s Vice President of Development and became dissatisfied with his staff, office, and campaign progress. Martin was subsequently reassigned to a different campaign that was less prestigious. Although his employer’s perception of Martin as a successful fund-raiser did not change, Martin’s self-esteem faltered. He later committed suicide.</p>
