      <em>Loud Hawk </em>involved facts very similar to those in the instant matter in that neither Loud Hawk nor appellant had been tried on the charges leveled against them and both Loud Hawk and appellant invoked the appellate process to obtain a more advantageous trial posture. When a criminal defendant petitions for appellate review in this Court, he necessarily risks a relatively slower, more deliberative process than that available with either the trial courts or intermediate appellate courts of this Commonwealth. The Superior Court’s review for errors in the trial court’s pretrial rulings and guilt determination almost inevitably implicate a quicker analysis aided by principles of <em>stare decisis </em>and well-settled legal pronouncements by this and other courts. By contrast, this Court engages in a more comprehensive legal and constitutional review of the issues raised by a particular case. Further, given that this Court’s opinions have a state-wide and precedentially binding impact on all other courts situated in this Commonwealth, this Court’s determinations affect more than just the litigants named in a particular case, thereby necessarily requiring a deliberative consideration of the issues, not constrained by significant temporal restrictions. Accordingly, when a criminal defendant petitions for review with this Court, he concurrently divests the trial court of its jurisdiction and, consequently, divests the trial court of the power to proceed with a trial while the deliberative appellate process takes its course. <em>Jones, supra, </em><a href="/pa/495/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="495 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1770719" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0490-01">495 Pa. at 497-498</a>, <a href="/pa/495/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="495 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1770719" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0490-01">434 A.2d at 1200-1201</a>.</p>

In his petition, appellant relied on the Superior Court’s opinion in <em>Schaeffer I </em>as the basis for asking this Court to reverse the Superior Court order in his case. When appellant filed his petition with this Court on April 26, 1989, this Court had already granted allocatur in <em>Schaeffer I </em>on December 2,1988. <a href="/citations/?q=520%20Pa.%20596" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="520 Pa. 596">520 Pa. 596</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=552%20A.2d%20251" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="552 A.2d 251">552 A.2d 251</a> (1988).

Accordingly, appellant cannot reasonably claim a “wholly unjustifiable delay” by this Court’s deliberation over his petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

Serendipitously, appellant’s speedy trial motion, Judge Salus’ relief grant thereof, and the instant appeal, even though causing another delay in his trial of approximately two years and four months, have worked to appellant’s favor in that this Court’s resolution of <em>Brion </em>would appear to favor appellant’s defense against the charges.
