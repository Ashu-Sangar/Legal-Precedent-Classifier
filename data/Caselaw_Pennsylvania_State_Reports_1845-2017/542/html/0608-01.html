The zoning permits single-family detached dwellings on lots with a minimum size of 2 acres.

The Board upheld the ordinance, finding that mobile home parks are permitted in the LI-limited industrial and LLI-light limited industrial districts of the township.

Uses are not limited to ones of an industrial character. Various agricultural, commercial, and residential applications are expressly allowed. In addition, section 801(A) permits <em>“[a]ny </em>individual use not specifically excluded, which meets the provisions of Section[s] 801 to 813....” (Emphasis added). Nowhere in the ordinance are mobile home parks “specifically excluded” from the township as a whole or from LI-limited industrial districts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Sections 801 to 813 limit smoke emissions, odors, noise, bright lights, water pollution, etc. An examination of these sections reveals nothing that would expressly, or by effect, bar mobile home park development. In the hearings before the Board, the township presented expert testimony that mobile home parks would be able to comply with the requirements of sections 801 to 813, and, further, that they would have no difficulty meeting lot size and setback require<a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>ments in LI-limited industrial districts. In short, in view of section 801(A)’s authorization of “any” use that complies with sections 801 to 813, the Board had ample basis for concluding that mobile home parks are permitted.</p>
    <p id="b926-4" data-blocks='[["BL_926.4",926,[297,565,1153,677]]]'>The Board also cited section 2305, which governs LLI-light limited industrial districts. That section permits as conditional uses requiring Board approval <em>u[a]ny </em>uses not specifically permitted by Section 2302 or specifically prohibited by Sections 2304 and 2307(A)____” (Emphasis added). Sections 2302, 2304, and 2307(A) enumerate a variety of permitted and prohibited uses. Permitted uses are not limited to ones of a light industrial character. A number of residential and commercial applications are expressly allowed. However, no reference is made to mobile home parks. Because mobile home parks are neither specifically permitted nor specifically prohibited by the relevant sections, they qualify as conditional uses under section 2305.</p>

The plain meaning of sections 801(A) and 2305 is that mobile home parks are permitted in both LI-limited industrial and LLI-light limited industrial districts. This alone is sufficient to support the Board’s conclusion that the parks are not excluded from the township. Given the additional principles of construction favoring a constitutional, i.e., non-exclusionary, interpretation, and favoring the broadest possible use of land, it is clear that the Board committed no abuse of discretion or error of law in interpreting the ordinance to allow mobile home park development. The Commonwealth Court’s decision must, therefore, be reversed.</p>

We granted allocatur to review the Commonwealth Court's determination that the ordinance completely excludes mobile home park development. Commonwealth Court did not address the question of whether, absent a de jure exclusion of such development, there is a de facto exclusion. It is argued that Collins waived this issue by failing to present it during oral argument before the Commonwealth Court. Any possibility of waiver notwithstanding, we note that the claim of de facto exclusion was fully considered, and rejected, by both the Board and the court of common pleas. That no such exclusion occurred is a finding amply supported by the record.</p>
