There are three different types of defective conditions that can give rise to a strict liability claim: design defect, manufacturing defect, and failure-to-warn defect. <em>Walton v. Avco Corp., </em><a href="/pa/530/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="530 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1833060" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0568-01">530 Pa. 568</a>, 576, <a href="/pa/530/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="530 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1833060" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0568-01">610 A.2d 454</a>, 458 (1992).

To establish that the product was defective, the plaintiff must show that a warning of a particular danger was either inadequate or altogether lacking, and that this deficiency in warning made the product “unreasonably dangerous.” For the plaintiff in a failure-to-warn claim to establish the second element, causation, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the user of the product would have avoided the risk had he or she been warned of it by the seller. <em>See Sherk v.

Appellee introduced rebuttal evidence that Employer-U.S. Steel provided dust masks to its workers and also had an extensive employee training program to educate its workers about the dangers of silica sand. <em>See, e.g., </em>879, 1017-1019. Also, Appellee introduced into evidence that Appellant-Husband had stated during a deposition that he knew exposure to silica sand was harmful. <em>See, e.g., </em>R.R. at 487-488. The jury found Appellee’s version to be the more credible; it specifically determined that Appellant-Husband knew that he could contract silicosis by exposing'himself to respirable silica dust, and voluntarily proceeded to expose himself to the product. <em>Special Verdict Form RE: Floyd Phillips, </em>R.R. at p. 1666.

      <p id="b447-7" data-blocks='[["BL_447.7",447,[244,1478,1115,312]]]'>The Superior Court determined that Appellee's product was not in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the consumer. The court trained its analysis on the hazards and efficacy of silica sand <em>in general. </em>This was not the proper focus of the court's analysis. In a failure-to-warn claim, the allegation is not that the product in general is defective, but rather is that the product was defective because it lacked a warning to make it safe. Thus, the analysis here should have been on whether Appellee's product was defective <em>absent a warning.</em>

We need not and do not here determine whether Appellee's product was indeed defective absent a warning; rather, our decision is based upon the determination that entry of a j.n.o.v. in Appellee's favor was appropriate because Appellant had failed, as a matter of law, to establish causation.</p>
