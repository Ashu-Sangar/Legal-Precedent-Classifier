      <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>The decedent, William Cochran, worked at Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel from 1943 to 1944 and from 1949 to 1982 as a boilerhouse attendant, steelworker and bricklayer. On June 3, 1981, Mr. Cochran was admitted to the hospital for back pain. During this hospitalization, a right upper lobe resection was performed, resulting in a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. At that time, the decedent had been smoking one-and-a-half packs of cigarettes daily since 1947. In response to the diagnosis of cancer, Mr. Cochran stopped smoking. There was no discussion at this time that the lung cancer was caused by work-related asbestos exposure.</p>
    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[251,904,1153,350]]]'>On March 3, 1985, Mr. Cochran was again admitted to the hospital after several chest x-rays revealed the presence of a mass in the lower lobe of his left lung. A bronchoscopy and wedge resurrection were performed, and pathology reports confirmed the presence of a malignancy. The 1985 admission records make the first reference to Mr. Cochran’s exposure to asbestos.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[247,1287,1156,404]]]'>Following this hospitalization, Mr. Cochran contacted an attorney who arranged for Dr. Howard E. Reidbord to review the tissue slides from both the 1981 and 1985 admissions. An August 7, 1985 report by Dr. Reidbord opined that both pulmonary carcinomas were related to asbestos exposure. This report revealed that slides prepared at the time of the 1981 resection contained asbestos bodies in the pathology material.</p>

The complaint alleged that Mr. Cochran was totally disabled from carcinoma of the lung and asbestosis as a result of his exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured by the various defendants during the course of his employment. In December of 1985, Mr. Cochran died. The Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment contending that the decedent knew or should have known his lung cancer was asbestos related in June of 1981, more than two years prior to initiating his suit. Appellant maintained that the decedent never knew, or had reason to know that his lung cancer was asbestos related until the receipt of Dr. <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>Reidbord’s report on August 7, 1985, and, therefore, the suit was filed well within the two year limitations period. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, a panel of the Superior Court reversed the trial court, and an <em>en banc </em>panel of the Superior Court reinstated the order of the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b529-4" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[216,661,1147,852]]]'>Appellant asserts that the <em>en banc </em>panel of the Superi- or Court incorrectly concluded that the Appellees were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Instead, she argues that the issue of whether the decedent should have known he had an asbestos related cancer in 1981 was an issue for the jury. Our standard of review in this matter is well established. A trial court’s order granting summary judgment will not be reversed unless it is established that the court committed an error of law or clearly abused its discretion. <em>Holmes v.

Here, the decedent was first diagnosed with lung cancer in 1981. The record indicates that there was ample evidence to support a diagnosis of asbestos-related lung cancer at that time. However, Mr. Cochran did not seek additional legal or medical help to ascertain the precise cause of his cancer until March of 1985.

These accusations warrant a brief response. First, we are charged with having overlooked medical history information contained in the decedent’s medical records. The Dissent asserts that these medical records create material facts that make summary judgment inappropriate in this case. However, we believe that the Dissent is torturing routine medical history information in an attempt to create an issue of material fact. The medical history quoted by the Dissent merely reveals that Mr. Cochran’s doctors noted that he was a smoker, and recommended that he stop smoking. This information is in the nature of routine medical history taken from any patient. <em>See, e.g., </em>Reproduced Record at 203 (“patient is a heavy smoker” under “Indications”); R.R. at 206 (“The patient smoked sixty packs a year, and quit last week.” under “Social History”); R.R. at 233 (“history of heavy cigarette abuse” under “Past Medical History”); R.R. at 252 (“He is a heavy smoker, no significant alcohol history”); R.R. at 261 (“He smokes 1 to 2 packs of cigarettes per day and is known to drink from 1 to 2 fifths of ethanol per week” under “Social History”). Nowhere in the record is the decedents’s smoking causally related to his lung cancer. Quite simply, these routine medical entries do not constitute a diagnosis that the decedent’s smoking caused his cancer in 1981. Thus, we cannot agree with the Dissent that “it is apparent that the appellant and his physician concluded in 1981 that the lung cancer was caused by smoking.” Dissent at 222. Accordingly, while the Dissent argues that we are acting as fact-finder, it would appear that the Dissent is actually combing the <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>record in a somewhat frantic attempt to manufacture a genuine issue of material fact where none exists.</p>
    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[245,445,1160,1281]]]'>Second, the Dissent accuses us of creating a heightened standard for establishing due diligence. Apparently, the Dissent would be in favor of a “no diligence” rule allowing anyone with a good faith, even if mistaken, belief to claim the discovery rule exception. Despite the apparent benevolence of such an approach, it is not supported by our case-law. Our cases firmly establish that the “reasonable diligence” standard has some teeth. A person claiming the discovery rule exception has the burden of establishing that he pursued the cause of his injury with “those qualities of attention, knowledge, intelligence and judgment which society requires of its members for the protection of their own interests and the interests of others.” <em>Burnside v.

Clearly, in this case there are material facts at issue as to when this decedent “reasonably should have known” that he was injured so as to give rise to a claim in tort. Admittedly, the standard for resolving what is or is not reasonable diligence is an objective, not subjective one. It was best stated by the Superior Court in <em>Petri v. Smith, </em><a href="/pa-super/307/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="307 Pa.

It is not a subjective standard. It is a community standard. It is sufficiently flexible, however, to take into account differences between persons, their capacity to meet certain situations and the circumstances confronting them at the time in question. In short, the standard of conduct required is a uniform one which takes ‘into account the fallibility of human beings.’ <em>Restatement, Tort 2d, § 288, comment b. and c.

But I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that in this case, on these facts, reasonable minds could not differ. In fact, in this case, the panel of the Superior Court which first reviewed the matter reversed the order of the trial court, with one judge dissenting; when the case was reviewed by the Superior Court en banc, six judges agreed to reinstate summary judgment, while three judges dissented. The very history of this case strongly indicates that there are material facts in dispute such that reasonable minds <em>could </em>differ on the question of whether this decedent reasonably should have known the cause of his injury.</p>

Here, it is apparent that the decedent and his physician concluded in 1981 that the lung cancer was caused by smoking. In 1981, the cancer was properly diagnosed, but apparently its cause was not ascertained. What change in the law would now require the layman patient to go beyond what appeared on its face to be a reasonable diagnosis as to illness and cause, and demand that the slide be sent to another physician for a second opinion as to causation?</p>

Although the decedent knew he had suffered an “injury” when he was diagnosed with lung cancer in June of 1981 he was unaware that the cancer was a “legal injury.” The Restatement Second of Torts defines an injury which would give rise to a cause of action as "the invasion of a legally protected interest which, if it is the legal result of a tortious act, entitles one so injured to maintain an action in tort.” <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § </em>7, <em>comment b.</em>
