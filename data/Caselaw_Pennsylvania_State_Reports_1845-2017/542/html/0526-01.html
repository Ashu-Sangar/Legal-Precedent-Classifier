Thus we are not compelled to accept appellants’ legal analysis, only their recitation of the facts.

Thus, an alternative, and solvent, payor was sought. All other considerations were subordinated to this objective, hence the unequivocal necessity, in appellants’ view, for appellees to be designated as sellers irrespective of the actual facts of this matter. However, to ignore the ancillary nature of the association of product with activity is to posit surgery, or indeed any medical service requiring the use of a physical object, as a marketing device for the incorporated object. This is tantamount to deciding that the surgical skills necessary for the implantation of, e.g., mandibular prostheses, are an adjunct to the sale of the implants. Moreover, under such a theory, no product of which a patient in any medical setting is the ultimate consumer, from CT scanners to cotton balls, could escape the assignment of strict liability. Clearly, the relationship of hospital and/or doctor to patients is not dictated by the distribution of such products, even if there is some surcharge on the price of the product.

An example supporting this proposition appears in comment f of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 402A and concerns the owner of a motion picture theater who offers edibles such as popcorn and candy for sale to movie patrons. The analogue to the instant case is valid in one respect only: both the candy and the TMJ implant are ancillary to the primary activity, viewing a film or undergoing surgery respectively. However, beyond that any comparison is specious. A movie audience is free to purchase or not any food items on offer, and regardless of which option is exercised the primary activity is unaffected.

The Superior Court, in addressing this element in conjunction with redress for potential plaintiffs, notes that the only considerations for extending strict liability, ability to pay plaintiffs and ability to charge others, would result in absolute rather than strict liability, <em>Coyle, </em>and further observed that relying on cost factors alone without a logical basis would confine the focus of the 402A principle to the search for a deep pocket. The net effect of this cost spreading would further endanger the already beleaguered health care system. As a practical matter costs would merely be absorbed by the insurers of physicians and hospitals, whose charges would reflect the increase in policy rates without corresponding improvement to any aspect of the health care system.

The first example of the majority’s misapplication of <em>Francioni </em>is with its analysis of the first prong of that test. The first prong of <em>Francioni </em>requires this Court to examine whether the defendant is in the marketing chain of <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>the product. <em>Francioni, </em><a href="/pa/472/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="472 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1727770" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0362-01">472 Pa. at 362</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="472 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1727770" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0362-01">372 A.2d at 739</a>. The majority, ostensibly applying this test, concludes that the defendants are not amenable to strict liability because “medical personnel and hospitals are already subject to liability, albeit only where the quality or quantity of the services they provide may be called into question.” Maj. op. at p. 535. This answer is a non-sequitur; the majority has sidestepped, rather than answered, the pertinent query of whether doctors and hospitals are in the marketing chain of this prosthesis. Furthermore, the majority’s new version of the first <em>Francioni </em>prong is no improvement on the old test. This new test will not advance our analysis as to whether a certain defendant is amenable to strict liability, but instead will thwart it. The majority’s test will exclude from strict liability those defendants which may be amenable to causes of action other than strict liability; it seems not to matter to the majority whether the plaintiff in the case before the court actually has that “other” cause of action available to it. I find this “test” perplexing for I can think of no entity which would not be excluded under the test fashioned by the majority. Thus, what purpose would this new “test” serve other than to eradicate strict liability?</p>

The majority commences its analysis of this point by recognizing that the focus of this inquiry is on whether there is “some ongoing relationship with the manufacturer from which some financial advantage inures to the benefit of the latter and which confers some degree of influence on the [putative seller].” <em>Musser v. Vilsmeier Auction Company, </em><a href="/pa/522/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="522 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1818990" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0367-01">522 Pa. 367</a>, 374, <a href="/pa/522/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="522 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1818990" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0367-01">562 A.2d 279</a>, 282 (1989). The majority, however, rapidly loses sight of its objective. It deduces that since the defendants here have an extensive list of products at their disposal, as did the defendant in <em>Musser, </em>then the defendants here should also be held immune from strict liability as was the defendant in <em>Musser. </em>This distortion of <em>Musser </em>could have frighteningly far-reaching implications. <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>Such reasoning would lead to the absurd result that a department store, with an inventory of tens of thousands of items, would be less likely to be held strictly liable than the local, family-run convenience store with its modest inventory. Such a “test” does not advance the goals of strict liability, but rather perverts them.</p>

In an effort to reach its result in the area of medical services, the majority has failed to advance with caution. I agree with the majority that this area deserves “more examination than has yet been afforded this issue.” Maj. op. at 538. Unfortunately, such an examination has not been presented and I am, therefore, compelled to dissent.</p>

The <em>Francioni </em>test requires the Court first to examine whether holding a particular entity strictly liable makes a member of the marketing chain available to the injured party for redress. Second, we look to whether applying strict liability would provide an incentive to safety. Third, we ascertain whether the defendant is in a better position than the consumer to prevent the circulation of defective products. Finally, we inquire as to whether the defendant can distribute the cost of compensating for injuries resulting from the defective product by charging for it in his business. <em>Francioni, </em><a href="/pa/472/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="472 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1727770" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0362-01">472 Pa. at 368-369</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="472 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1727770" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0362-01">372 A.2d at 739</a>; <em>see also Coyle, <a href="/pa/526/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="526 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="1825925" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0208-01">526 </a></em><a href="/pa/526/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="526 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="1825925" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0208-01">Pa. at 216-217</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="526 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="1825925" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0208-01">584 A.2d at 1387</a>. After applying these four factors to the defendant at bar, the Court then is able to determine whether the defendant is a “seller/supplier” as a matter of law.</p>
