Upon arriving at Harris’ home, Harris and the victim’s son began to argue. Hooper interceded, <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>urging his son and appellant to calm down and suggesting to appellant that if appellant attempted to provide for the boy, perhaps the boy would show appellant more respect. Appellant did not verbally respond to this rebuke but instead turned and went up the stairs of his house. Appellant’s wife started up the stairs after appellant to check on him only to be met by the barrel of appellant’s shotgun in her face and to hear appellant threatening to blow “her brains out.” At this point a shot was fired, striking Hooper in the chest.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[278,837,1160,1250]]]'>Appellant’s testimony, not surprisingly, reveals a different version of what took place. Appellant testified that he only went upstairs to retrieve his shotgun in an effort to defend himself because he observed the butt of a gun tucked into the victim’s trousers and that the victim had threatened to shoot him. Appellant claimed that his shotgun went off accidentally when his wife and the victim attempted to wrestle the shotgun from his possession. In contrast, the victim testified that he became alarmed because appellant had the shotgun pointed at his former wife’s face threatening to shoot her. The victim approached appellant in an attempt to discourage appellant from shooting his former wife when appellant suddenly turned the shotgun on the victim. The victim testified that he then raised his left hand to deflect the barrel of the shotgun, when he felt the sting of the weapons’ discharge. The victim further testified that he did not have a weapon, that he did nothing to anger appellant, and that appellant without apparent provocation shot him. As a result of the shooting, the victim spent twenty-seven days in the hospital, underwent eighteen hours of surgery to remove the shotgun pellets and has sustained permanent damage to nerve endings in his right arm. The police did not recover any weapon which the appellant asserted that he had observed in the victim’s waistband at the scene of the shooting.</p>

Thereafter, appellant went back upstairs, grabbed ammunition, loaded it into his shotgun, readied the weapon to fire and went back downstairs to confront the victim. Appellant himself admits that he cocked the shotgun even though the victim had neither moved from his spot nor displayed a firearm. This evidence clearly demonstrates that appellant was not in fear of imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. Moreover, appellant testified that his life was not in jeopardy. As this evidence clearly negates self-defense, the trial court, therefore, properly refused to give a self-defense charge. <em>See e.g. Commonwealth v.

Appellant also claims that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because his five year mandatory sentence for aggravated assault is “unconstitutionally disproportionate.’’ In support of this claim, appellant contends that aggravated assault is a lesser included offense of attempted murder and therefore aggravated assault merges with attempted murder. However, appellant fails to recognize that he was never charged with, convicted of or sentenced for attempted murder, the offense with which he claims his aggravated assault conviction should merge. Therefore, this claim is spurious and warrants no further review by this Court.</p>
