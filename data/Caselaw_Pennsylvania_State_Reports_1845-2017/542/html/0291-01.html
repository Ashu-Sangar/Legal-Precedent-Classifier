She ultimately confessed to the murder of Nairobi Dupont and signed a written statement to that effect. Shortly thereafter, Hill was again advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights and questioned about the murder of Nghia Quy Lu.

In support of this contention, Hill cites six separate instances where the prosecutor cross-examined her and presented rebuttal evidence concerning: the fact that she was on welfare; her cocaine use during pregnancy; her prior sentences of imprisonment; her probation violation; the fact that “wanted cards” had been issued for her; and her use of profanity during questioning by police. Our review of these allegations is guided by the fact that a defendant is not entitled to relief for a claim of prosecutorial misconduct unless the “unavoidable effect” of the prosecutor’s comments or <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>actions “is to ‘prejudice’ the jury so that a true verdict cannot be rendered because the existence of bias and hostility makes it impossible to weigh the evidence in a neutral manner.” <em>Commonwealth v.

On direct examination by her attorney, Hill indicated that the only form of photographic identification that she possessed was a card issued by the Department of Public Assistance. (N.T. 3/31/92, 66-67). This information was elicited by defense counsel in order to provide an explanation as to why a purse containing that particular identification card was found at the scene of Nairobi Dupont’s murder. Hill testified that she had given the card to her sister so that she could pick up Hill’s welfare check. (N.T. 3/31/92, 66-67). This testimony was offered to explain why the identification card was no longer in Hill’s possession and consequently could not have been left by her at the murder scene. Clearly then, it was permissible for the prosecutor to inquire further into the subject matter raised on direct examination, and Hill’s claim that this information was elicited for purposes of inflaming the jury’s passion is totally unfounded. <em>See e.g. Commonwealth v. Schmidt, </em><a href="/pa/437/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="437 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="1927763" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0563-01">437 Pa. 563</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20382" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="263 A.2d 382">263 A.2d 382</a> (1970) (the scope and limits of cross-examination are largely within the discretion of the trial court and its decisions pertaining thereto will not be reversed in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion or error of law).</p>

She claims that this information had no probative value and was elicited solely to assail her character in front of the jury. We disagree and find that such information was relevant in light of her claim that she was coerced by police to confess. Hill contended at trial that she signed a written confession admitting to the two murders because police threatened to take her children away if she refused. It was therefore entirely proper for the prosecutor to call into question Hill’s concern for the welfare of her children given her assertion that she falsely confessed to murder out of fear that her children would be taken away.</p>

Thus, she can not now be heard to complain that the prosecutor never offered a good faith basis for this inquiry. <em>See e.g. Commonwealth v. Clair, </em><a href="/pa/458/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="458 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="479736" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0418-01">458 Pa. 418</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20272" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="326 A.2d 272">326 A.2d 272</a> (1974) (issue was waived because the trial judge was not given an opportunity to rectify the errors at the time that they occurred). Although this Court does not rigidly adhere to the rules of waiver in death penalty cases,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> we nevertheless conclude that Hill is not entitled to relief. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the prosecutor did not have a good faith basis to question Hill concerning the abandonment of her children, the overwhelming evidence of guilt presented at trial renders harmless any negative inference that may have resulted from the prosecutor’s brief questioning on this point.</p>
    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.4",618,[223,1199,1153,472]]]'>Hill next contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by cross-examining her concerning prison sentences that she received for two robbery convictions.

(N.T. 4/1/92, 9). A sidebar discussion followed whereby defense counsel and the prosecutor argued in support of their respective positions concerning the admissibility of this information. The trial judge indicated that he did not recall whether Hill had volunteered that she was on probation or whether it was given as a response to a question. (N.T. 4/1/92, 15). He then concluded <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>that if Hill had responded that she was put on probation, the prosecutor had a right to inquire about it. (N.T. 4/1/92, 15). Consequently, the prosecutor briefly pursued the matter and it was revealed that Hill had been sentenced to eight to twenty-three months in prison followed by two years probation for one second degree robbery conviction and five to twelve months followed by two years probation for a third degree robbery conviction.</p>
    <p id="b619-5" data-blocks='[["BL_619.4",619,[197,772,1153,958]]]'>The fact that Hill was on probation was first brought to the jury’s attention when Hill stated that she stopped to see her probation officer prior to going to the homicide division of the Philadelphia Police Department. (N.T. 3/31/92, 47). Then, in a series of leading questions, defense counsel elicited from Hill that she was on probation, specifically ISP house arrest, as a result of guilty pleas that she had entered concerning two charges of robbery. “[T]he admissibility of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and an appellate court may only reverse rulings on admissibility upon a showing that the lower court abused its discretion.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Although we do not find persuasive the Commonwealth’s argument that Hill intended to deceive the jury as to the severity of her robbery convictions, we nevertheless are unable to conclude that the trial judge abused his discretion in allowing the prosecutor to question Hill concerning a subject that she first raised on direct examination.</p>

In connection with her complaint that the trial court’s penalty phase jury instructions were deficient, Hill makes several other claims which require little discussion. Hill cites the following excerpt from the prosecutor's opening comments during the penalty phase as grounds for a new sentencing hearing: "As <em>the Judge has just stated, </em>the aggravating circumstances which <em>we </em>are proceeding [sic] are....” (N.T. 4/7/92, 107) (emphasis added). She argues that this statement implied to the jury that the judge was in agreement with the Commonwealth that the aggravating circumstances enumerated by the prosecutor had been established.</p>
      <p id="b626-8" data-blocks='[["BL_626.7",626,[275,1795,1124,388]]]'>Hill cites another example of alleged prejudice during the penalty phase where the jury requested further guidance from the trial court when it had reached an impasse in its deliberations. The court responded, "I’m not trying to pressure you, believe me. This is a dreadfully important and serious decision that you have to make.” (N.T. 4/7/92, 62). Hill claims that this response in conjunction with the court’s earlier statement, "I want to advise you [the jury] that the Commonwealth is, indeed, seeking the death penalty in this case____” could have been viewed by the jury as the court’s endorsement of the death penalty in this case. (N.T. 3/24/92, 9).</p>

Moreover, the court clearly indicated that it was solely the decision of the jury to <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>determine the appropriate sentence. (N.T. 4/7/92, 4, 37). These allegations are unquestionably frivolous.</p>

The challenged comments by the prosecutor consisted of the following: ”[T]he defense may talk to you, ladies and gentlemen, about sympathy, sympathy for a young woman, sympathy for someone who has children. Well, if there’s any sympathy that belongs anywhere in this courtroom, ladies and gentlemen, it belongs there on the first row [with the family members of the victims].” (N.T. 4/7/92, 46).</p>

Although Hill complains that she was prejudiced by the prosecutor's reference to the fact that one of the robbery victims "did not comprehend the English language,” she fails to specify how she was harmed. We are unable to discern how this comment could have affected the jury's objectivity in this case.</p>

In another obvious misrepresentation of the record, Hill's brief makes the claim that "[n]o mitigating circumstances were ever mentioned by the judge, only the aggravating ones.” Brief for Appellant at 46. As stated previously, the trial court's instructions to the jury fully comported with the guidelines set forth in the death penalty statute.</p>
