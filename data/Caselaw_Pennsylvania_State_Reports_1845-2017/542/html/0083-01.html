They covered her eyes, nose and mouth with duct tape, tied her hands and feet with neckties, strangled her using a necktie, and held her head under water in the bathtub until she stopped breathing. Mr. Hart was taken to the basement where he was forced to lie down with his face in a pan of water while either Appellant or Mason held his foot on Hart’s back and pulled on a electrical cord around Hart’s neck causing his death.

Appellant also claims that this additional language violated Rule 357(a)(2) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, which requires the judge to meet with counsel prior to jury deliberations to determine which aggravating and mitigating circumstances apply based on the evidence. “The judge shall then set forth those circumstances on the sentencing verdict slip using the language provided by law.” Pa.

By showing a photograph of the child, the jury was able to see from her physical appearance that she was unable to care for herself upon being abandoned in a house where the thermostat had been turned down to approximately 50 degrees during the dead of winter. Moreover, Appellant cannot be said to have been prejudiced by the admission of this photograph in light of the fact that this was not one of the aggravating circumstances found by the jury.</p>

The jury had seen several photographs of the victims showing them bound, gagged and masked; photographs taken at the medical examiner’s office; photographs of the crime scene; and photographs of the duct tape which had been removed from the victims bodies. Although this photograph is not part of the record, in light of the admission of these many other descriptive photographs, the passions of the jury cannot possibly be said to have been inflamed by one innocuous photograph held up by a witness showing the couple before they were murdered.
