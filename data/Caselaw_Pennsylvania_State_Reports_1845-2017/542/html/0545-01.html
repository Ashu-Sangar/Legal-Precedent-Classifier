Appellee was behind another vehicle as the two cars approached a point on the Susquehanna River Bridge where two lanes of traffic merged into a single lane. Trooper Kambic then saw Appellee drive over a solid white line and pass the vehicle in front of him before that vehicle merged into the same lane. There was no evidence, however, that Appellee operated his vehicle in a careless or reckless manner or that he interfered with any other vehicle on the road.</p>

The trooper approached Appellee’s vehicle and directed him to roll down his window. As Appellee rolled down the driver’s side window, Trooper Kambic detected a strong odor of burnt marijuana. Appellee was then ordered out of the vehicle at which time the trooper conducted a pat down search of Appellee’s person. Trooper Kambic discovered a film canister in Appellee’s right jacket pocket which contained marijuana. The trooper also found some rolling papers and a lighter in Appellee’s pocket.

In <em>Murray, </em>the police responded to a burglar alarm that had been activated inside a clothing store. When they arrived, the police noticed an individual fleeing in the shadows of the building but were unable to apprehend or identify the (suspect. Approximately one hour after the initial alarm, the police observed an automobile pull into the driveway of a house near the store, stop momentarily, and then depart. The police followed the car for approximately one-half mile, during which time no traffic laws were violated nor was anything unusual observed with regard to the vehicle or its occupants. The police signaled the vehicle to stop, and the driver complied. One of the officers approached the passenger side of the vehicle and saw a hammer and a railroad spike lying on the floor behind the driver’s seat. Based on these observations, a search warrant was obtained for the automobile and a subsequent search uncovered the items that had been stolen from the clothing store earlier that evening.</p>

Trooper Kambic testified that he intended to cite Appellee for driving at an unsafe speed. That offense is proscribed by 75 Pa.C.S. § 3361, which provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="AL9" data-blocks='[["BL_866.6",866,[321,1591,1115,670]]]'>No person shall drive a vehicle at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having regard to the actual and potential hazards then existing, nor at a speed greater than will permit the driver to bring his vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead. Consistent with the foregoing, every person shall drive at a safe and appropriate speed when approaching and crossing an intersection or railroad grade crossing, when approaching and going around [a] curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway and when special hazards exist with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions.</blockquote>

The trooper testified that Appellee “made an erratic lane change from the ramp onto the interstate.... ” (R.R. at 14a). This observation clearly does not fit within the ambit of prohibited vehicle operation as defined in section 3361. Likewise, the trooper could not have relied upon his estimate of Appellee’s speed as that estimate was based on a distance of only two-tenths of a mile instead of the three-tenths required by the statute. <em>See </em>note five, <em>supra. </em>As the learned trial court stated,</p>

      <em>Commonwealth v. Whitmyer, </em>414 CR 1991, slip op. at 5 (C.P. Cumberland County June 17, 1991).</p>
    <p id="b867-6" data-blocks='[["BL_867.6",867,[202,1447,1149,580]]]'>Based on the evidence of record, there were no articulable and reasonable grounds for Trooper Kambic to believe that Appellee was driving at an unsafe speed. We note that this is not a case where further investigation would lead to a discovery of a violation of the Vehicle Code. If the trooper was unable to clock Appellee for three-tenths of a mile or observe the conditions that would warrant a citation for driving at an unsafe speed, there is no further evidence that could be obtained from a subsequent stop and investigation. Thus, we conclude that the fruits of the unlawful stop were correctly suppressed.</p>
