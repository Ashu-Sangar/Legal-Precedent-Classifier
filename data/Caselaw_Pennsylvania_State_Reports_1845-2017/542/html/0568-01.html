The first is whether an order transferring a murder case from the Criminal Division of the Court of Common Pleas to the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas, pursuant to section 6322 of the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301, <em>et. seq., </em>is an interlocutory order that cannot be appealed until a final disposition of the case has been made. The second issue deals with whether the appeal of an order <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>transferring a murder case from the criminal division to the juvenile division, pursuant to section 6322, taken after the disposition of the case by the juvenile division, is barred by the double jeopardy protections of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. Finally, assuming the appeal is timely and criminal prosecution is not barred, we must determine whether the lower court committed gross abuse of discretion by transferring Johnson’s case to the juvenile division.</p>

    <p id="b887-6" data-blocks='[["BL_887.5",887,[135,1202,1154,985]]]'>Section 6355(f) only expressly governs transfers from the juvenile division to the criminal division. The Commonwealth argues that we can infer that the legislature intended to treat all transfers between the two divisions in the same way. However, this argument ignores the practical difference between the two situations. Overwhelmingly, a challenge to an order transferring a case from the juvenile division to the criminal division will be made by the juvenile. Therefore, by asserting the challenge, the juvenile impliedly waives his claim to relief under the double jeopardy clause. <em>Forman v.

A problem arises, however, when the transfer is improper. In those instances, the case should have remained in the criminal division and no action should have been taken by the juvenile division.
