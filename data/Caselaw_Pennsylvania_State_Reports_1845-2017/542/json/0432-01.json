        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nAppellant, United National Insurance Company (\u201cUnited\u201d), appeals from an Order of the Superior Court affirming an Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The court of common pleas entered a compulsory nonsuit against United in an action seeking rescission of an insurance policy it had issued to Appellees, J.H. France Refractories Company, The Van Brunt Company, Mineral Industries, Inc., and Green Point Fire Brick Company (\u201cFrance\u201d or \u201cAppellees\u201d). United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. J.H. France Refractories Co., No. 5623, October Term 1987 (C.P. Philadelphia June 6, 1991). While the court found that United met all the elements required to rescind the policy based on fraud, the court nonetheless entered the nonsuit because it found United\u2019s action barred by the two-year statute of limitations for fraud provided in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5524(7). Id.\nOn appeal, the Superior Court affirmed, finding that 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5501(c) permitted the trial judge to determine the timeliness of Appellant\u2019s equity action based solely on the statute of limitations for fraud, without regard to the application of laches. United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. J.H. France Refractories Co., 417 Pa.Super. 614, 612 A.2d 1371 (1992). Further, the court held that the trial judge correctly determined the date on which Appellant\u2019s action accrued, and thus applied the proper statute of limitations. Id. at 627-29, 612 A.2d at 1378.\nUnited appealed to this Court, and we granted allocatur. 533 Pa. 646, 622 A.2d 1377 (1993). Because we find that the timeliness of an equitable action may not be determined based solely on the applicable statute of limitations, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court for the reasons that follow.\nThe undisputed facts of this matter reveal that in May of 1982, one of Appellees\u2019 officers contacted its insurance agent at Main America Agency to obtain $5,000,000 of liability insurance coverage. United National, No. 5623, October Term 1987, Finding of Fact No. 2(a) (C.P. Philadelphia June 6, 1991). Appellees, manufacturers of various refractory products such as fire brick and related items, sought this coverage in addition to $500,000 of primary liability coverage and $5,000,000 of umbrella coverage issued by Allstate Insurance Company and Twin City Fire Insurance Company, respectively. Id., Findings of Fact Nos. 1, 2(a).\nMain America then contacted an intermediary company, Tri-State General Insurance Agency, which in turn contacted Doran Excess Underwriters. Doran, a managing general agent for United, had the authority to underwrite and issue policies for United. Before issuing a policy, Doran requested certain information from France, including France\u2019s involvement with asbestos. Id., Findings of Fact Nos. (2)(d), (e)(i).\nAt the time of Doran\u2019s request for information, Appellees\u2019 officer knew that:\n(1) in 1979, France had been sued by an individual named Temple, who claimed that he contracted mesothelioma as a result of exposure to France\u2019s asbestos-containing products;\n(2) Allstate refused to defend the Temple action because asbestos-related conditions were not covered by its policy;\n(3) in 1980 or 1981, France brought a declaratory judgment action against Allstate regarding the Temple matter;\n(4) between 1968 and 1972, France had produced a cement containing 26 percent asbestos fiber; and\n(5) at least 12 actions had been brought against France alleging injury resulting from exposure to France\u2019s asbestos-containing products, and that many of these actions sought damages in excess of $1,000,000.\nSee id., Findings of Fact Nos. 2(b)(i) \u2014 (iv).\nNonetheless, Appellees\u2019 application for insurance revealed only two lawsuits involving products of France in 1982; France also claimed that these lawsuits involved only $10,000. Id., Finding of Fact No. 2(e)(iii). Also, in response to the question asking Appellees to specify any incidents indicating exposure to noxious material that occurred prior to the application and which could cause injury during the period of coverage requested by Appellees, Appellees answered \u201cnone.\u201d Id., Finding of Fact No. 2(e)(iv).\nBased on the information supplied by Appellees, Doran issued a binder on Policy No. XTP 11511 issued by Appellant, covering the period from June 3, 1982, to June 3, 1983. Id., Finding of Fact No. 2\u00ae. On July 12, 1982, Doran asked TriState for additional information on the two lawsuits mentioned in the insurance application. Id., Finding of Fact No. 2(g). Main America informed Tri-State that one claim was made against Bethlehem Steel and its suppliers, including France, for \u201csome sort of a lung condition\u201d and that France did not believe it was doing business with Bethlehem Steel when the loss was thought to have originated. Id. Main America indicated that the second claim was very similar and that \u201c[n]o verdict or evidence that they [France] are involved has been proven to date.\u201d Id. The insurance policy was then issued on August 4, 1982, for $5,000,000 of excess coverage for the period from June 3, 1982, to June 3, 1983. Id., Finding of Fact No. 2(h).\nOn June 3, 1983, in response to a request by Doran for renewal information, Tri-State informed Doran that Main America reported that France had three, not two, products liability cases involving $10,000. Id., Finding of Fact No. 3(i). Further, Doran learned that from 1968 to 1972, France had produced a cement containing 26 percent asbestos fiber. Id., Finding of Fact No. 3(ii).\nAs a result of this information, Doran forwarded a new policy issued by Appellant, but with an asbestos and occupational disease exclusion attached. Id., Finding of Fact No. 4. France refused to accept this policy. Id. On September 12, 1983, Appellant learned from Doran of a claim potentially involving Policy No. XTP 11511. Id., Finding of Fact No. 5. On October 28, 1983, United\u2019s then-President wrote to the President of France advising Appellees that United considered Policy No. XTP 11511 \u201cvoid ab initio\u201d based upon \u201cmaterial misrepresentations in securing these policies.\u201d Id., Finding of Fact No. 6.\nHowever, it was not until October 30, 1987, that United filed the present matter, claiming that Appellees had fraudulently misrepresented that there were no asbestos-related claims against them. In response, Appellees contended that the action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations for fraud as well as the doctrines of laches, waiver and estoppel. The matter proceeded to a non-jury trial.\nAt the close of Appellant\u2019s case, France moved for a nonsuit, reiterating its arguments that Appellant\u2019s lawsuit was untimely filed. The trial judge agreed, finding that the two-year statute of limitations governing fraud barred Appellant\u2019s action. Id., at 440 \u2014 41. In so holding, the court rejected Appellant\u2019s argument that its cause of action accrued in June of 1982, when Appellees first misrepresented their potential asbestos-related liability. Id. Appellant had urged this interpretation upon the court because, prior to February 18, 1983, fraud actions were governed by a six-year statute of limitations. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5527(6) (amended 1982). Under section 5527(6), Appellant\u2019s action would have been timely.\nThe court, however, determined that the earliest time Appellant had reason to discover Appellees\u2019 fraud was on or about June 3, 1983, when France revealed certain asbestos-related information on its renewal application. Id., at 438-39. The court concluded that Appellant \u201cshould not be permitted to claim that its agent . .. was put on notice of an asbestos-related risk when in fact he was not.\u201d Id., at 438-39. The court also did not consider the application of the doctrine of laches or any other equitable doctrines to Appellant\u2019s suit.\nOn appeal to the Superior Court, Appellant contended that the trial court erred in (1) applying the statute of limitations alone rather than the doctrine of laches to evaluate the timeliness of its claim; and (2) applying the discovery rule to evaluate when Appellant\u2019s cause of action accrued. United National, 417 Pa.Super. at 620, 612 A.2d at 1374. Regarding its first argument, Appellant cited this Court\u2019s decision in Kay v. Kay, 460 Pa. 680, 334 A.2d 585 (1975), in which we stated that a statute of limitations may not control an equity court\u2019s determination of the timeliness of an action, but may only provide guidance in determining, within the context of laches, whether a delay was appropriate. Id. at 685, 334 A.2d at 587.\nThe Superior Court acknowledged that equity courts of this Commonwealth have long evaluated the timeliness of actions by applying the doctrine of laches. United National, 417 Pa.Super. at 621, 612 A.2d at 1374. Further, the court noted that, pursuant to Kay, it has stated that statutes of limitation do not control in equity actions. Id. (citing In re Francis Edward McGillick Fdn., 406 Pa.Super. 249, 594 A.2d 322 (1991), aff'd in part & rev\u2019d in part, 537 Pa. 194, 642 A.2d 467 (1994)). However, the court stated that in 1978, the legislature amended 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5501, pertaining to statutes of limitation, and added subsection (c), which provides: \u201c[t]his chapter is applicable to equitable matters, but nothing in this chapter shall modify the principles of waiver, laches, and estoppel and similar principles heretofore applicable in equitable matters.\u201d Id. at 624, 612 A.2d at 1376 (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5501(a)).\nIn the Superior Court\u2019s view, when the legislature added section 5501(c), it \u201cwithdrew the foundation upon which the cases cited by [Appellant], which relied on Kay, ... rested.\u201d United National, 417 Pa.Super. at 625, 612 A.2d at 1376. The court further found that the language in section 5501(c) regarding equitable principles did not affect its conclusion because\nthis language may be construed to mean that these doctrines continue to apply in equitable matters. In other words, contrary to the Kay court\u2019s statement, a statute of limitation may control in equity, or, an equity court may apply the laches doctrine to determine the timeliness of an action before it. In fact, in the years following the amendment of [section] 5501, our courts have continued to employ the doctrine of laches.\nId. at 624-25 n. 6, 612 A.2d at 1376 n. 6 (citation omitted). Therefore, the Superior Court concluded that \u201c[t]he trial court did not commit an error of law in applying a statute of limitation to determine the timeliness of [Appellant\u2019s] action.\u201d Id. at 625, 612 A.2d at 1376.\nTurning to the second issue, the Superior Court first rejected Appellant\u2019s argument that 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5524(7) was inapplicable because Appellant sought rescission rather than money damages. Instead, the court concluded that since section 5524(7) applies to \u201cany action or proceeding sounding in trespass, including deceit or fraud,\u201d this language encompasses matters in equity as well as law. Id. at 626-27, 612 A.2d at 1377.\nFinally, the Superior Court addressed Appellant\u2019s contention that the six-year statute of limitations provided in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5527(6) should apply because its cause of action accrued in June of 1982, prior to the effective date of the two-year limitation period for fraud. Appellant argued that since the misrepresentations actually occurred in 1982 and because it could have discovered the fraud at that time if it had exercised due diligence, its cause of action arose upon the actual receipt of the misinformation. Id. at 627-28, 612 A.2d at 1378.\nHowever, the Superior Court noted that since the discovery rule operates to delay rather than accelerate the commencement of a limitations period, Appellant could not benefit from its own lack of diligence. Id. at 628, 612 A.2d at 1378. Therefore, the court agreed with the trial court\u2019s determination that the insurer\u2019s cause of action accrued in June of 1983.\nWe limited allocatur to two issues. The first issue is whether the timeliness of an equitable action may be determined based solely on the applicable statute of limitations. The second issue is whether the discovery rule may be invoked to determine the accrual of a cause of action when a plaintiff does not seek the protection of the rule. We agree with Appellant that the trial court erred in assessing the timeliness of its action solely with reference to the statute of limitations and therefore reverse.\nThe correctness of the trial judge\u2019s reliance on the statute of limitations alone to determine the timeliness of this action depends upon this Court\u2019s interpretation of the admittedly confusing language in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5501(c). Enacted in 1978, this section provides that statutes of limitation are \u201capplicable to equitable matters.\u201d However, the section further states that \u201cnothing ... shall modify the principles of waiver, laches and estoppel and similar principles heretofore applicable in equitable matters.\u201d Therefore, we find it necessary to examine the principle of laches as it existed prior to 1978 to determine if the lower courts were correct in their assessment that section 5501 (c) authorizes reliance on statutes of limitation alone in equitable matters.\nAs the Superior Court observed, the courts of this Commonwealth have traditionally applied the doctrine of laches to determine the timeliness of actions in equity. \u201cThe application of the equitable doctrine of laches does not depend upon the fact that a definite time has elapsed since the cause of action accrued, but whether, under the circumstances of the particular case, the complaining party is guilty of want of due diligence in failing to institute his action to another\u2019s prejudice.\u201d Class of Two Hundred Admin. Faculty Members of State Colleges in Commonwealth v. Scanlon, 502 Pa. 275, 279, 466 A.2d 103, 105 (1983).\nWe have observed that, \u201c[i]n the absence of fraud or concealment, it is a general rule that laches follows the statute of limitations.\u201d Silver v. Korr, 392 Pa. 26, 30, 139 A.2d 552, 555 (1958); see also Philadelphia v. Louis Laboratories, Inc., 201 Pa.Super. 16, 19, 189 A.2d 891, 893 (1963). However, because statutes of limitation are \u201cnot controlling in equity,\u201d but only \u201cprovide guidance in determining the reasonableness of any delay,\u201d Kay, 460 Pa. at 685, 334 A.2d at 587, this Court has allowed suits in equity to proceed despite significant delays in bringing the action. See, e.g., Brodt v. Brown, 404 Pa. 391, 172 A.2d 152 (1961) (seven year delay in bringing action to enjoin defendants from interfering with plaintiffs\u2019 use of unopened street); Crunk v. Mid-State Theatres, Inc., 404 Pa. 22, 170 A.2d 858 (1961) (sixteen-year delay in bringing action to compel corporation to issue stock certificate). Likewise, this Court has noted that laches may bar an action even though it would not be barred by the analogous statute of limitations. See, e.g., Freeman v. Lawton, 353 Pa. 613, 617, 46 A.2d 205, 207 (1946) (laches may constitute a defense in equity even though action would not be barred at law); see generally Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 396, 66 S.Ct. 582, 584, 90 L.Ed. 743 (1946) (since equity \u201cdepends on flexibility,\u201d a suit in equity may exist even where the analogous cause of action at law would be barred; conversely, a suit in equity may fail even though the analogous statute of limitations would not operate as a bar).\nThus, prior to the enactment of section 5501(c), the \u201cequitable principle\u201d of laches at operation in this Commonwealth was that, although statutes of limitation often provided guidance in determining if an action was timely, they did not control that determination. In the Superior Court\u2019s view, this doctrine is no longer in force because language in section 5501(c) states that statutes of limitation are applicable to equitable matters.\nWe find that the Superior Court too lightly dismissed the accompanying language of section 5501(c) to the effect that \u201cnothing in this chapter shall modify the principle! ] of ... laches ... heretofore applicable in equitable matters.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5501(c) (emphasis added). Under 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903, we are bound to construe a statute \u201caccording to common and approved usage, and where possible it should be interpreted in a manner so as to give effect to each and every provision of the Act.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hill, 481 Pa. 37, 43 n. 6, 391 A.2d 1303, 1306 n. 6 (1978) (emphasis added).\nInstantly, the courts below did not give effect to every provision of section 5501(c); instead, they essentially ignored the section\u2019s \u201cheretofore applicable\u201d language. Yet, consistent with the principle that we must give effect to the full language of a statute wherever possible, it is possible to give meaning to all of the language in section 5501(c). The logical construction of this provision is that, to the extent that equity courts have historically been guided by statutes of limitation, the limitations periods set forth in Chapter 55 are \u201capplicable to equitable matters.\u201d However, to give meaning to the \u201cheretofore applicable\u201d language in section 5501(c), we conclude that equity courts may not rely solely on statutes of limitation in determining if a claim is timely.\nTherefore, the Order of the Superior Court is reversed, and this case is remanded to the trial court for an evaluation of the timeliness of Appellant\u2019s claim according to the doctrine of laches.\nLARSEN and PAPADAKOS, JJ., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nZAPPALA, J., files a concurring opinion.\nCAPPY, J., joins the majority opinion and the concurring opinion filed by ZAPPALA, J.\nMONTEMURO, J., who was an appointed Justice of the Court at the time of argument, participated in the decision of this case by designation as a senior judge as provided by Rule of Judicial Administration 701(f).\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5501(c) provides that \"[t]his chapter [Chapter 55, relating to limitation of actions] is applicable to equitable matters, but nothing in this chapter shall modify the principles of waiver, laches and estoppel and similar principles heretofore applicable in equitable matters.\u201d\n. Appellees' insurance agent at Main America actually filled out the application, but at the direction of Appellees. Id., Finding of Fact No. 2(e)(ii).\n. Because of our resolution of the laches issue, we need not address the issues raised by the application of the discovery rule to this matter.\n. As Appellant correctly notes, since the question of whether laches applies is a question of law, we are not bound by the lower courts\u2019 decisions on this issue. See 2401 Pennsylvania Ave. Corp. v. Federation of Jewish Agencies, 507 Pa. 166, 172, 489 A.2d 733, 736 (1985).\n. We are not persuaded by the Superior Court\u2019s reconciliation of the language of 5501(c). In the Superior Court's view, section 5501(c) authorizes courts to choose either to find the statute of limitations controlling or to apply laches to determine timeliness. United National, 417 Pa.Super. at 624 n. 6, 612 A.2d at 1376 n. 6. In our view, this interpretation invites abuse of discretion and could raise serious equal protection concerns. Indeed, as Appellant argues, if any case is worthy of the application of laches based on the underlying factual dispute, this is such a case.\n. Appellant argues that since Appellees presented no evidence of prejudice at the trial level, we should order the trial court to reinstate Appellant's action. However, since the trial court did not address the question of prejudice, we find that the appropriate course is to remand this matter to the trial court to make that factual determination.",
