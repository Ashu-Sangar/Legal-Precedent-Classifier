        "text": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nAt issue in this case is whether a claimant in a fatal claim petition requesting compensation under section 307 of the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act sustained her burden of proof that she was \u201cdependent\u201d upon her deceased child and therefore entitled to compensation under the act.\nOn November 9, 1990, Else B. Essel filed a fatal claim petition with the Bureau of Worker\u2019s Compensation requesting compensation based on the death of her son, Brian K. Adams, who died as a result of work-related injuries on October 2, 1990. At hearings before a referee, claimant testified that she is a sixty-year-old widow, that her son provided financial support for her from 1989, while he was in the Navy, until his death in October 1990. He was discharged from the Navy in August 1990, moved in with his mother shortly thereafter, and went to work for Lineal Industries. Mrs. Essel also introduced evidence of her income and expenses. Her expenses included monthly mortgage payments ranging from $193.79 to $387.58 for a vacation home-trailer purchased in 1987 for $13,500. The referee found that the son was single, without dependent children, living with his widowed mother, and earning $425 per week at the time of his death. He also found that the mother\u2019s average monthly income was $1322, her average monthly expenses were $1400, and that her son contributed approximately $583 per month to his mother from January 1990 through September 1990. The referee concluded, therefore, that Mrs. Essel had sustained her burden of proof that she was partially dependent upon her son at the time of his death and that she was entitled to compensation under the fatal claim petition.\nThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the referee\u2019s determination and the employer appealed to Commonwealth Court. Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that the cost of Mrs. Essel\u2019s vacation trailer-home was not an ordinary necessity of life and, therefore, should have been excluded from the referee\u2019s calculation of expenses. Had it been excluded, Mrs. Essel\u2019s expenses would not have exceeded her income and she would not, therefore, be \u201cdependent\u201d under the act.\nWe granted Mrs. Essel\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal to review Commonwealth Court\u2019s interpretation of the statutory requirement of dependency under the act.\nSection 307 of the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 561, provides for compensation benefits to dependent parents of a deceased employee as follows:\nIn case of death, compensation shall be computed on the following basis, and distributed to the following persons.... If there be neither widow, widower, nor children entitled to compensation, then to the father or mother, if dependent to any extent upon the employee at the time of the injury....\n(Emphasis added.) Commonwealth Court has described a parent\u2019s dependency under the act as follows:\nThe test of dependency is whether or not the child\u2019s earnings were needed to provide the parents with some of the ordinary necessities of life suitable for persons in their class and position, and that the parents were, consequently, dependent to some extent upon the child at the time of the accident causing his death.... If the contribution of the deceased child were necessary to maintain the parents in an established reasonable standard of living, this existing standard must be considered in determining the necessity for such contribution from the child.\nLeipziger v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 12 Pa. Cmwlth. 417, 420, 315 A.2d 883, 885 (1974) (Citations omitted).\nOur standard of review is whether the necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, whether the lower court committed an error of law, or whether constitutional rights have been violated. Bethenergy Mines, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 531 Pa. 287, 612 A.2d 434 (1992).\nMrs. Essel\u2019s view is that Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding that the vacation home was excludable from the dependency calculation because it was not an \u201cordinary necessity of life\u201d was error. We will address this claim after first considering the employer\u2019s arguments that in addition to the vacation home matter, other considerations defeat appellant\u2019s claim for compensation.\nTo begin with, the employer asserts that the referee erred in calculating the claimant\u2019s income at $1322 per month and her expenses at $1400 per month. In support of this claim, the employer points out that included in claimant\u2019s expenses is the cost of a headstone for her son, a capital expense that should be excluded from the calculation of ordinary monthly expenses, and that if the cost of the headstone is removed, claimant\u2019s expenses would be $1362 per month. Employer also asserts that the referee erred in calculating Mrs. Esser\u2019s monthly income at $1322 and that it should have been calculated at $1391.78.\nThe argument as to Mrs. Esser\u2019s income fails because the employer has not preserved the issue of claimant\u2019s income for review. The income, therefore, for purposes of this appeal, remains at $1322 as set by the referee, and even if the expenses are adjusted downward to $1362, as argued by the employer, the expenses still exceed the income and dependency is not defeated.\nNext the employer argues that if claimant is allowed to include the monthly expense for her trailer-vacation home, and if she is awarded benefits, the benefits should cease as of October 1994, when the trailer will be paid for.\nThe statutory scheme provides for limitations upon payment of compensation to various categories of beneficiaries. Section 307 provides for compensation to any child, brother or sister, for example, \u201conly if and while such child, brother, or sister is under the age of eighteen unless such child, brother or sister is dependent because of disability ...\u201d or until the child, brother or sister reaches twenty-three if he is enrolled in an accredited educational institution. There are also restrictions upon compensation to surviving spouses and \u201cdependents\u201d:\nShould any dependent of a deceased employee die or remarry, or should the widower become capable of self-support, the right of such dependent or widower to compensation under this section shall cease except that if a widow remarries, she shall receive one hundred four weeks compensation at a rate computed in accordance with clause 2 of section 307 in a lump sum after which compensation shall cease.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 562. According to this provision, compensation' payable to a dependent (the status sought by Mrs, Essel) ends (a) upon the death of the dependent or (b) upon the dependent\u2019s remarriage. Compensation payable to a surviving spouse ends (a) when the surviving spouse dies, (b) when the surviving spouse becomes capable of self-support, or (c) upon remarriage of the surviving spouse.\nIn sum, section 307 sets limits upon compensation payable to children, brothers, sisters, dependents, and surviving spouses of the deceased. Mrs. Essel is not a child, brother, sister or widow of the deceased; rather, she is, in the terms of the statute, a \u201cdependent.\u201d Benefits to Mrs. Essel, therefore, are payable under the portion of the statute governing dependents. The statute terminates a \u201cdependent\u2019s\u201d benefits upon death or remarriage. It does not provide other possible conditions for termination, as it does for children, brothers, sisters, widows and \"widowers. We conclude, therefore, that once benefits are paid to a parent who is dependent, they are payable until the parent\u2019s death or remarriage.\nThe question remains, however, whether Commonwealth Court was correct in holding that the monthly payment for the trailer-vacation home was excludable from the dependency calculation because it was not an \u201cordinary necessity of life.\u201d The employer asserts that the mortgage payment for a second home \u201ccannot be considered a necessary and ordinary expense,\u201d and concludes that such an expense, therefore, is not includable in the calculation of dependency.\nIt will be recalled that Commonwealth Court in Leipziger v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board stated: \u201cThe test of dependency is whether or not the child\u2019s earnings were needed to provide the parents with some of the ordinary necessities of life suitable for persons in their class and position,\u201d 12 Pa.Cmwlth. at 420, 315 A.2d at 885, supra. We agree with this interpretation of \u201cdependency\u201d under section 307.\nIn order to be eligible for compensation, the father or mother must \u201cto any extent\u201d be dependent upon the financial contributions of the deceased child. This means, simply, that when normal monthly bills extant at the time of the child\u2019s death are set off against normal monthly income of the parent, there is a deficit, absent the child\u2019s contribution. Further, in order to qualify as \u201cdependent,\u201d these regular monthly expenditures must be reasonable in light of the life circumstances of the parent at the time of the child\u2019s death.\nHere, the purchase of the trailer-vacation home occurred three years prior to the decedent\u2019s death while Mrs. Esser\u2019s husband was still living. The record indicates that Mrs. Essel acquiesced in her late husband\u2019s desire to purchase the property. The total purchase price of the trailer-vacation home was $13,500 and it was to be paid off at the rate of approximately $194 per month over a period of seven years. Mrs. Esser did not incur this expense after her son\u2019s death, but rather, it was a financial reality and a financial burden at the time of his death. Further, it was an expense appropriate to her life circumstances that was incurred at a time when she reasonably expected to be able to afford it. It is not, therefore, an unreasonable expense and is includable in her expenses for purposes of calculating her dependency under the act.\nOrder of Commonwealth Court is reversed and the order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board is reinstated.\nZAPPALA, J., files a concurring opinion.\nCAPPY, J., concurs in the result.\nMONTEMURO, J., files a dissenting opinion in which CASTILLE, J., joins.\nMONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation as a senior judge as provided by Rule of Judicial Administration 701(f).\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7 562.\n. See employer\u2019s Appeal and Request for Supersedeas before the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, which states, in pertinent part:\n6. This appeal is from referee's finding of fact number 8, 9, and 13. These' are contrary to the law and not supported by substantial competent evidence.\nThe referee\u2019s Findings of Fact which were appealed are as follows:\n8. At that time, the family\u2019s monthly expenses were about $1,400.00 excluding October 1990.\n9. At that time, decedent\u2019s average monthly contribution toward those expenses was about $583.00 from January 1990 through September 1990. Since Claimant's Exhibit # 3 starts with January 1990, that date is used here also.\n13. Claimant sustained her burden of proving that she was partially dependent upon decedent at the time of his fatal, work-related injuries.\nThe referee\u2019s finding which employer did not appeal from was number 7:\n7. Excluding decedent's income and contributions, the family\u2019s total monthly income at that time was about $1,322.00.\n. Appellee also argues that claimant\u2019s expenses will decrease by at least $100 per month because of the death of her son, thus reducing her expenses to about $1300 per month, less than her income. An examination of claimant\u2019s monthly expenses from January 1990 through December 1990, however, reveals that claimant\u2019s expenses remained fairly constant: the average monthly expense for food and personal items over twelve months was $617, and for the two months claimant\u2019s son lived with her, it was $637 per month. Average monthly expense for utilities over twelve months was $204 and for the two months claimant\u2019s son lived with her, utility expense was $170 per month. We conclude, therefore, that claimant\u2019s monthly expenses would not measurably decrease after her son\u2019s death.",

        "text": "ZAPPALA, Justice,\nconcurring.\nI join in the majority opinion as I find it to be a proper interpretation of the current law of this Commonwealth. As noted, Section 307 of the Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 561, provides that compensation shall be distributed to a parent of the deceased employee if the parent was dependent \u201cto any extent\u201d upon the employee at the time of the injury. Furthermore, case law has developed defining the test for dependency as whether or not the employee\u2019s earnings were needed to provide the parent with some of the ordinary necessities of life suitable for persons in their class and position. Majority at 331.\nAs it appears that the vacation home fell within this definition, I believe the majority\u2019s analysis is correct. However, since \u201cordinary necessities of life\u201d are not statutorily defined, I question a case by case examination of what is \u201cnecessary\u201d for a particular class. Such an indefinite analysis leaves room for rewarding the extravagant while penalizing the frugal. I would respectfully request that this issue be reexamined by the Legislature. A statutory definition of what constitutes \u201cordinary necessities of life\u201d would be beneficial to the bench and bar alike.",

        "text": "MONTEMURO, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe majority concludes that in order to be eligible for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits as a \u201cdependent\u201d of a deceased child, the parent simply must be dependent upon the financial contributions of the deceased child to any extent. In determining what qualifies as \u201cto any extent,\u201d the majority believes that a rudimentary mathematical calculation which pits normal monthly bills against normal monthly income will be dispositive of the issue, as long as the normal monthly expenses exceed the normal monthly income and further provided that the monthly expenses are reasonable in light of the parent\u2019s station in life. Because I do not believe that such an arbitrary standard should be applied, I must dissent.\nOur legislature has provided that:\n\u00a7 561. Persons entitled to compensation on death of employe; amounts\nIn case of death, compensation shall be computed on the following basis, and distributed to the following persons: Provided, That in no case shall the wages of the deceased be taken to be less than fifty per centum of the Statewide average weekly wage for purposes of this section:\n* * * * * *\n5. If there be neither widow, widower, nor children entitled to compensation, then to the father or mother, if dependent to any extent upon the employe at the time of the injury, thirty-two per centum of wages but not in excess of the Statewide average weekly wage: Provided, however, That in the case of a minor child who has been contributing to his parents, the dependency of said parents shall be presumed: And provided further, That if the father or mother was totally dependent upon the deceased employe at the time of the injury, the compensation payable to such father or mother shall be fifty-two per centum of wages, but not in excess of the Statewide average weekly wage.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 561 (emphasis supplied).\nIt is well established that the test for determining dependency under this section is:\nwhether or not the child\u2019s earnings were needed to provide the parents with some of the ordinary necessities of life suitable for persons in their class and position, and that the parents were, consequently, dependent to some extent upon the child at the time of the accident causing his death. If the contribution of the deceased child were [sic] necessary to maintain the parents in an established, reasonable standard of living, this existing standard must be considered in determining the necessity for such contribution from the child.\nLeipziger v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 12 Pa. Commw. 417, 420, 315 A.2d 883, 885 (1974) (citations omitted). Moreover, \u201c[t]he term \u2018dependency\u2019 as used in Section 307(5) [77 P.S. \u00a7 561] contemplates \u2018actual dependency\u2019.... \u201d Haller v. W.C.A.B. (Rainbow Sign Services), 153 Pa.Commw. 149, 153, 620 A.2d 657, 659 (1993) (emphasis supplied). Furthermore, the Commonwealth Court has held that \u201c[ordinary necessities do not include such \u2018capital expenditures\u2019 as new siding for the claimant\u2019s house or furniture and amounts expended for such items are not properly chargeable to the claimant\u2019s expenses in the year of the child\u2019s death.\u201d No. 1 Contracting Corp. v. W.C.A.B. (Van Horn), 74 Pa.Commw. 340, 346, 460 A.2d 374, 377 (1983) (citing DeGuffroy & Associates v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 52 Pa. Commw. 58, 415 A.2d 437 (1980)). See also Cook v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 64 Pa.Commw. 278, 440 A.2d 652 (1982) (wherein the Commonwealth Court recognized that expenses for college tuition of adult children should not be considered in the parent\u2019s expenses because, while important, an education is not one of the ordinary necessities of life suitable for persons in the parent\u2019s class).\nWithout addressing the Act\u2019s overall objective to provide compensation to individuals who are actually dependent, the majority simply concludes that the cost of maintaining a vacation home is an expense appropriate to Claimant\u2019s life circumstances. I disagree. I do not believe that a vacation home is one of the ordinary necessities of life which our legislature sought to protect. Rather, I agree with the Commonwealth Court that just as capital expenditures and college educations are not considered to be \u201cnecessities of life,\u201d the cost of maintaining a vacation home cannot be considered a necessity of life either. Therefore, I would affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision to exclude this expense from the referee\u2019s calculation.\nCASTILLE, J., joins in this Dissenting Opinion.\n. Alternatively, I also dissent from the majority's conclusion that \u201conce benefits are paid to a parent who is dependent, they are payable until the parent's death or remarriage.\u201d Op. at 601. Contrary to the majority's cursory analysis of this point, the Commonwealth Court has recognized that the resolution of this question is not as simple as it may seem. Claws Refuse v. W.C.A.B. (Squires), 164 Pa.Commw. 424, 643 A.2d 742 (1994). In that case, the Commonwealth Court noted that, \" '[tjhis issue has been the subject of several Commonwealth Court decisions. Kreider vs. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board, 10 Pa. Comwlth.Ct. 79, 308 A.2d 187 (1973) and Broadwood Chuckwagon v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 112 Pa.Comwlth.Ct. 213, 535 A.2d 272 (1987). The cases hold that dependent parents were entitled to benefits until they died.\u2019 \u201d Claws Refuse, 164 Pa.Commw. at 427-28, 643 A.2d at 744 (citing Decision of the Board, November 30, 1993, pp. 3-4). After reviewing the several cases and addressing the equities of the situation in light of the intent of the Act, the Court held that:\nfatal claim benefits to a dependent can be limited in duration where, as in this case, the limitation is for financial reasons \u2014 i.e., financial dependency in fact no longer exists at some point \u2014 and is performed at the initial determination of dependency. We therefore are bound to follow [Broadwood], despite some of the language in Canton Plumbing [and Heating v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Robbins), 135 Pa.Commw. 641, 582 A.2d 90 (1990)].\nClaws Refuse, 164 Pa.Commw. at 431, 643 A.2d at 746.\nIn this case, as the majority notes, Claimant\u2019s average monthly income was $1,322.00, while her average monthly expenses were $1,400.00, including monthly mortgage payments on the vacation home which ranged from $193.79 to $387.58. As of October 1994, when the mortgage on the vacation home should have been paid in full, Claimant\u2019s expenses would no longer be greater than her income, and as such, any benefits awarded under the majority\u2019s analysis should have been limited to the period of the mortgage.",
