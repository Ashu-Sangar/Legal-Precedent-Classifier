Petrisko, was arrested in Allegheny County on the charge of murder. He was arraigned before a committing magistrate the following day and held without bail for trial. On January 17, 1968, the grand jury <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>returned a true bill. On June 27, 1968, Petrisko, not having been tried on the indictment, filed a petition for discharge from imprisonment under the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, §54, as amended, Act of December 1, 1959, P. L. 1671, §1, 19 P.S. §781. From the lower court’s order denying the petition after hearing, this appeal was filed. We affirm.</p>

      <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>The record discloses that before the petition for discharge was filed, trial of the case was scheduled on two different occasions, but continued. While it does not appear that these postponements were “on the application or with the assent of” Petrisko, it is clear that a petition filed by Petrisko, pro se, to suppress certain evidence, and subsequent motions filed on his behalf by counsel to quash the indictment, suppress evidence and for the appointment of a psychiatrist did play a major part in delaying the trial beyond the six month statutory period. In fact, the last mentioned motions were filed on June 10, 1968, the very day the case was listed for trial the second time. The filing of these motions, a hearing thereon and disposition thereof prevented the case from proceeding to trial as scheduled. Under the circumstances, the court below did not err in refusing the petition for discharge. Where the delay in bringing the issue to trial within the six month period is due to the actions of the accused, he is not entitled to discharge under the Act of 1860.</p>
