Appellee, John McShain, Inc., was to undertake the construction. Appellee John McShain controls both Country Club Estates and the building corporation bearing his name. Appellees filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings alleging, inter alia, that appellants had failed to plead an enforceable contract. The court below agreed that no enforceable contract had been pleaded, thus concluding that appellants were entitled to neither equitable relief nor damages at law. However, instead of granting appellees’ motion and dismissing the complaint, the chancellor certified the case to the law side for the limited purpose of allowing appellants, if they could, to prove a case for restitution: the return of moneys allegedly expended by appellants in contemplation of the theater project. From this decision the present appeal has been taken.</p>

However, this rule flows not from the mere fact that a case has been certified from one court to another, but from the fact that this certification still leaves open the possibility that the appealing party might eventually be made whole, i.e., that a court of law may award sufficient money damages to substitute for the equitable relief held unavailable. In short, the certification is but an interlocutory order.</p>

Unlike the normal certification of a contract case to the law side for damages in assumpsit on the <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>contract, here we are presented with a decision by the chancellor that there was <em>no </em>contract at all—that there could be no relief ex contractu, equitable or legal. To the extent that appellants entered court seeking relief on their alleged contract, they were turned away with absolutely nothing. The chancellor made all the findings necessary to dismiss appellants’ complaint, and had he done so his order would unquestionably have been appealable. That, almost as an afterthought, the chancellor told appellants that they could seek restitution for out of pocket expenses in no way alters the effect of his order; and that effect is to put appellants completely out of court vis-a-vis <em>this </em>lawsuit. Even had the chancellor granted appellees’ motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the complaint, appellants could still have pursued their restitution remedy, since it would not be dependent on the contract as initially pleaded. Thus, the certification Avas in a real sense but a legal gesture.</p>

Late in 1963 William Goldman, an operator of motion picture theaters, and John McShain, a builder and owner of the subject property, began discussing the possibility of erecting a motion picture theater on part of McShain’s tract known as “Presidential Center” a ninety acre parcel located at the intersection of two heavily travelled Philadelphia arteries. In March of the following year, McShain drew this document which was signed by both parties:</p>

McShain agreed to pay all additional construction costs, as well as all taxes on the property. Once the theater was built, Goldman agreed to rent <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>it for 25 years, paying McShain a rental based upon a percentage of gross receipts. Finally, the parties agreed to review the undertaking after one year and submit disputes to a designated arbitrator.</p>
    <p id="b115-3" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[191,624,1148,1145]]]'>About the same time as this agreement was signed, Goldman and McShain jointly hired an architect to design the theater itself. However, during the next year many complications arose concerning the possibility of condemnations by the city for new roads which would, if built, bisect appellees’ tract. Although these complications were eventually settled, it was not until October, 1965 that final plans were completed by the architect. In the meantime, both parties were exchanging numerous letters and partial plans. Appellants allege that these documents, taken together, show agreement on certain elements of the venture not specifically mentioned in the March, 1964 writing; viz., exact location of the theater on the tract, size and location of parking facilities, final plans for the theater building itself. Finally, a large sign was erected on the tract announcing the construction of the theater, and on November 12, 1965 a formal ground breaking ceremony was held. Thereafter, however, MeShain refused to continue the project and eventually this lawsuit was commenced.</p>

The chancellor reached this conclusion largely on the basis of findings that the parties failed to reach agreement on parking, final plans and theater location. The chancellor also relied heavily on a thirty page detailed lease which was sent by Goldman’s attorney to McShain but never signed by appellee. This, the court concluded, established that the March memorandum was never intended to be a <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>binding contract; instead, the lease alone was to signal the start of binding obligations; since that lease was never signed by McShain, no such obligations arose.</p>

However, in holding as a matter of law that appellants failed to <em>plead </em>a valid contract, we think the court below erred. This Court has long recognized the principle that documents, having the surface appearance of contracts may be in fact evidence of mere negotiating by parties with a view toward executing a binding contract in the future. Should this be the case, of course, such documents cannot form the basis for recovery. See, e.g., <em>Essner v.

This is so because the motion for judgment on the pleadings is in the nature of a demurrer, and as such is adjudicated upon the assumption that all of the opposing party’s (in this case Goldman’s) well-pleaded allegations are true; moreover, only specifically admitted facts may be used against him. Thus, in the present <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>case, even though McShain alleged in his answer that no agreement had been reached on parking, theater location, or final plans, since Goldman alleged the contrary we must assume in passing on McShain’s motion that agreement <em>had </em>been reached on these matters.</p>

Goldman’s reply to the new matter categorically denies that the lease embodied the only true contract; instead appellants allege that the lease was merely intended to formalize the previous agreement of March, 1964 which agreement by itself was enforceable. Section 26 of the Restatement of Contracts specifically recognizes that parties may bind themselves contractually although they intend, at some later date, to draft a more formal document: “Mutual manifestations of assent that are in themselves sufficient to make a contract will not be prevented from so operating by the mere fact that the parties also manifest an intention to prepare and adopt a written memorial thereof; . . Restatement, Contracts §26. Even more significant at least for purposes of this decision, is the comment to section 26 of the Restatement which recites that <em>oral testimony </em>is usually required to determine whether the parties did or did not intend the formal document to be the only binding agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>Because the intent of the parties in cases such as this so often turns upon disputed questions of fact, it is only the very rare case which can be decided upon pleadings alone. Although appellees cite two such decisions, neither can be said to control the present controversy. In <em>Upsal St. Realty Co. v.

In holding that the defendant was entitled to a judgment on the pleadings this Court was very careful to note that the alleged lease set up by plaintiff as creating binding legal obligations could not have been intended as a real lease since it was specifically captioned “Application For Lease.” The instrument was nothing more than a form which prospective tenants filled out indicating how much they would pay for an apartment and for how long they intended to rent. Other than this, however, the application contained merely information about the prospective tenant upon which the landlord would decide whether to rent the premises to the applicant. In fact, the application stated, inter alia, that the selection of colors for the apartment would be made only “after the lease is signed.” By contrast, it is not at all clear from the pleadings in the present case that Goldman and McShain did not consummate a binding agreement. Only a trial can uncover this crucial fact.</p>

Hahn, </em><a href="/pa/419/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="419 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1896852" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0042-01">419 Pa. 42</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20342" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="213 A.2d 342">213 A. 2d 342</a> (1965), Mr. Justice Jones noted that only certain statutes of frauds could be raised by preliminary <em>objections; </em>others could be raised only as new matter since they are affirmative defenses which must be pleaded and proven. In distinguishing between the two types of statutes, Mr. Justice Jones stated: “Bearing in mind that the provisions of the several Statutes of Frauds differ in that language and that provisions of some Statutes of Frauds make unenforceable or void oral agreements in violation thereof while provisions of other Statutes of Frauds constitute declarations of public policy, the appropriate rule is that, if the particular statute operates to bar or destroy the plaintiff’s right of action, i.e., is a limitation on the power of the judiciary to afford a remedy, such statute constitutes a ground for demurrer and may be raised by preliminary objections: on the other hand, if the statute merely gives the defendant a waivable defense, such defense must be raised under Rule 1030 [new matter] and not under Rule 1017(b) [preliminary objections].” <a href="/pa/419/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="419 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1896852" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0042-01">419 Pa. at 49</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20342" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="213 A.2d 342">213 A. 2d at 345-46</a>. <em>Brown </em>holds that the Statute of Frauds requiring a writing for land contracts (Act of March 21, 1772, 1 Sm. L. 389, 33 P.S. §1) is of the second type, i.e., it creates a waivable defense and must be raised as new matter, not by preliminary objections. Since appellees in the present case are also relying on this particular Statute of Frauds, <em>Brown </em>controls so long as, on this issue, a motion for judgment on the pleadings equates with preliminary objections. We agree with appellants that such an equation does exist.</p>

      <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>We held in <em>London v. Kingsley, </em><a href="/pa/368/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="368 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1230332" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0109-01">368 Pa. 109</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.2d%20870" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="81 A.2d 870">81 A. 2d 870</a> (1951), that “A motion for judgment on the pleadings is in effect a demurrer.” This notion is reinforced by the comments to Pa. E. C. P. 1034 appearing at 1 Goodrich-Amram, Standard Pennsylvania Practice 243-44 where the authors state, inter alia, that the motion for summary judgment affords defendant another opportunity, in addition to a preliminary objection, to challenge the sufficiency of a complaint. This similarity between preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and the motion for judgment on the pleadings also gains support from the fact that in both cases the trial judge must accept as true all facts properly pleaded by the opposing party. When the defendant moves for summary judgment therefore, he is merely alleging that plaintiff’s complaint has not stated a claim upon Avhich relief may be granted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> See also Pa. E. C. P. 1032(1).</p>

In the present case, however, appellants’ reply to appellees’ new matter <em>specifically denies </em>that the statute of frauds controls. Moreover to say that a possible affirmative defense exists to a complaint is not to say that such a complaint is legally insufficient on its face. It may still <em>state </em>a claim upon which relief can be granted, even though the relief itself will eventually be denied should defendant prove his affirmative defense. Surely, for example, we would not hold that a complaint in trespass failed to state a <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>claim upon which relief could be granted simply because the defendant’s new matter raised the defense of contributory negligence. To prevail, defendant would still have to <em>prove </em>that defense at trial or somehow succeed in having plaintiff admit it in his own pleadings. The result is no different here. Appellees have raised the statute of frauds in their new matter and appellants have denied its applicability. Issue has thus been joined; its resolution cannot be based on pleadings alone.</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[211,950,1151,1094]]]'>Appellees next contend that relief must be denied because the contract is too vague for a court of equity to grant specific performance and that should the court so attempt it would burden the chancellor to an extent not accepted under equitable doctrines. While we recognize the principle that equity will not grant specific performance unless the contract be clear and unless the performance ordered can be supervised without placing undue burdens on the court, we would be loath to hold that equity must stay its hand on this ground even <em>before </em>the chancellor has heard any testimony. Of course, having permitted the issues to be fully litigated, the court below may then conclude that no enforceable contract ever existed. Or it may conclude that there was a contract but that equity could not enforce it specifically due to the complex nature of its terms. In that case certification to the law side for damages may be in order. But on a motion for summary judgment, given these pleadings we do not think appellants may be put out of court.</p>

Whether either party intended the continued life of the arbitrator to be a condition prece<a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>dent to enforceability of the agreement is a matter of fact which must be settled at trial, especially in view of appellants’ denial that snch intention ever existed.</p>
    <p id="b123-3" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[168,574,1148,589]]]'>There remains, finally, one additional matter to discuss in connection with this case, a dispute concerning the lis pendens indexed against McShain’s property. The lis pendens as originally indexed covered all of Presidential Center; however the area covered was later limited to the proposed theater site plus land to be used for parking. Of course, when the chancellor determined that appellants had failed to plead an enforceable contract, the court below ordered the amended lis pendens stricken. Appellants now urge this Court to reinstate it.</p>
    <p id="b123-4" data-blocks='[["BL_123.5",123,[167,1185,1148,869]]]'>Appellees counter with the proposition that the lis pendens was never properly entered in the first place since appellants failed to get court approval before filing with the prothonotary a praecipe to index lis pendens. We agree with appellants that such prior court approval was not necessary. The Act of June 15, 1871, P. L. 387, §1, as amended, 17 P.S. §1908, directs that whenever any proceedings have been commenced “by which purchasers of real estate would be deemed to have had constructive notice <em>... it shall be the duty </em>of the several prothonotaries ... to enter the same upon” the proper court index. (Emphasis supplied.) This mandatory directive to the prothonotary would certainly not appear to be the kind of act for which prior court approval was required by the Legislature.</p>
