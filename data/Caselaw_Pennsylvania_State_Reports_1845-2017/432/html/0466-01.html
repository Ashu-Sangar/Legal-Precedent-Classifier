As a result, appellant had leased from his employer two garages to be used for storage. The key to the garages was on appellant’s key ring.</p>

She offered the key to the garages to the police officer; the key, not just a symbolic expression of permission to enter, but the actual power to enter. And the bestowal of this means of access was not reluctant. It came not in response to a command, or even a request. It was offered without condition, — even with a statement that a search warrant was not necessary.</p>

Cf. <em>Katz v. United States, </em><a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">389 U.S. 347</a>, <a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">88 S. Ct. 507</a> (1967). Property has no rights, no privacy. Persons do. So, in deciding whether the appellant’s constitutional rights were impinged upon, we must consider the gravity of the invasion upon <em>Ms </em>privacy. What was the nature of the appellant’s privacy here? He had the power of control over the premises, and indeed, it was a pervasive power, a broad power. But it was not absolute. For in the garage was furniture which belonged jointly to the appellant and his wife. Although the lease agreement did not mention the appellant’s wife, the facts reveal that the appellant “had no intention of excluding his wife either from the garages or from the <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>goods and furniture stored there.” Hence, the appellant’s privacy gave him the right to exclude vast numbers, perhaps the whole world,—all except his wife. But she too had rights and powers with respect to the garages; she could permit her friends, her neighbors, and her family to go there. And she could also allow the police to enter and search it.</p>

      <em>Stoner </em>invalidates, as violative of the Fourth Amendment, a search of a defendant’s hotel room, initiated with thq consent of a hotel clerk.

Once within the house, they seized 1300 gallons of mash. The Government did not maintain that the search and seizure met Fourth Amendment approval because of an implied consent or waiver by the accused-tenant. Obviously there was none. Rather it argued that the search and seizure were valid because of an independent right in the landlord to enter the premises when he had good reason to suspect that the demised dwelling was being used for unlawful purposes.</p>

      <em>Kata </em>indicates that the proper focus in this case is whether the search was unconstitutionally intrusive <em>as to appellant, </em>not as to the building involved. Thus the fact that appellant’s wife could legally enter the building or admit others does not mean that the police could enter and search for <em>appellant’s </em>property without obtaining a search warrant. The majority relies on factors such as appellant’s wife’s ownership in furniture in the garages. I find it rather odd for appellant’s right to be free from a warrantless search to depend on whether his wife’s ottoman was on the premises. Under the majority’s theory of “rights and powers” I have to assume that if appellant and his wife held property as tenants by the entireties, she could consent to a search against her husband, but if the property was held in his name alone, she could not. I cannot see how the majority can insist that it is not hinging appellant’s constitutional rights to his wife’s property rights while emphasizing that it is holding the search valid because the wife had furniture on the premises. This is exactly the kind of distinction that <em>Kata </em>held to be unacceptable.</p>

The Court in <em>Stoner </em>stated: “It is important to bear in mind that it was <em>petitioner’s constitutional right </em>which was at stake here, and not the night clerk’s nor the hotel’s. It was a right, therefore, which <em>only the petitioner could waive </em>by word or deed, either directly or through an agent.” <a href="/us/376/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="376 U.S. 483" data-case-ids="379537" data-case-paths="/us/376/0483-01">376 U.S. at 489</a>, 84 S.

The Court went on to explicitly reject the notion that the right of a person to enter upon certain premises carried with it the right to permit <em>police to </em>also so enter, stating that “when a person engages a hotel room he undoubtedly gives ‘implied or express permission’ to ‘such persons as maids, janitors or repairmen’ to enter his room ‘in the performance of their duties.’ . . .

      <em>Stoner </em>reaffirmed and elaborated on <em>Chapman, </em>which I believe the majority also has misread. The majority states that <em>Chapman </em>was based on the government’s failure “to establish the landlord’s right under Georgia law to enter. . . .” This is not entirely accurate. Although the Court did note that it could find no Georgia cases to support the government’s position, it als'o had to meet the government’s argument that the landlord had a general common law right to <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>enter. To this contention, the Court replied, inter alia, that to allow this argument to prevail would leave tenants’ Fourth Amendment rights at the discretion of their landlords.

Certainly the mere existence of a marriage does not create an agency agreement under which a spouse may consent to a search and seizure of the other spouse’s property. The folly of permitting a husband’s rights to turn on whether a wife has an independent right to enter the property is emphasized by the case in which the wife is working hand-in-glove with the police because she is angry at her husband.
