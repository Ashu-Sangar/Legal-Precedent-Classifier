On May 2, 1968, Mrs. Beichner petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Beaver County for the removal of both Mrs. Groom and Mrs. Larson as executrices and the appointment of a corporate administrator in their stead. Her petition averred, inter alia: (a) that the executrices had not filed an inventory or a statement of debts and deductions and had not paid the transfer <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>inheritance tax; (b) that the claims against the estate, to petitioner’s knowledge, amount to approximately $5500 included in which are estimated fees for the executrices and attorneys of $1297 which it is claimed are excessive; (c) that executrices contracted an excessive funeral bill of $1,938.70; (d) that Beichner had told petitioner that he had a life insurance policy, wherein the named beneficiary was Mrs. Larson, earmarked for payment of funeral expenses which Mrs. Larson had agreed to pay out of the proceeds of the policy but which she now refuses to pay, contending the insurance proceeds were a gift from decedent; (e) that Mrs. Larson, a registered nurse, has presented two claims against the estate, one for $2,470 for private duty nursing plus medication and the other for $100 for injections for the petitioner, which claims “are with the cooperation of” Mrs. Groom; (f) that the executrices have charged petitioner with concealing and disposing of estate assets and have disclosed “a fixed enmity toward her”; (g) that an “unfriendly feeling exists between the [executrices] and [Mrs. Beichner] through no fault of” [the petitioner].</p>

Mrs. Groom thereafter filed a supplemental answer setting forth that Mrs. Grooms’ counsel had now received the executor’s deed and an agreement had been concluded providing for handling the proceeds of the real estate sale pending the decree of distribution thereof by the court and that arrangements had now been made for her to enter the premises occupied by petitioner to take an inventory of the personal assets and furniture therein.</p>

Therefore, the propriety of her removal and any conflict of interests on Mrs. Larson’s part are not before the Court.</p>

These personal representatives were not selected by the Register of Wills but by the testator himself. In <em>Matheus’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/322/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="322 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1167882" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0358-01">322 Pa. 358</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20768" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="185 A. 768">185 A. 768</a> (1936), this Court said: “A testator has, as a property right, the privilege and power to place the management of his estate in a selected person as a condition of his bounty.” (p. 359).

In this connection, it is well to note that the status of a testamentary executor or trustee is not the same as that of a trustee or administrator appointed by the court. See: <em>Crawford’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/340/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="340 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="1203362" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0187-01">340 Pa. 187</a>, 190, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.2d%20521" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="16 A.2d 521">16 A. 2d 521</a> (1940); <em>Corr Estate, </em>supra, 598. A testamentary executor or trustee is one whose choice was made by the person whose estate was to be administered and managed and represents an expression of trust and confidence in the person or persons so selected; an administrator appointed by the Register of Wills represents not the choice of the decedent nor are the person or <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>persons appointed those in whom, necessarily, the decedent placed trust and confidence.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[235,520,1149,1029]]]'>That an Orphans’ Court possesses the power to remove an executor is clear beyond question. See: Fiduciaries Act of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, art. 111, §331, 20 P.S. §320.331. Insofar as presently pertinent, section 331 provides: “The Court shall have exclusive power to remove a personal representative when he— (1) ... has failed to perform any duty imposed by law; or . . . (5) when, for any other reason, the interests of the estate are likely to be jeopardized by his continuance in office.” While, under that statutory provision, orphans’ courts do have the power of removal of personal representatives and such removal lies largely within the discretion of such courts, an abuse of such discretion renders its exercise subject to appellate review. Cf. <em>Fraiman </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/408/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="408 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="1308365" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0442-01">408 Pa. 442</a>, 449, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.2d%20494" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="184 A.2d 494">184 A. 2d 494</a> (1962) and authorities therein cited. Our present inquiry is whether the court below abused its discretion in the removal of Mrs. Groom; our conclusion is that it did.</p>

To justify the removal of a testamentary personal representative the proof of the cause for such removal must be clear. <em>Glessner's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/343/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="343 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1208400" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0370-01">343 Pa. 370</a>, 373, 374, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.2d%20701" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="22 A.2d 701">22 A. 2d 701</a> (1941). In <em>Parson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/82/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="82 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1047980" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0465-01">82 Pa. 465</a>, 467 (1876), Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Sharswood, speaking for this Court, stated: “It is a . . . stringent and summary process to remove an executor, and it must clearly appear from the evidence that a case was made out under it, and that the discretion of the court was properly exercised. It must clearly appear that the executor is ‘wasting or mismanaging the property or <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>estate under his charge, or that for any reason the interests of the estate or property are likely to be jeopardized by the continuance of such executor.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[180,575,1150,1043]]]'>The only cause assigned for Mrs. Groom’s removal by the court below was that animosity existed between Mrs. Groom and her stepmother, Mrs. Beichner, such cause being shown only by an admission in the pleadings. Such animosity may have arisen, as it too often and unfortunately does, because Mrs. Beichner was the second wife and Mrs. Groom a daughter of the first wife or it might have arisen through the fault of Mrs. Beichner or Mrs. Groom; nothing of record indicates <em>why </em>the animosity existed. Moreover, there is not a scintilla of evidence on this record that indicates that, assuming this animosity to exist, the estate is being mismanaged or wasted or that such animosity has jeopardized the estate or the interest therein of Mrs. Beichner. Animosity <em>per se, </em>absent any showing of any adverse effect on the estate or the rights of any beneficiary by reason of such animosity, does not constitute a ground for removal of an executor in whom the testator placed trust and confidence.</p>

In reaching such conclusion the court below placed its reliance on <em>Rafferty Estate, </em><a href="/pa/377/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="377 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="1249633" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0304-01">377 Pa. 304</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.2d%20147" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="105 A.2d 147">105 A. 2d 147</a> (1954) and <em>Wogan’s Estate, </em>8 Fid. Rep. 116. In <em>Rafferty, </em>the executor clearly had interests which conflicted with his fiduciary duties, i.e., personal claims to alleged estate assets, and the animosity between the beneficiaries and the executor was not <em>per se </em>the ground for his removal. In <em>Wogan, </em>the court found as facts that the executor <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>had failed to account for a savings account, a stock account and had misrepresented certain doctor bills.

We recognize that Mrs. Groom and her co-executrix had failed to file an inventory or a statement of debts and deductions or pay the transfer inheritance tax, failures which Mrs. Groom attempted to account for in her answer to the removal petition. Such failures could have been promptly rectified by action on the part of Mrs. Beichner’s counsel had the executrices been cited to file an inventory, etc. For some unexplained reason such remedies were not resorted to.</p>
