See: <em>Gather-wood Trust, </em>supra, at p. 68. However, unless an item is “income”, an accumulation thereof is neither illegal nor unlawful. In this posture, we must, therefore, initially, determine whether, <em>when these dividends were received, </em>such dividends were deemed income or principal in deciding what, <em>if any, </em>impact the accumulations statute had on these dividend distributions. In <em>Maris Estate, </em>supra (1930), the testator, providing for the division of his residuary estate into three parts upon the life tenant’s death, stated that “all stock dividends consisting of shares of stock of the corporation issuing them shall be considered as principal.” This Court, concluding that such a testamentary provision did violate the Act Against Accumulations, supra, stated: “No one can be permitted to set aside the public policy of the State by the simple expedient of designating by another name that which the courts have repeatedly decided to be income” (p. 23). Hoavever, the <em>Maris </em>Court clearly indicated that its ruling Avas dictated by the fact that, <em>at that time, </em>the Pennsylvania Rule of Apportionment (now abolished by <em>Catherwood) </em>was in effect. Illustrative that such apportionment rule motivated the result is the following language from <em>Maris </em>(pp. 24, 25) : “This provision, so far as the items now in controversy are concerned, runs counter to <em>our established rule of property </em>that such dividends, earned after the death of the testator, which do not decrease the intact value of the stock as of that date, are <em>income,—a rule </em>that cannot be avoided, as presently attempted, by, under a testamentary direction, treating dividends which would otherwise be considered income, as principal, if, as here, the result of that course is to im<a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>pinge on the act against accumulations. This being the case, despite testator’s direction that all stock dividends shall be considered as principal, those here involved remain income; and, since this income is in effect ordered to be unlawfully accumulated, it becomes presently distributable. The law was correctly so held, under somewhat similar circumstances, in Wentz’s Est., <a href="/pa-d-c/12/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="12 Pa.

See: <em>McEldowney, </em>supra, <em>Norvel, </em>supra, <em>Reznor, </em>supra, and Arrott, <a href="/pa/421/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="421 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="1900273" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0275-01">supra.</a> In <em>Norvell, </em>supra, Mr. Justice Roberts, speaking for this Court, said (pp. 433, 434, 435) : “We are therefore led to the question whether the Legislature possesses eon<a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>stitutional authority to define income.

The eminent Professor Austin W. Scott well states: “The Pennsylvania legislature was not satisfied with the decision in Maris’s Estate. By the Act of May 25, 1939, P. L. 201, it is provided that in trusts becoming effective thereafter provisions directing that extraordinary dividends in stock or cash should be treated, in whole or in part, either as principal or income, should be valid and enforceable. Thereafter the Estates Act of 1947, §6, was amended to provide that a direction or authorization to apply to principal in whole or in part extraordinary dividends should be valid.

It would be unwise to make the legality of a direction by the settlor to allocate to principal what would otherwise be presumed to be income depend upon the time of the creation of the trusts, whether before 1939, before 1945 or 1947, before 1956, before 1963, or thereafter.

There is no policy today which would preclude him from directing that small as well as large stock dividends should be allocated to principal. Where the settlor has a . large or controlling interest in a corporation, it might be disastrous if the trustees were to lose control by compelling them to disregard the settlor’s expressed intention by distributing stock dividends to the income beneficiary. See Haas Trust, 37 D. &amp; C. 2d 593.
