    <p id="b500-6" data-blocks='[["BL_500.8",500,[196,951,1146,427]]]'>On June 15, 1917, Herbert DuPuy (settlor) created an inter vivos trust for the benefit of a granddaughter, Amy McHenry, who is now living and 52 years of age. Under the terms of that, trust, in the event of Amy McHenry’s death without issue living at the time of her death, the remaindermen were settlor’s three children, including Eleanor Merrick, their heirs and assigns.</p>

Some time thereafter, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue notified the executors of the completion of the audit of the tax return and that he intended to assess a federal estate tax deficiency in the amount of approximately $2,656,-000. One of the alleged errors upon which the Commissioner predicated the deficiency was the failure of the executors to include in the gross estate the amount of $1,731,904.04 which the Commissioner had determined was the value of Eleanor Merrick’s interest in the inter vivos trust when she died.</p>

    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[161,517,1147,596]]]'>About eight months after notification of the alleged tax deficiency, the executors petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County for a declaratory judgment to establish the value of Mrs. Merrick’s interest in the inter vivos trust, which the executors alleged was none. The United States Government (Government) filed preliminary objections in the declaratory judgment proceedings averring that the declaratory judgment petition did not present an actual justiciable controversy and that another available and more appropriate remedy existed.</p>

After discontinuance of its appeal, the Government then proceeded to accept the decree and to enter into the merits of the controversy. Approximately ten months later the Government changed its tactics and asked the court below to reconsider the original decree and from the refusal to so reconsider this appeal was taken.</p>
