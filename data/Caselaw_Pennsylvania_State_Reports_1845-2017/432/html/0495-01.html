Plaintiff, an employee of Green, was injured when a large crate containing heavy glass fell upon him while unloading a truck. The crates of glass had been loaded and braced by American and transported on a truck of Lyons Transportation Lines, Inc. (found not liable by the jury below) to the consignee, Green.</p>
    <p id="b545-8" data-blocks='[["BL_545.11",545,[188,1737,1148,653]]]'>Plaintiff’s apparent theory was that due to improper loading and bracing the load shifted into an unstable position during transit and then fell during unloading. We have, however, searched the record and have not found any evidence describing the manner in which the accident occurred, or how the improper loading caused the injury. In order to carry his burden of proving defendant negligent, plaintiff must prove what did happen. Since plaintiff had no knowledge of what happened and there were no other eyewitnesses present, the case rested on the existence of expert testimony given by plaintiff’s expert witness.</p>

      <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>However, plaintiff’s expert witness did not testify as to how the accident happened, nor that in his opinion the accident happened in a described manner. He would not unqualifiedly say how the accident occurred. Instead, he used such words as “feasible”, “could”, “possible”, and “within the realm of reason.” We have often said that such opinion evidence falls below the required standard of proof and is not sufficient to satisfy plaintiff’s burden of convincing the factfinder. <em>Florig v.

Even the majority acknowledges <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>that the truck carrying the crates had been <em>improperly </em>loaded. The problem confronting the lower court was a factual one and the judge properly submitted the issue of liability to the jury which on a proper charge found for appellee. Appellee’s expert engineer testified that the crates were loaded at an angle from which they would necessarily be able to fall only in the direction of one engaged in unloading the crates, since the sides of the trailer prevented their falling outward. The jury chose to accept this evidence offered by appellee, and this evidence without doubt sustains its verdict.</p>

The facts are for the jury in any case, whether based on <em>direct or circumstantial </em>evidence where a reasonable conclusion can be arrived at which would place liability on the defendant. . . . The right of a litigant to have the jury pass upon the facts is not to be foreclosed just because the judge believes that a reasonable man might properly find either way.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
