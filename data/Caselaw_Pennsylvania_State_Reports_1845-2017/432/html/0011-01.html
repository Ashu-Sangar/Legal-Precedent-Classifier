Charles Holton was arrested for these crimes and eventually was convicted by a jury of assault and battery, aggravated assault and battery, assault and battery with intent to ravish, rape, and larceny. Post-trial motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial were denied, following which an aggregate prison sentence of 21% to 43 years was imposed. On appeal the Superior Court affirmed without opinion. Judge Hope-man filed a dissenting opinion. See <a href="/pa-super/209/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="209 Pa.

Now you don’t have a lawyer, so you still don’t have to make a statement. But if you want a lawyer you will either get one at a hearing tomorrow morning. ... If you care not to make a statement now, don’t make it.” Holton was then taken downstairs to a cafeteria for a cup of coffee and minutes later, upon being returned to the “interview room,” he orally admitted his guilt.

During the return trip Holton’s condition was such that the accompanying police officers stopped at a bar and got him a glass of wine; (6) On the morning of April 8th, a physician at the Detention Center of the Philadelphia Prison system, after examining Holton, concluded that he was “a chronic alcoholic who has had several episodes of d.t.’s” and directed that he be placed on the center’s “alcohol withdrawal regime,” which included, inter alia, the consumption of medicine three times a day to arrest the withdrawal incidents; (7) On April 9th, a consulting psychiatrist of the Philadelphia Prison system saAV Holton and diagnosed and described his condition as folloAVS: “In the state of withdrawal from alcohol ....

A jury of his peers, after hearing evidence for a week, rendered a verdict that established that the defendant, in the middle of the night, broke into a house, terrified a woman in bed by suddenly appearing before her with a knife which he placed to her neck and threatened to slit her throat unless she submitted to his bestial lust. He violated her carnally, gagged her, and then trussed her up with wire like a sheep prepared for slaughter, stole and made away with valuable articles in the house, leaving his victim in a state which could have caused her death from strangulation or from bleeding.

The disabling infirmity of the Majority Opinion is that it takes its facts from the defendant’s account, wholly ignoring that in appeals the appellate court accepts its facts from the side which has predominated in the verdict, here, the Commonwealth.

J. DeBenedetto, one of the officers who interrogated the defendant at the Police Administration Building, testified that the defendant “made no complaint of being ill.” Of course, here he means illness in a serious sense. Obviously the defendant was not happy. He was in the hands of the law after his horrible crime. He had broken into a home in the middle of the night, he had threatened to kill a woman, he had violently raped that woman, he had tied her up with wire in such a fashion that she could have died, he had committed burglary, and now he knew that the time had come to pay the fiddler for the dance he had danced.

In refuting the defendant’s claims of being ill, what else would the police testimony be but of a negative nature? If A says he has a leg off and B testifies, “I didn’t see any leg off,” this is what the Majority would call testimony of a negative nature, but would the Majority say that it was not a contradiction of the no-leg assertion? Perhaps it might not be, under the style of reasoning adopted in the Majority Opinion which, the more one reflects on it, as against the stark realities of the transcript, one cannot help but recommend it to lawyers as a conversation piece to discuss at bar association dinners when all other shop talk has dimmed into nocturnal innocuous lassitude.</p>

No, he did not. Q. Now, you told Mr. Segal (defense attorney) that he told you he was ill. What did he say? A. The conversation relative to being ill is an incident about ulcers.

Detective Mulhern, as above indicated, had an ulcer and he offered Holton a shot of Milanda, which the defendant imbibed and admitted that it eased his stomach. The trivial character of Holton’s hypochondriacal ulcer became quite evident when he testified that, prior to his involvement in this crime, he had been to see a doctor and the doctor told him he <em>“might </em>have an ulcer.” After that one visit to a doctor, Holton never went back.

As soon as Holton arrived at the police station, he sat down to a meal of hamburger, coleslaw, potato salad, bread, butter and coffee. Ask ulcer patients how they would feel after that kind of a gastronomical mishmash churning in their abraded intestines! Not long after this hamburger-coleslaw special, Holton drank more coffee. Later the police took him to a cafeteria where he could order what he pleased. Still later this much-suffering defendant (in the maternally-solicitous eyes of the Majority) drank more coffee and then he was given a glass of wine which he downed with relish. What kind of cheating would ulcerated patients have to commit on their doctors to drink wine? What the Majority is trying to say in its Opinion, although it does not actually form the words, is that Holton was a victim of “police brutality.” And, against that concept, <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>I would register boundless protest. Even reading Holton’s own account, one sees that he was treated with consideration, dignity and respect. The police gave him cigarettes, they allowed him maximum freedom of physical movement.</p>

Physical pain of itself does not impede the function of recollection, nor does it disturb factworthy narrative. A sprained ankle does not cripple truth nor does a bellyache knot the tongue.

Even the defendant did not say he was relentlessly questioned. “Belentless questioning” suggests a browbeating, badgering, domineering, menacing, dictatorial interrogation with the interrogatees not being allowed to explain.

There is no evidence what he did on April 6th, but the record is complete of his actions on April 7th. He wasn’t so sick that he had to remain in bed that day. He was standing on the street conversing with acquaintances and carrying on in the normal fashion of a healthy person. Invited into a police car, he went willingly, and we have seen how he conducted himself at the Police Administration Building. His appetite was elephantine and his thirst was camel-like. The Majority sets great store by the fact that he sweated. His enormous intake of liquids would suggest that the perspiration glands had to help out on the outtake.</p>

Here we have four continuous days of uninhibited physical activity on the part of the defendant, and yet the Majority would now have the world believe that for the few moments that he described what he had done on April 5th, he was too sick to talk.</p>

What reasons does the Majority assign in support of its conclusions of Holton’s incapacity? The Majority enumerates those reasons and, among them, it lists the following blatant, inane, preposterous propositions, namely, Holton drank a great deal of water, he took an antacid pill during the questioning, he lay on the floor for a few minutes <em>after </em>he had admitted his crime, he drank a glass of wine. If these reasons were given by a tobacco-chewing, cracker barrel, illiterate expositor as explanation for physical and mental incapacitation, one would dismiss the exposition as drivel.

It is not strange to learn that he was nervous and agitated. That’s the kind of person Holton probably is. We will recall that the victim testified that during the perpetration of his unspeakable deed he was “agitated.” The wolf that kills a sheep is agitated when he sinks his teeth into the neck of his prey, and he undoubtedly is even more agitated when the shepherd or farmer blasts away at him with a shotgun.</p>
