The weather was cold and clear, it was dark, and there was snow along the sides of the road. Plaintiff’s parked vehicle had its parking lights on.

Plaintiff testified that upon his return from work he noticed that his left rear tire was going flat. He testified that the tire could not have been changed at the place where the car now was parked, so he began to drive to a service station. However, he quickly realized that the tire was completely flat, and he therefore pulled the car over to the right side of the road in order to fix the tire. Plaintiff admitted that he had a clear vision for 1,000 feet but did not see the defendant until defendant was a few feet away, at which time he saw a flash of light just before he was hit.</p>

Moreover, it is important to remember that neither a jury nor a judge who sees and hears the witnesses have to believe everything or indeed anything that a plaintiff (or a defendant) or his doctor, or his other witnesses say, even though their testimony is uncontradicted.”</p>

Thus, under the law of the Commonwealth Black was entitled to reimbursement for all medical bills incurred and still to be incurred, compensation for loss of past earnings, remuneration for impairment of earning power, and for pain and suffering. The jury returned a verdict of $3500, which, in comparison to the enormous losses suffered and to be suffered by the plaintiff, was like applying a band aid to a severed pumping artery.</p>

His medical bills amounted to $1,834.20, which will be increased by $1,000 for another operation which the doctors recommend. He lost wages in the amount of $932.64. Thus, his out-of-pocket expenses amounted to $2,806.84.

A jury may not eliminate pain from wounds when all human experience proves the existence of pain, and it may not withhold lost wages when the evidence in the case uncontradictedly establishes the loss of Avages as the result of the negligence which they, the jury, have adjudicated against the responsible defendant.

He pulled over to the side of the road, as far as he could go, there being snow piled on the banks of the highway. However, he and a witness testified that he was actually completely off the road. His parking lights were on, and he bent over to examine the tire. It was a cold December night, and he straightened up momentarily to warm his hands.

The judge should have struck out this wholly prejudicial questioning and lectured the lawyer for employing improper tactics. Instead, the judge did nothing and, in his opinion denying a new trial, said that the reference to the woman was of no consequence. It is a grave mistake to assume that the mention of a woman in any given circumstance can ever be of no consequence.</p>
    <p id="b424-4" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[208,858,1152,1254]]]'>In the case of <em>Bedillion v. Frazee, </em><a href="/pa/408/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="408 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="1308368" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0281-01">408 Pa. 281</a>, we affirmed the granting of a new trial on the basis of an inadequate verdict because defendant’s counsel had intimated, through improper questioning, that the plaintiff might have been on an immoral errand when she was injured. We said: <em>“It </em>is evident from the record, and the lower Court so found, that the inadequate verdict was due to the fact that defendant’s counsel attempted to portray Mrs. Bedillion as a person of loose morals. The jury was led to believe that if on the night of the accident Mrs. Bedillion was bound on a mission which did not appeal to the jury she was not entitled to the damages which might otherwise be due her. Of course, it goes without saying that in a personal injuries case, the jury has no jurisdiction over the morals of the parties except, of course, insofar as they relate to truthfulness and credibility. It wouldn’t matter what Mrs. Bedillion’s intended destination was that night, no one had the right to throw her against a concrete abutment. Even if she were going to a bull fight strictly prohibited by law no motorist could injure her and then be immune from responsibility for his tort.”</p>

After Dr. Harry H. Negley, Jr., Huntingdon County Coroner <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>and a medical witness for the plaintiff, had stated his qualifications, the judge asked him the following: “The Court: Are you a member of the American College of Surgeons? The Witness: No, the International College of Surgeons. The Court: The American College of Surgeons is the most respected and qualified in the United States, is it not? The Witness : Not necessarily so, Your Honor, although it is well recognized. The Court : Isn’t it true that most specialists are members of the American College of Surgeons? The Witness: If I might digress a minute, because you have led me afield—Mr. I. Newton Taylor : Just a minute, Doctor.”</p>
    <p id="b425-4" data-blocks='[["BL_425.4",425,[162,1136,1149,644]]]'>Very few jurors would know the relative merits of the American College of Surgeons as against the International College of Surgeons, but the judge’s queries suggested that Dr. Negley was not a very good doctor since he was not a member of the American College of Surgeons. The judge later instructed the jury to disregard his references to the two surgeon associations but by this time the horse was out of the barn and the bear was out of the tree. By this time it can be doubted if any member of that jury would have wanted Dr. Negley to operate on a stray caterwauling cat.</p>
    <p id="b425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[159,1803,1149,649]]]'>The trial judge allowed two wholly extraneous factors to enter into the case to distract the jury enough to allow them to believe that it was within their authority to reduce, as a matter of punitive determination, the amount of the verdict the plaintiff’s injuries entitled him to. Obviously, this kind of a determination is contrary to the most elementary appreciation of a jury’s duties and responsibilities. It is my view that law, justice and elementary fair play dictate a new trial in this case, without reference to phantom roadside women, stray cats and comparative negligence which does not exist in Pennsylvania law.</p>
