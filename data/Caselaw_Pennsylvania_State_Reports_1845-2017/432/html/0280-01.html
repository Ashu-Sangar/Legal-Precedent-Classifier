    <p id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[168,587,1149,974]]]'>The Commonwealth would have us include a fourth rule: not only may the condemnee not introduce evidence of the number of tons of minerals lost and then multiply that number by a dollar figure, he may not introduce evidence of the number of tons for any reason. The Commonwealth maintains that this is already the law in Pennsylvania and relies on four cases: <em>Searle, Balthaser, Sgarlat </em>and <em>Williams v. Department of Highways, </em><a href="/pa/423/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="423 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="1903185" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0219-01">423 Pa. 219</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%20865" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="223 A.2d 865">223 A. 2d 865</a> (1966). A close reading of these four cases reveals, however, that in each instance, the condemnee multiplied the number of tons by a dollar figure. Therefore, none of these cases answers the precise question before us—whether the condemnee can introduce evidence of the number of tons if he does not multiply that figure by some dollar amount. Our research has not uncovered any case in this Commonwealth dealing with this precise question.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

All of the cases cited to us in the briefs of both parties have held that such evidence is admissible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Sound logic dictates this result. The jury <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>must place itself in the position of a potential purchaser of the tract in question. Snitzer, Pennsylvania Eminent Domain, §603 (1965). Such a purchaser would certainly consider the existence of mineral deposits beneath the surface in arriving at a purchase price. The Commonwealth does not argue with this proposition. In effect, what the Commonwealth maintains is that this potential buyer should not be allowed to know whether there are five tons or 500 tons of sand and gravel below the surface. It is unrealistic to require a potential purchaser, or a jury, to hazard a guess as to the value of a tract of land without knowing the extent of a valuable mineral deposit situated below the surface of the land. If the jury is to make an educated determination of the value of a tract of land, it must know what is below the ground as well as what is on the surface.</p>

This is error for two reasons. First, the minerals may not be valued separately apart from the remainder of the tract. Second, it is impossible to determine how much a ton of sand and gravel will be <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>worth until it has been removed from the earth and processed for market. All we are saying is that a tract of land containing 500 tons of sand and gravel is much more valuable than a tract of land with five tons and the jury has the right to know more than that there is a sand and gravel deposit of unknown quantity below the surface. ■</p>

The lease agreement between the Werners and <em>Mahoning-^introduced into evidence without objection by the Common</em>wealth—provided for a fixed royalty payment per ton.: The Commonwealth does not argue that the lease should not have been admitted; instead it maintains that the jury now had both the number of tons and a dollar figure and that, in effect, this violated the longstanding rule against the introduction of these two items of evidence in combination.</p>

First, the Commonwealth failed to specify exactly which evidence it found objectionable but merely made general allegations that evidence was improperly admitted. Since it is impossible to determine exactly which evidence the Commonwealth is now attacking, we cannot determine whether the Commonwealth preserved its record by objecting to the admission of the evidence at trial. The trial court held that the Commonwealth had failed to object below. Without more specific allegations by the Commonwealth, we cannot upset this finding by the trial court. Second, the decision to apply the integrated use doctrine benefited the Commonwealth. The trial court also excluded evidence which it might have properly admitted concerning the processing plant. Both decisions indicate that the Common<a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>wealth’s interests were more than adequately protected by the trial court. Third, it is by no means certain that evidence concerning the processing plant and the quality of finished sand is not admissible even under the integrated use doctrine. As indicated above, this doctrine is still in its infancy and the outlines of the doctrine have not been spelled out.</p>

The first two instances again involved the integrated use doctrine. The Commonwealth objected when counsel for the appellees asked this question: “Now, we are going to ask you a question and we are going to ask you not to answer it until counsel for the Commonwealth has an opportunity to object. What in your opinion was the fair and reasonable market value of this property used in relation to the property of the Mahoning Yalley Sand Company, the processing plant and including that plant?” The Commonwealth did object, and the objection was sustained. Therefore, the question about which the Commonwealth now complains was never answered. The Commonwealth maintains, however, that this was one of several instances where counsel for the appellees tried to bring the unity of use doctrine into the case after the trial court had specifically ruled that the integrated use doctrine should be applied. This contention must fail. First, again it is not clear that this question was prejudicial to the Commonwealth’s case. The trial court aptly summarized the problem facing him in using a new theory handed down by this Court three months before the trial began: “Since the integrated use doctrine is <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>wholly new and has no guidelines other than the generic language of the Porter case, the course of action of plaintiffs’ counsel relative to questions and evidence concerning integrated use of the two properties was as fair and reasonable under the circumstances as the conduct of the Commonwealth’s counsel who, as has been indicated, urged an unreasonably restrictive application of the doctrine.” Second, the decision to withdraw a juror is within the discretion of the trial court and its refusal to withdraw a juror will be reversed only for a palpable abuse of discretion. <em>Menarde v. Philadelphia, Trans. Co., </em><a href="/pa/376/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="376 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1246154" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0497-01">376 Pa. 497</a>, 509, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.2d%20681" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="103 A.2d 681">103 A. 2d 681</a> (1954). We cannot say that the trial court palpably abused its discretion in denying the Commonwealth’s motion in this instance.</p>
    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[166,1247,1150,763]]]'>The second motion was made after counsel for the appellees asked counsel for the Commonwealth for “the machinery appraisal that was made by the representative of the Commonwealth” which dealt with property on the Mahoning property. The Commonwealth maintains that this is another example of the repeated efforts by counsel for the appellees to bring the unity of use theory into the case. Again, we must conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Commonwealth’s motion. Nothing more was said about the appraisal in the presence of the jury. From what was said, the jury could not have concluded whether the appraisal dealt with equipment on the Werner or Mahoning property.</p>

Upon objection by the Commonwealth, the trial court ruled that the counsel for the appellees could not continue with the multiplication. A product was <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>never written on the blackboard. Tbe jury was instructed that they were not to value the minerals separately from tbe rest of tbe tract. This instruction cured any prejudice resulting from tbe attempted multiplication. Tbe trial court was correct in denying tbe Commonwealth’s motion.</p>

    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[216,902,1147,754]]]'>Tbe Commonwealth’s fourth objection is that tbe trial court erred in selecting tbe jury five days in advance of the day which he bad set for tbe trial. The day set for jury selection was the last day of tbe civil term. Tbe trial court adopted this course of action because tbe case was tbe oldest on tbe civil list and had been continued on several occasions before. After the jury bad been selected, tbe trial was postponed five days because one of tbe attorneys for tbe <em>Commonwealth■ </em>was unable to attend. Furthermore, the Commonwealth has also failed to indicaté in what way it was prejudiced by this procedure. The contention of tbe Commonwealth in this regard is completely without merit.</p>

The trial court admitted that, in condemnation proceedings, a wide range of cross-examination is permissible when tbe condemnee takes tbe stand. However, tbe court excluded tbe evidence solely because there was no evidence that tbe land purchased by Mr. Werner was comparable to tbe land condemned. Such <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>a foundation is especially important in a case such as this where valuable mineral rights are included in the land condemned. In fact, there is no evidence in the record that the land purchased by Mr. Werner contained mineral deposits of any value. Therefore, had Mr. Werner been required to testify as to the price paid for the land acquired after the condemnation, it might well have had the effect of distorting the jury’s impression of the value of the condemned land. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining appellees’ objection to the question posed to Mr. Werner.</p>
