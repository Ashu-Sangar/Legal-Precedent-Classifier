It must never be overlooked that the ConCon was a limited convention, not a plenary one. It was bound by the Constitution of 1874 and had no authority whatsoever to go beyond the limitations spelled out in the Enabling Act No. 2 of March 15, 1967. That Act, approved by the people, specified the areas in which the ConCon could operate in the judicial field. Those areas were as conspicuously circumscribed as if they were surrounded by walls. The ConCon had no authority whatsoever to go beyond those Avails. What were the circumscribed areas? Administration, Organization, Selection, Tenure. The ConCon broke down those walls and <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>trespassed into the area of Jurisdiction, where it had no right to be <em>at all. </em>This is so fundamental and elementary that I cannot but be amazed that this Court treats the matter in so summary a fashion, especially since the ConCon’s trespassing involves the very lifeblood of this Court itself, jurisdiction.

When the ConCon erased from the Constitution all language on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and said, through Sec. 2(c) that the Supreme Court “shall have such jurisdiction as shall be provided by law,” it made the Supreme Court subservient to the Legislature, this in violent violation of the basic principle of American government, that each of the three departments shall have sovereign authority unto itself.</p>

    <p id="b57-9" data-blocks='[["BL_57.8",57,[198,2278,1146,154]],["BL_58.1",58,[199,390,1144,764]]]'>The Pittsburgh Press, editorializing on the New Judiciary Article before adoption, declared that the invasion by the Legislative Department into the Judi<a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>ciary Department of the State Government constituted a “fatal flaw” in the Judiciary Article. Its exposition is so able and so unanswerable in its logic that I incorporate it by reference into this dissenting opinion, a salient portion of which reads: “It [the new Judiciary Article] could destroy the pattern of government which has served us throughout our history, the system of three independent, co-equal branches of government—the executive, legislative and judicial—all exercising separate powers defined in the constitution itself. It would do this by malting the entire judicial establishment subservient to the Legislature. For no matter how you slice the 8190 words in this single proposal, this is what they spell.</p>
    <p id="b58-5" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[197,1163,1145,532]]]'>“Unaccountably, the drafters of the judicial article failed to provide a guarantee of any specific powers for the State Supreme Court of any of the lower courts. In fact, adoption of this proposal would rub out even those provisions of the present constitution which specify the basic jurisdiction and powers of the State Supreme Court. The proposal contains no language comparable to that of the U. S. Constitution which defines the jurisdiction and powers of the Federal Courts.</p>
    <p id="b58-6" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[195,1715,1145,372]]]'>“In section after section, as applied to the State Supreme Court on down, the proposal states that the various courts shall have ‘such jurisdiction as shall be provided by law’ or shall retain their present jurisdiction ‘until otherwise provided by law.’ In other words, the entire judicial system would be placed under the control of the Legislature.”</p>

Nothing could be more vital to the authority of this tribunal, which happens to be the oldest Supreme Court in the United States.</p>
