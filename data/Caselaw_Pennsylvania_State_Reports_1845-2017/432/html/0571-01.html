In Vivian, the trial court, in remanding the defendant to the custody of an officer during a noon recess, had instructed defendant’s counsel that he would not be permitted to see Vivian or discuss the case with him. In <em>Vivian, </em>this Court unanimously<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> stated: “This case also poses the serious question of whether or not Vivian’s right to the assistance of counsel, as guaranteed by the Sixth Amend<a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>ment to the Constitution of the United States, was illegally restricted during the trial. It appears that on the fourth day of trial, while Vivian was under examination as a witness, the noonday recess interfered. The trial judge remanded him to the custody of an officer for the recess period, and instructed his counsel that he would not be permitted to see Vivian or discuss the case with him during this time. This was error. As pointed out in United States v. Venuto, <a href="/f2d/182/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="182 F.2d 519" data-case-ids="1242955" data-case-paths="/f2d/182/0519-01">182 F. 2d 519</a>, 522 (3rd Cir. 1950), there is ‘no justification for imposing a restriction of silence between accused and counsel during a trial recess.’ Again as stated in Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>In the trial court there is vested a discretion, albeit very limited, to impose certain restrictions on communications between an accused and his counsel, such as where the accused, testifying as of cross-examination, refuses to answer a question unless he be afforded an opportunity to consult with his counsel. However, such right of restriction on the part of the trial court, <em>aimed only at insuring orderly procedure in the trial itself, </em>does not extend to trial recesses. Common sense dictates such a result. Were the rule otherwise, vague and ill-founded suspicions could well arise in the minds of the jurors as a result of hearing the trial court notify the accused and his counsel, for no apparent reason, that they may not communicate with one another during a trial recess and the jurors would well have reason to ponder why such a prohibition had been imposed. The mere act of consultation between the accused and his counsel might well be tainted, by such restriction, with an aura of treachery and deception. In the case at bar the admonition was not made in order to preserve the orderly procedure of the trial itself but it took place when Sc oler i was undergoing direct examination by his counsel and at a time when a trial recess had been directed. Guaranteeing the right to full and free consultation between the accused and his counsel, we believe that the <em>Vivian </em>rule is sound and must be retained even without any proof that the trial court’s admonition caused any prejudice to the accused.</p>

This is not such a case. To the argument that our decision in <em>Vivian </em>(June 29, 1967) was handed down subsequent to Scoleri’s trial, the answer is obvious. The ruling in <em>Vivian </em>followed that in <em>United States v. Veneto, </em>supra, decided many years prior to the trial of Scoleri.

At his first trial in November 1958, Scoleri was found guilty by a jury of murder in the first degree and the penalty fixed at death. That conviction was upheld by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Scoleri, </em><a href="/pa/399/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="399 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1290525" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0110-01">399 Pa. 110</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.2d%20215" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="160 A.2d 215">160 A. 2d 215</a> (1960) wherein the pertinent facts relative to the crime are set forth. Thereafter, Scoleri petitioned the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for a writ of habeas corpus, which writ was denied. See: <em>United States ete rel. Scoleri v. Banmiller, </em>198 E. Supp. 872 (1961). This judgment of the District Court was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which directed that the writ of habeas corpus be granted so that Scoleri might be retried by the Commonwealth, the “Split Verdict Act” (Act of Decern<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>ber 1, 1959, P.

On October 21, 1963, the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Philadelphia, three judges sitting, found Scoleri guilty of murder in the first degree and, on October 23, 1963, fixed the penalty at death. Seoleri’s counsel then moved to withdraw the plea of guilty, to reinstate the plea of not guilty and requested a jury trial, which motions were denied and from the judgment of sentence an appeal was taken to this Court. Seoleri’s motions were based upon an alleged commitment made by one of the members of the three-judge court to defense counsel to vote for life imprisonment rather than the death penalty. On appeal, we determined that, due to the unusual circumstances presented, Scoleri was entitled to withdraw his plea of guilty, to enter a not guilty plea and to be tried by a jury and to that end we granted a new trial.

    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.6",630,[177,726,1152,1024]]]'>I must file a concurring opinion for two reasons. First, I believe the majority applies the incorrect standard. They state that while this Court “has entertained questions raised for the first time upon an appeal, such cases have always involved errors of such substance and prejudice as to result in an unfair trial and a deprivation of justice.” It is my view that this rule is no more than new words to express the “basic and fundamental” error test used by the dissent in <em>Commonwealth v. Simon, </em><a href="/pa/432/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="432 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1919714" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0386-01">432 Pa. 386</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20289" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="248 A.2d 289">248 A. 2d 289</a> (1968) and the majority in <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/432/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="432 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1919746" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0557-01">432 Pa. 557</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20301" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="248 A.2d 301">248 A. 2d 301</a> (1968). Therefore, my objections as stated in those two cases apply with equal vigor here. The correct test for whether this court will consider an issue on appeal which was not raised below must hinge upon the ability of the trial court to have corrected the error if it had been brought to that court’s attention. See <em>Commonwealth v. Simon, </em><a href="/pa/432/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="432 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1919714" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0386-01">432 Pa. 386</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20289" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="248 A.2d 289">248 A. 2d 289</a> (1968).</p>

The opinion explicitly states that they will consider questions not raised below if they are of “such substance and prejudice as to result in an unfair trial and a deprivation of justice.” The majority then decides that Scoleri’s denial of his right to the assistance of counsel during trial, a right guaranteed by the sixth amendment of the Constitution and of paramount importance was not of such substance. See my discussion of the importance of this right in <em>Commonwealth v. Simon, </em><a href="/pa/432/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="432 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1919714" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0386-01">432 Pa. at 386</a>, 248 A. 2d at 289.

But the same majority in <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/432/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="432 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1919746" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0557-01">432 Pa. 557</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20301" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="248 A.2d 301">248 A. 2d 301</a> (1968) holds that a <em>mere error </em>in the charge (for which no objection was made) can rise to “basic and fundamental error which affects the merit of the ease ... or offends against the fundamentals of a fair and impartial trial.” Examining these two cases provides a shocking contrast—denial of a constitutional right is <em>not </em>fundamental (Scoleri) but an error in a charge <em>is (Williams). </em>This demonstrates two things: (1) the “basic and fundamental” test (or its equivalent “errors of such substance or prejudice”) is very difficult to apply; (2) the test is so vague that it may result in denying the administration of even-handed justice since the determination of what constitutes errors sufficiently “fundamental” to merit consideration by our Court may be colored by the severity not of the error but of the crime itself.</p>
    <p id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.4",631,[174,1508,1153,471]]]'>The majority, in order to be consistent in the application of its rule, should reach the same result in <em>Scoleri </em>and <em>Williams. </em>Equal justice requires that the majority <em>either </em>deny Scoleri and Williams new trials (results which I believe would be correct) <em>or </em>grant both Scoleri and Williams the relief requested. In my view, the error of granting Williams a new trial is made more grievous and obvious by denying Scoleri relief.</p>
