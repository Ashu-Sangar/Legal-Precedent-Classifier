Shortly after the shooting, a fire was discovered in the house. Mr. Bordner, mistakenly thinking it was water, threw a bucket of gasoline on the flames, and in the resulting blaze, the home was completely destroyed and seven of the Bordner children perished. The Fire Marshal, after investigation, reported that the initial blaze was of incendiary origin. Harold Eugene Bordner, the eldest child (Bordner), then aged 17 years, was severely burned in the fire and was admitted to Sunbury Community Hospital in the late evening of November 20th.</p>

This interview, which lasted from approximately 3:00 p.m. to 3:50 p.m., took place after the officers had questioned other members of Bordner’s family concerning the crime. The questioning commenced with a general preliminary discussion with Bordner as to his home life, and then Bordner inquired as to the type of gun found at the scene of the crime. The officers showed the gun to Bordner who identified it, by touch, as his own. Bordner was then asked if he wished to make a “dying declaration” in view of his condition and if he had anything to say. He was then warned of his right to remain silent, his right to an attorney and that anything he might say may be used against him. Bordner was then asked direct questions as to whether he set fire to his parents’ house and whether he shot his parents and Bordner replied in the negative. The first interview was thus concluded.</p>

The coroner then asked Bordner to repeat his confession to his mother which the son then did. Officer Sherosick entered the room at this time in order to hear the confession.

A deputy sheriff left his guard-post to come into the room and listen to the conversation. Bordner admitted to his father that he wished to use the insurance money to pay his bills.

Bordner was questioned solely by his father although he was prompted by the police at least 46 times as to which questions to ask his son.

The tape recorder was then set up and, in the presence of the father, Bordner received from the officer an explanation of his constitutional right to remain silent, his right to counsel and the nature of the crime. The questions as to an understanding- of Bordner’s rights were directed to his father who answered in the affirmative.

The evidence indicates that during these interrogations the police were engaged in a general fact-finding process in that they were still questioning other members of Bordner’s family.

By the time of this confrontation between Bordner and the police, Bordner, on November 22nd, had identified a weapon found at the scene of the crime as his own and, on November 23rd, had, of course, admitted his commission of the crime to the police. It is clear beyond question that, at the time of Bordner’s statements to his mother on November 23rd, the focus of the police investigation was upon Bordner as the perpetrator of the crime and, at this point, the police were bound to fully and adequately warn the accused as to his constitutional rights. See: <em>Escobedo, </em><a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">supra, p. 491</a>.

The United States Supreme Court has equated “custodial interrogation” with what it meant in <em>Escobedo </em>when it spoke of the accused being warned of his rights when the investigation focuses upon him. See: <em>Miranda, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">supra, p. 444</a>; <em>Com. v.

Additionally, this Court has held that custodial interrogation is not limited to police questioning or interrogation which takes place after a formal arrest. See: <em>Com. v. Jefferson, </em>supra, p. 546. Bordner was under a process of custodial interrogation while a patient in his hospital room due to the fact that the investigation had settled upon him. Such was his status prior to the time his mother was brought to see him. This finding of the court below in this respect is fully supported by the fact that, on the evening of November 23rd, Bordner was placed under a guard system which most definitely meant that he was in custody. Moreover, prior to the guard system being instituted, Bordner’s condition, by reason of his injury and his medication, of course, prevented him from leaving his room of convalescence. It necessarily follows that all statements made by Bordner subsequent to and including his conversation with his mother occurred while Bordner was in custody within the meaning and intent of the <em>Miranda </em>decision.</p>
    <p id="b461-3" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[142,2028,1150,376]]]'>The second issue which the Commonwealth raises in its appeal is whether the court erred in suppressing oral statements of Bordner to his mother and father, as distinguished from the proscribed statements to law enforcement officers, instead of ruling them admissible as part of a spontaneous confession of Bordner within the purview of <em>Miranda, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b462-3" data-blocks='[["BL_462.3",462,[214,420,1151,1969]],["BL_463.1",463,[170,403,1147,266]]]'>
      <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>Our inquiry at this point is riveted <em>to </em>the question of whether Bordner was constitutionally protected, within <em>Miranda, </em>by the fact that he made his incriminating statements to his mother and father rather than to police officers even though he was in custody at the time. As previously mentioned, Bordner, on November 23rd, did make a confession to his mother in the presence of police officers at a time when he was in custody and when the focus of the investigation was upon him. See: <em>Com. v. </em>Jefferson, <a href="/pa/423/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="423 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1903093" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0541-01">423 Pa. 541</a>, 546, <a href="/citations/?q=226%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="226 A.2d 765">226 A. 2d 765</a> (1967). The facts indicate that the police asked Bordner if he would see his mother and the mother was then brought into the room at the request of the police. Neither mother nor son voluntarily requested the visit nor were they left alone with one another. On this occasion, the police gave no warning whatsoever to the accused of his constitutional rights. The police commenced the conversation between mother and son by asking Bordner to tell his mother what he had earlier in the day told them. Coupled with the additional fact that the accused was then in custody and that this was really one continuous interrogation since the police had never left, the evidence is clear that the police arranged this conversation in order to gain additional incriminating statements from Bordner by utilizing the emotional relationship between mother and son. <em>In viewing the totality of circumstances involved, </em>it can hardly be stated that these incriminating statements made to the mother were spontaneous. Cf. Com. <em>v. Eperjesi, </em><a href="/pa/423/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="423 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1903122" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0455-01">423 Pa. 455</a>, 469, <a href="/citations/?q=224%20A.2d%20216" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="224 A.2d 216">224 A. 2d 216</a> (1966). The circumstances reveal a plan on the part of the police authorities to use the mother as a police instrumentality in the interrogation of the accused son and the statements made to the mother, in the <em>context </em>of this factual setting, are as though made to the police themselves. As Bordner was not warned of his <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>rights, the incriminating statements made to his mother are inadmissible as evidence and are clearly not spontaneous. Thus, Statement No. 2 is inadmissible as evidence and the court below did not err in suppressing such statement.</p>
    <p id="b463-3" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[172,681,1148,870]]]'>The father met with Bordner on three occasions— November 23rd, 26th and 27th. Since the son was in custody, again we must examine the circumstances to determine whether the son’s statements to his father were within the purview of <em>Miranda </em>in that they were not spontaneous confessions. The record indicates that at no time did Bordner and his father converse without the presence of police and additionally, there is ample evidence that the father requested the presence of the police and that his motive was to assist the police in their investigation of the accused. The undisputed testimony reveals that the father even suggested “bugging” the room of the accused son and that he was an instrumental party and moving force in tape recording two conversations with the son on November 26th and November 27th.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Having been given no warnings as to his rights, his confession to his father, Statement No. 3, is inadmissible and we affirm the court below in suppressing it.</p>

The father was prompted as to the questions addressed to his son on numerous occasions by the police and, for all intents and purposes, the accused was answering the questions of the police.

Bordner had not been fully and adequately warned of his rights up to this time nor was he given any warning at this <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>time. This statement acquires its full import when it is considered against the context of the conversation of Bordner’s interrogation by his father, in concert with the police, on November 26th. It is highly doubtful whether the accused would have made so immediate a statement to his father had it not been for his statement to his father of Eugene Yerger’s complicity in the crime during the interrogation of November 26th. During that questioning, defendant had not been warned as to his full constitutional rights even though he was in custody and he was, in essence, being questioned by the police. The United States Supreme Court has stated that: “unless and until such warnings and waiver are demonstrated by the prosecutor at trial, no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.” See: <em>Miranda,, </em>supra, p. 479.</p>

Due to the father’s active collaboration with the police, the fact that the son was under fairly continuous interrogation, that the son’s physical condition was critical, that he was under medication and had not been allowed to see familiar faces in the absence of the police, it is difficult <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>to find that the circumstances are indicative that the statement was spontaneously made.

However, it is equally evident that Bordner had <em>never </em>received any warning of his right to <em>appointive counsel </em>up to and including the November 27th interrogation. As stated in <em>Miranda, </em>supra, p. 473: “without this additional warning, the admonition of the right to consult with counsel would often be understood as meaning only that he can consult with a lawyer if he has one or has the funds to obtain one. The warning of a right to counsel would be hollow if not couched in terms that would convey to the indigent the knowledge that he too has a right to have counsel present. As with the warnings of the right to remain silent and of the general right to counsel, only by effective and express explanation to the indigent of this right can there be assurance that he was truly in a position to exercise it”.

As Bordner at the time of the questioning was only 17 years of age and had not been warned of his right to <em>appointive counsel, </em>he undoubtedly would be subject to the very misapprehension as to his constitutional rights to which the <em>Miranda </em>decision addressed itself. Moreover, we have recently reaffirmed that a defendant cannot intelligently waive a right of which he is not fully aware. See: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Mullins v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/428/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="428 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="1912420" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0195-01">428 Pa. 195</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=236%20A.2d%20781" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="236 A.2d 781">236 A. 2d 781</a> (1968). For these reasons, <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>we conclude that the lower court did not err in suppressing Statement No. 5.</p>

While freely volunteered statements are not affected by <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo, (Miranda, </em>at p. 478, <em>Com. v.

Bordner was given no warnings as to his rights on this occasion. It is only rational to assume that the policeman knew or assumed that the condition of Bordner’s hands were the result of being burned during the commission of the crime. Therefore, by commenting on the condition of Bord<a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>ner’s hands and having just questioned him as to discrepancies of a prior interrogation, it would not be unnatural to expect that Bordner might give an incriminating answer to such a neutral remark. This is so particularly since Bordner had not seen a friendly person, in the absence of police, since the beginning of his custodial interrogation some six days before. Moreover, Bordner was in critical physical condition during this period of time.</p>
    <p id="b468-4" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[204,911,1150,1142]]]'>Additionally, it must be borne in mind that this “admission” related directly to the alleged discrepancies in the prior interrogation about which he was being questioned on November 29th. This admission was directly related to the November 27th and 29th interrogations and Bordner had not been advised of his full constitutional rights on either of these prior occasions. This Court has said that a statement or confession made subsequent to another confession or incriminating admission obtained in the absence of a required warning of constitutional rights may not be used as evidence, unless it is first established that the last statement or confession was not the exploitation of the original illegality and was obtained under circumstances sufficiently distinguishing to purge it of the original taint.
