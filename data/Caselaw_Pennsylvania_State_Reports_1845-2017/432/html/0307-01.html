The latter was predicated upon the authority’s assertion that a prior action commenced in 1962 by one of the appellants and concluded adversely to her was res judicata of the present action (commenced in December of 1965). The court below agreed that the res judicata defense was meritorious and thus sustained appellees’ demurrer; this appeal was then taken.</p>

Such a course is contemplated by Pa. R. C. P. 1030: “All affirmative defenses, including . . . res judicata . . . shall be pleaded in a responsive pleading under the heading ‘New Matter’.” See also Pa. R. C. P. 1045(b). The rationale for this procedure stems from the fact that a court may not ordinarily take judicial notice in one case of the records in another case even though the case arose in the same court and the contents of those records are known to the court. See, e.g., <em>Naffah v. City Deposit Bank, </em><a href="/pa/339/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="339 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="1201236" data-case-paths="/pa/339/0157-01">339 Pa. 157</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.2d%2063" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 A.2d 63">13 A. </a><a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a><a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.2d%2063" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 A.2d 63">2d 63</a> (1940). It follows that, unless the circumstances necessary to sustain the plea of res judicata appear on the face of the complaint, the defense must be raised in an answer and not by preliminary objections. See <em>Jones v. Costlow, </em><a href="/pa/354/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="354 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="467463" data-case-paths="/pa/354/0245-01">354 Pa. 245</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20A.2d%20259" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="47 A.2d 259">47 A. 2d 259</a> (1946). In <em>Jones, </em>for example, the complaint contained no reference to any prior action between the parties. The answer, however, asserted in new matter the defense of res judicata, placing this issue before the court and compelling the plaintiff to file a responsive pleading upon penalty of admitting the facts alleged in the new matter. See also <em>Thal v. Krawitz, </em><a href="/pa/361/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="361 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="476401" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0178-01">361 Pa. 178</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20A.2d%2033" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="63 A.2d 33">63 A. 2d 33</a> (1949).</p>

A hearing was held in 1964 on the equity action and, on November 30, <em>1964, </em>the complaint was dismissed. In his findings of fact the chancellor specifically found that the water served by the authority was then “potable” and “chemically and bacteriologically wholesome,” although concededly having an unpleasant taste at various times.

As pointed out in <em>Hahn, </em>under these circumstances, the court felt compelled to treat the case as though the defense had been properly raised under Rule 1030. However, the majority of this Court by taking one statement out of the factual and legal context in <em>Hahn </em>has promulgated and sanctioned a new principle of law which directly contravenes and seriously undermines the viability of Rule 1030. The majority opinion amounts to an open invitation, both to the litigants <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>and tbe lower courts, to ignore tbe mandatory language of Rule 1030 and decide all affirmative defenses by way of preliminary objections without fear that on appeal this Court will do nothing more than slap their hands and at the same time treat the case as though the correct procedure had been followed. Moreover, it is quite clear that the instant case cannot be so easily distinguished on the basis that the law with respect to the proper procedure for raising the defense of res judicata had heretofore been in a confusing state. For these reasons I would vacate the judgment of the court below without deciding the merits of the controversy and remand the case for the purpose of requiring both the parties and the court below to follow the mandatory procedure outlined under the present rules of civil procedure.</p>
