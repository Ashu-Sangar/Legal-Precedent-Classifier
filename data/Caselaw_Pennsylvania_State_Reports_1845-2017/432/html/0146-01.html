In both decisions, we held that a charitable nonprofit hospital was not an “employer” subject to the Act and that the Act did not confer upon the Board jurisdiction to entertain a labor dispute between a charitable nonprofit hospital and its nonprofessional employees. As Mr. Chief Justice Stern said in <em>Mid-Talley, </em>supra: “The basis for the decision [in <em>Lich</em>liter] was, in brief, that such hospitals, being nonprofit corporations not engaged in industry, commerce, trade, business or production, are not within the intendment of the purpose and scope of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act.” (p. 346).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>The Union, conceding that <em>lichliter </em>and <em>Mid-Valley </em>are directly apposite and must be reversed if it is to succeed, urges that certain language in <em>Flagiello v. Pennsylvania Hospital, </em><a href="/pa/417/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="417 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1894073" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0486-01">417 Pa. 486</a>, 493, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20193" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="208 A.2d 193">208 A. 2d 193</a> (1965) compels not only a reappraisal of both decisions but their reversal. It must be noted that in <em>Flagiello </em>a majority of this Court, reconsidering a judicially-created doctrine, reversed the decisions upholding such doctrine and held that charitable nonprofit hospitals were not immune from tort liability; in the ease at bar, we deal with the ascertainment of the legislative intent as demonstrated in the language of a statute. The language in <em>Flagiello, </em>upon which the Union contends a reversal of <em>LAchliter </em>and <em>Mid-Valley </em>is mandated, is found in the opinion of the late Mr. Justice Mtjsmanno : “But [charitable nonprofit hospitals] do all this on a business basis, submitting invoices for services rendered—-and properly so. And if a hospital functions as a business institution, by charging and receiving money for what it offers, it must be a business establishment also in meeting obligations it incurs in running that establishment.” (p. 493). Even if such language represented the views of a majority of this Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
      <em>Flagiello </em>does not require a reversal of <em>LAchliter </em>and <em>Mid-Valley.</em>
