On December 14, 1961 they placed an order for cattle feed with defendant-appellee, Pritts. This feed was to be blended by <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>Pritts according to a formula previously used by appellants for their cattle and previously blended by Pritts. One of the ingredients in appellants’ formula was a commercially packaged feed supplement known as “Cattle Blend,” manufactured by defendant-appellee Central Soya. Pritts blended the feed supposedly according to appellants’ formula whereupon it was fed to Mr. and Mrs. Kassab’s herd. Shortly thereafter the cows in the herd began to abort and the breed bull began be having in a manner which tended to cast doubt upon his masculinity. He was eventually pronounced sterile.</p>
    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[208,1083,1148,1316]],["BL_269.1",269,[187,415,1147,369]]]'>Fearing that the feed supplement used in appellants’ formula had somehow caused the malfunctioning of the Kassab’s cattle, a chemical analysis was made which revealed the presence of a drug known as “stilbestrol” in the feed, and more particularly in the feed supplement, Cattle Blend. Although appellees contest this fact the trial judge, sitting without a jury, found on the basis of competent evidence that stilbestrol was in the feed, a finding which this Court will not disturb on appeal. It is conceded by all concerned that stilbestrol is customarily added to feed for <em>beef </em>cattle since it has a tendency to make the cattle gain weight. However, it is also conceded that stilbestrol is a synthetic hormone which tends to accentuate the female characteristics in animals, inducing heat and abortions in cows and sterility in bulls. Accordingly, feed containing this drug is not recommended for breed cattle. In fact, a federal regulation requires that feed containing stilbestrol be so labeled and that this label state, inter alia, that the feed is not to be fed to breeding or dairy animals. 21 Code of Federal Regulations §121.241 (1964). It is finally conceded that no such label appeared on the bag of Cattle Blend used by Pritts in compounding appellants’ feed formula. Ob<a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>viously, Central Soya mistakenly packed its stilbestroladded feed supplement into a bag supposed to contain a supplement without stilbestrol. Therefore, although appellants ordered feed without stilbestrol, and although Pritts thought that this is what he had mixed, in fact the feed sold to appellants did not conform to the mixture ordered.</p>
    <p id="b269-3" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[182,806,1152,1311]]]'>Alleging (1) that the stilbestrol in the feed caused their cows to abort and their bull to become sterile; and (2) that community knowledge of what the herd had eaten resulted in appellants’ inability to sell their stock except at beef prices thus greatly diminishing the value of appellants’ property, Mr. and Mrs. Kassab commenced this action in assumpsit against Pritts and Central Soya. The case was heard before a judge sitting without a jury. At the conclusion of the testimony on the issue of liability for breach of contract, the court and counsel agreed that no written opinion need be filed, but rather that the judge could announce his decision on liability from the bench, thereby dispensing with the need for hearing testimony on damages should the court find for defendants. Accordingly, the court announced a verdict for defendants, and orally (later in a written opinion) stated that, although it found that stilbestrol was present in the feed contrary to the formula ordered, nevertheless there should be a verdict for defendants because the court believed defendants’ expert who testified that the amount of drug in the feed could not have caused the abortions and sterility complained of. This appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[213,694,1147,1428]]]'>The record clearly reveals that the trial judge was well aware of the rules governing trials without a jury. At the conclusion of the evidence on liability, he summoned both counsel to side bar and discussed with them the possibility of dispensing with the requirements of the Act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109, §2, as amended, 12 P.S. §689, that the decision of the court be in writing. The court first properly pointed out that, from a formal viewpoint, it could not resort to Pa. E. C. P. 1048 which does allow an oral decision to be rendered from the bench because Rule 1048 applies only to trespass actions. However, while not being able to invoke Rule 1048 on its own motion, the court assumed that, with the consent of both counsel, there would be nothing to prevent it from waiving the requirements of the Act of 1874 and, in fact, using a Eule 1048 type procedure. To this both lawyers readily agreed. Now, the losing party below, while candidly admitting to this Court that he consented to everything done in this respect by the trial court, urges us to reverse for failure to comply with the Act of 1874. It is appellants’ contention that regardless of what they might have consented to, the act is mandatory and, by requiring a formal written opinion, obviously demands that all evidence, on liability <em>and </em>damages, be heard.</p>

To be sure, we have found no authority whatsoever for holding the Act of 1874 mandatory when both parties agree to relax its provisions. Cf. <em>Pittsburgh’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/243/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="243 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1001646" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0392-01">243 Pa. 392</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20A.%20329" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="90 A. 329">90 Atl. 329</a> (1914). Moreover, as for appellants’ argument that the court erred in failing to file an opinion with separate findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Act of 1874 recites that an opinion <em>of this type </em>need not be filed unless requested by the parties. No such request was ever made.</p>
    <p id="b271-3" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[201,1249,1147,1153]],["BL_272.1",272,[190,419,1146,706]]]'>Appellants next attack the procedure of this litigation on the ground that the Act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109, §1, 12 P.S. §888 was not properly applied. This section requires that a suit may be tried without a jury only if the parties so stipulate by agreement filed “in the proper office where such suit is pending.” It appears that, in the present case, shortly before the court announced its verdict the judge discovered that no such agreement had been filed. Again, both parties agreed to read the required stipulation into the record at that point in the trial. This was done and appears of record at page 712a. Appellants now maintain that the entire suit must be retried because the agreement was not submitted to the court before trial. For the same reasons set forth in the preceding paragraph this contention is without merit. This Court said of á consensual failure to comply with practically identical language in Article 5, section 27 of our state Constitution: “There was no formal agreement for such submission [to a judge sitting alone] and waiver [of a jury] filed in this case; but to allow <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>a party at whose instance a proceeding [trial without jury] has been appointed, and who has taken advantage of it by pursuing it, to afterwards defeat it, against the wishes of the opposing party, by alleging his own default in the matter of filing a formal written agreement, would be to suffer the strict letter of the law to overcome its clear purpose.” <em>Pittsburgh’s Petition, </em>supra at 395-96, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20A.%20329" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="90 A. 329">90 Atl. at 330</a>. Considering that the <em>Pittsburgh </em>Court was interpreting a state <em>Constitutional </em>provision and nevertheless denied relief when <em>no </em>written agreement was filed at all, we have no reluctance in the present case to hold appellants to their original agreement.</p>

    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[184,1290,1150,930]]]'>Turning to the merits of this controversy, appellants maintain that the court below, having found as a fact that stilbestrol was in the feed contrary to the formula ordered, had no choice but to find for them on the issue of liability, since the tainted feed constituted a clear breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and of the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. With this contention we agree. The court declared that it was basing its decision of no breach of warranty on its finding that plaintiffs failed to establish that the tainted feed caused any injury to their cattle. But the question of injury, we believe, goes only to the amount of damages and will not affect a finding that the contract itself was breached. Accordingly, on the facts as found appellants were at least entitled to a verdict in their favor for nominal damages.</p>

    <p id="b273-3" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[204,794,1149,1099]]]'>At the outset, it is clear that the privity issue is properly before this court. Appellees raised the privity issue initially in a nonsuit motion, at the close of appellants’ evidence. Although the privity issue was not raised again before the trial court, the parties, at the conclusion of appellees’ evidence, chose to proceed under Pa. R. C. P. 1048.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Under this procedure, the trial judge, sitting without a jury, may render an oral verdict at the conclusion of the trial. <em>After </em>the verdict is rendered, exceptions may be filed within twenty days. The procedure obviously does not contemplate the making of the usual motions that are made in a jury case before the verdict; rather, the intent is to expedite the rendering of the verdict by avoiding those motions, filing of suggested findings of fact, conclusions of law, etc. Thus it cannot validly be argued that appellees waived their privity argument by not making motions based upon it before the verdict. Once the verdict was rendered in its favor, appellees certainly could not have been required to take exceptions.</p>

Section 2-314 of the code lists, inter alia, the following requirements that goods must meet to be merchantable: they must be “fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used” and must be “adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may require.” It was properly found below that the Cattle Blend supplied by Central Soya was <em>not </em>fit for the ordinary purpose of feeding to breed cattle and was <em>not </em>properly labeled. But Soya disclaims liability because appellants purchased the feed from Pritts and cannot therefore maintain an action in assumpsit against Soya, a remote manufacturer.</p>

      <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>As far back as 1931 the seeds of discontent were sown in the field of privity when Justice Cardozo said in <em>Ultramares Corp. v.

Courts and scholars alike<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> have recognized that the typical consumer does not deal at arm’s length with the party whose product he buys. Rather, he buys from a retail merchant who is usually little more than an economic conduit. It is not the merchant who has defectively manufactured the product. Nor is it usually the merchant who advertises the product on such a large scale <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>as to attract consumers. We have in our society literally scores of large, financially responsible manufacturers who place their wares in the stream of commerce not only with the realization, but with the avowed purpose, that these goods will find their way into the hands of the consumer. Only the consumer will use these products; and only the consumer will be injured by them should they prove defective.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Yet the law in Pennsylvania continued to permit these manufacturers to escape contractual liability for harm caused consumers by defective merchandise simply because the manufacturer technically did not <em>sell </em>directly to the consumer. There was no privity of contract between them. No one denied the <em>existence </em>of absolute liability under the code for breach of implied warranty. But this warranty ran not to the injured party, but rather to the middleman who merely sold to the injured party, thus ignoring commercial reality and encouraging multiplicity of litigation.</p>

Under the Uniform Commercial Code, once a breach of <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>warranty has been shown, the defendant’s liability, assuming of course the presence of proximate cause and damages, is absolute. Lack of negligence on the seller’s part is no defense. Therefore, prior to the adoption of section 402a, it could be said that to dispense with privity would be to allow recovery in contract without proof of negligence, while requiring a showing of negligence in order to recover for the same wrong against the same defendant if suit were brought in tort. To permit the result of a lawsuit to depend solely on the caption atop plaintiff’s complaint is not now, and has never been, a sound resolution of identical controversies.</p>

Under the Restatement, if an action be commenced in tort by a purchaser of a defective product against a remote manufacturer, recovery may be had without a showing of negligence, and without a showing of privity, for any damage inflicted upon the person or property of the plaintiff as a result of this defective product. The language of the Restatement is both clear and emphatic: “(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold. (2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>tbe seller.” Thus, in tbe present case, for example, appellants’ complaint alleging that tbeir property (cattle) was damaged (rendered valueless as breeding stock) by virtue of the physical barm caused when these animals ate appellee-Soya’s defective feed would have been sufficient to state a valid cause of action had it been captioned “Complaint in Trespass.” However, because appellants elected to style their complaint as one in assumpsit for breach of warranty under the code, the requirement of privity would prevent these identical allegations from making out a good cause of action. This dichotomy of result is precisely the same evil which, prior to the Restatement, prevented the abolition of privity. It now compels this abolition.</p>

Merely to say that our Legislature never enacted the comments into law does not, of course, preclude this Court from examining <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>them to ascertain the proper meaning of a statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The comment recites that: “This section [2-318] expressly includes as beneficiaries within its provisions the family, household, and guests of the purchaser. Beyond this, the section is neutral and is not intended to enlarge or restrict the developing ease law on whether the seller’s warranties, given to his buyer who resells, extend to other persons in the distributive chain.” Thus it is clear beyond peradventure that the drafters of the code never intended 2-318 to set any limits on vertical privity, nor did they intend all changes in the law to come only from the Legislature as suggested, we think erroneously, by the court in <em>Henry v.

Merely to <em>read </em>the language is to demonstrate that the code simply fails to treat this problem. Therefore, just as is the rule for any area of contract law not covered by the code, general principles of law control. See section 1-103. There thus is nothing to prevent this Court from joining in the growing number of jurisdictions which, although bound by the code, have nevertheless judicially abolished vertical privity in breach of warranty cases.</p>

We now believe that the time has come to recognize that the same policy reasons underlying the food cases also underlie cases involving defective nonedibles which cause injury. When it is considered that continued adherence to the requirements of vertical privity results merely in perpetuating a needless chain of actions whereby each buyer must seek redress for breach of warranty from his own immediate seller until the actual manufacturer is eventually reached, and in memorializing the unwarranted notion that a change in the caption of a complaint can completely alter the result of a lawsuit, our course becomes well marked. Vertical privity can no longer commend itself to this Court.</p>

We need not face the question of liability under section 2-315, however, since, under the facts here pleaded, there certainly existed the implied warranty of merchantability under section 2-314; and this warranty was clearly breached by Pritts. As a seller who deals regularly in cattle feed, appellee impliedly warranted that the feed supplement sold to appellants was fit for the ordinary purposes for which such supplement is used.

The breach of warranty was made out, and appellees shown liable at least for nominal damages, simply by proof that stilbestrol was in fact present in the feed contrary to the formula ordered. However, since there was sufficient evidence to sustain the lower court’s finding that the abortions and sterility were not proximately caused by this stilbestrol, we have no choice but to hold that appellants have not demonstrated that particular element of damages.</p>

Thus, for example, were one to buy a defective gas range which exploded, ruining the buyer’s kitchen, injuring him, and of course necessitating a replacement of the stove itself, all of these three elements of the injury should be compensable. The last, replacing the stove, has been sometimes referred to as “economic loss,” i.e., “the diminution in the value of the product because it is inferior in quality and does not work for the general purposes for which it was manufactured and sold.” Comment, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20539" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="114 U. Pa. L. Rev. 539">114 U. Pa. L. Rev. 539</a>, 541 (1966). There would seem to be no reason for excluding this measure of damages in an action brought under the Restatement, since the defective product itself is as much “property” as any other possession of the plaintiff that is damaged as a result of the manufacturing flaw. Thus, since the tort action would enable plaintiff to recover for economic loss (the physical harm necessitated by 402a would, ipso facto, be present given the defect in the product which caused the damage), so also should this form of damages be compensable in contract. Contract eases from other jurisdictions dispensing with privity have allowed recovery for all three types of injury: personal injury, <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>supra note 3; injury to plaintiff’s property other than the defective article itself, <em>Morrow v. Caloric Appliance Co., </em>supra note 3; and “economic loss,” <em>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Anderson-Weber, Inc., </em>supra note 3.</p>
