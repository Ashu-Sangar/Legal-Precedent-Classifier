At his trial before a jury beginning February 26, 1962, appellant pleaded not guilty, but near the close of the trial he was permitted to change his plea to guilty to a charge of murder generally. The matter then proceeded before the court, to determine the degree of guilt, which hearing resulted in a finding of guilty of murder in the first degree. Patterson was sentenced to life imprisonment, and took no appeal.</p>

Among other things, Patterson alleged that his guilty plea was not voluntary. To this end, he asserted as matters of fact, that during a trial recess he and his attorney were passed in the hallway by the district attorney who stated that unless he changed his plea to guilty “it would be too late to save him.” Appellant next alleged that his own counsel agreed with this evaluation, and “threatened” Patterson with the electric chair unless the guilty plea was entered.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

However, the plea must nevertheless be the free and uncoerced product of its maker. Thus, it is one thing to say that a man voluntarily chooses to plead <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>guilty with the hope of avoiding a death sentence, yet quite another to say that he enters his plea solely out of the fear injected into his mind by what could almost appear, to a man untrained in the law, as some sort of private agreement between opposing counsel to which the defendant himself was not even privy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In order to properly decide exactly what motivated Patterson’s plea, therefore, it is necessary for the court below to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>

In holding that this allegation was sufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing we said, quite simply: “If accepting the petitioner’s allegations as true the writ would issue, then it is incumbent upon the court to hold a hearing affording the petitioner the opportunity to establish the truth of his allegations.” <em>Id. </em>at 4, <a href="/citations/?q=222%20A.2d%20918" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="222 A.2d 918">222 A. 2d at 921</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Thus, if appellant wishes to attack his confession collaterally, he will have to abandon his allegation that the plea was entered because counsel “threatened” Patterson with the electric chair, and vice versa. However, not since the days of Blackstone have internally consistent pleadings been required in any case, civil or criminal, in this Commonwealth. Since appellant would be entitled to relief by proving the truth of either allegation concerning the reason for his plea, he must be given a hearing.</p>

The invalidity of the confession in <em>Adderley </em>stemmed from a violation of <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">378 U.S. 478</a>, <a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">84 S.

At the same time, however, we stated, at page 235, that “admission of a coerced confession requires automatic reversal.” The distinction between a coerced confession and one based on a violation of <em>Escobedo </em>or <em>Miranda </em>is the relative reliability of the fact-finding process at trial when a right has been violated. Finding that the considerations governing automatic reversal as opposed to harmless error under <em>Chapman </em>were similar to those governing the retroactivity <em>vel non </em>question, <em>Padgett </em>indicated that the involuntary confession exclusionary rule, always applied retroactively, see <em>Johnson v.

Here, appellant was convicted of first degree murder. There can be no doubt of the possibility that appellant’s statement contributed to the verdict of first degree murder. The statement could be interpreted as revealing a deliberate plan on appellant’s part to enter the house, load the guns, and wait for his wife. I have indicated above that the introduction of an involuntary confession cannot constitute harmless error. <em>Commonwealth v. Padgett, </em>supra. In view of the inherent untrustworthiness of an involuntary confession, I see no reason for applying a different rule to a confession used <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>to raise the degree of guilt than to a confession used to prove the guilt itself.

But if the evidence presents a fair question as to its voluntariness, as where certain facts bearing on the issue are in dispute or where reasonable men could differ over the inferences to be drawn from undisputed facts, the judge ‘must receive the confession and leave to the jury, under proper instructions, the ultimate determination of its voluntary character and also its truthfulness.’ ” That procedure was obviously followed here. When the prosecution sought to introduce appellant’s statement, an objection on the grounds of voluntariness was interposed. After hearing briefly the Commonwealth’s version of the circumstances under which the statement was taken, the court admitted the statement into evi<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>dence, and noted an exception. When evidence as to involuntariness<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> was presented during the defendant’s case, the defense moved to strike the statement.

      <em>Jackson </em>held that the New York procedure of submitting any disputed issue of voluntariness to the jury was defective because it elided a proper determination of voluntariness. <em>Com. ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/429/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="429 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1913542" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0141-01">429 Pa. 141</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20426" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="239 A.2d 426">239 A. 2d 426</a> (1968). The <em>Jackson </em>Court pointed out that under either of the permissible procedures, the orthodox rule or the Massachusetts rule: “. . . the judge’s conclusions are clearly evident from the record since he either admits the confession into evidence if it is voluntary or rejects it if involuntary. Moreover, his findings upon disputed issues of fact are expressly stated or may be ascertainable from the record. In contrast, the New York jury [substitute judge] returns only a general verdict upon the ultimate question of guilt [substitute 1st degree] or innocence [substitute second degree]. It is impossible to discover whether the jury [judge] found the confession voluntary and relied upon it, or involuntary and supposedly ignored it. Nor is there any indication of how the jury [judge] resolved disputes in the evidence concerning the critical facts underlying the coercion issue. Indeed, there is nothing to show that these matters were resolved at all, one way or another.” The procedure is defective in that “the evidence given the jury [judge] inevitably injects irrelevant and impermissible considerations of truthfulness of the confession into the assessment of voluntariness.” <em>Jackson </em>at page 386.</p>

      <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>The fact that the confession was here heard by a judge who had to determine both its truthfulness and its voluntariness rather than by a jury I deem to be a distinction without a difference. This issue was recently considered in <em>United States ex rel. Spears v. Rundle, </em><a href="/f-supp/268/0691-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="268 F. Supp. 691" data-case-ids="1571719" data-case-paths="/f-supp/268/0691-01">268 F. Supp. 691</a>, 695 (1967), a well-reasoned opinion by Judge Lord in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. We take the liberty to quote at length therefrom: “. . . The question for our decision is whether Jackson requires a separate hearing on the issue of voluntariness where the fact finder is a judge rather than a jury. We think that the decision in Jackson requires such a result. The function of a judge trying a case without a jury is twofold: he is a finder of fact, as well as an arbiter of the law. The responsibility is burdensome. But the task becomes too great when we require a judge who has heard evidence of guilt, to objectively and coldly assess a distinct issue as to the voluntariness of the confession. Objectivity cannot be guaranteed, and reliability must be questioned. Jackson properly construed, prohibits the finder of fact from passing on the voluntariness of a confession since its decision as to voluntariness could be colored by evidence as to guilt. The precise issue presented here was considered in United States ex rel. Owens v. Cavell, <a href="/f-supp/254/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="254 F. Supp. 154" data-case-ids="1549045" data-case-paths="/f-supp/254/0154-01">254 F. Supp. 154</a> (M.D. Pa. 1965). The court held that a judge cannot at the same time hear evidence of guilt, and evidence pertaining to the voluntariness of a confession, without violating the rule of Jackson v. Denno. The court granted the writ in Owens recognizing that a judge, like a jury, could not properly determine voluntariness. The decision found support in the analogous case of Hutcherson v. United States, <a href="" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="122 U.S. App. D.C. 51">122 U.S. App. D.C., 51</a>, <a href="/f2d/351/0748-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="351 F.2d 748" data-case-ids="3653507,807903" data-case-paths="/f2d/351/0748-01">351 F. 2d 748</a> (1965). In Hutcherson the question arose during a <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>separate hearing being held by the trial judge, in the absence of a jury, on the issue of voluntariness. He asked questions pertaining to the truth of the facts contained in the confession. The Court of Appeals found it necessary to order a separate hearing to determine the voluntariness question, since the trial judge’s determination was obviously tainted with the reliability of the confession. Jackson v. Denno requires a procedure designed to insure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession and the record should show the judge’s conclusions in this regard and his findings upon the underlying facts. 378 U.S. at 378, <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">84 S. Ct. 1774</a>. The relator here has not had such a reliable and clear-cut determination. In fact, the record nowhere discloses <em>any </em>determination of the issue of voluntariness. See Sims v. State of Georgia, <a href="/us/385/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="385 U.S. 538" data-case-ids="11340867" data-case-paths="/us/385/0538-01">385 U.S. 538</a>, <a href="/us/385/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="385 U.S. 538" data-case-ids="11340867" data-case-paths="/us/385/0538-01">87 S.

Of course, the presence of an explicit judicial determination in the record of Spears’ trial would not cure the constitutional defect. When the issue of voluntariness was raised, the court had already heard testimony of guilt. It is impossible to objectively and reliably determine that the confession was voluntary after considering his guilt. Were this merely a hearing on voluntariness, Hutcherson would prevent the judge from deciding the issue. The only method, consistent with Jackson and Hutcherson which the court could have adopted during Spears’ trial was upon learning that he placed the confession in issue, to order a separate hearing to be held by another judge unfamiliar with the case and testimony. The reliability of the hearing demanded by Jackson was not present in relator’s trial, and therefore, the writ must issue for this reason alone . . .” (Emphasis in original.) Although <em>Spears </em>involved a waiver of jury trial entirely, the same principles would apply to a degree of <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>guilt hearing before a judge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> I am not at all certain that <em>Spears </em>in interpreting <em>Jackson, </em>did not go too far in equating judge with jury by holding that <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>requires a separate judge to hear the question of voluntariness in every case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> The minimum required, however, is that the trial judge rule on voluntariness before hearing the contents of the confession, and make a clear-cut, reviewable determination of the issue of voluntariness. This minimum was not met here. I would thus hold that <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>held to be retroactive in Pennsylvania, <em>Com. ex rel. Butler v.
