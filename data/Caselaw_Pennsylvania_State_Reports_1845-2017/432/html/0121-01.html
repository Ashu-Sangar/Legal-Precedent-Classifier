His most recent PCHA petition was dismissed without a hearing on the grounds that all but an unlawful search and seizure claim had been previously litigated, and that there was no merit in the search and seizure claim since the challenged conduct occurred prior to <em>Mapp v. </em>Ohio, <a href="/us/367/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="367 U.S. 643" data-case-ids="1785580" data-case-paths="/us/367/0643-01">367 U.S. 643</a>, <a href="/us/367/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="367 U.S. 643" data-case-ids="1785580" data-case-paths="/us/367/0643-01">81 S. Ct. 1684</a> (1961). Appellant, however, contends that he was denied the right to counsel for appeal as guaranteed by <em>Douglas v. California, </em><a href="/us/372/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="372 U.S. 353" data-case-ids="1765282" data-case-paths="/us/372/0353-01">372 U.S. 353</a>, <a href="/us/372/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="372 U.S. 353" data-case-ids="1765282" data-case-paths="/us/372/0353-01">83 S. Ct. 814</a> (1963), arguing that if given a direct appeal, his judgment would not be “final” and he could thus raise his <em>Mapp </em>claim under <em>Linkletter v. </em>Walker, <a href="/us/381/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="381 U.S. 618" data-case-ids="6172443" data-case-paths="/us/381/0632-01">381 U.S. 618</a>, <a href="/us/381/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="381 U.S. 618" data-case-ids="6172443" data-case-paths="/us/381/0632-01">85 S.

    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.8",170,[214,1291,1148,762]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that appellant did not raise his <em>Douglas </em>claim in his PCHA petition, and it is thus not properly before this Court. However, in the course of his petition, appellant stated that his “attorney refused to take appeal as I requested at time of trial”. Although appellant’s hand-drawn petition may not have set out these facts in what the prosecutor considered to be the usual place, we feel that the above allegation is sufficient to preserve appellant’s claim. There is no clear indication in the record before us that appellant’s appointed counsel abandoned this claim at argument on appellant’s petition. As a result, the denial of appellant’s <em>Douglas </em>claim without a hearing is properly before us.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Thus appellant is entitled to a hearing to determine if he was denied his right to counsel for appeal. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant believed that he had thirty days from the denial of his motion for reconsideration in which to appeal and he did appeal within this time period. At this point, appellant was no longer represented by counsel. Since the whole point of appellant’s <em>Douglas </em>claim is that he was unable to prose<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>cute Ms direct appeal without the assistance of counsel, it would make little sense to deny him the right to have that claim considered because, again without counsel, he filed a PCHA appeal late due to an understandable misconstruction of a procedural provision which caused no prejudice to the prosecution.
