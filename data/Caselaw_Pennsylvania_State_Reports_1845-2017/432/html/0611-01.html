L. 901, 53 P.S. <em>41101. </em>Subsequently, it enacted a comprehensive program for compensation for its employees, including policemen and firemen. This program does not meet the standards of compensation established for policemen and firemen in Third Class Cities of Pennsylvania by the Act of June 28, 1951, P.

The central issue for decision is whether or not a Third Class City, such as Bradford, operating under a charter form of government authorized by the Act of 1957, supra, is required to adhere to the provisions of the Acts of 1931 and 1951, as amended, supra.

    <p id="b662-7" data-blocks='[["BL_662.7",662,[172,1353,1146,652]]]'>In <em>Ehald, </em>supra, we affirmed the lower court’s dismissal of a Philadelphia policeman’s suit brought upon a state-wide statute providing for compensation of policemen and firemen for diseases of the lungs and heart. The court reasoned that the statute upon which the suit was based did not apply to Philadelphia employees because it had been superseded by a Philadelphia regulation enacted in accordance with the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter. The Philadelphia regulation contained a comprehensive program for disability compensation for Philadelphia policemen, and was totally unrelated to the state-wide statute.</p>
    <p id="b662-8" data-blocks='[["BL_662.8",662,[175,2016,1146,378]],["BL_663.1",663,[163,420,1149,1208]]]'>The appellants maintain that the eases construing the First Class City Home Rule Act do not apply here. The argument seems to be that, while Philadelphia can by local regulation supersede state-wide statutes affecting the personnel and administration of offices local to Philadelphia, Third Class Cities which have adopted optional charter forms of government cannot likewise <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>supersede by local regulations state-wide statutes affecting Third Class Cities which have not adopted optional charter forms of government. The appellants rest this distinction upon a comparison of Philadelphia with Third Class Cities. Whereas Philadelphia, because of its size, the complexity of the problems of municipal government, and its unique position in the Commonwealth can be entrusted with expansive powers of self-government, Third Class Cities, it is argued, cannot be given those powers because Third Class Cities “are not set apart from the remainder of the Commonwealth in so specific and arbitrary fashion.” The appellants contend that philosophical differences behind the First Class City Home Rule Act and the Optional Third Class City Charter Law support this distinction. It is argued that the primary purpose behind the former law was the expansion of Philadelphia’s local autonomy, whereas one of the signal purposes behind the latter law was the broadening of the base of local municipal government by permitting Third Class Cities to choose between commission, city manager and mayor council types of local government.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b663-3" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[159,1641,1148,477]]]'>We are not persuaded by this argument, which is, at best, conjectural. As is noted in the appellee’s brief, the Constitutional provision authorizing home rule for cities does not in any way distinguish Philadelphia from the other cities of the Commonwealth. Moreover, the recently adopted Constitutional Amendments expand the home rule concept by permitting all units of local government, regardless of “size,” to adopt home rule charters.</p>
    <p id="b663-4" data-blocks='[["BL_663.5",663,[160,2139,1146,152]],["BL_664.1",664,[217,423,1147,649]]]'>Next, the appellants contend that the cases construing the First Class City Home Rule Act are not dispositive in this appeal which relates to aspects of <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>the Optional Third Class City Charter Act, because of basic differences in those acts. The argument is that both enabling acts limit local home rule power with respect to acts “applicable to all cities of the Commonwealth,” but only the Optional Third Class City Charter Act defines the word “city.” In that act, “city” means “a city of the third class,” unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. If the appellants’ argument is correct, then, of course, the enabling act would preclude the operation of Bradford’s personnel plan and would require the application of the state-wide minimum salary acts to its policemen and its firemen.</p>
    <p id="b664-4" data-blocks='[["BL_664.4",664,[214,1085,1148,1092]]]'>After having examined the act carefully in all of its provisions, we conclude that the word “cities” as used in Section 305(3) does not mean “third class cities.” Broad and expansive powers of local self-government were conferred upon cities adopting an optional plan of government in Section 301. Section 304 sheds further light upon the legislative intent by providing that: “The general grant of municipal power contained in this article is intended to confer the greatest power of local self-government consistent with the Constitution of this State. . . . All grants of municipal power to cities governed by an optional plan under this act, whether in the form of specific enumeration or general terms, shall be liberally construed in favor of the city.” 53 P.S. 41304. The grant of such expansive powers of local self-government would be largely impaired by the substitution of “cities of the third class” for “cities” in Section 305(3). We do not think that such a result would comport with the legislative purpose expressed throughout the act.</p>
