Under a Rider Agreement which formed part of the lease and which was signed by both <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>appellant landlords, the lease was assigned to McDonald Bowl, Inc. (McDonald), a corporation formed by Toder to start a bowling alley. The lease was for a term of ten years, for a total rent of $119,520, payable $11,520 at signing of the lease and $1,000 per month. It provided, in case of default, for confession of judgment, and in the event of default, bankruptcy, or insolvency, for the entire balance of the rent to become due and payable. Provision was made permitting the lessor to distrain for rent on all property found on the premises.</p>
    <p id="b493-3" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[166,1028,1147,599]]]'>However, the rider provided that a landlord’s waiver of the right to distrain in a form as was attached would be executed in order to permit the tenant to finance the purchase of bowling alleys and equipment. The attached form was an unexecuted general form of waiver covering Brunswick automatic pinsetters and naming as the protected seller Brunswick Automatic Pinsetter Corporation. The only waiver that was executed was to the benefit of Brunswick Corporation and was signed only by Paul Ciaffoni and his wife, and acknowledged on September 16, 1960.</p>

District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, McDonald was adjudicated a bankrupt. On July 5, 1962, the Referee in Bankruptcy entered an order that appellees were “entitled to take possession of the personal property” that is here in dispute. When appellees sought, on July 20, 1962, to remove the equipment, Paul Ciaffoni <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>instructed employees of Brunswick to leave the premises and they departed voluntarily. Paul and Peter Ciaffoni then, on July 23, 1962, distrained for'rent on the equipment, taking possession of it.</p>

Mc-Cune made an order awarding to Paul Ciaffoni his one-half share of the rents in default since Paul had not signed the waiver agreement. On appellees’ exceptions, the court <em>en banc </em>vacated the prior order and in an opinion by Judge McCune, ordered judgment for appellees, with costs on appellants.</p>
    <p id="b494-6" data-blocks='[["BL_494.6",494,[202,1259,1146,420]]]'>The court <em>en banc </em>was of the view that appellees were creditor beneficiaries of the rider provision in which appellants agreed with Toder to sign a landlord’s waiver in favor of appellees.

This was an adjudication <em>in rem </em>binding on all who might claim an interest in the property, including appellants. “Adjudications of the referee, if not reviewed within the time and in the manner prescribed, have the force and effect of judgments and orders of the District Court.” <em>In re Tinkoff, </em><a href="/f2d/85/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="85 F.2d 305" data-case-ids="925148" data-case-paths="/f2d/85/0305-01">85 F. 2d 305</a>, 307 (7th Cir. 1936), <em>cert. denied, </em><a href="/citations/?q=299%20U.S.%20611" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="299 U.S. 611">299 U.S. 611</a>.
