In 1967 appellant filed a writ of habeas corpus, claiming (1) that he had not been represented by counsel at the time of his sentencing; (2) that he had not had a separate hearing to determine the validity of his allegedly involuntary confession; (3) that the trial judge had denied appellant his right to counsel by directing him to remain silent while a witness was being cross-examined; and (4) that appellant did not know his right to appeal, nor of his right to have counsel appointed to perfect an appeal as required by <em>Douglas v.

Accordingly, appellant’s sentence was vacated and Judge Ellenbogen, later sitting as sentencing judge, reimposed a life sentence on appellant, who then of course was represented by counsel. Appellant was also given a hearing under <em>Jackson v.

The hearing judge did not decide appellant’s denial of the right to appeal claim because he felt that his determination that appellant “is entitled to be resentenced, with counsel present, will automatically afford him the right to file an appeal within the prescribed time limits . . . .” Appellant has appealed from the resentencing and from the determinations made at his collateral hearing.</p>

    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[215,1115,1147,761]]]'>Appellant apparently has appealed from the reimposition of a life sentence, but it is unclear on what his claim is based. In his brief, appellant’s counsel merely reiterates that appellant was denied counsel at his <em>original </em>sentencing, notes that as a result the sentence was vacated for imposition of a new sentence, and states that “the Court’s attention is directed to this procedure.” Unfortunately, our attention is not directed to anything that might be improper about this procedure. Surely appellant is not arguing that his new sentence <em>must </em>be different from his original sentence. Nor is there anything wrong with having the same judge who granted appellant the right to a re-sentencing preside over that resentencing.</p>

    <p id="b506-7" data-blocks='[["BL_506.7",506,[213,2006,1144,265]]]'>After the <em>Jaelcson </em>hearing, the court ruled that appellant’s confession was voluntary. Appellant’s confession was not available, having apparently been lost by the district attorney’s office, and appellant claims that this deprived him of a fair hearing.</p>

Determination of whether a confession is voluntary is dependent on facts wholly independent of anything that appears on the actual document.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The confession itself is not even necessary in deciding appellant’s claim that he merely signed a blank sheet of paper, upon which his allegedly coerced confession was later typed.

    <p id="b507-3" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[164,910,1145,257]]]'>Considerable testimony was introduced at the hearing bearing on the voluntariness of the confession.

Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S. Ct. 1602</a> (1966). Although his confession was elicited in 1950, appellant claims that <em>Miranda </em>applies to retrials, and that the vacating of his sentence and his subsequent resentencing constitute a retrial. Although there is considerable disagreement as to whether <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, </em><a href="/us/384/0719-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="384 U.S. 719" data-case-ids="12047240" data-case-paths="/us/384/0719-01">384 U.S. 719</a>, <a href="/us/384/0719-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="384 U.S. 719" data-case-ids="12047240" data-case-paths="/us/384/0719-01">86 S.

Rather, appellant has merely been resentenced, this time with counsel present, but his new sentence is based on his 1951 trial, the only trial which appellant has received. We thus conclude that the determination that appellant’s confession was validly obtained was made at a fair hearing conducted under the proper legal standard.</p>

    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[217,968,1145,652]]]'>While a witness was testifying, appellant leaned across the table at which he was seated to speak with his attorney. The trial judge ordered appellant to cease talking and to remain silent. Appellant contends that this prevented him from conferring with his attorney, thus depriving him of a fair trial. Appellant’s trial counsel testified at appellant’s hearing that the trial judge’s order did not in any way hinder the prosecution of appellant’s defense. The hearing court found as a fact that the trial judge’s statement was made in an effort to keep order in the courtroom, a duty with which the trial judge is charged.</p>

This problem is not present in the <em>Vivian </em>situation, where there is “no justification for imposing a restriction of silence between accused and counsel during a trial recess.” <em>United States v. Venuto, </em><a href="/f2d/182/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="182 F.2d 519" data-case-ids="1242955" data-case-paths="/f2d/182/0519-01">182 F. 2d 519</a>, 522 (3d Cir. 1950). Although we held in <em>Vivian </em>that as a result, a showing of prejudice is not necessary, here, where there may be clear justification for the trial <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>judge’s order, we believe tbat at the least, prejudice must be shown. Since appellant’s counsel testified that he believed that appellant’s defense was not hindered, the hearing judge’s determination that appellant was not prejudiced supports the rejection of appellant’s denial of counsel claim.</p>

Act of May 11, 1927, P. L. 972, §1, 12 P.S. §1136. Since appellant’s original sentence was vacated, the date of his sentencing was the date on which he was given his <em>new </em>sentence, and at that point, as Judge Ellenbogen pointed out, appellant had an automatic right to take a direct appeal. It thus is something of a mystery why appellant continues to press his <em>Douglas </em>claim, when after his new sentence he was represented by counsel and obviously knew of his right to appeal.</p>
