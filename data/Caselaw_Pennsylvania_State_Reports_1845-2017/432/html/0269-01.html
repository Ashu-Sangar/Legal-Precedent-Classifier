While we recognize the existence of a rule of construction which requires that technical words be given their technical meanings, such recognition does not mandate that we accord to the word “heirs” <em>in this will </em>its legal or technical meaning. In the first place, even though the testator was a college graduate, he was a layman unversed in the law or legal language and, so far as the record reveals, was not aware of the technical as opposed to the popular meaning of the word “heirs”.

If we accept appellants’ construction of the word “heirs”, an examination of the will discloses this absurdity: if the word “heirs” be construed technically, then, under testator’s second testamentary disposition, if, in addition to his wife, testator was survived by “heirs” such as appellants, the testator’s wife would take the estate outright, whereas, under testator’s first testamentary disposition, if testator was not survived by “heirs” such as appellants, testator’s wife would not take his estate outright but only in trust. Such disposition of his estate defies common sense. From an examination of the language of this will <em>in its entirety, </em>we believe that testator clearly intended that if he were survived by a wife and no “children”, then his estate would go to his wife in trust, for life or remarriage, and then to the university from which he was graduated, and that, if he were survived by his wife and a child or children, then his <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>estate would go to Ms wife outright.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In this connection, Judge Rahauser aptly said: “Testator’s outright gift to his wife, if he had ‘children’, makes sense; she could reasonably be expected to give them what was left at her death. Likewise, his limitation of the gift to his wife for life or until remarriage, with remainder to Bucknell University, if he had no ‘children’, makes sense since this would provide for his wife as long as she needed his care, with the remainder to his university.</p>
    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.4",324,[196,972,1148,1039]]]'>“However, it is difficult to believe that the testator intended his wife to take his entire estate absolutely if she survived him and if his only other surviving heirs were an aunt and two cousins, but that he intended his wife to take only a defeasible life estate, with remainder to Bucknell University, if he was survived by his wife and no other ‘heirs’. Why would the testator be more generous to his wife if he was survived by collateral relatives than he would be if he left no one to survive him except his wife? But if the testator was thinking of what he would give his wife, depending on whether or not he had ‘children’, it is easy to see that he may have wished her to have his entire estate absolutely if he had ‘children’ (in order that she could take care of herself and the children as she saw fit), but only to have what she <em>personally </em>needed from his estate if there were no ‘children’, with remainder to Bucknell University.” (R. at 11a, 12a)</p>

The real thrust of appellants’ contention and that of the minority opinion is that the testator failed to make <em>any </em>disposition of his estate upon the occurrence of the event which did occur, <em>i.e., </em>the death of testator’s wife prior to that of testator. As Judge Kramer said in his minority opinion: “[Testator’s] only fault was one of omission.

[was] still in the hands of the trustee,” then the will provided a gift over to certain named remaindermen; the will did not provide for disposition of the residuary estate at any time other than while the fund was in the trustee’s hands. The child predeceased the testator. This Court awarded the fund to the remainder-men stating, inter alia (pp. 218-19) : “The son prede<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>ceased testator and consequently no funds have come into the possession of the trustee. The next of kin maintain that the gift of the remainder was <em>contingent upon </em>the death of the life tenant while the trust fund ‘. . .

[Citing authority]. The testamentary scheme reflects testator’s contemplation of the normal expectancy that the son would survive him. Testator clearly revealed his concern as to the support, maintenance and education of the son and how the trust fund should be applied during the son’s lifetime and after his decease. The testamentary provision concerning the manner of payment to the remaindermen was purely <em>directory </em>and manifestly did not contemplate a condition or contingency. Testator failed <em>specifically </em>to provide for a situation resulting from the predecease of the son.

Prom our reading and study of this will we are convinced that testator did not intend to give anything to those who ordinarily would be classed as his “heirs” in the technical sense. While we recognize that testator did not <em>specifically </em>provide for a disposition of his estate if his wife died before he did, nevertheless, we are convinced that, <em>by implication, </em>he did so. The plan, inherent in the four corners of this will, for the intended disposition of testator’s estate leads us to agree with that which was concluded by the majority in the court below: “. . . that testator’s will indicates that if he is not survived by children his estate is to go into a trust for the benefit of his wife until her remarriage or death, with remainder to Bucknell University. The wife having predeceased the testator, the gift to the remainderman, Bucknell University, would be accelerated in the absence of a testamentary direction to the contrary. We find no such direction.”</p>

        <em> </em>We believe from our scrutiny of the testamentary language that the testator used the words “heirs” to mean “children”. We <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>recognize that in the portion of the will quoted above testator speaks of “heirs other than my dear wife”.
