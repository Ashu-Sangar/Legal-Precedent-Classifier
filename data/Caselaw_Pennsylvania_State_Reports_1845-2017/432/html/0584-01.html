(d) Use as a canal, turnpike, tunnel, bridge, wharf, and the like for the public for compensation ____” Thus, although it would appear that the operation of a turnpike qualifies as a public utility service, the Turnpike Commission can only be classified as a public utility if it is a “person or corporation.” The Commonwealth, however, correctly maintains that if the Turnpike Commission is an agency of the state, it is not a “person or corporation” within the Public Utility Code. It is clearly not a corporation,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and Public Utility Code §1102(16) defines “person” as “individuals, partnerships, or associations other than corporations. . . .” This definition does not include an instrumentality of the state.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Taxpayer seizes upon this language to argue that (1) The Turnpike Commission is within the definition of a Municipal Corporation; (2) Municipal Corporations have been “long considered by the courts” to be public utilities; and (3) the Turnpike Commission is thus within that class of entities which <em>Lafferty </em>suggests can benefit from the public utility <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>tax exclusion although not regulated under the Public Utility Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
