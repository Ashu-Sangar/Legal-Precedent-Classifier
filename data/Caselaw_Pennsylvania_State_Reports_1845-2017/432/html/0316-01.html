    <p id="b365-13" data-blocks='[["BL_365.19",365,[148,1771,1150,647]]]'>In this action in trespass, service of the summons was made by the sheriff leaving a copy thereof with the defendant’s father at their allegedly common residence. The defendant filed preliminary objections to the complaint challenging proper venue of the action, and jurisdiction over the defendant’s person. In connection with the last mentioned objection, it was asserted that the defendant did not reside at his father’s residence and that the service was therefore invalid. For reasons which need not be discussed here, the court below dismissed the objections to the complaint on February 16, 1968.</p>

      <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>On March 4, 1968, the plaintiffs caused judgment to be entered against the defendant for failure to enter an appearance in the action. The defendant then filed motions to strike or open the judgment. Rules to show cause were granted, but were vacated on April 10, 1968. On May 15, 1968, the defendant filed two appeals in this Court: (1) Appeal No. 175 from the Order below dismissing the preliminary objections to the complaint; and (2) Appeal No. 174 from the judgment entered on March 4, 1968.</p>

If it be considered as an appeal properly raising a question of jurisdiction under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, § §1 and 2, 12 P.S. §§672 and 673, it was not timely filed and perfected. <em>Reynolds Metals Co. v.
