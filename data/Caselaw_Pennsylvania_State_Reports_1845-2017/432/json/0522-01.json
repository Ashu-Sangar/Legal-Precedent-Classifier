        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts:\nThe majority, in failing to grant appellant Siegel a new trial, ignores two recent Supreme Court decisions. During the course of the trial the Commonwealth introduced Magistrate Schwartz\u2019s unsworn statement which inculpated Constable Siegel. It is conceded that cautionary instructions were given to the jury warning them to disregard Schwartz\u2019s statement in evaluating the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Siegel. Further, under the rule originally established in Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S. Ct. 294 (1957), it was assumed that a properly instructed jury would ignore the confessor\u2019s inculpation of the nonconfessor in determining the latter\u2019s guilt. It followed from this assumption, that there could be no violation of the nonconfessor\u2019s right to confrontation, because the case was treated as if the confessor had made no statement inculpating the nonconfessor.\nHowever, in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968), the Supreme Court expressly overruled Belli Paoli, and held that because of the substantial risk that the jury might look to the confessor\u2019s statements in determining the nonconfessor\u2019s guilt, any admission of such a statement in a joint trial violated the nonconfessor\u2019s right of cross-examination as guaranteed by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Court opinion states: \u201cDespite the concededly clear instructions to the jury to disregard Evans\u2019 [Bruton\u2019s codefendant\u2019s] inadmissible hearsay evidence inculpating petitioner, in the context of a joint trial we cannot accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for petitioner\u2019s constitutional right of cross examination.\u201d\nThe facts in the instant appeal are so similar to those in Bruton that they clearly compel a new trial for appellant Siegel. Schwartz made implicating statements, never took the stand and therefore was not subject to cross-examination. Although it might be contended that Schwartz\u2019s statements did not prejudice Siegel, even the Commonwealth in its brief concedes that this was possible by noting that: \u201cThere was nothing in the statement which implicated Siegel which had not already been proved aliunde.\u201d Nor can a valid argument be made that because the damaging evidence in Schwartz\u2019s statement was also proved elsewhere, the error in introducing the statement at Siegel\u2019s trial was harmless. This Court has clearly enunciated. that in order to prove \u201charmless error, the Commonwealth must now demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d Commonwealth v. Pearson, 427 Pa. 45, 49, 233 A. 2d 552, 554 (1967). A cursory glance at the record indicates that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to meet this burden. Since the Supreme Court has declared that Bruton is completely retroactive, Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S. Ct. 1921 (1968), it seems clear to me that it is incumbent upon this Court to award Siegel a new trial.\nTherefore I dissent.\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien joins in this dissent.",
