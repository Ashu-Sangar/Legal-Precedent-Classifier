The issues, as stated by petitioner are;\n(1) Whether the Commonwealth Court erred when it reversed the trial court and held that an Act 111 arbitration award that set a minimum number of firefighters on duty per shift should be vacated because the number of firefighters on duty per shift, which is rationally related to the terms and conditions of employment of the firefighters since it is a safety issue, unduly infringes upon the exercise of an employer\u2019s managerial responsibilities?\n(2) Whether the Commonwealth Court erred when it reversed the trial court and held that an Act 111 arbitration award that set a minimum number of firefighters on duty per shift should be vacated because the number of firefighters on duty per shift unduly infringes upon the exercise of an employer\u2019s managerial responsibilities when there was no evidence of any undue infringement presented to the Act 111 panel?\nJustice Eakin did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.",
