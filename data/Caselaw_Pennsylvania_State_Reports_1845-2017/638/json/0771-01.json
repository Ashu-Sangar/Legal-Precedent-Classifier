Allocatur is DENIED as to all remaining issues. The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n1. If the rebuttable presumption under Section 6801 is established, can a finding that there is a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d be defeated by evidence of record before the burden is shifted back to the claimant to establish that he or she is the innocent owner?\n2. Where the rebuttable presumption establishes that currency is presumed to be proceeds of selling controlled substances, but the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is inconsistent with selling of controlled substances, can the presumption be defeated by the Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence?",
