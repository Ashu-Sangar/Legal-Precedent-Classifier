However, to be entitled to relief based upon an after-discovered evidence claim, a petitioner must, inter alia, establish that the proposed after-discovered evidence is \u201cproducible and admissible.\u201d Commonwealth v. Smith, 518 Pa. 15, 540 A.2d 246, 263 (1988). Here, Respondent\u2019s after-discovered evidence is inadmissible because the evidence consists only of criminal charges against a witness, not convictions. See Commonwealth v. Taylor, 475 Pa. 564, 381 A.2d 418, 419 (1977) (\u201c[t]he veracity of a witness may not be impeached by evidence of prior arrests which have not led to convictions\u201d). The Superior Court thus erred in reversing the PCRA court order on this basis, and in remanding for an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED, the order of the Superior Court is REVERSED, and the PCRA court\u2019s order denying collateral relief on the basis of after-discovered evidence is REINSTATED.\nChief Justice Saylor dissents.",
