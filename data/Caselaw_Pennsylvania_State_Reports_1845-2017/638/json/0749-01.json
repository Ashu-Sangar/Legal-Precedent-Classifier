When construing the unambiguous statute 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7710.2 in a case of first impression (in this matter pertaining to the property rights of a surviving spouse), may a court resort to legislative comments while also: (a) contravening prior rulings of this Court, as well as a recent decision from the same intermediate appellate court regarding the same statutory enactment, which held that comments shall not be considered when construing an unambiguous statute, and (b) failing to consider whether the court\u2019s interpretation will lead to absurd or unreasonable results?\nb. When construing the unambiguous statute 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7710.2 in a case of first impression, may a court conclude that the Legislature intended to reverse longstanding laws in the absence of any clear indication on the face of the statutes, but instead based solely on implication from a legislative comment?\nJustices Donohue and Mundy did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.",
