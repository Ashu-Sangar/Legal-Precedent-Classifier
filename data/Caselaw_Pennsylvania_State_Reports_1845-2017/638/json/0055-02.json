        "text": "OPINION\nCHIEF JUSTICE SAYLOR\nThe issue in this workers\u2019 compensation appeal is ultimately whether a notice of compensation payable closely circumscribes the range of health-related conditions to be considered in impairment rating evaluations.\nAppellant Michael C. Duffey (\u201cClaimant\u201d) sustained injuries to his hands when he picked up electrified wires while repairing a machine for Appellee, Trola-Dyne, Inc. (\u201cEmployer\u201d). Employer issued a notice of compensation payable (the \u201cNCP\u201d) per Sections 406.1 and 410 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 717.1, 731, which indicated that the \u201c[b]ody [p]art(s) affected\u201d were \u201cbilateral hands\u201d; the type of injury was \u201celectrical burn\u201d; and the description of the injury was \u201cstripping some electrical wire.\u201d\nOn March 6, 2011, after Claimant had received benefits for total disability for a period of 104 weeks, Employer requested an impairment rating evaluation pursuant to Section 306(a.2)(l) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1). In its request for designation of a physician to perform the evaluation per the applicable administrative regulations, see 34 Pa. Code \u00a7 123.104, Employer described the underlying compensable injury as \u201cbilateral hands-nerve and joint pain.\u201d\nA few months later, Claimant submitted to an impairment rating evaluation (the \u201cIRE\u201d) by Bruce E. Sicilia, M.D. (the \u201cPhysician-Evaluator\u201d), a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation. The Physician-Evaluator assigned a whole-body impairment rating of six percent, prompting Employer to issue a notice informing Claimant that his disability status would change from total to partial. This modification did not decrease the amount of Claimant\u2019s weekly benefits, see 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(3) (\u201cUnless otherwise adjudicated or agreed to based upon a determination of earning power ..., the amount of compensation shall not be affected as a result of the change in disability status and shall remain the same.\u201d), but instead, had the effect of limiting Claimant\u2019s receipt of benefits to a 500-week period, see id. \u00a7 512(1) (prescribing that partial disability benefits are to be paid \u201cfor not more than five hundred weeks\u201d).\nClaimant proceeded to file a review petition attacking the validity of the IRE. Claimant did not aver that there had been a determination that he actually met the threshold impairment rating of at least 50 percent, as facially is required to support a challenge to an IRE under Section 306(a.2). See id. \u00a7 511.2(4) (\u201cAn employe may appeal the change to partial disability ... [pjrovided, [tjhat there is a determination that the employe meets the threshold impairment rating that is equal to or greater than fifty per centum impairment^]\u201d). Nevertheless, Claimant proceeded under prevailing Commonwealth Court precedent holding that such requirement does not pertain where the challenge is lodged, as it was here, within 60 days after the employer provides the claimant with notice of the status change from total to partial disability. See Barrett v. WCAB (Sunoco, Inc.), 987 A.2d 1280, 1288-89 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010). It was Claimant\u2019s position that the Physician-Evaluator had failed to rate the full range of work-related injuries, since Claimant suffered from adjustment disorder with depressed mood and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his work injury.\nAt hearings before a workers\u2019 compensation judge (the \u201cWCJ\u201d), Claimant adduced his own testimony concerning the circumstances surrounding his injury and his initial and ongoing symptoms and treatment. According to this testimony, Claimant developed, and continued to experience, impairment in the use of his hands, agonizing deep pain, and debilitating exhaustion. See, e.g., N.T., Dec. 16, 2011, at 7-8.\nClaimant later supplemented the record with deposition testimony from his family physician, Debra A. Bell, M.D., who had diagnosed Claimant with the adjustment disorder with depressed mood and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder and treated him for such conditions. See Deposition of Debra A. Bell, M.D., dated Mar. 20, 2012, in Duffy v. Trola-Dyne Inc., No. 3485314 (DLI, Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp.), at 16, 18. Claimant also introduced deposition testimony from a neurologist, Scott M. Cherry, M.D., who attested that Claimant\u2019s injury had evolved into a disabling, chronic neuropathic pain syndrome attended by emotional and cognitive changes. See Deposition of Scott M. Cherry, M.D., dated Dec. 9, 2011, in Duffy, No. 3485314, at 14, 16, 19, 33.\nEmployer presented the Physician-Evaluator\u2019s testimony supporting the rating evaluation that he conducted. The Physician-Evaluator explained that, in addition to accounting for Claimant\u2019s physical condition, he also considered Claimant\u2019s complaints of pain, encompassing \u201cwork-related chronic neuro-pathic pain syndrome,\u201d Deposition of Bruce E. Sicilia, M.D., dated July 27, 2012, in Duffy, No. 3485314, at 23, 25, rating the condition according to a sensory impairment table provided in the governing impairment guidelines, see id. at 24. See generally 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1) (keying impairment rating evaluations to \u201cthe most recent edition of the American Medical Association \u2018Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment\u2019 \u201d). According to the Physician-Evaluator, however, the rating did not account for asserted work-related adjustment disorder or post-traumatic stress syndrome. In this regard, the Physician-Evaluator offered the following explanation:\nI am not a psychiatrist and I don\u2019t have appropriate skills, if you will, to do that type of assessment. And I was specifically asked to assess his electrical burn injuries and I did that.\nDeposition of Bruce E. Sicilia, M.D., dated July 27, 2012, in Duffy, No. 3485314, at 31.\nA clinical and forensic psychiatrist, Timothy J. Michals, M.D., also testified, via deposition on Employer\u2019s behalf, that he had evaluated Claimant and concluded that he had recovered from the adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood. See Deposition of Timothy J. Michals, M.D., dated Aug. 1, 2012, in Duffy, No. 3485314, at 26-27. Dr. Michals further expressed his disagreement with the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. See id. at 32-34.\nThe WCJ accepted Claimant\u2019s evidence as credible and rejected Employer\u2019s conflicting evidence, directed that Claimant\u2019s psychological conditions should be added to the notice of compensation payable, and determined that the IRE was invalid, because the Physician-Evaluator had not addressed those conditions. Accordingly, the WCJ also found that the total-disability status assigned to Claimant\u2019s benefits could not be modified.\nOn appeal, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board reversed the decision to invalidate the IRE, reasoning that a physician-evaluator may properly limit an impairment rating evaluation according to the accepted injuries as reflected in a notice of compensation payable. Along these lines, the Board observed that Claimant had not sought to amend the NCP to include additional injuries in a timely fashion, but instead, waited to do so until almost six months after the IRE was performed. The Board thus held that the six percent impairment rating assigned by the Physician-Evaluator was valid and, accordingly, modified the status of Claimant\u2019s benefits from total to partial disability.\nOn further appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board\u2019s order in a published opinion. See Duffey v. WCAB (Trola-Dyne, Inc.), 119 A.3d 445 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015). From the outset of its analysis, the intermediate court emphasized that Section 306(a.2) requires a determination of the degree of impairment \u201cdue to the compensable injury.\u201d Id. at 450 (emphasis in original). The court then focused most of its remaining analysis on the \"compensable injury\u201d component of this phrase, explaining that the notice of compensation payable establishes the description of the work injury. See id. at 451 (quoting Harrison v. WCAB (Auto Truck Transp. Corp.), 78 A.3d 699, 703 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2013)). In light of this approach\u2014 and given that an impairment rating evaluation involves an assessment of a claimant\u2019s condition at the time of the evaluation, see id. (quoting Westmoreland Reg\u2019l Hosp. v. WCAB (Pickford), 29 A.3d 120, 128 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2011))\u2014the court indicated that \u201cthe focus in determining the validity of an [impairment rating evaluation] is on the state of the claimant and the compensable injury, as described in the [notice of compensation payable] at the time the [impairment rating evaluation] is performed.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original).\nAfter distinguishing several previous decisions, the Commonwealth Court expressed its disinclination to \u201cbelieve that the General Assembly intended to nullify an already performed and otherwise valid IRE by claims of new or additional injuries that were not yet determined to be work-related and, therefore, would not have been addressed by the [evaluating] physician.\u201d Id. at 452. To hold otherwise, the court posited, would contravene the reform goals of the 1996 amendment to the WCA which had implemented Section 306(a.2). See id. at 452-53.\nAlong these lines, the Commonwealth Court suggested that a contrary holding would encourage claimants to effectively sabotage impairment rating evaluations. See id. at 453 (\u201cThe delay in adding injuries as a litigation strategy to defeat an [impairment rating evaluation] performed under Section 306(a.2) does not serve the purpose of the IRE process or the 1996 Amendments to the Act\u201d). In this respect, the intermediate court stressed that an employer has only a single opportunity to obtain a self-executing change of a claimant\u2019s status from total to partial disability. See id. (\u201cClaimant\u2019s position would effectively strip Employer of its only opportunity to obtain a self-executing change in disability status, by adding injuries to the [notice of compensation payable] after the IRE is performed and having the IRE declared invalid.\u201d). According to the court, claimants should be encouraged to be proactive in updating notices of compensation payable so that their constellation of injuries can be considered in impairment rating evaluations. See id.\nWe find the outcome of this ease to be controlled by straightforward statutory interpretation, a matter over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., Fish v. Twp. of Lower Merion, 633 Pa. 705, 713-14, 128 A.3d 764, 769 (2015). At the outset, we reiterate that a pervasive focus on \u201ccompensable injury\u201d has obscured an important aspect of the governing statute. See supra note 5. In this regard, Section 306(a.2) explicitly invests in physician-evaluators the obligation to \u201cdetermine the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury,\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1) (emphasis added). Per such express terms, a physician-evaluator must consider and determine causality in terms of whether any particular impairment is \u201cdue to\u201d the compen-sable injury. Id. Moreover, the required evaluation is of \u201cthe percentage of permanent impairment of the whole body resulting from the compensable injury.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(8)(ii).\nWe have no difference with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s reasonable holding that a notice of compensation payable should define \u201ccompensable injury\u201d for purposes of this inquiry. Such recognition, however, simply does not determine the range of impairments which may be \u201cdue to\u201d such injury. Under Section 306(a.2) and the applicable impairment guidelines, the physician-evaluator must exercise professional judgment to render appropriate decisions concerning both causality and apportionment. See id.; accord Am. Med. Ass\u2019n, Guides To the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Ch. 2, Introduction (6th ed. 2009) (the \u201cAMA Guides\u201d) (\u201cPhysicians must use their clinical knowledge, skills, and abilities to arrive at a specific diagnosis; define the pathology; and rate impairments based on the Guides\u2019 criteria.\u201d),\nIt is noteworthy that causation, for purposes of the AMA Guides, is assessed, in the first instance, by reference to an \u201cevent\u201d rather than an \u201cinjury,\u201d thus creating some potential tension with Section 306(a.2)\u2019s focus on causal association with a compensable injury. See AMA Guides \u00a7 2.5b (\u201cCausality is an association between a given cause (an event capable of producing an effect) and an effect (a condition that can result from a specific cause) with a reasonable degree of medical probability.\u201d). But cf. id. Ch. 2, Introduction (depicting the AMA Guides as a \u201ctool to translate human pathology resulting from a trauma or disease process into a percentage of the whole person\u201d). Accordingly, there may be some basis in the AMA Guides permitting a physician-evaluator to attribute a claimant\u2019s psychological disorders to the event in which the claimant was injured, rather than to the compensable injury itself. Again, however, a physician-evaluator simply may not entirely disavow any and all responsibility to consider causality relative to a given condition. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1).\nHere, it is apparent from the record that the Physician-Evaluator did not apply professional judgment to assess (or, per the applicable regulations, arrange for an assessment of) the psychological conditions identified by Claimant during the IRE examination; nor did he determine whether such conditions as might have been diagnosed were fairly attributable to Claimant\u2019s compensable injury. Instead of abiding by the directives of Section 306(a.2) and the AMA Guides in such regards, the Physician-Evaluator purported to take a different set of instructions from Employer. See Deposition of Bruce E. Sicilia, M.D., dated July 27, 2012, in Duffy, No. 3485314, at 31 (\u201cI was specifically asked to assess his electrical burn injuries and I did that.\u201d). Proceeding as such, the Physician-Evaluator simply ignored a range of potential diagnoses and impairments. See, e.g., id. at 15 (reflecting the evaluator\u2019s testimony that Claimant\u2019s depression \u201cwas not rateable [sic] at the time because I was not asked to rate it.\u201d (emphasis added)). Again, however, the Physician-Evaluator was bound to take his guidance, not from Employer, but from Section 306(a.2) and the AMA Guides. See AMA Guides \u00a7 2.3b (\u201cAs an impairment evaluator, the physician must understand the regulations pertaining to medical practice and evaluation.\u201d); id. Chapter 2, Introduction (\u201cPhysicians must use their clinical knowledge, skills, and abilities to arrive at a specific diagnosis; define the pathology; and rate impairments based on the Guides\u2019 criteria.\u201d).\nThe Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion may reflect a pragmatic approach in requiring claimants manifesting psychological symptoms deriving from a compensable injury to address the causality question in advance of an impairment rating evaluation. There may obviously be an attendant concern that the alternative is to require psychological assessments in the broader range of impairment rating evaluations.\nThere are competing considerations involved, however. For example, injuries often are depicted briefly, and even cryptically, on notices of compensation payable. Furthermore, benefits ultimately cease as a result of an unfavorable rating evaluation, although a claimant may remain, in conventional terms, totally disabled and unable to provide for his or her own well-being. See generally IA Constr., 635 Pa. at 553-54, 139 A.3d at 155 (discussing the distinction between impairment and disability in terms of the focus of the latter term on loss of earnings capacity); AMA Guides \u00a7 2.3b (reflecting that the object of the impairment rating process is \u201cto enable a fair and competent determination of benefits to which the [subject of the evaluation] may be entitled\u201d).\nMoreover, per the AMA Guides, as a matter of clinical judgment, a physician-evaluator may, where appropriate, treat the impairment rating pertaining to a particular organ or body system as encompassing a whole body assessment. See AMA Guides \u00a7\u00a7 2.2a, 14.1c (reflecting the general rule that \u201c[t]he psychological distress associated with a physical impairment is ... included within the rating\u201d for a physical condition (emphasis in original)). In point of fact, the AMA Guides rather pointedly discourage separate treatment of psychological effects. See AMA Guides \u00a7 14.1c (\u201cIn most cases of a mental and behavioral disorder accompanying a physical impairment, ... the mental and behavioral disorder chapter should not be used.\u201d (emphasis added)). In this regard, it devolves to the physician-evaluator\u2019s sound professional judgment whether, and under what circumstances, psychological conditions effectively graduate to distinct consideration per the AMA Guides\u2019 mental-and-behavioral-disorders protocols.\nIn all events, the evaluative judgment is the touchstone on these subjects, as well as on the topic of causality. In the present case, since the Physician-Examiner failed to exercise such judgment based on a misunderstanding concerning the scope of his responsibilities, the WCJ did not err in invalidating the IRE.\nThe dissenting opinion authored by Justice Wecht chastises this opinion on multiple fronts, asserting that we have: exceeded the scope of the issues presented; ignored the statutory definition of \u201cimpairments\u201d; compromised the impairment-rating process; inappropriately misalloeated decision-making responsibility relative to causation from workers\u2019 compensation judges to physician-evaluators; and disregarded the significance of the fourth edition of the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.\nRegarding the issue preservation concern, Justice Wecht characterizes the question presented as a narrow one limited to the following:\nDoes an amendment that expands the injury description on a notice of compensation payable (\u201cNCP\u201d) invalidate an impairment rating evaluation (\u201cIRE\u201d) that was conducted before the amendment?\nDissenting Opinion at 77-78, 152 A.3d at 998 (Wecht, J.), In point of fact, however, the issue accepted for review is framed in a considerably different fashion, see Duffey v. WCAB (Trola-Dyne, Inc.), 635 Pa. 61, 61, 131 A.3d 480, 481 (2016) (per curiam), as are the arguments in Claimant\u2019s brief.\nWhile, as we have previously explained, the issue statement and Claimant's arguments are clouded by a conflation of the terms \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cimpairment,\u201d see supra note 5, Claimant\u2019s brief otherwise makes clear that he is advancing the position that a physician-evaluator has an obligation \u201cto address all work-related conditions at the time of the evaluation.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 19 (emphasis added). Unfortunately, the difficulty with the terms \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cimpairment\u201d arises from the complexity of these overlapping and intersecting\u2014 but also diverging\u2014concepts. See, e.g., swpra note 10. Indeed, such conflation appears to be quite common. See, e.g., Dissenting Opinion at 77, 152 A.3d at 998 (Wecht, J.) (incorrectly asserting that the holding of this opinion is that physicians must assess all of the claimant\u2019s \u201cinjuries,\u201d when in point of fact, we have repeatedly explained that the statutorily prescribed duty is simply to assess \u201cthe degree of impairment due to the compensable injury\u201d on a \u201cwhole body\u201d basis, 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1), (8)(ii) (emphasis added)).\nAs a more general observation, a Court of last resort must have some leeway to make rational judgments and pronouncements that are not strictly confined according to the precise letter of parties\u2019 arguments. Otherwise, the law would be shaped according to the nuances of the litigants\u2019 presentations, including the extremes toward which they sometimes press their positions within the adversary system. Such latitude is particularly appropriate in matters involving statutory construction, where the language of the governing statute ultimately must remain the polestar for rulings having widespread application. Again, from our point of view, Claimant\u2019s position sufficiently implicates a plain-meaning interpretation of Section 306(a.2), and the need for clarification is sufficiently great, that the substantial differences between our approach and that of the dissents should be\u2014and are fairly\u2014resolved at the present time,\nIn reply to the criticism that we have disregarded the statutory definition of \u201cimpairment,\u201d see Dissenting Opinion at 77, 152 A.3d at 998 (Wecht, J.), notably, the dissent fails to provide a concrete explanation. To the degree that the dissent is suggesting that the statutory definition excludes psychological impairments, this is contradicted by both Section 306(a.2) and the AMA Guides which it incorporates. Alternatively, to the extent that the dissent is proposing a rule that psychological \u201cimpairment\u201d can result only from a psychological \u201cinjury,\u201d it fails to offer any textual grounding in the governing statute to support such a proposition. Indeed, as we have otherwise explained, psychological impairments are generally factored into the ratings for physical ones under the AMA Guides. See AMA Guides \u00a7\u00a7 2.2a, 14.1c. In this way\u2014or through the alternative rating infrastructure provided in Chapter 14 of the AMA Guides where implicated\u2014psychological impairments are always a component of the \u201cwhole body\u201d assessment explicitly required under Section 302(a.2). 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(8)(ii). From our perspective, the dissent\u2019s contrary approach unduly intermingles traditional compensation concepts into an impairment rating regime that, by its explicit terms, institutes a different focus.\nNext, we address the assertion, in Justice Wecht\u2019s dissent, that we have \u201cconvert[ed] the statute\u2019s impairment-rating process into one in which physicians must scrutinize each \u2018condition\u2019 hinted at by a claimant, and then determine which, if any, are \u2018fairly attributable\u2019 to the compensable injury.\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 79-80, 152 A.3d at 998 (Wecht, J.). From our point of view, this line of argument reductio ad absurdum understates the role of the permanency threshold for impairments (such that a cough or a cold would not qualify), see 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(8)(ii), as well as the statutory causation requirement that the impairment be \u201cdue to\u201d the compensable injury, id. \u00a7 511.2(1). Moreover, we do not find it to be at all unreasonable to believe that the Legislature intended to require a physician to render a detailed whole-person evaluation in order to support an ultimate termination of benefits for injured persons whose right to seek legal redress has been substantially limited, see id. \u00a7 481(a), and who may remain permanently disabled in the traditional sense.\nRegarding Justice Wecht\u2019s position that a workers\u2019 compensation judge must determine causation for impairments, we reiterate that this directly contradicts Section 306(a.2)\u2019s express directive that the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury is determined \u201cbased upon an evaluation by a physician ... pursuant to the most recent edition of the [AMA Guides].\u201d Id. \u00a7 511.2(1). To the extent that the dissent is suggesting that workers\u2019 compensation judges and not physicians have the qualifications to render causation determinations, this overlooks the pervasive reliance by workers\u2019 compensation judges upon expert medical opinion testimony from physicians in the adjudicatory setting.\nCertainly Section 306(a.2) introduced an innovation into the workers\u2019 compensation system by directing an automatic impact on benefits premised on a physician\u2019s determination, see 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(2), thus displacing the conventional involvement of a judicial or quasi-judicial decision-maker in the adjustment of substantive liabilities. This substantial change, however, is dictated by the statute and not of this Court\u2019s own accord, and nothing in the statute supports the sort of parsing of the decision-making responsibility expressly allocated by the Legislature to physician-evaluators favored by Justice Wecht\u2019s dissent.\nNotably, we have otherwise identified deficiencies in the impairment rating statute and suggested that the system is ripe for legislative review and adjustment. See I.A. Constr. Corp., 635 Pa. at 561-63, 139 A.3d at 159-61. Unless and until this occurs, however, it is our considered judgment that courts should adhere as closely as possible to the existing statutory directives, subject to constitutional limitations, rather than supplementing and/or adjusting these based on judicial policy-making judgments. From our point of view, such restraint is particularly in order given the many compromises and tradeoffs inherent in a workers\u2019 compensation liability scheme, among competing interests which each are very important in their own right. See id. at 563, 139 A.3d at 161.\nFinally, to the extent that Justice Wecht\u2019s dissent suggests that the fourth edition of the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment does not permit the rating of mental and behavioral impairments, see Dissenting Opinion at 81-83, 152 A.3d at 1000-01 (Wecht, J.), this is an issue of first impression in this Court which is well beyond the scope of this appeal. Nevertheless, we note that some other jurisdictions are in square disagreement with the dissent\u2019s position that the fourth edition \u201ccategorically rejects the use of impairment percentages in the context of mental disorders,\u201d id. at 82, 152 A.3d at 1001. See Harvey v. H.C. Price Co., 957 A.2d 960, 962-68 (Me. 2008) (approving of the assignment of a percentage of impairment to the psychological component of an injury in a workers\u2019 compensation system requiring the use of the fourth edition for impairment rating purposes and explaining that the method for establishing a percentage was \u201ca product of [the physician-evaluator\u2019s] medical training, clinical judgment, and application of the AMA Guides\u201d). Alternatively, if assignment of impairment ratings pertaining to psychological impairments by evaluators is found to be impossible under the fourth edition, it may well be that the statute should simply be deemed incapable of enforcement as applied, and no conversions to partial disability should occur for claimants who suffer from serious work-related psychological impairments. Accord Torrey & Greenberg, West\u2019s PA. Prac., Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 6.52 (advocating such position).\nIn any event, as should be clear from the above, this case does not present questions pertaining to the fourth edition, and, unlike the dissent, we do not view these as overarching or disabling for present purposes. See Dissenting Opinion at 82, 152 A.3d at 1000 (Wecht, J.). Rather, we believe this opinion addresses a matter that is important in its own right. Again, we hold that physician-examiners must exercise independent professional judgment to make a whole-body assessment of \u201cthe degree of impairment due to the compensa-ble injury,\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1), which discernment cannot be withheld on the basis that the physician-examiner believes the undertaking is a more limited one.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for reinstatement of the finding of invalidity rendered by the WCJ.\nJustices Todd, Donohue, Dougherty and Mundy join the opinion.\nJustice Baer files a dissenting opinion.\nJustice Wecht files a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736 (as amended 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1041.4, 2501-2626 (the \"WCA\u201d or the \"Act\u201d)).\n. This Court recently summarized the impairment rating regime in IA Construction Corporation v. WCAB (Rhodes), 635 Pa. 551, 553-56, 139 A.3d 154, 155-56 (2016).\n. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(2) (prescribing that, if an impairment rating determination under Section 306(a.2)(l) results in an impairment rating of less than 50 percent impairment under the relevant criteria, \"the employe shall then receive partial disability benefits under [Section 306(b)]\u2019\u2019); see also 34 Pa. Code \u00a7 123.105(d) (providing for a requisite notice to the employee of the change in status from total to partial disability).\n. It is beyond the scope of this appeal to consider the validity of the Commonwealth Court's precedent on the subject of whether Section 306(a.2)(4) applies to challenges lodged within the 60-day period.\n. As further discussed below, Claimant\u2019s framing of his argument, which has continued into the present appeal, is misleading. In this regard, physician-evaluators do not specifically rate \"injuries\u201d; rather, it is their obligation under the governing statute to determine \u201cthe degree of impairment due to the compensable injury.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1). Thus, the rating is of impairments deriving from injuries. Despite this diversion, Claimant\u2019s arguments do incorporate the notion that an impairment rating evaluator has \"the obligation to address all work-related conditions existing at the time of the evaluation.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 19 (emphasis added). Accordingly, although Claimant\u2019s focus on rating injuries as opposed to impairments is pervasive, we find that his arguments do subsume the contention that an impairment rating evaluator is obliged to \"determine the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury,\" 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1) (emphasis added), regardless of whether such impairment is otherwise separately denoted as a compensable injury unto itself.\n. The Commonwealth Court further observed that its decision did not foreclose a subsequent challenge to the IRE under Section 306(a.2)(4), to the degree that Claimant could produce an impairment rating evaluation demonstrating at least 50 percent impairment. See id. (citing 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(4)).\n. Parenthetically, the Commonwealth Court has separately determined that the 6th edition of the AMA Guides cannot be used to conduct impairment rating evaluations in Pennsylvania. See Protz v. WCAB (Derry Area Sch. Dist.), 124 A.3d 406, 416-17 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015), appeal granted, 635 Pa. 198, 133 A.3d 733 (2016) (per curiam). Claimant, however, did not raise such a challenge, and the validity of the use of the 6th edition is beyond the scope of the present appeal.\n. In dissent, Justice Baer posits that the outcome of this case should turn on an event-injury dichotomy. See Dissenting Opinion at 75, 76 n.1, 152 A.3d at 996, 997 n.1 (Baer, J.), According to the dissent, Claimant does not attribute his psychological conditions to his electrical burn injury, id. at 75, 152 A.3d at 996\u2014which has been recognized by Employer to encompass bilateral nerve and joint pain in the hands\u2014 and it should be obvious that the incident and the recognized injury are entirely distinct, see id. To the contrary, however, although Claimant does explain that he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder \"from the incident,\u201d he depicts this to encompass the electrical \"lead in his left hand consisting] of two wires ... melt[ing] to the bones in his hand.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 3. Moreover, the expert testimony that Claimant offered and which was credited by the workers' compensation judge described an ongoing pain syndrome originating in Claimant\u2019s hands, as well as a failure to improve from physical impairments, yielding derivative psychological conditions, See, e.g., Deposition of Scott M. Cherry, M.D., dated Dec. 9, 2011, in Duffy, No. 3485314, at 12-13 (describing the ongoing pain syndrome); id. at 14 (\"I felt that he had, as was clearly obvious, the electrical injury and that this subsequently evolved into a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome\u201d); id. at 33 (\"The stated injuiy, ... electrical burn injury was followed by a syndrome of chronic pain complicated by emotional and cognitive changes.\u201d); Deposition of Debra A. Bell, M.D., dated Mar. 20, 2012, in Duffy, No. 3485314, at 16 (attributing Claimant\u2019s adjustment disorder to his failure to improve after his initial injury); id. at 27-28 (opining that Claimant\u2019s post-traumatic stress disorder was caused by his previous physical impairment).\nWe believe that the impairment rating process encompasses discerning judgments recognizing the complexity of injury and causation, arising in part because notions of an \"incident\u201d (presently described by the dissent as \"being electrocuted at work\u201d) and attendant \u201cinjuries\u201d (here, electrical burn and attendant nerve and joint pain) can be integrally interrelated. See infra note 10. In this case, however, the Physician-Examiner made no such judgments related to an event-injury distinction or otherwise, and such failure is both the specific basis for our decision and a matter about which Claimant expressly complains. See, e.g., Brief for Appellant at 14 (attacking the IRE because the Physician-Examiner \"did not rate [the additional diagnoses] because of the limited scope of his exam and his lack of qualifications pertaining to those conditions.\" (emphasis added)).\n, See 34 Pa. Code \u00a7 123.105(b) (\"To ascertain an accurate percentage of the employee\u2019s whole body impairment, when the evaluating physician determines that the compensable injury incorporates more than one pathology, the evaluating physician may refer the employee to one or more physicians specializing in the specific pathologies which constitute the compensable injury.\u201d).\n. In this regard, there is a tendency, in the workers\u2019 compensation arena, to oversimplify what can sometimes be complex subjects, such as injury and impairment. See generally AMA Guides \u00a7 1.3b (recognizing \"the complex and dynamic interactions between an individual with a given health condition, the environment, and personal factors\u201d); id. \u00a7 1.5a (\u201cImpairment and disability are complex concepts ....\u201d); id. (\"[T]he impact of injury or illness is dependent on factors beyond physical and psychological aspects, including biopsychosocial, behavioral and contextual issues.\u201d).\n. Citing to a listing of rules set forth in Chapter 14 of the AMA Guides, Justice Wecht\u2019s dissent eschews the exercise of sound medical expertise and judgment, see Dissenting Opinion at 81, 152 A.3d at 1000 (Wecht, J.), which is otherwise the touchstone of impairment rating evaluations. See, e.g., AMA Guides \u00a7 2.3b. The dissent, however, fails to recognize that the rules to which it refers are expressed in non-exclusive terms. See AMA Guides at \u00a7 14.1c (stating that the rules for using Chapter 14 \"would include\u201d those highlighted by the dissent). See generally Mishoe v. Erie Ins. Co., 573 Pa. 267, 288, 824 A.2d 1153, 1165 (2003) (explaining that the term \"includes\u201d represents \"non-exclusive verbiage\u201d). In any event, we have not disputed that the Physician-Examiner potentially could have appropriately relied on rules stated in Chapter 14, otherwise invoked principles under the AMA Guides, or exercised sound professional judgment to exclude Chapter 14\u2019s application. However, as developed in the text above, the record amply demonstrates that that simply is not what occurred in the present case. Rather, the Physician-Examiner erroneously followed instructions that were extrinsic to the AMA Guides, as well as the terms of the governing statute.\n. Per this Court\u2019s order allowing the appeal, the issue accepted for review is as follows:\nDid the Commonwealth Court err in concluding that an Impairment Rating Evaluation (IRE) ... was valid where the IRE only considered the injuries listed on the notice of compensation payable issued at the time of the injury, and did not consider additional injuries that subsequently arose and were known at the time of the IRE but not yet formally added to the description of injury?\nId. As Justice Wecht\u2019s dissent stresses, Claimant does accept an additional obligation to secure a post-evaluation modification of the notice of compensation payable within a reasonable time after a contested rating evaluation. In our considered opinion, however, this does not prevent us from recognizing Claimant's explicit assertions of an error on the part of the Physician-Evaluator in the first instance in declining to consider the degree of whole-body impairment due to the compensa-ble injury as the governing statute explicitly requires. See 77 P.S, \u00a7 511.2(1), (8).\n. Accord id. at 7 (\"The Claimant submits that for an IRE to be valid, all of the Claimant\u2019s work-related conditions at the time of the IRE must be rated.\u2019\u2019); id. at 8 (explaining that Claimant advised the Physician-Evaluator of his psychological conditions at the time of the evaluation and faulting the Physician-Evaluator for failing as a consequence to consider such conditions in the rating evaluation); Brief for Amicus Pa. Ass'n for Justice at 5 (\"[T]he Court should hold that in a timely filed appeal of an IRE determination, if the evidence shows that the IRE did not consider all work related pathologies, then the IRE is invalid.\u201d).\n. For example, an amputation is both an \u201cinjury,\u201d see, e.g., 77 P.S. \u00a7 513, and an impairment, see, e.g,, AMA Guides at \u00a7 15.6 (discussing \"Amputation Impairment\u201d). Accordingly, to the extent that the dissent envisions a categorical division between the two\u2014per which a condition that may be an injury for purposes of the traditional compensation regime cannot also represent a derivative impairment for purposes of the distinct impairment rating regime, see Dissenting Opinion at 78-79, 152 A.3d at 998-99 (Wecht, J.)\u2014such portrayal is incorrect.\n. To the degree that the dissents discern unfairness to Employer, we note that Claimant quotes the governing statute in his brief, see Brief for Appellant at 9 (explaining that an IRE is permitted \"to determine the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury,\u201d (quoting 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1)), while repeatedly arguing that the Physician-Examiner erred by failing to account for his derivative psychological conditions, Indeed, Employer recognizes both that Claimant's arguments are multidimensional and that they encompass the notion that \"the IRE should have taken into account any and all possible injuries that [Claimant] might have had from the work injury.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 14 (emphasis added). Apparently based on such understanding, Employer ably advances all of the policy positions highlighted in the dissents. See, e.g., id. at 15, 19, 23-24.\nIn response to Justice Wecht's claim that our decision to implement the plain import of the governing statute represents a substantial change in workers\u2019 compensation practice, Dissenting Opinion at 79-80, 152 A.3d at 998-99 (Wecht, J.), certainly the dissent has not identified any decisional law from this Court that is in conflict with our holding. For example, the Commercial Credit Claims decision which the dissent highlights was expressly decided under the distinct statutory language of the WCA\u2019s modification and termination schemes, see Commercial Credit Claims v. WCAB (Lancaster), 556 Pa. 325, 332, 728 A.2d 902, 905 (1999) (explaining that the disposition of the case was \"plainly dictated by the relevant statutory provisions\u201d), whereas, our present decision is premised on the plain language of an entirely different statute. Moreover, it appears that the Commonwealth Court otherwise has recognized that the impairment rating system introduced a new conceptual overlay into the workers\u2019 compensation regime. See, e.g., Harrison v. WCAB (Auto Truck Transp. Corp.), 78 A.3d 699, 703-04 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2013) (discussing an impairment rating \"based on all of the claimant\u2019s medical conditions,\u201d while highlighting the conceptual difference between a traditional compensation determination and an impairment rating evaluation).\n. See, e.g., 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(8)(ii) (defining \"impairment rating\u201d in terms of the degree of impairment to the \"whole body,\u201d which obviously encompasses the brain and functioning); AMA Guides \u00a7 1.3d (defining \"impairment\u201d to include deviation, loss, or loss of use of any ... body function,\u201d which is separately defined under Section 1.3c to include \"psychological functions\u201d); see also id. at \u00a7\u00a7 14.1b, 14.5 (discussing \"psychiatric impairment\u201d).\n. To the extent that the dissents express concerns about malingering, notably, the General Assembly integrated a potent safeguard into the impairment-rating regime, via its prescription that conversions may only be subject to challenge upon a determination that a claimant meets the fifty-percent impairment threshold. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(4); see also supra note 4 and accompanying text. The Commonwealth Court, however, has relieved claimants filing appeals within 60-days after notice of an automatic conversion of such condition, based upon the requirement that claimants be noticed of the conversion and attendant due process. See Johnson v. WCAB (Sealy Components Group), 982 A.2d 1253, 1257 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2009). See generally Torrey & Greenberg, West's PA. Prac., Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 6.48.50 (characterizing Johnson as a \"remarkable case\u201d). Although Johnson represents prevailing Pennsylvania precedent, it has not been subject to this Court\u2019s substantive review, and we believe that it would be unfortunate if the understanding of other key aspects of Legislature\u2019s intent in the impairment rating system (i.e., the responsibility expressly invested in physician-examiners to determine the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury) were to be colored by an intermediate court's deviation (whether correct or incorrect) from the plain import of others.\n. In this regard, we note that the approach of tying the continuation of disability benefits to impairment rating protocols has been decried by many physicians and characterized as \"unappealing, if not Orwellian\u201d in commentary. David B. Torrey & Andrew E. Greenberg, West\u2019s PA. Prac., Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 6.51 (2008 & July 2016 Supp.) (quoting Nortin M. Hadler, Impairment Rating in Disability Determination for Low Back Pain: Placing the AMA Guides and the Quebec Institute Report in Perspective, in John F. Burton, Jr. & Timothy P, Schmidle, Workers\u2019 Compensation Desk Book 1-132 (LRP Pubs. 1992)); see also id. at \u00a7 6:48:50 (discussing controversy surround the AMA Guides, including the criticism that they lack any empirical basis). We malte this observation not as an adoption of such viewpoint, but rather, to add perspective to our adherence to the specific statutory directives embodying the legislative policy choices that have been made in the impairment-rating arena.",

      {
        "text": "DISSENTING OPINION\nJUSTICE BAER\nAs noted by the majority, Michael Duffey, Claimant herein, did not focus his argument on the issue addressed by the majority, namely, whether Bruce E. Sicilia, M.D., \u201cthe Physician-Evaluator\u201d conducting the IRE, was obligated to evaluate Claimant\u2019s PTSD/adjustment disorder as an impairment arising from the compensable injury set forth in the NCP. Majority Opinion at 59 n.5,152 A.3d at 986 n.5. Rather, \u201cit was Claimant\u2019s position that the Physician-Evaluator had failed to rate the full range of work-related injuries, since Claimant suffered from adjustment disorder with depressed mood and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his work injury.\u201d Id. at 59, 152 A.3d at 986. Nevertheless, the majority finds that the issue argued by Claimant sufficiently subsumes the analysis conducted by the majority. Specifically, the majority holds that a physician must consider the causal relationship between the compensable injury and any impairment articulated by a claimant at the IRE, and fully evaluate those impairments as part of the IRE examination. The majority\u2019s departure from the issue as expressed by Claimant is problematic for several reasons.\nFirst, Claimant has never posited that his PTSD/adjustment disorder derived in any way from his accepted compensable work-related injury set forth in the NCP, ie., his hand injury. To the contrary, it has been Claimant\u2019s position throughout all of the prior proceedings that the PTSD and adjustment disorder are independent injuries that, like his hand injury, derived directly from being electrocuted at work. Indeed, it seems obvious that the PTSD and adjustment disorder do not derive from claimant\u2019s hand injury but, if compensable, are a result of being electrocuted. The majority takes the view that, regardless, the Physician-Evaluator conducting the IRE must independently evaluate any mentioned impairment a claimant makes at the examination and consider the causal relationship between the impairment and the compensable injury in the NCP. Majority Opinion at 64, 152 A.3d at 989. Thus, even in a case like this, where the Claimant himself does not purport that the impairment he is expressing, PTSD/adjustment disorder, is related to his accepted hand injury, if the physician fails to evaluate those conditions, then the IRE is to be disregarded by the WCJ. Id. at 66, 152 A.3d at 990.\nSecond, by addressing the issue that was raised by Claimant in a way that was not fully briefed and argued by the parties, the majority has altered the structure of how IRE proceedings will take place without input regarding the full ramifications that will result from such alteration. In my mind, the Court\u2019s holding will undermine the IRE process in general and permit claimants easily to invalidate otherwise fair IRE proceedings by simply expressing new physical and/or psychological conditions unknown to the employer, even ones that clearly were not derived from the injury set forth in the NCP. The claimant\u2019s mere expression will trigger an obligation on the part of the physician to evaluate these conditions, regardless of the injuries accepted as compensable, or risk having the IRE declared a nullity. This obligation will inject uncertainty and inefficiency into the IRE process, which is contrary to the goals of the legislature in enacting this legislation.\nSpecifically, pursuant to Section 306(a.2)(l) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1), when an employee has received total disability compensation for 104 weeks, unless otherwise agreed to, the employee will be required to submit to a medical examination (the IRE) for the purpose of determining the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury, if any. A duly rendered impairment rating is automatically effective if the employer/insurer requested the examination within 60 days after the expiration of the 104-week period prescribed by the statute. If such a determination results in an impairment rating that is equal to or greater than fifty percent impairment, then the employee will be presumed to be totally disabled and will continue to receive total disability compensation benefits. However, if such determination results in an impairment rating of less than fifty percent, then the employee will then receive partial disability benefits after proper notice.\nAn employer has only one opportunity under the Act to utilize the self-executing change; if employer requests an IRE beyond that short window, then employer must file a modification petition and litigate the requested change in disability status. Gardner v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Genesis Health Ventures), 585 Pa. 366, 888 A.2d 758, 767-68 (2005). The IRE procedure \u201cwas part of the General Assembly\u2019s 1996 reform effort intended to reduce rising Workers\u2019 Compensation costs and restore efficiency to the Workers\u2019 Compensation system.\u201d Hilyer v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Joseph T. Pastrill, Jr. Logging), 847 A.2d 232, 235 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004).\nHere, Employer requested the IRE within the 60 day window provided by subsection 306(a.2), which authorizes employers to issue the self-executing change of disability resulting from an IRE that establishes an impairment rating of less than fifty percent. 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1), (2), Employer specified that the Physician-Evaluator should determine the percentage of impairment from Claimant\u2019s hand injury, the only injury arising from the work incident accepted and set forth in the NCP. Although Claimant indicated at the time of the IRE that he suffered impairments from other work-related injuries arising from the work incident, I believe the physician properly limited his evaluation to the impairments associated with the compensable injury set forth in the NCP. As said, to hold otherwise is to subject the IRE process to chicanery having the potential to render it useless. Thus, I dissent and would affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision.\n, The majority responds to Justice Wecht\u2019s similar observation in dissent, that physician evaluators must now consider any condition hinted at by a claimant by noting that this ignores the statutory causation requirement that the impairment be \"due to\u201d the compensable injury. Majority Opinion at 71, 152 A.3d at 994. It seems to me, however, that the majority has ignored this very requirement where, as here, there is no allegation that the articulated impairment is \"due to\u201d the compensable injury; rather, Claimant alleges the impairment is due to the work incident.",

        "text": "DISSENTING OPINION\nJUSTICE WECHT\nSubsection 306(a.2) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides that impairment-rating physicians shall \u201cdetermine the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1). The learned Majority construes this to mean that physicians must assess all of the claimant\u2019s injuries, including those that the claimant\u2019s employer never accepted as compen-sable. The Majority arrives at this interpretation by disregarding the statutory definition of the word \u201cimpairment.\u201d Because the Majority\u2019s reading of Subsection 306(a.2) will compromise the impairment-rating process, which exists to quantify a claimant\u2019s whole body impairment due to his established work-related injuries, I respectfully dissent.\nThe issue that Duffey presents is narrow: Does an amendment that expands the injury description on a notice of compensation payable (\u201cNCP\u201d) invalidate an impairment rating evaluation (\u201cIRE\u201d) that was conducted before the amendment? Trola-Dyne maintains that it does not, arguing instead that claimants must file a petition to amend the NCP before the IRE occurs. In the event that a claimant fails to seek an amendment prior to the IRE, Trola-Dyne notes, the claimant still may contest the change to partial disability status \u201cat any time during the five hundred week period of partial disability,\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(4), by petitioning the WJC to amend the NCP and then obtaining an impairment rating of at least fifty percent. Brief for Trola-Dyne at 23. Duffey, on the other hand, argues that allowing post-IRE amendments to invalidate an already-completed IRE would not impose much of a burden on employers, who can simply require that the claimant submit to another IRE. Brief for Duffey at 18.\nThe Majority adopts neither party\u2019s position. Under the Majority\u2019s approach, claimants in Duffey\u2019s position need not file a petition to amend the NCP at all. This is so, the Majority reasons, because impairment-rating physicians have a duty to identify any injuries that are \u201cfairly attributable\u201d to the claimant\u2019s compensable injury. To be sure, the fact that Duf-fey himself has not advanced the Majority\u2019s reading of Subsection 306(a.2) does not mean that the issue is \u201cwaived\u201d or otherwise beyond the scope of our review. Maj. Op. at 67-69, 152 A.3d at 992-93. It is notable, however, that the interpretation which the Majority deems \u201cstraightforward\u201d was not championed by Duffey, his Amicus, Trola-Dyne, the Commonwealth Court, the Appeal Board, or the WCJ. Moreover, to my knowledge, no judicial or administrative tribunal expressed such an understanding of Subsection 306(a.2) throughout the two decades since Act 57 became effective.\nThe Majority\u2019s principal misstep is that it mislabels Duffey\u2019s psychological conditions, both of which are injuries in their own right, as \u201cimpairments\u201d that the IRE physician must diagnose and evaluate. Notably absent from the Majority\u2019s analysis is the fact that the Act defines \u201cimpairment\u201d as \u201can anatomic or functional abnormality or loss that results from the compensable injury and is reasonably presumed to be permanent.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(8)(i). Similarly, the Majority\u2019s thorough review of the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (\u201cthe Guides\u201d) fails to recognize that the AMA defines \u201cimpairment\u201d as \u201ca significant deviation, loss, or loss of use of any body structure or body function in an individual with a health condition, disorder, or disease.\u201d Am. Med. Ass\u2019n, Guides To the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 5 (6th ed. 2008). Under both definitions, losses could be anatomic (like amputation) or functional (like decreased range of motion or an inability to perform activities of daily living). As these definitions suggest, the purpose of an IRE is to determine whether the compensable injury has left the claimant with a permanent \u201closs,\u201d and, if so, to quantify it. Put differently, impairment ratings quantify losses and limitations, not diseases and disorders.\nNotwithstanding its repeated insistence that its holding flows from the plain language of Section 306(a.2), the Majority fails to elucidate the principle which can transform the statutory phrase \u201cthe degree of impairment due to the com-pensable injury\u201d into the unconfined styling \u201cthe degree of impairment due to injuries not yet determined to be compen-sable.\u201d With today\u2019s decision, the Majority by judicial fiat converts the statute\u2019s impairment-rating process into one in which physicians must scrutinize each \u201ccondition\u201d hinted at by a claimant, and then determine which, if any, are \u201cfairly attributable\u201d to the compensable injury. Maj. Op. at 65, 152 A.3d at 990. The Majority justifies this remodeling by citing a few nonspecific passages from the Guides. But, when deciding whether a particular malady is causally related to a claimant\u2019s work injury, the Guides are no more helpful to physicians than a copy of Moby-Dich. As the Majority correctly notes, the Guides are simply a \u201ctool to translate human pathology resulting from a trauma or disease process into a percentage of the whole person.\u201d Maj. Op. at 64, 152 A.3d at 989.\nThe Majority invokes the mandate (which no one disputes) that impairment-rating physicians must determine the degree of \u201cwhole-body\u201d or \u201cwhole-person\u201d impairment. Id. at 63-64, 65, 66 n.10, 68-69, 69 n.14, 70-71, 152 A.3d at 989, 990, 991 n.10, 992, 992 n.14, 993. However, the Majority misconstrues the concept of \u201cwhole-body\u201d impairment to mean that impairment-rating physicians must go beyond the scope of the claimant\u2019s compensable injury. See id. at 70 n.16, 152 A.3d at 993 n.16 (stating that whole-body impairment \u201cobviously encompasses the brain and functioning\u201d); 71, 152 A.3d at 994 (concluding that the General Assembly \u201cintended to require a physician to render a detailed whole-person evaluation\u201d).\nThe requirement that impairment ratings be expressed in terms of \u201cthe percentage of permanent impairment of the whole body,\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2, exists because the Guides\u2019 formulae differ across the various organ systems. Some chapters, like those relating to the musculoskeletal system, yield \u201cregional\u201d ratings, which must be converted into a whole-person rating. The complete loss of a hand, for instance, is equivalent to 90% upper-extremity impairment, while the complete loss of an upper extremity is equivalent to 60% whole-person impairment. Am. Med. Ass\u2019n, Guides To the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 22 (6th ed. 2008). In light of these hierarchical impairment schedules, the \u201cwhole-body\u201d requirement serves two important purposes. First, it ensures consistent impairment ratings across different organ systems, and second, it guarantees that a claimant\u2019s total impairment rating will not exceed 100%. Id. at 21-22.\nChapter 14 of the Guides, which relates to mental and behavioral disorders, also provides no support for the Majority\u2019s holding. As the Majority notes, the (Guides \u201crather pointedly discourage separate treatment of psychological effects.\u201d Maj. Op. at 66, 152 A.3d at 991. Specifically, physicians are to use Chapter 14: (1) if a mental or behavioral disorder is present without a physical impairment; (2) if a mental or behavioral disorder \u201cis judged independently compensable by the jurisdiction involved;\u201d or (3) when explicitly required by a particular state\u2019s compensation system. Am. Med. Ass\u2019n, Guides To the Evaluation op Permanent IMPAIRMENT 349 (6th ed. 2008) (emphasis in original). As with Subsection 306(a.2), these directives plainly contemplate that the scope of an IRE will be constrained by the \u201ccompensable injury.\u201d Id.; 77 P.S. \u00a7 611.2(1) (providing that impairment-rating physicians shall \u201cdetermine the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury\u201d). Thus, the Majority errs in opining that \u201cit devolves to the physician-evaluator\u2019s sound professional judgment whether, and under what circumstances, psychological conditions effectively graduate to distinct consideration per the Guides\u2019 mental-and-behavioral-disorders protocols.\u201d Maj. Op. at 67, 152 A.3d at 991.\nEven if the Sixth Edition of the Guides supported the Majority\u2019s statutory interpretation, I find it impossible to ignore the proverbial elephant-in-the-room that is Protz v. W.C.A.B. (Derry Area School Dist.), 124 A.3d 406 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015), appeal granted, 635 Pa. 198, 133 A.3d 733 (2016), in which the Commonwealth Court held that Subsection 306(a.2) constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of the General Assembly\u2019s legislative authority. Notably, that decision required that impairment-rating physicians use the Fourth Edition of the Guides. Protz, 124 A.3d at 416. Yet, the Majority\u2019s interpretation is driven, in part, by portions of the Sixth Edition that were not present in earlier versions. See Maj. Op. at 65-67, 152 A.3d at 990-91 (discussing Chapter 14 of the Guides, relating to \u201cMental and Behavioral Disorders\u201d).\nSetting aside the substantive legal issues in Protz, the appeal of which is currently pending before this Court, I see two problems with the Majority\u2019s use of the Guides to interpret Subsection 306(a.2). First, as a conceptual matter, I fail to discern why this Court should, or even how it could, divine the legislative intent of Subsection 306(a.2) by looking at a publication that the AMA released more than a decade after the General Assembly enacted the statute. To make matters worse, the Fourth Edition of the Guides\u2014the most recent version in existence when the General Assembly enacted Subsection 306(a.2) in 1996\u2014categorically rejects the use of impairment percentages in the context of mental disorders, and contains no formula for calculating them. Am. Med. Ass\u2019n, Guides To the Evaluation op Permanent Impairment 300 (4th ed. 1993) (explaining that there \u201cis no available empiric [sic] evidence to support any method for assigning a percentage of impairment\u201d to mental or behavioral disorders); id. at 301 (embracing the view that, \u201cunlike the situations with some organ systems, there are no precise measures of impairment in mental disorders\u201d).\nBecause it is likely that the Majority would interpret Subsection 306(a,2) differently if it relies upon the Fourth Edition of the Guides, I cannot agree that Protz has no bearing upon this case. Even a cursory review of the Majority\u2019s analysis reveals that its decision today is rooted in the text of the Guides as much or more than it is grounded in the text of the statute. See e.g., Maj. Op. at 63-64, 65, 66-67, 152 A.3d at 989, 990, 990-92. In other words, the Majority extensively relies upon the Sixth Edition of the Guides, even though current precedent holds that the Sixth Edition plays no role in the IRE process. My point here is not to suggest that the issue Duffey presents is not \u201cimportant in its own right;\u201d it is to propose that the manner in which the Majority resolves the issue disregards an important overarching inquiry. Id. at 74, 152 A.3d at 996.\nEqually troubling, the Majority relieves claimants of their burden of proving a causal relationship between the accepted work-related injury and any subsequently arising psychological injuries. On this subject, the Act makes clear that, when an employer accepts liability for purely physical injuries, the claimant bears the burden of proving the necessary causal relationship. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 772 (providing that a WCJ \u201cmay, at any time, modify, reinstate, suspend, or terminate a notice of compensation payable ... upon proof that the disability of an injured employe [sic] has increased, decreased, recurred, or has temporarily or finally ceased\u201d).\nIn Commercial Credit Claims v. W.C.A.B. (Lancaster), 556 Pa. 325, 728 A.2d 902 (1999), a claimant was injured when he fell from a catwalk. The employer issued a NCP in which it voluntarily accepted liability for physical injuries that it described as \u201ccervical syndrome, sprain[ed] right sternoclavicu-lar joint.\u201d Id. at 903. Three years later, the employer sought to terminate the claimant\u2019s benefits, alleging that he had fully recovered from the work-related injury. The WCJ denied the employer\u2019s termination petition, noting that the employer\u2019s own medical expert had raised the possibility that the claimant was suffering from a psychological condition due to his initial work injury.\nOn appeal, we held that the WCJ erred in failing to confine his analysis to the injuries listed on the NCP. We emphasized that the claimant\u2019s psychological injury \u201cplainly fell outside the scope of liability to which the employer had stipulated in the [NCP] because it was an entirely different type of injury, distinct in kind from\u201d the claimant\u2019s physical injuries. Id. at 905 n.5. Thus, \u201cbecause claimant never sought to modify the terms of the [NCP] to include compensation for his mental injuries, employer needed to show only that claimant\u2019s physical injuries had been resolved in order to succeed on its termination petition.\u201d Id. at 905.\nAlthough Commercial Credit Claims involved a termination petition rather than an IRE, the underlying rationale is equally applicable here. Our decision was based upon Section 407 of the Act, which provides that a NCP is \u201cvalid and binding unless modified or set aside,\u201d as well as Subsection 413(a), which states that a WCJ may modify a NCP \u201cupon proof that the disability of the injured employe [sic] has increased, decreased, [or] recurred.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 731, 772. Though the Majority claims otherwise, neither of these provisions is limited to the Act\u2019s \u201cmodification and termination schemes.\u201d Maj. Op. at 70 n.15, 152 A.3d at 993 n.15. Furthermore, the Majority\u2019s decision is at odds with our holding in Commercial Credit Claims insofar as the Majority refuses to acknowledge that Duffey\u2019s late-manifesting psychological conditions are separate injuries, \u201cdistinct in kind from the [physical] injury described in the [NCP].\u201d Commercial Credit Claims, 728 A.2d at 905 n.5.\nEvidently, Duffey understands that the NCP\u2019s injury description is binding unless modified or set aside, because he sought to amend the NCP to include his PTSD and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. The WCJ then held hearings, considered the deposition testimony of multiple physicians, made credibility determinations, and ultimately con-eluded that Duffey\u2019s additional injuries should be added to the NCP. According to the Majority, all of this was unnecessary; instead, the impairment-rating physician unilaterally should have discerned the scope of Duffey\u2019s compensable injury. Or, to use the Majority\u2019s words, the impairment-rating physician should have determined whether \u201cany particular impairment\u201d was due to the compensable injury, a phrase that may or may not be synonymous with the compensable injury itself. Maj. Op. at 63, 68-69, 152 A.3d at 988-89, 992-93 (referring to injuries and impairments as \u201coverlapping and intersecting\u2014 but also diverging\u2014concepts\u201d). The Majority insists that this is nothing out of the ordinary, since WCJs typically rely upon medical experts in other contexts. In my view, however, a physician who proceeds according to his or her own assessment is not a substitute for a WCJ who first evaluates conflicting expert testimony and then reaches a reasoned decision. The Majority\u2019s approval of the former marks a significant departure from both the statutory language and current practice.\nI also find puzzling the Majority\u2019s citation to a Department of Labor and Industry regulation, which instructs that, \u201cwhen the evaluating physician determines that the compensable injury incorporates more than one pathology, the evaluating physician may refer the employee to one or more physicians specializing in the specific pathologies which constitute the compensable injury.\u201d 34 Pa. Code \u00a7 123.105(b). If anything, the above regulation suggests that the Department of Labor and Industry, unlike the Majority, believes that impairment ratings should include only the \u201cpathologies which constitute the compensable injury.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Despite the Majority\u2019s concession that a NCP defines the compensable injury and that the NCP in this case did not include Duffey\u2019s psychological injuries, it somehow concludes that Dr. Sicilia should have referred Duffey for an assessment of those injuries. Maj. Op. at 57-58, 63-64, 152 A.3d at 985-96, 989.\nFinally, the Majority justifies its holding by noting that employers sometimes describe injuries \u201cbriefly and even cryptically\u201d on NCPs. I share the Majority\u2019s worry that such practices are not rare and that they might enure to a claimant\u2019s detriment. See generally David B. Toreey & Andrew E. Greenberg, 8 West\u2019s PA. Practice Series, Workers\u2019 Compensation: Law and Practice, \u00a7 20:63 (3rd ed. 2008) (\u201cUnfortunately, the integrity of the \u2018description of injury\u2019 can be impacted either by sloppy or perfunctory claims handling or by intentional though unwarranted efforts to limit employer liability.\u201d). The NCP here, for example, described Duffey\u2019s injury as \u201cstripping some electrical wire.\u201d See Notice of Compensation Payable, 3/23/2009, at 1. It may well be that in situations like these, where the NCP lacks needed specificity, we should interpret it in the light most favorable to the claimant, who, after all, did not draft it. See e.g., Cerro Metal Products Co. v. W.C.A.B. (PLEWA), 855 A.2d 932, 938 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004) (construing broadly an injury described in the NCP as \u201cchemical fume exposure\u201d because employer failed to \u201cspecify the physical injury,\u201d instead describing \u201cthe manner in which it was acquired\u201d). The Majority does not create such a rule here. It offers an authoritative interpretation of the Act, presumably applicable even when the NCP is a model of perfect clarity and precision.\nThe Majority\u2019s interpretation of Section 306(a.2), one which neither party has advanced and which the plain language does not support, will fundamentally alter the IRE process. It will relieve claimants of their burden to prove compensable injuries and turn impairment-rating physicians into junior varsity WCJs. The likely result will be heightened confusion and increased litigation. I respectfully dissent.\n. This Court consistently has held that the term \"injury\u201d encompasses \"any hurtful or damaging effect which may be suffered by anyone.\u201d Panyko v. W.C.A.B. (U.S. Airways), 585 Pa. 310, 888 A.2d 724, 735 (2005) (citing Creighan v. Firemen's Relief & Pension Fund Bd., 397 Pa. 419, 155 A.2d 844, 847 (1959)).\n. The Guides and the Act also define an \u201cimpairment rating\u201d using similar language. See Am. Med. Ass\u2019n, Guides To the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 5 (6th ed. 2008) (describing an impairment rating as a \u201cconsensus-derived percentage estimate of loss of activity reflecting severity for a given health condition, and the degree of associated limitations in terms of ADLs [(Activities of Daily Living)]\u201d); 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(8)(ii) (\"[T]he term 'impairment rating\u2019 shall mean the percentage of permanent impairment of the whole body resulting from the compensable injury.\u201d).\n. See Maj. Op. at 62-63, 65, 68 n.12, 69-70 n.15, 70-71, 72, 72-73, 152 A.3d at 988-89, 990, 992 n.12, 993-94 n.15, 994, 994, 994-95.\n. Although the record in this case demonstrates that Duffey informed Dr. Sicilia about his mental health issues, the Majority's holding logically would apply even if Duffey had remained silent, This is so because the statute provides simply that '\u2018[t]he degree of impairment shall be determined based upon an evaluation by a physician ,,. pursuant to the most recent edition of the [Guides],\" 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.2(1).\n. See generally Payes v. W.C.A.B, (State Police), 621 Pa. 564, 79 A.3d 543 (2013) (discussing so-called \"mental-mental'\u2019 injuries).\n. It may be true that Duffey did not challenge the use of the Sixth Edition in this appeal, but the Majority\u2019s interpretation of Subsection 306(a.2) presumably does not apply only to Duffey. See Maj. Op. at 63, 152 A.3d at 989 (\"Per [the] express terms [of Subsection 306(a.2),] a physician-evaluator must consider and determine causality in terms of whether any particular impairment is \u2018due to' the compensable injury\u201d)-\n. That the Fourth Edition of the Guides eschews the practice of assigning impairment percentages in the context of mental disorders is not open to serious debate. In that publication, the AMA, in no uncertain terms, took the position that there is no evidence \u201cto support any method for assigning a percentage of impairment\u201d to mental or behavioral disorders. Am. Med. Ass'n, Guides To the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 300 (4th ed. 1993). It is of no moment that the State of Maine\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act allows physicians to rate such impairments using criteria that were intended to be used for other purposes. Maj. Op. at 73, 152 A.3d at 995 (citing Harvey v. H.C. Price Co., 957 A.2d 960 (Me. 2008)). Once more, the problem with the Majority\u2019s analysis is that it is predicated upon the Sixth Edition of the Guides (the adoption of which the Commonwealth Court has held unconstitutional) despite the undeniable fact that the Sixth Edition differs dramatically from the Fourth Edition, particularly in the context of mental disorders. The prospect that this Court, if presented with a challenge to the absence of certain impairment-rating criteria in the Fourth Edition, might apply a layer of judicial gloss on top of the AMA\u2019s handiwork does not make the Majority\u2019s statutory interpretation any less problematic.\n. Imagine a situation where a claimant, during an IRE, mentions that he is experiencing a litany of psychiatric symptoms. Although the NCP describes the compensable injury as a spinal injury, the physician\u2014 perhaps having read the Majority\u2019s decision\u2014finds that the claimant is suffering from PTSD, which he believes is fairly attributable to the claimant\u2019s work injury. After evaluating the claimant\u2019s physical and mental injuries, the physician concludes that the claimant has a fifty-percent impairment rating. This scenario is problematic because the issue of causation should be for the WCJ to decide, not the physician. See 77 P.S, \u00a7 772 (providing that the WCJ may modify a NCP upon proof that a claimant's disability has increased).\nFurthermore, assuming that the employer could somehow challenge the physician\u2019s determination, the employer would need to prove the absence of a causal relationship between the compensable injury and the subsequently arising psychological injury. In other words, the employer would be forced to prove a negative. See Commercial Credit Claims, 728 A.2d at 905 (declining to \"strain the humanitarian goals underlying the [Act]\u201d by requiring employers to disprove a causal relationship between the physical injuries described in the NCP and a subsequently alleged psychological injury).\n. It is also inconsistent with the Guides, which state that \"an impairment evaluation is a form of expert testimony.\u201d Am. Med. Ass\u2019n, Guides To the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 27 (6th ed. 2008).",
