Adams was carved out of Richland in 1870. Although the document that established Adams presumably would have described the boundary between the townships, that document has been lost. The document is missing from the Cambria County Courthouse and appears in no other repository of historical documents or official records. No copies of the document are known to exist. The townships and <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>their residents long used a line depicted in the Cambria County tax assessment map as the common boundary.</p>

With the location of the true boundary thus in question, the townships jointly hired a professional surveyor, Frederick Brown, to identify and plot the boundary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Brown relied, in part, upon a survey of nearby municipalities that was performed around 1980. That survey was not conducted to ascertain the boundary between Adams and Richland, but purportedly depicted the northernmost point where the townships meet. Brown further considered a number of “monuments” that aided in his location of that northernmost point along the boundary. Brown believed that a monument to the south of that point established a line, and that, because the original boundary was a straight line, such a line could be extended to determine the location of the southernmost point where the townships meet. Thus, Brown opined, that line was the original boundary between Adams and Richland. As further support, Brown pointed to differentiations in macadam on two roads near his proposed line.</p>

(“Watkins Glen”), was planning to develop a subdivision on a plot of land that ostensibly was situated in both Adams and Richland, and it sought clarification from the townships as to the location of the municipal boundary. Richland advised Watkins Glen to follow the tax assessment line, but Adams advised the developer to follow the line established in Brown’s survey. The matter remained unresolved for seven years before Watkins Glen requested that the townships resolve their disagreement over the location of the boundary. Accordingly, on April 17, 2013, Adams filed an action for a declaratory judgment, seeking a judicial declaration that Brown’s proposed line represents the <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>true boundary between Adams and Richland. The trial court, in turn, appointed a board of commissioners (“Board”) pursuant to Section 303<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> of the Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S. §§ 65101 et seq., to determine the location of the boundary.</p>

In support of its position, Adams presented the testimony of Frederick Brown, who explained the reasoning behind his survey. Richland offered the testimony of another professional surveyor, David Kalina. Kalina did not conduct his own survey, but he testified that he researched historical documents dating back to 1872. Kalina agreed with Brown that the original boundary was a straight line, but his research led him to conclude that the northernmost point where Adams and Richland meet is a point northeast of the location that Brown identified. Kalina opined that the original boundary could be discerned by extending a line from that point southward to a farm that he identified as the original southern point of convergence between the townships. Kalina believed that the older records that he consulted were more reliable than the documents upon which Brown relied, because they were created closer in time to the establishment of the original boundary.</p>

The Board rejected the expert opinions of both Brown and Kalina. Although noting that Brown’s proposed boundary reflected “the most reasonable analysis and alternative to the [tax assessment line],” the Board concluded that it was “unable to find sufficient supporting evidence in the record, when weighing all factors, including, but not limited to [the] credibility of all witnesses, to support any <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>Board determination” that Brown’s proposed line was the true boundary.

Because the true location of the boundary could not be ascertained from the evidence presented, and because property owners had substantially improved their properties in justifiable reliance upon the tax assessment line and the townships’ acquiescence to that line, the Board recommended the adoption of the tax assessment line as the boundary between Adams and Richland. The Board recognized that the tax assessment line was not the original 1870 boundary. Nevertheless, it concluded that “no testimony revealed a superior methodology,” and, “despite the inherent inaccuracies in county tax assessment records,” the adoption of the tax assessment line was “tenable, reasonable, and justifiable.” Id. at 16.

The property in dispute originally lay in Moon. However, sometime after 1952, a portion of the stream that served as the municipal boundary was relocated to accommodate the construction of a highway. For approximately thirty years, the property was treated as being in Findlay. That is, the municipalities continued to use the stream as the boundary as if the stream had not been relocated. In 1986, the construction of a hotel on the disputed property caused Moon to challenge the continued use of the stream as the boundary. The trial court appointed a board of commissioners, which determined that the boundary between Moon and Findlay remained in its pre-1952 location, and was not altered by the relocation of the stream. The trial court confirmed the board’s report, and the Commonwealth Court affirmed.

Findlay noted that it provided police and fire services to the hotel on the disputed property, that all taxes on the property had been paid to Findlay, that the roads by which the hotel was accessed ran through Findlay, and that the hotel <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>received water services from the Findlay Township Water Authority. In rejecting Findlay’s argument, the Commonwealth Court discussed the applicability of the doctrine of acquiescence to municipal boundary disputes. The court reviewed the effect of Article IX, Section 8 and the line of cases which held that preexisting statutory procedures for altering boundaries were invalid. However, in accordance with the holding in Laflin I, the court noted that statutory provisions that concern judicial resolution of boundary disputes remained valid. The court noted that it had considered the doctrine of acquiescence “within the context of a true boundary dispute” in Laflin II. <a href="/pa-commw/123/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="553 A.2d 500" data-case-ids="1382651" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/123/0172-01">Id. at 505</a>.

Although the hotel project involved improvements to the property, Moon had not acquiesced to those improvements. Rather, the hotel project caused Moon to question the location of the boundary and to initiate the litigation, The Commonwealth Court concluded that, “[i]n order for acquiescence to work an estoppel in a municipal boundary dispute, there must be more than substantial improvements to the property affected by the dispute.

They sought to develop the property, but encountered difficulty in dealing with the townships because the townships disputed jurisdiction over the subject property. The Violas filed a petition for the appointment of a board of commissioners to determine the location where the municipal boundary crossed their property. All direct evidence of the location of the original boundary had been lost or destroyed. Notably, Cranberry’s expert suggested using the line depicted in the county tax map as the boundary, but the board rejected that approach because it would establish a new boundary. After determining that the record was insufficient to allow it to determine the location of the true boundary, the board directed the parties to produce all deeds in the chain of title for the subject property going back to 1850. Eventually, the board corroborated evidence in the record and established the true location of the boundary. The trial court confirmed the board’s recommendation, and the Commonwealth Court affirmed.

The evidence adduced before the Board demonstrated that the townships had allowed the boundary to go unchallenged for many years, despite the property owners’ construction of improvements in the disputed area. For instance, Ms. Kuhne testified that she <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>constructed her home in 1986. N.T., 11/15/2013, at 92.

In 1994, the General Assembly enacted the Municipal Consolidation or Merger Act, Act of October 13, 1994, P.L, 596, No. 90, 53 Pa.C.S. §§ 731-41. Although enacted over twenty years beyond the constitutional deadline, this legislation partially complied with Article IX, Section 8 by establishing procedures for consolidation and merger of municipalities. However, the statutory scheme does not provide for <em>changes </em>to boundaries between municipalities that are not undergoing consolidation or merger, and therefore offers no guidance in the instant case.</p>
