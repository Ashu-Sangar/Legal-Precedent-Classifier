The Court described a two-part test for analyzing the rights and obligations of the alleged third-party beneficiary and the testator’s lawyer. In order to determine whether an individual is an “intended third-party beneficiary” with standing to sue a lawyer based on his contract with the testator the court must first find “the recognition of the beneficiary’s right must be ‘appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties.’ ” <em>Guy, </em><a href="/pa/501/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="501 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1782466" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0047-01">459 A.2d at 751</a>, <em>quoting </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 302.

However, application of these precepts to the facts in this case does not support the Superior Court’s conclusion that appellees have standing to sue appellants on the contract between Ross and Agnew.
