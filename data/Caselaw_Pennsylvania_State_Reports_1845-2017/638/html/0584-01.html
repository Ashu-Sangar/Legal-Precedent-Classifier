The award also made modifications to issues of wages, sick leave, vacation, pension, and overtime. Relevant for purposes of this appeal, the panel determined that the previous contract’s requirements found in Article 26(B) regarding the City’s implementation of staffing and the requirement that the City employ a certain number of firefighters were suspended, and instead, declared that “there shall be a manning scheduling requirement of twepty-five (25) per shift, which shall include all scheduled personnel including command positions.” <em>In the Matter City of Allentown v.

The panel also provided that the City was not obligated to recall firefighters to replace any scheduled firefighter if the number of firefighters called to report to work on any shift fell below 25, where such absence was due to the use of a sick day, due to disability leave, or due to the use of any other unanticipated paid or unpaid leave, except for a previously scheduled vacation or personal day. <em><a href="/citations/?q=360%20Lans.%20Ch.%2000947" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="360 Lans.

While recognizing total employment numbers were a matter of managerial authority, the court opined, based on the hearing testimony, that the specific numbers of individuals on duty at any given time was rationally related to the duties and safety of firefighters. As issues rationally related to firefighter safety are subject to arbitration, the court concluded that the number of on-duty firefighters per shift was not a managerial preroga<a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>tive, but, rather, was subject to the interest arbitration panel’s jurisdiction.

    <p id="b632-4" data-blocks='[["BL_632.4",632,[263,697,1161,1494]]]'>An <em>en banc </em>Commonwealth Court affirmed in part and reversed in part in a split decision. Writing for the majority, then-President Judge, now-Senior Judge, Dan Pellegrini explained that the staffing inquiry initially focused upon whether the subject matter implicated a managerial responsibility, and, then, whether the award unduly infringed upon that right. In approaching the question, the court considered two of its decisions which marked a distinction between provisions affecting staffing requirements and those affecting the overall number of employees to be employed. In <em>City of Scranton, </em>the Commonwealth Court considered an arbitration panel award which mandated that the City of Scranton increase its minimum number of firefighters to 225 persons. The city challenged the award, contending the size of the force was a managerial prerogative and not subject to an arbitration award. The Commonwealth Court concluded that determining the size of a fire department was a managerial prerogative for the municipality, as such decisions had far reaching political and economic implications. In contrast, in <em>Appeal of City of Erie, </em>74 Pa.Cmwlth. 245, <a href="/citations/?q=459%20A.2d%201320" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="459 A.2d 1320">459 A.2d 1320</a> (1983), the court addressed an arbitration panel award which mandated a minimum crew of four on each firefighting rig. Relying upon testimony that less than four firefighters on a rig could impair the firefighters’ safety, the <em>City of Eñe </em>court distinguished <em>City of Scranton, </em>reasoning that the safety of a firefighter was more rationally related to the number of persons with whom he or she was fighting a fire or operating a piece of equipment than to the total complement of members on the force.</p>

      <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>Considering these decisions, the Commonwealth Court in the matter <em>sub judice </em>determined that the minimum shift staffing requirement implicated both the terms and conditions of employment for firefighters and the City’s managerial responsibilities, and, thus, turned to whether that mandate unduly infringed upon the City’s managerial responsibilities. Noting that staffing levels impact government spending, budgeting, level of fire protection, and taxation, the court concluded that requiring minimum shift staffing unduly infringed upon the City’s managerial responsibilities by restricting its decisions concerning the fire protection levels it desires or can afford. Therefore, the court found that the arbitration panel’s minimum staffing mandate concerned a managerial prerogative which lies outside of the scope of collective bargaining, and, thus, was beyond the arbitration panel’s authority to impose. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court’s order denying the City’s petition to vacate the shift staffing requirements.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

He reasoned that, while the minimum shift staffing provision touched upon a managerial responsibility, because the City presented no evidence of undue infringement, he could not conclude that the arbitration panel erred under the narrow <em>certiorari </em>standard of review. Judge Patricia McCullough also filed a dissenting opinion, finding that the evidence of record established that the minimum shift requirement related to firefighter safety, and, thus, was subject to mandatory bargaining. She further offered that the minimum shift staffing mandate was distinguishable from other mandates affecting the total number of firefighters which had been found to be an inherent managerial prerogative.</p>

Resultant disharmony in the public-safety arena, and, at times, illegal and disruptive strikes, led to legislative reform by the late-1960s.

The IAFF offers that, in <em>City of Philadelphia, </em>we cited with approval <em>City of Scranton </em>in which the Commonwealth Court found that a contract provision mandating that the city increase its total complement of firefighters to 225 employees was illegal, as it unduly infringed upon the city’s inherent managerial prerogative to determine force size. In doing so, the <em>City of Scranton </em>court explained that “[t]he courts that have dealt with this issue have drawn a very fine line in distinguishing between the total number of persons on the force (not arbitrable), and the <em>number of persons on duty at a station, </em>or assigned to a piece of equipment, or to be deployed to a fire (all arbitrable because they are rationally related to the safety of fire fighters).” <em>City of Scranton, </em><a href="/citations/?q=429%20A.2d%20779" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="429 A.2d 779">429 A.2d at 781</a> (emphasis added).

Specifically, the IAFF proffers that both witnesses explained that the population of the City of Allentown, the density of its housing, other demographic factors, and the number of fire calls, combined with the number of firefighters employed per shift, have a direct and significant impact upon the health and safety of the firefighters. These witnesses offered that the fewer firefighters on shift, the more likely those firefighters would be injured in their jobs.</p>

Appellant’s Brief at 25. According to the IAFF, shift staffing does not unduly infringe upon a municipality’s responsibilities, but allows it to retain the “authority to decide whether to hire more employees, close stations, revamp the force, or take some other managerial action.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=429%20A.2d%20779" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="429 A.2d 779">Id.</a> </em>(citing <em>City of Scranton, </em><a href="/citations/?q=429%20A.2d%20779" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="429 A.2d 779">429 A.2d at 781</a>). The IAFF argues that the City may hire or lay off as many employees as it desires, or change shift length, and still meet the safety needs of the firefighters, all without being forced to employ a certain overall number of firefighters. The IAFF claims that setting a minimum shift requirement is no different than setting a minimum number of firefighters on a piece of equipment or at a fire station, both of which it submits are mandatory subjects of bargaining.</p>

The IAFF reasons that the arbitration panel found a rational relationship between the mandate and the firefighter’s condition of employment, then found the City’s managerial responsibilities would not be unduly infringed upon as the shift mandate was not absolute, thus, achieving a compromise between firefighter safety and the City’s prerogative to determine the type of fire service it wants to provide to its citizens.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

It then takes the position that the issue also “constitutes a managerial prerogative as it directly results in determining the overall manning of the Department, thereby unduly infringing on the City’s managerial prerogatives.” Appellee’s Brief at 16. In support of its argument, the City claims that a decision regarding the number of personnel to employ has been consistently regarded as a managerial prerogative, and that the minimum shift staffing issue implicates the same concerns as overall force staffing. Citing <em>City of Scranton, </em>the City notes that, in that decision, the Commonwealth Court held that the number of firefighters an employer deems appropriate is a managerial prerogative <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>that is not arbitrable. The City further offers that the court in <em>City of Scranton </em>cast the issue as whether members of fire and police forces are to decide “how much of the municipal budget will be spent in the areas of fire and police protection,” and focused on the members having “the right to have a major decision-making impact on government spending, budgeting, the level of police and fire protection that the municipality must provide, and even taxation, because salaries for the additional employees must come from public funds.” Appel-lee’s Brief at 18 (quoting <em>City of Scranton, </em><a href="/citations/?q=429%20A.2d%20779" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="429 A.2d 779">429 A.2d at 781</a>).</p>

The City develops that minimum shift staffing “was a major contributor to skyrocketing overtime, which in turn lead [sic] to spiking pension costs,” as overtime compensation is used in the calculation of pension benefits. Appellee’s Brief at 19. Thus, according to the City, it must be left with the ultimate determination of the level of fire protection to be provided, and a minimum shift staffing provision eliminates such discretion. The City goes further and rejects the contention that it can revamp the force, eliminate certain apparatus, or close stations, as, according to the City, it will have to schedule and pay the minimum number of firefighters per shift even if it closed all of its fire stations. Moreover, to meet the minimum staffing requirements, the City asserts that it will be required to employ a certain minimum number of firefighters overall to have enough personnel for each shift, and, in doing so, discounts the IAFF’s contention that it can change the length or type of shift to retain overall managerial prerogatives, as the length and type of shift are mandatory subjects of bargaining.</p>

Thus, under the concurrence’s fact-determinative approach, if the minimum shift staffing number required by an arbitration panel impacted the overall firefighting complement or failed to resolve significant unfunded pension liability issues, that topic would not be considered to be a subject of bargaining and could not be part of an arbitration award.</p>

Notably, by focusing only on this one extreme example, the majority avoids the question of whether a required shift size of, say, fifty percent of the force, would have a similar effect.

Residence within or outside a hiring municipality is binary in nature; as such, it is the type of factor that lends itself well to a categorical rule—and, indeed, the <em>Moon Township </em>Court did not support its holding by reference to an evidentiaiy record. <em>See Moon Township, </em><a href="/pa/508/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="508 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="1794016" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0495-01">508 Pa. at 510-11</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="508 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="1794016" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0495-01">498 A.2d at 1312-13</a>. Here, the topic is more complex, and thus more fact-sensitive. For example, and as previously noted, the Court’s present holding does little to illuminate the question of when the mandated minimum firefighting complement becomes large enough to impact upon the total size of the firefighting force; or under what circumstances it will unduly impede the municipality’s ability to meet its pension obligations. Our Court is not well positioned to know where these cut-off numbers lie absent evidentiaiy development in particular cases going forward.</p>

Unlike the majority, which posits in some instances evidence of undue infringement would be unnecessary because it would be clear a certain subject by its very nature unduly infringes on managerial rights, Majority Opinion at 598-600 n.8, 157 A.3d at 908-09 n.8, I believe it is unlikely such an instance would ever occur because the undue infringement analysis is used to resolve the competing interests which arise when a topic is a mandatory subject of bargaining implicating managerial prerogatives. In my opinion, bare assertions of infringement by the public employer are insufficient. The public employer must demonstrate how its managerial prerogatives are infringed and the impact of the infringement.
