For the reasons set forth below, we remand to the PCRA court for an evidentiary hearing limited to two issues—whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failing to: 1) show the ballistics evidence purportedly tying appellant to a series of crimes and murders was inconsistent; and 2) impeach an eyewitness’s in-court identification of appellant with the witness’s inability to identify appellant at his preliminary hearing.</p>

We explained appellant was charged with: 1) shooting and killing Luis Santos during a robbery on April 5, 1999; 2) shooting and killing William Townes during an argument on April 26, 1999; and 3) committing an armed home-invasion burglary and robbery with three conspirators on May 6, 1999. The charges were consolidated for a jury trial; the jury found appellant guilty of two counts of murder and related offenses and sentenced him to death.</p>

      <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>With respect to the Santos killing, we noted appellant was identified at trial by four witnesses, one of whom followed appellant after the shooting and saw him enter a rowhome on the 3900 block of Pierce Street. As to the killing of Townes, we noted a woman who sold drugs for Townes (Natisha Evans) testified at trial, over defense objection, that she was robbed at gunpoint of Townes’s cash and drugs the night before the murder and identified appellant and one of his conspirators in the home invasion as the men who robbed her. Another witness (Debra Redden) testified she saw appellant shoot and kill Townes during a confrontation that occurred the following night. We dismissed appellant’s claim the verdict was against the weight of the evidence based on his challenges to the credibility of the eyewitnesses’ testimony. We noted the eyewitnesses were vigorously challenged during cross-examination. We additionally held the court did not err in precluding appellant’s proffered evidence showing a number of potential eyewitnesses, who did not testify at trial, failed to identify appellant in a line-up.</p>

Furthermore, I would have concerns about the stewardship of a defense attorney failing to ask a court to do so.

I also note that the majority refrains from framing the proffer obligation in <em>terms </em>of a requirement to submit an "affidavit.” <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 192, 154 A.3d at 299-300 (indicating that "a <em>supporting document" </em>from counsel stating the reasons for the course chosen is generally necessary to establish potential entitlement to a hearing”). To my mind, some clarification is warranted in light of the following. In 2005, writing from a responsive posture, a Justice made a point of highlighting the distinction between affidavits and declarations, for purposes of post-conviction evidentiary proffers, expressing disapproval of the use of the latter. <em>See Commonwealth v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa/582/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="164" data-cite="582 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="650333" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0461-01">582 Pa. 461</a>, 510-14, <a href="/pa/582/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="165" data-cite="872 A.2d 1139" data-case-ids="650333,8979014" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0461-01,/a2d/872/1139-01">872 A.2d 1139</a>, 1168-70 (2005) (Castille, J., concurring). Such perspective has been integrated into various majority expressions of the Court in subsequent years. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hutchinson, </em><a href="/pa/611/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="166" data-cite="611 Pa. 280" data-case-ids="4203681" data-case-paths="/pa/611/0280-01">611 Pa. 280</a>, 343 n.19, <a href="/pa/611/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="167" data-cite="25 A.3d 277" data-case-ids="4203681,7275666" data-case-paths="/pa/611/0280-01,/a3d/25/0277-01">25 A.3d 277</a>, 313 n.19 (2011).
