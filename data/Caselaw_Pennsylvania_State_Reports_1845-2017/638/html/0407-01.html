The evidence revealed that, on February 8, 2010, appellant and his pregnant girlfriend Meidinger were at the Greensburg, Pennsylvania bus station when appellant noticed codefendant Ricky Smyrnes. Smyrnes was there with the victim and the other codefendants, Angela Marinucci, Robert Masters, and Peggy Miller. The victim, who had the intellectual capacity of a fourteen-year-old, had taken a bus to Greensburg to attend a doctor’s appointment the next day and intended to stay at Smyrnes’s apartment. Meidinger recognized the victim from a facility they both attended that provided services to clients with mental disorders and disabilities. In conversation with Meidinger, the victim said she was going to marry Smyrnes; Meidinger noticed tension between the victim and Marinucci after Marinucci overheard the remark.</p>

In defense, the victim kneed Marinueci in the stomach, causing Marinueci to report to Smyrnes that the victim had killed her baby (in fact, Marinueci was not pregnant). Smyrnes confronted the victim, demanding, “[I]f you want to kill my kid, why should I let you live[?]” <em>Id. </em>at 596. Marinueci insisted that Smyrnes choose between her and the victim, leading Smyrnes to call a “family meeting” and ask the others’ opinions regarding what kind of mother the victim would be. At this point, the victim appeared to be “out of it,” having been beaten, raped, and drugged. <em>Id. </em>at 600.</p>

During this time, Miller’s nail polish was applied to the victim’s face. Smyrnes called a third “family meeting” and inquired whether they should kill the victim. After the “family” voted to kill, <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>Smyrnes forced the victim to write a suicide note and told her the conspirators were going to make her death look like a suicide to avoid being held responsible.</p>

After appellant put something in the victim’s mouth to keep her silent, he asked her if she was ready to die, then stabbed her in the chest multiple times, and stabbed and sliced her neck. As the victim lay gasping, appellant exited the bathroom and announced she was not dead yet. Marinucci said to kill her, that she wanted her “out of here.” <em>Id. </em>at 617.

He contacted police, who launched an investigation, and the victim’s body was identified. Dr. Cyril Wecht, the forensic pathologist who performed an autopsy on the body, received the body while it was still in the garbage can—placed head first, partially covered with plastic bags, with Christmas lights wrapped around the neck and wrists, and a decorative material binding the ankles. The body had suffered multiple incised wounds, abrasions, and contusions, and several prescription drugs were found in the victim’s system. Dr. Wecht concluded the cause of death was a combination of all of the injuries, but was primarily due to stab wounds of the chest, which penetrated the left lung and went into the heart, producing a substantial hemorrhage. Dr. Wecht opined these injuries were inflicted shortly before <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>death, with the intent to cause pain and suffering: the victim would have remained conscious after the initial infliction of the wounds, bled for a couple of minutes, lost consciousness, and finally died within four to six minutes.</p>

Appellant pursued four mitigating circumstances: no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1); his age at the time of the crime, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4); extreme duress, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(5); and the “catch-all” mitigator. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8).

This Court is frequently presented with evidentiary issues involving autopsy photographs in capital cases, our guiding jurisprudence on the subject is well-developed, <em>see, e.g., Ballard, </em><a href="/pa/622/0176-02" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="80 A.3d 380" data-case-ids="4280587,4280994,4281131,7302512,7302531,7302600" data-case-paths="/pa/622/0176-02,/pa/622/0177-01,/pa/622/0176-01,/a3d/80/0380-01,/a3d/80/0380-02,/a3d/80/0380-03">80 A.3d at 392-93</a>, and the trial court identified the guiding principles. Moreover, because the torture aggravator was implicated in this case, we recognize photographic evidence was relevant to illustrate the testimony of Dr. Wecht and the detective regarding the extent of the non-fatal injuries inflicted upon the victim prior to administration of the ultimately fatal wounds. <em>See </em>N.T. Penalty Phase, 8/20/12, at 182-98; N.T. Penalty Phase, 8/23/12, at 678-96. On the other hand, we also recognize that, as is invariably the case in murder prosecutions involving knives and torture, the photographs here are graphic and gruesome. The photographs from the internal examination of the victim were especially bloody and graphic as they depicted the underlying tissues in her face and torso; they were introduced to illustrate Dr. Wecht’s testimony that the force of the blows inflicted on the victim caused extensive internal hemorrhaging beneath her scalp and between her ribs. Likewise, the photograph of the victim’s heart, showing the stab wounds, pertained to how the victim died, which was part of the case’s history. <em>See </em>N.T. Penalty Phase, 8/23/12, at 697-701.</p>

The testimonial description of the acts committed by the conspirators, and the description of her injuries by Dr. Wecht and the detective vividly display the victim’s suffering. As our cases recognize, this is not to say the trial has to be sanitized to the point where no photographs can or should be admitted. But, care can be taken not to allow the presentation to go to unnecessary extremes. This is not a case where the defendant seriously contested the existence of the torture aggravator; indeed, appellant’s counsel never argued against torture in his closing. In addition, the trial court recognized certain measures should be taken to limit the jury’s exposure to the photographs but, for some reason, they were not followed, as the jury saw the photographs twice during the trial, and also had them in deliberations.</p>

      <em>Ballard, </em>which was decided after the trial in this case, offers a useful contrast.

So, certainly this is a mitigating circumstance that is permitted to be offered in a death penalty trial. And, again, you must consider that. But I ask you to balance that against the horrific events of this particular crime. It wasn’t simply a killing. It was a murder that was committed during the course of a felony, during the course of kidnapping, aggravated assault, a rape. And it was worsened by the fact that it wasn’t done by the defendant himself, that he joined with other people to keep her, Jennifer away from her family, from anybody who would help her, to kidnap her in effect. He had no prior convictions, but in this particular case he pled guilty to first degree, second degree, two conspiracy charges and kidnapping. Five separate felonies.</blockquote>

Defense counsel did not argue Appellant’s prior criminal history was uncontradicted, only that Appellant “didn’t have a significant prior criminal history.” The defense undoubtedly makes an argument that this was met by a preponderance of the evidence, but nevertheless, this is clearly a question for the jury, and the jury after consideration, did not find it.
