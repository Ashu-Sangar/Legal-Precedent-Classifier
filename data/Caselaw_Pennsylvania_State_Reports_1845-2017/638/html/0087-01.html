Pertinent to this appeal, the MVFRL requires insurers to offer insureds UIM coverage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Id. at § 1731(a). Insurers need to inform <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>named insureds that they may reject UIM coverage by signing a written rejection form contained in Subsection 1731(c) of the MVFRL. Id. § 1731(c). Subsection 1731(c.l) of the MVFRL states that any UIM coverage rejection form that does not “specifically comply” with Section 1731 of the MVFRL is void and that, if an insurer fails to produce a valid UIM coverage rejection form, then UIM coverage shall be equal to the policy’s bodily injury liability limits. Id. at § 1731(d). We granted allowance of appeal in this matter to determine whether an insurer’s UIM coverage rejection form does “specifically comply” with Section 1731 of the MVFRL if the insurer’s form is not a <em>verbatim </em>reproduction of the statutory rejection form found in Subsection 1731(c) of the MVFRL but, rather, differs from the statutory form in an inconsequential manner. For the reasons that follow, we hold that a UIM coverage rejection form specifically complies with Section 1731 of the MVFRL even if the form contains <em>de minimis </em>deviations from the statutory form. Because the Superior Court reached the proper result in this case, we affirm that court’s judgment.</p>

More specifically, the court observed that the rejection form in the case <em>sub judice </em>contains only one additional word—“motorists.” The court opined that this term is directly related to the rejection of UIM coverage and eliminates, rather than exacerbates, any perceived ambiguity. The trial court noted that the form did not alter the “proximal relationship” between the language of the statutory rejection form and the mandated date and signature lines.

Instead, the General Assembly drafted the precise language to be used in those rejection forms, directed insurers to have insureds sign those particular forms, and provided that any form that fails to “specifically comply” with this requirement is void. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(d). The learned Majority’s decision to allow insurers to vary the General Assembly’s prescribed language in these forms ignores, in my view, both the actual instructions in Section 1731 and the rules of statutory construction this Court must follow. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.</p>

The juxtaposition between the legislative grant of authority to insurers to make de minimis (grammatical) changes to the rejection language in subsection (b.l), while simultaneously requiring insurers to “specifically comply” with subsections (b) and (c), plainly demonstrates that the General Assembly intended for the rejection forms prepared under the latter subsections to contain the precise waiver language set forth therein.</p>

By permitting changes to the statutorily prescribed rejection forms, the Majority ignores the word “specifically” in the phrase “specifically comply” in subsection (c.l). The Majority has, essentially, decided that mere “compliance” with the overall spirit of Section 1731 is sufficient, so long as the lack of specific compliance is not substantial.</p>

Subsection 1738(d) of the MVFRL, for instance, sets forth rejection forms for insureds to waive stacked limits on uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, and Subsection 1738(e) then provides that any rejection form “that does not comply with this section is void.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1738(d)-(e) (emphasis added). As the Superior Court has rightly concluded, this crucial difference signals the need to apply more exacting scrutiny of the relevant forms in Section 1731 than to those in Section 1738. <em>Am.

As a practical matter, it is exceedingly easy not to make changes, as the required language may be copied and pasted, or re-typed and meticulously reviewed for deviations (inadvertent or otherwise). The Majority’s contrary approach allows insurers to continue to tinker, ad nauseam, with the statutorily required language. As the Majority’s review of multiple cases on this very issue demonstrates, refusal to adhere to the forms mandated by the statute will continue to require courts to oversee case after case in which parties contest whether particular modifications to the statutorily prescribed form were merely inconsequential or instead injected ambiguity into its language. This is the precise tinkering and judicial involvement that the legislature intended to avoid and I am at a loss to understand why this Court would inject uncertainty into this abundantly clear expression of legislative direction.</p>
