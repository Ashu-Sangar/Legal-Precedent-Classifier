See 4 Pa.C.S. §§ 1101, <em>et seq. </em>That section levies a “local share assessment” against all licensed casinos’ gross slot machine revenue. According to Mount Airy, the statutory provision violates the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution because it imposes grossly unequal local share assessments upon similarly situated slot machine licensees. See PA. Const, art. VIII, § 1.</p>

The Act defines GTR as the sum of all “cash or cash equivalent wagers received by a slot machine,” <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>less any amounts paid out to players in various forms. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1103. Slot machine licensees also must pay a local share assessment, which the Commonwealth collects and distributes to the casino’s host municipality and/or county. For most casinos, the local share assessment consists of two distinct parts: the county local share assessment and the municipal local share assessment. A casino located outside of Philadelphia County must pay both (a) an annual county local share assessment of 2% of its GTR and (b) a municipal local share assessment of either <em>2% </em>of its GTR or a lump sum of $10 million, whichever is greater. Therefore, a non-Philadelphia casino with GTR at or below $500 million will always pay a $10 million municipal local share assessment, and a non-Philadelphia casino with GTR above $500 million will always pay more than $10 million. Because, uniquely, Philadelphia County is coterminous with the City of Philadelphia, casinos located there pay only a county local share assessment, which is fixed by the Gaming Act at a rate of 4% of the casino’s GTR.</p>

Specifically, Mount Airy seeks a declaratory judgment that the municipal portion of the local share assessment violates the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, both facially and as applied to Mount Airy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Mount Airy avers that the municipal local share assess<a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>ment violates the Uniformity Clause in three ways. First, Mount Airy takes issue with the fact that casinos outside of Philadelphia are subject to a $10 million minimum assessment, whereas similarly situated Philadelphia casinos are not. Second, Mount Airy complains that the General Assembly further subdivided non-Philadelphia casinos into two categories <em>(ie., </em>those with GTR above $500 million and those with GTR below $500 million) and taxed them differently.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Finally, Mount Airy broadly alleges a Uniformity Clause violation based upon the fact that the municipal local share assessment’s $10 million floor leads to disparate effective tax rates among casinos.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Because we find merit in Mount Airy’s second Uniformity Clause argument, we need not address its two alternative arguments.</p>

The parties’ requests effectively invite us to make what amounts to a policy decision under the auspices of severance. This Court is not in the business of drafting complex tax statutes, nor are we experts on the financial condition of Pennsylvania’s casinos or the financial needs of Pennsylvania’s municipalities.</p>

In Pennsylvania, the legislature, through the canons of statutory construction, has given guidance to the courts as to how it desires severability to operate. The General Assembly has created a presumption of severability, and directed courts to uphold the remainder of an infirm statute “unless the court finds that the valid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision ... that it cannot be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds that the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1925.</p>

Thus, contrary to the majority and concurrence, I find subsection (c)(2) to be severable.</p>
    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[187,680,1156,1329]]]'>Further, in preserving subsection (c)(2), I find that the other related provisions of Section 1403 are likewise severable. Specifically, subsection (a) merely establishes the State Gaming Fund; it is wholly unaffected by subsection (c)(3), and assuredly would have been enacted without subsection (c)(3). Similarly, subsection (b) sets a daily tax of 34% from daily GTR and a local share assessment as provided in subsection (c). While “local share assessment” is not defined, as indicated above, it includes assessments from licensees for distribution to <em>both </em>counties and municipalities. Further, subsection (b) speaks of funds that are owed to the Commonwealth, a county, or a municipality, being held in trust by the licensed gaming entity. Thus, the mere striking of subsection (c)(3) regarding the municipal portion of the local share assessment does not render nugatory the local share assessment for counties, or the holding of any funds in trust; it merely renders the subsection inoperative with respect to hosting municipalities. Again, subsection (b) can be given effect without subsection (c)(3) and it cannot be presumed that the General Assembly would not have enacted subsection (b) without subsection (c)(3). In addition, subsection (c)(1) merely provides for the transfer of slot machine tax and local share assessments imposed by subsection (b) to the State Gaming Fund. There is no basis to conclude this transfer cannot operate without the municipal portion of the local share assessment.</p>

Subsection (d), which defines the Consumer Price Index, is wholly operative without subsection (c)(3), as it is utilized in subsection (c)(2) for defining distributions among the counties. Similarly, subsection (e) speaks to reporting requirements and information-providing obligations regarding distributions of local share assessments, which applies to counties and munici<a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>palities; thus, this subsection remains operative, albeit there would be nothing to report with respect to municipalities governed by subsection (c)(3). Subsection (f) prohibits certain compensable lobbying activities. It can remain wholly operative without (c)(3). Even though it recognizes an exception for certain qualified persons preparing grant applications for funds for counties and municipalities, that exception is meaningful because funding flows to both counties and municipalities in (c)(2).</p>
    <p id="b210-4" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[263,860,1154,1064]]]'>Finally, as an aside, by engaging in broad severance, and keeping operative as many provisions of the Gaming Act as possible as envisioned by the General Assembly, our Court would be acting consistent with the public policy goals of that Act, which include providing a significant source of revenue to the Commonwealth, 4 Pa.C.S. § 1102(3), providing broad economic opportunities to the citizens of the Commonwealth, 4 Pa.C.S. § 1102(5), and considering the public interest of the citizens of the Commonwealth in any decision or order with respect to the Gaming Act. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1102(10); cf.

Indeed, the majority’s striking of Section 1403(c)(2) (in addition to its proper striking of subsection (c)(3)) will, in my view, unnecessarily throw numerous counties and municipalities, already facing difficult budgetary constraints, as well as the Commonwealth itself, into a state of further financial uncertainty.</p>

While subsection (c)(2) only contains a single cross-reference to subsection (c)(3), subsection (c)(3) contains numerous references regarding the distribution of remaining funds pursuant to subsection (c)(2), See, e.g., 4 Pa.C.S. § 1403(c)(3)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii). While this understandably supports the majority’s conclusion that (c)(2) and (c)(3) are so interrelated that they both must be stricken, given the severance standards, and in particular the more demanding severance requirements set forth in the Gaming Act, we are tasked to analyze the severance question with exacting scrutiny. Thus, I find subsection (c)(2) is not so intertwined with (c)(3) that it cannot be severed.</p>
