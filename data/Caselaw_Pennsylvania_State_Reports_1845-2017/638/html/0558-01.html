In the UCBR’s view, the court’s reliance on <em>Harkness </em>is misplaced because the two-Justice OAJC addressed representation by non-attorneys, but did not account for “formerly admitted attorneys” who have been suspended and therefore are prohibited by the Disciplinary Enforcement Rules from appearing before a referee. According to the UCBR, the Disciplinary Enforcement Rules do not simply govern the practice of law, but also the conduct of attorneys and formerly admitted attorneys. <em>Id. </em>at 13-14, <em>citing </em>Pa.R.D.E. 201(a) (exclusive jurisdiction of Supreme Court and Disciplinary Board extends to any formerly admitted attorney whose actions constitute violation of Disciplinary Enforcement Rules).

The ODC argues the UCBR is authorized to prohibit suspended attorneys from representing clients in unemployment compensation proceedings and the UCBR did not invade this Court’s jurisdiction in affirming the referee’s decision to do so here. The ODC notes suspended attorneys are qualitatively different from non-lawyer representatives who may otherwise appear before agencies on behalf of claimants—suspended attorneys are not only prohibited from the practice of law, but also from conducting other law-related activities. Amicus Brief at 19-20, <em>citing </em>Pa.R.D.E. 217(j)(4)(vii) (formerly admitted attorney prohibited from appearing before administrative referees or boards). According to the ODC, the distinction between suspended attorneys and non-lawyer representatives is based not on legal ability, a characteristic rendered immaterial by the <em>Harkness </em>plurality’s conclusion that proceedings before the UCBR do not constitute the practice of law, but on the basis of the lack of ethical fitness to act as an advocate. The ODC argues the UCBR properly exercised its authority pursuant to Section 503 of the Administrative Agency Law, which provides an “agency may, upon hearing and good cause shown, preclude any person from practice before it.” <em>See </em>2 Pa.C.S. § 503. The ODC posits the Commonwealth Court’s decision actually contravenes this Court’s authority by permitting a suspended <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>attorney to ignore the Court’s suspension orders. Further, the Commonwealth Court’s decision places referees in an ethical quandary because allowing a suspended attorney to violate Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217 may be seen as assisting in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which itself may be professional misconduct. Amicus Brief at 22-23, <em>citing </em>Pa.R.P.C, 8.4 (professional misconduct includes engaging in conduct prejudicial to administration of justice). The ODC also contends the Commonwealth Court’s analysis is faulty based upon an overly broad interpretation of the term “enforce,” as used in the court’s theory the referee and UCBR overstepped their bounds by “enforcing” the Court’s order. The ODC asserts a referee’s refusal to participate in or to allow a violation of the law does not amount to unauthorized “enforcement” of this Court’s order.</p>

We consider suspended attorneys to be different from non-lawyer representatives who are authorized to participate in unemployment compensation matters pursuant to Section 214 of the UC Law. Instead, suspended attorneys are individuals who have actually been sanctioned by this Court for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct and now are “formerly admitted attorneys” who are expressly prohibited from appearing on behalf of a client “in any hearing or proceeding” pursuant to Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217(j)(4)(vii).

Therein, Macy’s Department Store contested a claim for unemployment compensation. At the hearing, Macy’s was represented by an employee of an out-of-state company in the business of representing companies in unemployment compensation matters; the representative was not an attorney. The claimant was denied benefits and appealed to the Board wherein she challenged Macy’s representation by a non-attorney. The Board rejected that challenge; however, on further appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed that determination. After noting the general rule that non-attorneys may not represent parties in court or before administrative agencies, the court observed one exception to that rule, allowing claimants in unemployment compensation proceedings to be represented by a non-lawyer. <a href="/a2d/867/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="867 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="9027331" data-case-paths="/a2d/867/0728-01">867 A.2d at </a>731 (citing 43 P.S. § 862 (“Any individual claiming compensation in any proceeding before the department, the board, or referee may be represented by counsel or other duly authorized agent.”)).

The legislative history makes plain that the bill’s purpose was to respond to the <em>Harkness </em>decision, and allow any party, including corporate parties, to be represented by non-attorneys. <em>See </em>Pennsylvania House of Representatives Legislative Journal, 2005 Regular Session, No. 34 (June 7, 2005), at *31 (remarks of Representative Belfanti: in discussing the <em>Harkness </em>decision, noting that claimants may be represented at unemployment compensation hearings by non-attorneys, and that “if one party should be allowed to be represented by experts other than attorneys, why not both sides?

Indeed, when Governor Rendell signed the bill, he explicitly stated that its purpose was to respond to the <em>Harkness </em>decision and allow non-attorney, representation. <em>See </em>Governor’s Message, 189th General Assembly, 2005 Regular Session (June 30, 2005) (noting that the bill “amends the UC State Law to re-establish the ability of any party in a UC benefit proceeding to be assisted by an attorney or other representative.

The majority’s discernment of a third category of representatives—suspended attorneys—who are neither an “attorney” nor an “other representative,” Majority Opinion at 566-68, 157 A.3d at 889-90, to the degree it is an effort at statutory construction, is not grounded in Section 774. Section 774 does not place any limits on the representation and, indeed, was enacted in response to such constraints. Moreover, I see no reason why suspended attorneys should be deemed <em>ipso facto </em>less capable of performing activities which the legislature, and seemingly this Court, has decided do not require an attorney at all.</p>

However, neither the Board nor the majority has offered a basis for concluding that the Board is bound by this Court’s disciplinary pronouncements, or, most importantly, that it may “uphold[] the force and effect of this Court’s orders” with regard to suspended attorneys, Majority Opinion at 573, 157 A.3d at 893, in contravention of its statutory duties.</p>

Outside of enforcing constitutional or statutory mandates, we have no authority over an agency’s rules of practice or procedure. <em>See Mercy Hosp. of Pittsburgh v.

Moreover, the Board is not a part of our disciplinary system, not a party to our disciplinary orders, nor a subject of our orders. Indeed, members of the Board and its referees are not required to be attorneys. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 763 (setting forth qualifications of Board and referees). In short, in my view, the Board is under no legal compulsion to enforce our disciplinary orders; but, more critically, it may not “uphold the force and effect” of our disciplinary orders in a manner contrary to its statutory duties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>
