The facts pertinent to the current appeal are that on October 25, 1992, appellant and codefendant, Larry Gregory, following an argument with the victim, Peter LaCourt, about the authenticity of a gold chain, took the chain and pistol-whipped LaCourt. LaCourt attempted to flee but stopped when appellant threatened to shoot him. LaCourt dropped to his knees, put his hands behind his head and appellant shot him six times, killing him. Fifteen-year-old Tanesha Robinson witnessed the robbery and beating, heard the gunshots as she fled the scene, and later gave a statement to police implicating appellant and codefendant. She also testified at their preliminary hearings. On August 4,1993, however, she and two of her <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>female friends were murdered execution-style (via close-range gunshots to the head) in an apartment located in the same housing development where LaCourt was murdered.</p>
    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.4",388,[261,508,1152,943]]]'>Appellant and codefendant were charged with the murder of LaCourt and were tried together. At trial, two witnesses testified concerning a plot to murder Robinson to prevent her from testifying at trial. Terrence Richardson testified he was present when codefendant and his brother gave two other men a .357 revolver and paid them $2,000 to kill Robinson, directing them to “be fast about it” and “don’t leave [any] witnesses.” N.T. 3/3/94 at 73. James Buigi testified he shared a prison cell with appellant in the fall of 1993 and appellant confided to him he shot and killed LaCourt during a robbery. Appellant additionally confided to Buigi he told “his friends” he needed Robinson “out of the way” because she was “the only witness that can hurt me in the trial.” N.T. 2/28/94 at 122. Appellant told Buigi “my boys are loyal to me. They took care of that for me.” <em><a href="/a2d/753/1265-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="753 A.2d 1265" data-case-ids="11220025,11220117,226000,226004" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/1265-01,/a2d/753/1265-02,/pa/562/0131-01,/pa/562/0132-01">Id.</a> </em>Appellant explained to Buigi his boys “found [Robinson] and shot her,” and they killed the other females in the apartment because “they [were] not going to leave two witnesses behind[.]” <em>Id. </em>at 123.</p>

At the ensuing joint penalty phase proceedings, the guilt phase evidence was incorporated. Appellant testified and also presented the testimony of his aunt and his girlfriend who described him as patient, hard-working and a good father to his children. The jury found one statutory aggravating circumstance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6) (killing committed during perpetration of felony), and no statutory mitigating circum<a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>stances, rejecting appellant’s assertion of the applicability of the age and catch-all mitigators, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4), (e)(8), and thus, the jury sentenced appellant to death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Relevant to the issues on this appeal, we rejected appellant’s substantive claim of the denial of a fair trial based on the introduction of evidence linking him to the murder of Tanesha Robinson, finding her murder was part of the history of the case and was admissible to show appellant’s consciousness of guilt. For the same reason, we rejected his derivative claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to object to the evidence about Robinson’s murder. We additionally rejected appellant’s claim of counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to subpoena prison records, which allegedly would have shown Buigi and appellant had not been cellmates, because we determined appellant failed to show such records existed. We also determined the trial court did not err in its instruction to the jury regarding the element of specific intent to kill as it related to first-degree murder and accomplice liability. <em>Hannibal, </em><a href="/a2d/753/1265-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="753 A.2d 1265" data-case-ids="11220025,11220117,226000,226004" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/1265-01,/a2d/753/1265-02,/pa/562/0131-01,/pa/562/0132-01">753 A.2d at 1269-71</a>.

Clarke, Jr. (now deceased), had retired. Unfortunately, considerable delay ensued. An amended petition was filed by counsel in 2005, the Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss in 2010, and a number of additional pleadings were filed by both sides. In all, Judge Berry oversaw appellant’s PCRA litigation for about eleven years, but retired from the bench without scheduling a hearing or issuing a decision. In 2012, the matter was reassigned to the Honorable Glenn B. Bronson who reviewed the amended petition, which contained sixteen issues, the motion to dismiss and the supplemental pleadings. The court determined the claims were without merit and issued notice of its intent to dismiss the petition without a hearing, to which appellant filed a response and the Commonwealth filed an answer. The parties then agreed to an evidentiary hearing on the layered issue of trial counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness for failing to present penalty phase mitigation evidence regarding appellant’s cognitive functioning, and appellate counsel’s failure to properly litigate the claim on appeal.</p>

Appellant presented neuropsychologists Dr. Carol Armstrong and Dr. Barry Crown, both of whom offered expert testimony, based on their tests and examinations of appellant, that he suffered from organic brain damage, most likely originating in his early developmental period, resulting in cognitive dysfunction and disability. Moreover, both experts testified they reviewed school, work and forensic records existing at the time of appellant’s trial which, in their opinions, raised red flags indicating a neuropsychological exam should have been performed.

To further support his claim, appellant challenges what he says was the trial court’s confusing penalty phase instruction regarding the jury’s consideration of the evidence of Robinson’s murder.

Moreover, even had the claims been properly raised, the court found them meritless: Daughtry stated in his affidavit he would refuse to testify if called as a witness in any further proceedings and, although Richardson recanted his testimony in a post-trial hearing in codefendant’s case, the judge in that case, who also presided over this trial (Judge Clarke) found the recantation to be incredible. <em>See </em>PCRA Court Op. at 18.

In her concurring opinion, Justice Todd disagrees the issue has been previously litigated, because although the claim was raised on direct appeal, this Court misapprehended the issue to such an extent there was no merits ruling.

The Court properly stated the substantive issue was whether appellant received a fair trial. Although the Court did not set forth appellant’s arguments in detail, it nevertheless clearly identified and implicitly rejected the substantive claim of an unfair trial based on the court’s allegedly erroneous evidentiary rulings with respect to the triple-killing, and it explicitly rejected appellant’s arguments with respect to counsel’s ineffectiveness because they were not supported by the necessary legal analysis. <em>Hannibal, </em><a href="/a2d/753/1265-01" class="citation" data-index="198" data-cite="753 A.2d 1265" data-case-ids="11220025,11220117,226000,226004" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/1265-01,/a2d/753/1265-02,/pa/562/0131-01,/pa/562/0132-01">753 A.2d at 1272, n.11</a>.

Furthermore, I find a fundamental inconsistency in the majority’s simultaneous assertion that a claim is previously litigated on the ground that it is <em>the same claim </em>disposed on direct appeal, <em>see id., </em>but that the newly-asserted claim must <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>also be regarded as <em>a different claim, </em>when confronted with the question of whether the Court should remedy its own patent failure to fairly address it in the first instance. <em>Compare </em>Majority Opinion at 375, 156 A.3d at 219 (indicating that “Appellant has failed to articulate any material difference between the instant claim of a due process violation resulting in an unfair trial and the substantive claim raised and rejected on direct appeal.”), <em>with id. </em>at 375-76 n.14, 156 A.3d at 220 n.14 (asserting that, in his present brief, appellant presently “has not raised” the claim asserted on direct appeal).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a>
