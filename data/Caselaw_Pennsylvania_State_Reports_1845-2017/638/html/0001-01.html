Contrary to Vencil’s position, however, and unlike the proceeding at issue in Addington, a section 6111.1(g)(2) review is not a direct appeal from a 302 commitment and the interest at stake under 6111.1(g)(2) is not one’s right to liberty. The infringement upon Vencil’s liberty occurred when she was involuntarily committed pursuant to section 302 of the MHPA. By the time a section 6111.1(g)(2) petition is filed, the liberty deprivation has ended. A sufficiency review pursuant to section 6111.1(g)(2) of the Uniform Firearms Act is merely a mechanism to expunge the PSP’s record of an individual’s 302 commitment to remove this barrier to his or her possession and control of firearms.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

On the day of the final vote by the Pennsylvania House of Representatives before the bill was signed into law, immediately before the vote was taken, Representative William R. Lloyd, Jr., explained, in relevant part: “What we have done is to ... say that ... you have the right to challenge your original commitment on the grounds that there was not sufficient evidence for that commitment, and if you can demonstrate that there was not sufficient evidence, you then have the [firearms] disqualification removed.” Pa.
