    <p id="b731-6" data-blocks='[["BL_731.5",731,[182,637,1153,1067]]]'>On March 9, 1993, at approximately 12:15 p.m., Officer Gary Fluman, a correctional officer at the Allegheny County Jail, received a report from an inmate that there was a problem on Range 17, in the East Block of the jail. After requesting backup, Officer Fluman approached Cell 17-S. A group of inmates was gathered outside the cell and advised Officer Fluman that someone was under the bed and would not come out. Initially, Officer Fluman could see only the mattress and bedding, but, when he entered the cell and removed the mattress and bedding, he observed that inmate Seth Floyd had a ligature consisting of a shoe lace and a piece of nylon cord tied around his neck; the other end of the ligature was tied to a chain that holds the bed to the wall. Officer Fluman could not detect a pulse, and another officer who had arrived on the scene radioed for a doctor. A third officer cut the ligature, and the doctor unsuccessfully attempted to revive Floyd. Following an autopsy, it was determined that Floyd died as a result of asphyxiation due to ligature strangulation, and the manner of death was listed as pending due to suspicious circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b731-7" data-blocks='[["BL_731.6",731,[181,1754,1153,635]]]'>During their investigation into Floyd’s death, correctional officers interviewed several inmates. One inmate reported that he was walking past Floyd’s cell on his way to lunch and observed Appellee Shawn Burton and another individual, Melvin Goodwine, engaged in conversation with Floyd inside his cell. When confronted with this information, Goodwine admitted that he had been in Floyd’s cell for a short time. Appellee, however, denied being in the vicinity of Floyd’s cell around the time of Floyd’s death, and, in fact, denied ever being in Floyd’s cell. Appellee later admitted that he was near Floyd’s cell at the time he died, but maintained that he had never been inside Floyd’s cell.</p>

One of these two witnesses also stated that, shortly after he observed the physical altercation among Appellee, Goodwine, and Floyd, he saw Appellee and Goodwine run down the stairs, away from the area of Floyd’s cell. Another witness reported that, a few days before Floyd’s death, he overheard a conversation between Appellee and Goodwine in which Appellee told Goodwine that they needed to “fix that guy from California.” Affidavit for Criminal Complaint against Shawn Burton, 3/19/93, at 2. The witness explained that it is common knowledge in prison that the term “fix” means kill. <em>Id. </em>Further, it was confirmed that Floyd originally was from California, having recently moved to the Pittsburgh area. Based on the above evidence, Appellee and Goodwine were charged with Floyd’s murder.</p>

In rejecting the Commonwealth’s argument, we made clear that the exception set forth in subsection (b)(1)(h) does not require any merits analysis of the underlying claim. Rather, “the exception merely requires that the ‘facts’ upon which such a claim is predicated must not have been known to appellant, nor could they have been ascertained by due diligence.” <em>Lambert, </em><a href="/a2d/884/0848-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="884 A.2d 848" data-case-ids="8912059,8912136,988519,988530" data-case-paths="/a2d/884/0848-01,/a2d/884/0848-02,/pa/584/0461-01,/pa/584/0460-01">884 A.2d at 852</a>. Therefore, our opinion in <em>Lambert </em>indicated that the plain language of subsection (b)(1)(h) is not so narrow as to limit itself to only claims involving “after-discovered evidence.” Rather, subsection (b)(1)(h) has two components, which must be alleged and proved. Namely, the petitioner must establish that: 1) “the <em>facts </em>upon which the claim was predicated were <em>unknown” </em>and (2) could not have been ascertained by the exercise of <em>due diligence.” </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(h)(emphasis added). If the petitioner alleges and proves these two components, then the PCRA court has jurisdiction over the claim under this subsection. <em>See Lambert, supra.</em>

To reiterate, the newly-discovered facts exception to the time limitations of the PCRA, as set forth in subsection 9545(b)(l)(ii), is distinct from the after-discovered evidence basis for relief delineated in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2).

The PCRA court rejected the petitioner’s claim that the affidavits and notes of testimony qualified him for an exception under subsection 9545(b)(1)(i) or (ii), noting that, because evidence of the witness’ deal with the Commonwealth was offered in open court at the witness' sentencing hearing, it was a matter of public record which the petitioner could have discovered earlier with the exercise of due diligence.

PCRA Court Opinion, 11/6/2013, at *4-5, As Goodwine’s co-conspirator, Appellee necessarily knew the extent of their agreement to attempt or to commit a crime, and assuming Goodwine’s claim of self-defense is to be believed, Appellee should have known whether the killing of the victim was not a part of their agreement or plan. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 903(a)(1) (explaining that a person is guilty of conspiracy with another person to commit a crime if, with the intent of promoting or facilitating its commission, he agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such crime or an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime). In addition, I am cognizant of and troubled by the additional burden that the Majority’s proposed new hearing procedure will create for the courts of common pleas that are charged with reviewing PORA petitions in the first instance. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 719-20, 158 A.3d at 638 (stating that a PCRA court first must determine whether the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner, which may require a hearing, and if the court determines that the facts were unknown to the petitioner, then the court should proceed to consider whether the facts could have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence).</p>

Rather, my narrower interpretation of <em>Bennett </em>largely comports with that of Judge Olson in her dissenting opinion below. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The Majority does not expound upon its observation. It is unclear to me from the Majority Opinion at what stage an incarcerated PCRA petitioner must be <em>pro se </em>to qualify for the exception to the public record presumption. For example, to benefit from this exception, does the incarcerated petitioner have to be <em>pro se </em>when the “unknown fact” occurred, when it became publicly accessible, or when he files his PCRA petition? The answer to this inquiry begs the question as to when the petitioners in <em>Bennett </em>and the previously mentioned cases were and were not represented by counsel. In this case, we have no idea when exactly Appellee had or did not have counsel.</p>
