Appellants, Main Line Gardens, Inc. and Coffman Associates, LLC (collectively, “Main Line”), ask us to decide whether it was proper for the Commonwealth Court to dismiss its appeal because it did not file briefs in the trial court in support of post-trial motions. We conclude that the Commonwealth Court erred, and thus remand the case for merits review of the issues raised on appeal.</p>

In April 2011, Main Line received an enforcement notice from Appellee, the Board of Supervisors of Willistown Township (the “Township”), that asserted violations of the Township zoning ordinances. Main Line appealed the enforcement notice to the Township zoning hearing board, which, after hearings, determined that Main Line was in violation of the relevant zoning ordinances. To enforce the zoning board’s determination, in August 2013 the Township <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>filed seven complaints against Main Line with a magisterial district judge. Each of the seven complaints alleged violations during a distinct twelve-day period, together comprising violations over eighty-four days. The magisterial district judge entered judgments against Main Line in the amount of $6143 in each of the seven cases ($43,001 in total).</p>
    <p id="b367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[187,670,1156,801]]]'>Main Line appealed these decisions to the court of common pleas, and in accordance with rules governing practice before magisterial district judges, the Township responded by filing seven complaints<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> asserting the same violations of the zoning ordinance over the same eighty four day period. Unlike the complaints before the magisterial district judge, however, in the court of common pleas, the Township’s seven complaints were identical, all alleging zoning violations over a single, eighty four day period. The cases proceeded to arbitration, at the conclusion of which the arbitrator entered an award ($21,274.67) in the Township’s favor in one action (No. 2013-05036), and defense judgments in favor of Main Line in the other six cases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Township entered judgment on the arbitrator’s award in the case docketed at 2013-05036 and filed notices of appeal in the other six cases.</p>

In supporting briefs filed in each case, Main Line argued that res judicata barred the Township from offering proof of damages because the arbitrator had rendered a decision on damages (in case No. 2013-05036) for the entire eighty four day period alleged in that case, and case No. 2013-05036 was a final judgment because <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>the Township had not filed an appeal from that decision. In response, the Township filed motions for leave to amend its complaints in the six actions to set forth the distinct twelve-day time periods that had been delineated in the complaints filed before the magisterial district judge. Main Line filed briefs in response, arguing against amendment on res judicata grounds. The Township also filed cross-motions for summary judgment with supporting briefs in the six cases, offering its own res judicata argument, namely that the doctrine should bar Main Line from contesting the arbitrator’s factual findings relating to its ordinance violations in case No. 2013-05036 because Main Line also had not filed an appeal from that decision. Main Line filed responses and supporting briefs to the Township’s cross-motions for summary judgment, offering further argument with respect to the proper application of res judicata under the existing procedural posture of the six cases.</p>

After trial, the trial court ruled in favor of the Township in all six actions, entering judgments of $15,200 in each case. In a footnote to one of its orders, the trial court indicated that Main Line had not properly raised res judicata as a defense in the six actions by failing to include it in the pleadings.

In its post-trial motions, Main Line specified both the grounds for which it sought relief and the various ways it had asserted those grounds before and during trial. As pertinent to this appeal, Main Line argued that the trial court had erred, inter alia, in the following respects: (1) “in not applying <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>the doctrine of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel, claiming the same were not pled;” (2) “in concluding [that Main Line] should have pled res judicata to enable [the Township] to take ‘appropriate steps to separate each' of the causes of action;” and (3) in granting the Township leave to amend its complaints, all of which “requested relief for the same claims and the same time periods as had already been finally litigated.” Main Line’s Motion for Posh-Trial Relief, 12/30/2014, at 1-3.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The letter was not docketed in the proceedings below. Main Line did not file briefs and the docket does not reflect that oral argument took place. The Township filed a brief in opposition to Main Line’s motions for post-trial relief, arguing that Main Line’s failure to brief its post-trial motions constituted “waiver and abandonment of the issues not briefed.” Township’s Opposition Brief, 3/31/2015, at 1.</p>

These orders made no reference to the Township’s contention that Main Line had waived or abandoned any issues. After Main Line filed notices of appeal with the Commonwealth Court, the trial court ordered the filing of statements of the issues complained of on appeal pursuant to Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure. In its subsequent written opinion pursuant to Rule 1925(a), the trial court addressed the res judicata issue on its merits, indicating that its prior contention that Main Line had not properly asserted the defense was in error. Trial Court Opinion, 9/31/2015, at 3.

The appellant filed a brief in support of the post-trial motions, but included no argument therein with respect to one issue. <em>DiSalle, </em><a href="/pa-super/375/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="375 Pa.

On appeal, the Superior Court held that the issue was waived based upon the failure to brief it. <em>Id. </em>at 1364. In so ruling, the Superior Court did not reference any language in Rule 227.1 requiring the filing of briefs. Instead, the Superior Court noted that because the purpose of post-trial practice is to inform the trial court of the issues so that it may be given an opportunity to decide them in advance of appellate review, “common sense mandates that any issue raised in the motion for post-trial relief must also be briefed and argued to the trial court.” <em>Id. </em>at 1363.

Instead, in our view, proper practice in this regard was articulately set forth in a concurring opinion by the Honorable Maureen Lally-Green in <em>Jackson v. Kassab, </em><a href="/a2d/812/1233-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="812 A.2d 1233" data-case-ids="11375873" data-case-paths="/a2d/812/1233-01">812 A.2d 1233</a> (Pa. Super. 2002). In <em>Jackson, </em>as in the present case, following the appellant’s filing of post-trial motions, the trial court requested briefing on the motions in a letter to the parties. <em><a href="/a2d/812/1233-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="812 A.2d 1233" data-case-ids="11375873" data-case-paths="/a2d/812/1233-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/812/1233-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="812 A.2d 1233" data-case-ids="11375873" data-case-paths="/a2d/812/1233-01">at 1236</a> (Lally-Green, J., concurring). When the appellant <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>failed to comply with the request, the trial court denied the post-trial motions. <em><a href="/a2d/812/1233-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="812 A.2d 1233" data-case-ids="11375873" data-case-paths="/a2d/812/1233-01">Id.</a> </em>(Lally-Green, J., concurring). Judge Lally-Green explained that the trial court’s finding of waiver in that circumstance was entirely appropriate because a trial court has the inherent authority to order the filing of briefs, and if a party fails to comply with an order to do so, “the result may be waiver of the unbriefed issues.” <em><a href="/a2d/812/1233-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="812 A.2d 1233" data-case-ids="11375873" data-case-paths="/a2d/812/1233-01">Id.</a> </em>(Lally-Green, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[271,794,1153,520]]]'>Because Rule 227.1(b)(2) does not require supporting briefs, the failure to file a brief does not violate the rule, and neither the trial court nor the appellate courts may find waiver pursuant to the rule for failing to do so. In its discretion, based upon its conclusion that it requires further advocacy on the issues, a trial court may request that the parties file briefs. In the event of non-compliance with such a request, it is for the trial court, again in its discretion, to find waiver or, alternatively, to overlook the noncompliance and rule on the merits of the issues presented.</p>
    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[270,1337,1155,1051]]]'>In the present case, the trial court followed this practice precisely. Its letter of January 7, 2014 advised the parties of the briefing schedule for post-trial motions, and Main Line thereafter failed to file briefs in response. The trial court, in its discretion, chose to overlook this non-compliance. In its order denying Main Line’s post-trial motions, the trial court indicated that it was doing so “upon consideration of [Main Line’s] motion for post-trial relief ... and upon consideration of the briefs and arguments of counsel.” Trial Court Orders, 4/22/2015 (Nos. 2013-05037, 05041-45). Based upon our review of the certified record, the trial court’s decision not to find waiver, and to instead rule on the merits of the issues raised in the post-trial motions, was entirely understandable, as by the time Main Line filed its post-trial motions, the parties had each filed at least five briefs in each of the six cases (thirty in total), all arguing the merits of Main Line’s attempted assertion of a res judicata defense. The record further reflects that the trial court heard oral argument from the parties during the course of the proceedings on the res judicata issue. <em>See </em>N.T., 11/3/2014, at 17, 86-87, 122-31.</p>
