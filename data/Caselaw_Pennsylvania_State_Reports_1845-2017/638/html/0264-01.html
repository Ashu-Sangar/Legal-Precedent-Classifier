    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.5",316,[261,479,1153,744]]]'>On March 6, 2007, Junius Burno was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a), and sentenced to death. In this direct appeal from the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County, Burno challenges the admissibility of his confession to the murders, the sufficiency of the evidence, the alleged denial of his right to a speedy trial, and the admissibility of certain evidence establishing an aggravating factor for purposes of the death penalty. We reject all but one of these challenges on the merits. We find merit to Burno’s argument that one of his statements to police was inadmissible because it was obtained during the course of plea negotiations. However, we ultimately conclude that the erroneous admission of this statement at trial was harmless. Consequently, we affirm Burno’s death sentence.</p>
    <p id="b316-6" data-blocks='[["BL_316.6",316,[261,1242,1153,583]]]'>On April 13, 2003, two men entered an apartment in Allentown, Pennsylvania and proceeded to shoot and kill Carlos Juarbe and Oscar Rosado. The investigation that followed eventually led the Allentown Police to arrest Terrance Bethea for the murders. Soon thereafter, Bethea implicated Burno in the shootings. On September 12, 2003, Burno surrendered to the police and was arrested. Burno elected not to speak with the police about the murders without counsel. Burno then retained the services of Glennis Clark, Esquire. In the weeks that followed, Burno provided the police with multiple inculpa-tory statements regarding the murders.</p>
    <p id="b316-7" data-blocks='[["BL_316.7",316,[260,1848,1155,526]],["BL_317.1",317,[186,340,1159,416]]]'>Attorney Clark arranged a September 24, 2003 meeting with the police and assistant district attorney (“ADA”) Maria Dantos. On that date, Burno and Attorney Clark met with Detective Wayne Simock, Detective John Miller, and ADA Dantos in the law library of the Lehigh County District Attorney’s Office. At the inception of the meeting, Detective Simock and ADA Dantos detailed the rules applicable to Burno’s cooperation. Specifically, ADA Dantos explained to Attorney Clark and to Burno that Burno was required to tell the truth about what had happened on April 13, 2003, and <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>would need to testify against Bethea at Bethea’s preliminary hearing and trial. In exchange, ADA Dantos promised that she would not seek the death penalty against Burno. However, if the negotiations fell through or broke down for any reason, any statements that Burno had made would be used against him at a future trial. Burno and Attorney Clark both agreed to these terms. Burno then spoke about the murders for approximately two hours. The conversation was not recorded.</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[185,780,1157,570]]]'>During this conversation, Burno identified the locations of the two guns that he and Bethea used during the murders. Detectives Simock and Miller then took Burno to the police station to record his statement. On the way, they stopped to retrieve the secreted guns. Once at the police station, Detective Simock provided Burno with Miranda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> warnings. Burno then repeated his statement, which was tape-recorded. In this statement, Burno claimed that he drove Bethea to Juarbe’s apartment to trade guns for drugs, but asserted that Bethea was the only person to enter the apartment. Burno stated that he remained in the car at all times.</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[185,1379,1155,898]],["BL_318.1",318,[276,343,1150,149]]]'>The police and ADA Dantos did not believe Burno’s statement. ADA Dantos conferred with Attorney Clark about these suspicions. ADA Dantos and Attorney Clark agreed that, in order to test the veracity of his statement, Burno should submit to a polygraph test. On September 26, 2003, police officer Keith Morris met with Burno, provided Miranda warnings, and administered the polygraph test. Although he had known about the polygraph examination and consented to it, Attorney Clark was not present for the examination itself. Typically, at the end of a polygraph examination, Officer Morris would take some time and review the results. However, Officer Morris did not find that necessary in this case inasmuch as he detected immediately that Burno’s statement was not truthful. Officer Morris then informed Burno that he had failed the polygraph test. Burno stared at Officer Morris, and stated that no one could save him at that point. Officer Morris responded by telling Burno that he did not believe that no one <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>could save him. Officer Morris then told Burno that, generally, telling the truth is a way that a person in his position could help himself.</p>
    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[274,514,1153,781]]]'>After pondering Officer Morris' statement briefly, Burno asked to speak with Attorney Clark. However, Attorney Clark was unavailable at that time. After being advised of the results, ADA Dantos proceeded to the interview room to inform Burno, who was crying and upset, that authorities were attempting to contact his attorney. Burno apologized to ADA Dantos for lying, and expressed remorse for his actions. ADA Dantos reminded Burno that, because he was not truthful, the parties no longer had a deal to forego the death penalty. ADA Dantos explained to Burno, however, that if he was truthful from that point on, the parties could recommence plea discussions. She emphasized that he had to tell the truth and that, at that point, there was no deal on the table. Hearing that, Burno told ADA Dantos that he was remorseful and that he would have to face the consequences for his crimes.</p>
    <p id="b318-6" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[274,1317,1151,416]]]'>Eventually, ADA Dantos was able to reach Attorney Clark by telephone. Attorney Clark then spoke with Burno over the phone. Attorney Clark agreed to come to the police station, but could not get there for some time. Nevertheless, Attorney Clark authorized the police to commence discussions with Burno before he arrived, in part because he believed that Burno could not do any more damage than he already had done by lying.</p>
    <p id="b318-7" data-blocks='[["BL_318.6",318,[272,1757,1152,616]]]'>Burno met with Detective Simock and Detective Joseph Effting, even though Attorney Clark had not yet arrived at the police station. The detectives once again provided Burno with Miranda warnings. In the ensuing statement, Burno admitted that he and Bethea went to Juarbe’s residence, knowing that Juarbe was a drug dealer, and intending to rob Juarbe to settle a dispute that Bethea had with Juarbe. Burno admitted that he got into a scuffle with Rosado, and then shot him with a nine millimeter handgun. After Burno provided additional details surrounding the murders, Attorney Clark arrived at the station and knocked on the door of the interview room.</p>
    <p id="b319-3" data-blocks='[["BL_319.3",319,[189,344,1157,305]]]'>
      <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>Once Attorney Clark was seated and had spoken to Burno, Detectives Simock and Effting continued the interview. Much of this portion of the interview involved reviewing parts of what Burno had stated before Attorney Clark arrived. Among other points, Burno again admitted that he had participated in the murders.</p>
    <p id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[191,699,1154,693]]]'>At the conclusion of the interview, Detective Simock reminded Burno that, for the authorities to consider taking the death penalty off the table, Burno’s statement had to be truthful and Burno had to testify against Bethea. However, on October 28, 2003, the day before Bethea’s preliminary hearing, Burno informed Detective Simock and ADA Dantos that he no longer was willing to cooperate in the prosecution of Bethea. In addition to removing the death penalty from consideration, Burno wanted his homicide charges reduced to third-degree. ADA Dantos would not make that deal, and, in light of Burno’s decision not to cooperate, indicated to Burno and Attorney Clark that there would be no agreement. She informed them that she would be seeking the death penalty against Burno.</p>
    <p id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[190,1433,1155,962]],["BL_320.1",320,[266,341,1148,101]]]'>Prior to trial, Burno filed numerous motions to suppress the statements that he provided to the police. Among his claims for relief, Burno maintained that: (1) the warrant for his arrest lacked probable cause, and any resulting statements were fruit of the poisonous tree; (2) his statements were coerced by Officer Miller during the polygraph examination; (3) his statements were inadmissible because they were made during the process of plea negotiation; and (4) the September 26, 2003 statements were involuntary because Attorney Clark was not present for the first portion of the statement, and the second portion of the statement was tainted unconstitutionally by Attorney Clark’s absence during the first part. After an evidentiary hearing, and in two separate orders, the trial court denied Burno’s motions to suppress his statements on all points except the argument relative to the first portion of the September 26, 2003 tape-recorded confession. Because Attorney Clark was not present for that part of the statement, the trial court suppressed that portion of the statement. However, <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>because Attorney Clark arrived for the second portion, the court ruled that portion to be admissible.</p>
    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.4",320,[265,481,1152,575]]]'>Because of ADA Dantos’ involvement in obtaining Bumo’s confessions, and believing that she might be a material witness at trial concerning the voluntariness of the confessions, Burno filed a pre-trial motion for the assignment of a new prosecuting attorney. On April 18, 2005, the trial court granted the motion in part, relegating ADA Dantos to serve as second chair at Burno’s trial instead of as the lead prosecutor. The Commonwealth filed a motion seeking reconsideration, which the trial court denied. On April 21, 2005, the Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal from the order denying its motion for reconsideration.</p>
    <p id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[262,1103,1157,583]]]'>In its notice of appeal, the Commonwealth did not expressly invoke Pa.R,A,P. 313, which governs appeals of collateral orders. Nonetheless, the Commonwealth set forth the terms of the rule and explained that the order was “separable and collateral to the main cause of action, the right involved is too important to be denied review, and the question presented is such that if review is postponed until final judgment, the claim will be irreparably lost.” See Notice of Appeal, 4/21/2005, ¶ 2. Notably, the Commonwealth did not certify that the order terminated or substantially handicapped its prosecution pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 311(d).</p>
    <p id="b320-6" data-blocks='[["BL_320.6",320,[262,1730,1154,419]]]'>In the interim, both parties sought permission to file an interlocutory appeal, contending that the issue involved a controlling issue of law upon which a substantial basis for difference of opinion existed. See 42 Pa.C.S, § 702(b). The trial court granted permission to both parties,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> However, the Superior Court denied permission to appeal upon that basis.

    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[189,1214,1156,724]]]'>The appeal delayed the proceedings for one year. Burno filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss the charges against him pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 600, alleging that he was denied his right to a speedy trial because the Commonwealth’s appeal lacked a jurisdictional basis. Burno maintained that, because the Commonwealth did not demonstrate that the trial court’s order was, in fact, a collateral order, and did not certify that the appeal terminated or substantially handicapped the prosecution pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 311, the Superior Court never had jurisdiction to rule upon the appeal. Because the Commonwealth did not perfect jurisdiction, it had no right to appeal, and, therefore, did not act with due diligence so as to justify the delay.

For instance, he initially gave the police a statement claiming he and Bethea were innocent bystanders who were visiting Juarbe when two armed intruders entered the residence, and Bethea was shot when he got caught in the crossfire between Juarbe and the intruders. However, on September 24, 2003, Burno gave the police a taped statement in which he admitted to some involvement with the crime. Burno explained during the taped statement that, some months prior to the killings, Bethea had informed him that he obtained two handguns when he burglarized his neighbor’s apartment. One of the handguns was a nine-millimeter model, which Bethea gave to Burno. [Burno] also explained that, in April of 2003, when he took his ex-wife, Michele Wright, medicine for their daughter, he stole a .38 caliber handgun from underneath Ms. Wright’s bed. Burno claimed he drove Bethea to Juarbe’s residence on the night in question in order to trade the .38 caliber handgun for drugs and money, and he remained in the car at all times.

Burno is correct to assert that the affidavit was not rife with information implicating him as one of the murderers. However, Burno demands more from the affidavit than the law requires. The affidavit need only establish the probability that Burno was involved in the murders. The affidavit established without question that Juarbe and Rosado were murdered. The affidavit contained statements <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>from Ms. Moyer, who indicated that she heard gunshots and saw two men fleeing the scene in a maroon car. Records discussed in the affidavit revealed that Burno owned a similarly colored car. The affidavit further set forth the forensic evidence that tied Bethea to the murders. Bethea, who was wounded in the leg during the shootout, placed Burno at the scene of the crime, which also made it probable that Burno was one of the two men who fled the scene shortly after Ms. Moyer heard gunshots. There was no forensic evidence to suggest that any other perpetrators were present at the scene.</p>

Burno’s presence at the scene, plus the fact that two people were seen hastily fleeing the scene soon after the gunshots, plus Burno’s assistance in Bethea’s escape in a car belonging to Burno, plus Burno’s unwillingness to discuss the events with Bethea’s wife, collectively produce at least a probability that Burno was a participant in the murders. At a minimum, the information provided the magisterial district judge with a reasonable basis to conclude that Bethea did not act alone, and that it was probable that Burno was an accomplice, if not a principal actor.</p>

If a search warrant is based upon an affidavit containing deliberate or knowing misstatements of material fact, the search warrant is invalid, unless probable cause exists notwithstanding any deliberate omissions or misrepresentations of fact. See generally Franks v. Delaware, <a href="/us/438/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="438 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="1769234" data-case-paths="/us/438/0154-01">438 U.S. 154</a>, 155-56, <a href="/us/438/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="438 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="1769234" data-case-paths="/us/438/0154-01">98 S.Ct. 2674</a>, <a href="/us/438/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="438 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="1769234" data-case-paths="/us/438/0154-01">57 L.Ed.2d 667</a> (1978) (holding that a warrant must be voided if an affiant made a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, unless the affidavit’s remaining content is sufficient to establish probable cause). Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the detectives omitted Bethea’s statement that two other men committed the murder and misrepresented Meade’s statements about which cars were used on the night in question, probable cause existed nonetheless. Bethea confirmed that Burno was present at the shootout during which Bethea was <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>wounded, and that Burno helped Bethea escape from the scene of the crime. This information makes it probable that Burno was involved at least as an accomplice. Bethea’s self-serving exculpatory statements would not have negated that probability, nor were they supported by any evidence that the police had discovered. Additionally, even if Meade told the police that Burno and Bethea arrived and left in different vehicles, suggesting the presence of something other than a maroon vehicle, the affidavit still contained Ms. Moyer’s statement that she saw two men leaving the murder scene in a maroon vehicle. As well, the affidavit set forth information connecting Burno to a vehicle of that color. Upon our deferential review, that information sufficed to support the probable cause finding. The alleged misrepresentations or omissions do not upset that calculus.</p>

There, while in the custody of Pennsylvania State Police regarding a charge of receiving stolen property, John Stutter (“Stutter”) stated that “he would be willing to cooperate with the Commonwealth” on unrelated burglary and conspiracy charges, “if he would receive judicial consideration for his cooperation.” <a href="/a2d/966/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="966 A.2d 594" data-case-ids="8161013" data-case-paths="/a2d/966/0594-01">Id. at 596-97</a>. The troopers relayed Stutter’s message to the district attorney who, in turn, authorized the troopers to communicate to Stutter her “plea bargain offer of county sentences for the stolen property charge and the [burglary and conspiracy] charges” and “immunity for information regarding any other crimes in which Stutter had been involved.” <a href="/a2d/966/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="966 A.2d 594" data-case-ids="8161013" data-case-paths="/a2d/966/0594-01">Id. at 597</a>. The troopers communicated the offer to Stutter, who then gave a statement fully admitting his participation in the burglary. Subsequently, Stutter recanted his agreement to cooperate, and the Commonwealth’s offer of county time was withdrawn. The trial court denied Stutter’s motion to suppress, and the jury found him guilty of all charges.</p>

With respect to whether Stutter exhibited an actual subjective expectancy that his statements were made in regard to plea negotiations, the Superior Court found relevant the trooper’s testimony that Stutter told him that he was willing to cooperate with the Commonwealth if he would receive judicial consideration in return. The Superior Court found Stutter’s subjective expectancy was reasonable, noting that Stutter refused to give his statement until he received leniency, and only confessed after the trooper communicated the district attorney’s offer of county time for his cooperation. <a href="/a2d/966/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="966 A.2d 594" data-case-ids="8161013" data-case-paths="/a2d/966/0594-01">Id. at 600</a>.</p>

At the time he gave the statement, Burno was under arrest for two murders. He had just failed the polygraph. He was told that the original deal was off. He was surrounded by detectives and ADA Dantos. He was upset and concerned about facing the death penalty. His attorney was advising him to tell the truth in the hopes of obtaining something less than the death penalty. ADA Dantos then expressed her willingness to recommence plea negotiations, which were to begin with Burno making both a truthful statement and a promise to testify against Bethea.</p>

She also explained how, when Burno reneged on the deal and refused to testify at Bethea’s preliminary hearing on September 28, 2003, “death [was] back on the table.” Id. at 86. If Burno’s statement was not made in furtherance of plea discussions, there would be no reason for ADA Dantos to place death “back on the table.” For death to be placed “back on the table” there had to be a prior agreement to take it off.

Although ADA Dantos took the original deal off the table, she then encouraged Burno to confess and testify against Bethea, and in turn indicated that she was willing to participate in plea discussions. The promise made by ADA Dantos, vague though it was, prompted Burno to confess and ultimately resulted in a deal. There is no question that the Commonwealth was participating in plea discussions with Burno at the time that he confessed. This is the relevant inquiry under Vandivner.

Attorney Clark’s appearance, and his consent to continue with the interrogation, very clearly suffices as an intervening event that removed the only taint found by the trial court and broke the chain of events so as to insulate the second statement from the first. Moreover, we note that, upon consideration of the last factor from Green, the police misconduct in this case does not appear to be purposeful or flagrant.

Burno had the assistance of counsel at every stage of the process. Attorney Clark was present to negotiate the initial deal with ADA Dantos that would have taken the death penalty off the table for Burno. Attorney Clark advised Burno to provide a truthful statement, and was consulted before and after Burno took (and failed) the polygraph examination. Following some delay, ADA Dantos was able to reach Attorney Clark after Burno failed the test, whereupon Attorney Clark advised Burno to speak with the police and gave permission to begin the interrogation without him. Attorney Clark eventually arrived, spoke with Burno, and sat with Burno during the final confession. Throughout the process, the detectives provided Burno with Miranda warnings on three separate occasions. There is no indication that Burno failed to understand his rights, or that he was at any time unaware of his right to insist upon the presence of his attorney or of his right to remain silent. The record contains no indication that Burno was forced, or compelled in any way, to speak with the police.</p>

None of the interrogations was extensive, nor were they performed in a way that debilitated or weakened Burno’s psychological functions. There was no evidence that the police were threatening, abusive, or unduly coercive.

There is no evidence to suggest that ADA Dantos met with Burno in an effort to extract a confession, or that she maneuvered to speak to Burno without Attorney Clark’s permission or knowledge. More importantly, there is nothing about this interaction to suggest that the confession that Burno provided the police later was involuntary as a result of ADA Dantos’ statements.

Although the term life-in-being is rarely, if ever, listed as a specific point of proof, or as an element of murder, it is axiomatic that the victim must be alive before being killed unlawfully. The fault in Burno’s argument is that he appears to believe that the only manner of proving this point is through a specific witness who takes the stand to testify to seeing the victim(s) alive during the time period immediately preceding the murder. This is simply incorrect. It is hornbook law that the Commonwealth may prove its case using wholly circumstantial evidence, and that circumstantial evidence can itself be sufficient to prove any or every element of the crime.

Burno focuses his argument upon the approximate one-year time period that it took for the Commonwealth to litigate its appeal of the trial court’s decision to remove ADA Dantos from the lead prosecutor role. Burno maintains that the Commonwealth failed to establish that the Superior Court had jurisdiction over the appeal. Burno argues that the Commonwealth neither <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>demonstrated that the order in question was an appealable collateral order pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 313 nor that the order terminated or substantially handicapped its prosecution pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 311(d).

The Commonwealth asserts that the appeal was filed in good faith and was accepted and ruled upon by the Superior Court. As such, even though the Superior Court did not address whether the Commonwealth had satisfied each element of the collateral order doctrine, the Commonwealth maintains that the court nonetheless impliedly granted permission under that doctrine by disposing of the case on the merits.

See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9). According to Burno, the facts of the prior conviction demonstrated that no person was present at the time of the entry into the structure that resulted in the conviction, and, therefore, there was no risk of personal violence to anyone. As such, the conviction should not have been admitted in support of this aggravating factor.</p>

The act that society seeks to punish is the nefarious agreement, which, by its very nature, cannot be a violent act, unless violence is used during the formation of the agreement itself. There is no evidence that such violence occurred. Despite the fact that the conspiracy charge did not itself recite a violent crime, the trial court nonetheless allowed the Commonwealth to submit the crime to the jury for consideration, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as well as the general proscription against allowing non-statutory aggravation evidence.

Thus, even assuming, <em>arguen-do, </em>that Burno is correct that the trial court incorrectly permitted the Commonwealth to introduce the conspiracy conviction, any such error would be harmless, as no prejudice befell Burno.
