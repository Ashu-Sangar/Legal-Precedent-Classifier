N.T. 11/5/14 at 91. At these various locations, troopers recovered numerous black garbage bags with blue handle ties containing the body parts of a woman, except for her hands. <em>Id. </em>at 91-93. Surprising to Corporal Radziewicz was the fact that most of the body parts were relatively cleanly severed, probably with a knife or saw, and free from blood. <em>Id. </em>at 102, 121. However, there was blood and a jagged cut in the shoulder area where the neck and head were severed from the rest of the body. <em>Id. </em>at 157.

Dr. Ross also found pre-death injuries, including lacerations, on the back of the victim’s head which he determined were consistent with being struck with a <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>crowbar or a pipe. <em>Id. </em>at 34-38. Dr. Ross concluded the victim suffered at least seventeen different impacts to her face and head area while she was still alive as there was swelling and hemorrhaging which would not have occurred had the victim been deceased prior to the trauma. <em>Id. </em>at 44. Further pre-death injuries were found to the victim’s torso, including all twelve ribs being fractured multiple times. <em>Id. </em>at 51. Dr. Ross concluded these injuries resulted from being stomped with a boot or shoe. <em>Id. </em>at 54. Dr. Ross also found evidence the victim was strangled while alive based on the red-purple appearance of her face and hemorrhaging in the throat area. <em>Id. </em>at 61-64. Using a process called “blood staining,” and based on blood and blood clotting around the neck tissue, Dr. Ross concluded the victim was alive when her neck and head were severed from her torso. <em>Id. </em>at 75-90.

More recently, however, this Court has recognized that we may affirm a judgment based on harmless error even if that argument was not raised by the Commonwealth because “an appellate court has the ability to affirm a valid judgment or verdict for any reason appearing as of record.” <em>Commonwealth v. Moore, </em><a href="/pa/594/0619-01" class="citation" data-index="167" data-cite="594 Pa. 619" data-case-ids="3595655" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0619-01">594 Pa. 619</a>, <a href="/pa/594/0619-01" class="citation" data-index="168" data-cite="937 A.2d 1062" data-case-ids="3595655,8363820" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0619-01,/a2d/937/1062-01">937 A.2d 1062</a>, 1073 (2007); <em>see also, Allshouse, supra </em>(finding that violation of the defendant’s constitutional right of confrontation was harmless despite the Commonwealth’s failure to raise harmless error argument on appeal). Thus, while ordinarily the Commonwealth has the burden of persuasion<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> when it asserts that a particular error was harmless, <em>sua sponte </em>invocation of the harmless error doctrine is not inappropriate as it does nothing more than affirm a valid judgment of sentence on an alternative basis.</p>

In an apparent effort to maintain consistency in its position, the Commonwealth did not raise harmless error in the instant appeal and reiterated at oral argument before this Court that it was not pursuing harmless error. The Commonwealth’s position in this regard, however, does not prevent this Court from examining the harmless error doctrine. Rather, the determination that an error is harmless is a legal determination and an appellate court is not bound by the Commonwealth’s concession.</p>

      <em>Sua sponte </em>invocation of harmless error under these circumstances is consistent with both the rationale undergirding the harmless error doctrine and the well-established principle that an appellate court can affirm a valid judgment for any reason appearing of record. While this Court should exercise restraint when invoking the right for any reason doctrine and in finding harmless error <em>sua sponte, </em>it is appropriate where, as here, the Commonwealth has demonstrated the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and retrying the defendant would be a waste of judicial resources. Moreover, <em>sua sponte </em>application of harmless error in a capital case is not novel. <em>See Moore, supra, </em>(finding harmless error in a capital case where the trial court erroneously admitted hearsay evidence despite the Commonwealth’s failure to assert that the error was harmless). Thus, regardless of the Commonwealth’s position, I do not believe we are precluded from <em>sua sponte </em>deeming an error to be harmless based upon our independent review of the record before us. For the reasons described below, I conclude that the prejudicial effect of the admission of the Rule 404(b) evidence was insignificant compared to the remaining overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt such that it did not contribute to the verdict in this case.</p>

Ordinarily, it would be highly suggestive that a defendant was guilty of murder in light of evidence that: the defendant was the last person to be seen with the deceased before she went missing; that multiple garbage bags containing her dismembered body parts were found within miles of the defendant’s home; that garbage bags matching those which contained her dismembered body parts where discovered in the defendant’s home; and that her severed hands were discovered inside the wall of the defendant’s bedroom closet. However, in order to avoid a homicide conviction, Appellant’s trial strategy here was to acknowledge that he was with the victim around the time of her death and maintain that he dismembered and disposed of her body in a moment of panic after she died of a drug overdose. <em>See </em>N.T., 11/5/2014, at 61-68 (counsel for Appellant stating “I’m [ ] going to tell you that Mr. Hicks is guilty of abuse of a corpse” and opining that the victim died of a drug overdose). Consequently, the guilt-determinative question for the jury was whether the victim’s manner of death was homicide or a drug overdose and much of the trial centered on whether there were any indications that she sustained fatal injuries before she was dismembered by Appellant.</p>

Indeed, while disagreeing as to the nature of certain of the victim’s injuries, both of Appellant’s expert pathologists, Dr. John Shane and Dr. Isidore Mihalakis, testified as to their conclusions that the manner of the victim’s death was homicide. See, <em>e.g., </em>N.T. 11/12/2014, at 43-45 (cross-examination of Dr. Shane in which he agreed that he would call the victim’s death a homicide); N.T., 11/12/2014, at 76 (testimony of Dr. Mihalakis stating that the victim died of “homicidal violence” due to “multiple traumatic injuries that resulted in death.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Therefore, the Commonwealth’s expert testimony in this case, that the victim suffered extensive pre-mortem injuries and that the manner of her death was homicide, was in fact corroborated by Appellant’s experts.

Rather than grabbing her throat while in his home, he grabbed the back of her neck while in a car. She never lost consciousness.

However, there is apparent tension between that principle and the well-settled rule that the "Commonwealth bears the burden of demonstrating harmless error.” Commonwealth v. Chmiel, <a href="/pa/585/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="267" data-cite="585 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="2471663,2473146" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0547-01,/pa/585/0547-02">585 Pa. 547</a>, <a href="/pa/585/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="268" data-cite="889 A.2d 501" data-case-ids="2471663,2473146,8993560,8993616" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0547-01,/pa/585/0547-02,/a2d/889/0501-01,/a2d/889/0501-02">889 A.2d 501</a>, 521 (2005). Although I believe that we can apply the doctrine without prior invocation, it seems inconsistent to assign to a party a burden of proof that is applicable only in appellate proceedings, while determining simultaneously that the papy has satisfied that burden without the party raising or addressing the doctrine in any way. Nonetheless, in light of the Commonwealth's unequivocal abandonment of the harmless error <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>claim here, any tension between these principles can (and should) be resolved in another case.</p>

For example, one forensic pathologist, Dr. Ross, opined that numerous, violent injuries were inflicted upon the victim before her death, including at least seventeen different impacts to her head and neck. Dr. Ross also determined that the victim was strangled while still alive. These injuries were particularly relevant because Hicks was the last person to be seen wffh the victim while she was alive.</p>
