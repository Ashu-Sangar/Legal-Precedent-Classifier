Sicilia, M.D., “the Physician-Evaluator” conducting the IRE, was obligated to evaluate Claimant’s PTSD/adjustment disorder as an impairment arising from the compensable injury set forth in the NCP. Majority Opinion at 59 n.5,152 A.3d at 986 n.5. Rather, “it was Claimant’s position that the Physician-Evaluator had failed to rate the full range of work-related injuries, since Claimant suffered from adjustment disorder with depressed mood and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his work <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>injury.” Id. at 59, 152 A.3d at 986. Nevertheless, the majority finds that the issue argued by Claimant sufficiently subsumes the analysis conducted by the majority.

    <p id="b115-4" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[183,824,1155,1035]]]'>First, Claimant has never posited that his PTSD/adjustment disorder derived in any way from his accepted compensable work-related injury set forth in the NCP, <em>ie., </em>his hand injury.

Indeed, it seems obvious that the PTSD and adjustment disorder do not derive from claimant’s hand injury but, if compensable, are a result of being electrocuted. The majority takes the view that, regardless, the Physician-Evaluator conducting the IRE must independently evaluate any mentioned impairment a claimant makes at the examination and consider the causal relationship between the impairment and the compensable injury in the NCP. Majority Opinion at 64, 152 A.3d at 989. Thus, even in a case like this, where the Claimant himself does not purport that the impairment he is expressing, PTSD/adjustment disorder, is related to his accepted hand injury, if the physician fails to evaluate those conditions, then the IRE is to be disregarded by the WCJ.

The Majority arrives at this interpretation by disregarding the statutory definition of the word “impairment.” Because the Majority’s reading of Subsection 306(a.2) will compromise the impairment-rating process, which exists to quantify a claimant’s whole body impairment due to his established work-related injuries, I respectfully dissent.</p>

To make matters worse, the Fourth Edition of the Guides—the most recent version in existence when the General Assembly enacted Subsection 306(a.2) in 1996—categorically rejects the use of impairment percentages in the context of mental disorders, and contains no formula for calculating them.

That the Fourth Edition of the <em>Guides </em>eschews the practice of assigning impairment percentages in the context of mental disorders is not open to serious debate. In that publication, the AMA, in no uncertain terms, took the position that there is no evidence “to support any method for assigning a percentage of impairment” to mental or behavioral disorders. Am. Med. Ass'n, Guides To the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 300 (4th ed. 1993). It is of no moment that the State of Maine’s Workers’ Compensation Act allows physicians to rate such impairments using criteria that were intended to be used for other purposes. Maj. Op. at 73, 152 A.3d at 995 (citing Harvey v. H.C.

        <em>Guides </em>(the adoption of which the Commonwealth Court has held unconstitutional) despite the undeniable fact that the Sixth Edition differs dramatically from the Fourth Edition, particularly in the context of mental disorders. The prospect that this Court, if presented with a challenge to the absence of certain impairment-rating criteria in the Fourth Edition, might apply a layer of judicial gloss on top of the AMA’s handiwork does not make the Majority’s statutory interpretation any less problematic.</p>

Although the NCP describes the compensable injury as a spinal injury, the physician— perhaps having read the Majority’s decision—finds that the claimant is suffering from PTSD, which he believes is fairly attributable to the claimant’s work injury. After evaluating the claimant’s physical and mental injuries, the physician concludes that the claimant has a fifty-percent impairment rating. This scenario is problematic because the issue of causation should be for the WCJ to decide, not the physician. See 77 P.S, § 772 (providing that the WCJ may modify a NCP upon proof that a claimant's disability has increased).</p>
