He disregarded a duty established by an unbroken line of decisions on the subject extending from Ehrisman v. East Harrisburg City Pass. Railway Co., 150 Pa. 180, to Moser v.

He then drove on slowly and without looking again turned across the tracks, and was struck by a car which he could have seen if he had looked again before turning or when at the edge of the tracks. Held, that a nonsuit was properly entered.\nArgued May 14, 1906.\nAppeal, No. 304, Jan. T., 1904, by plaintiff, from order of C. P.
