There is no difference in meaning between the words used \u201c should she have any living \u201d and \u201c having issue at the time of her death \u201d which were held in Beckley v. Riegert, 212 Pa. 91, to carry only a life estate to the first devisee. The testator\u2019s intent in both cases is entirely clear to provide for a definite failure of issue at the date of the death of the life tenant, and the present case is even stronger than the other insomuch as the testator uses the word \u201c children \u201d which is prima facie and presumably a word of purchase.\nJudgment affirmed.",
