Chas. F. Jones.\u201d\nAnd the defendant also delivered to the plaintiff a certificate of interest in 400 shares of the Mexican Mining '& Smelting Company, as provided for in the said contract and note.\nOn or about February 27, 1905, the said plaintiff made a demand upon the said defendant for the payment to him of the amount due on the said note.\nNotwithstanding the said demand, the defendant declined to pay the amount due to the plaintiff as aforesaid, unless the plaintiff would surrender and deliver to him the 16,000 shares' of the common stock of the Red Mountain Railroad, Mining & Smelting Company, which, in accordance with the terms of the said contract, as the plaintiff is advised by counsel, belonged absolutely to the plaintiff.\nThe said note and the said preferred stock of the Red Mountain Railroad, Mining & Smelting Company, and the said certificate of interest in the Mexican Mining & Smelting Company, have been since the making of the said contract and are now under the control of the plaintiff, and he always has been, and is now, ready to surrender the same to the defendant upon receiving the amount due to- him as aforesaid.\nDefendant filed an affidavit of defense in which he averred as follows:\nThe sale of stock to plaintiff under the agreement of February 29, 1904, was of 8,000 shares of preferred stock of said company and 16,000 shares of common stock of said company, for the sum of $8,000. In consideration of the purchase, defendant guaranteed that if, at the end of a year, plaintiff was not satisfied with his purchase, defendant would repay him the $8,000 on the return to defendant of the stock. This guarantee was secured by the promissory note in suit. The 8,000 shares of preferred stock and 16,000 shares of common stock were delivered to plaintiff, and the $8,000 paid by him, immediately after the execution of said written agreement in February 29, 1904. The common stock was not specifically mentioned in said written agreement, but was included in the expression \u201c preferred stock,\u201d because at the time of the execution of the agreement said common stock was represented and agreed as being included in the sale of the preferred stock, and on the strength of that representation and agreement the written agreement simply mentioned the preferred stock.\nThe 16,000 shares of common stock were not given to plaintiff as a bonus or compensation for purchasing the 8,000 shares of preferred stock, but constituted a part of the purchase, and were so delivered.\nMay 14, 1906 :\nThe court discharged the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nJames Collins Jones, for appellant.\nJS. Cooper Shapley, for appellee."
