The plaintiff\u2019s statement is not printed as the rules require, and the omission is all the more material because it is claimed by the appellee that the case is argued here on entirely different ground from that urged in the court below.\nBut as it is practically admitted that the cause of action declared on was not proved, we need go no further. The learned judge was right in directing a verdict for the defendant.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Philadephia Rapid Transit Company.\nAppeals \u2014 Assignments of error \u2014 Failure to print statement \u2014 Paper-book.\nA failure to print the statement of claim in an appellant\u2019s paper-book is a violation of the rules of court.\nWhere on an appeal in an accident case it is practically admitted that the cause of action declared on was not proved, the appellate court will not consider other circumstances alleged as negligence.\nArgued March 28, 1906.\nAppeal, No. 156, Jan. T., 1905, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 5, Phila. Co., March T., 1904, No. 2,752, on verdict for defendant in case of Thomas Morris, by his next friend and mother Margaret T. Morris, v. The Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before Davis, J.\nThe statement of claim was not printed in the appellant\u2019s paper-book.\nFrom a portion of the statement printed in the appellee\u2019s paper-book, it appeared that the only negligence charged on the defendant company was a \u201c dangerously high rate of speed.\u201d There was no evidence to support this except the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony that \u201c the car was going pretty fast; shaking from one side to another.\u201d In the argument in the Supreme Court the negligence alleged was that the conductor was negligent in permitting a boy under fourteen years of age to ride on the front platform of a car.\nMay 14, 1906:\nYerdiet and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was the action of the court in giving binding instructions for defendant.\nJ. AT. Brinton, for appellant.\nThomas Learning, with him Charles Biddle, for appellee."
