Philadelphia Bourse, Appellant.\nContract \u2014 Architect\u2014Drawings\u2014Evidence.\nJn an action by an architect to recover his feas, where there is evidence from which it may be inferred that the parties treated the drawings furnished by the plaintiff as those stipulated for by the contract, the case is for the jury, and a verdict and judgment for plaintiff will be sustained.\nTrial \u2014 Charge\u2014Preponderance of evidence \u2014 Preponderance in the number of witnesses.\nWhere the court in its charge uses the expression \u201cpreponderance of evidence,\u201d in the sense of preponderance in the number of witnesses, and this is obvious from the context, so that the jury could not have been misled, a judgment on the verdict will not be reversed.\nArgued March 20, 1906.\nAppeal, No. 58, Jan. T., 1906, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Pliila. Co., March T., 1898, No. 1,101, on verdict for plaintiff in case of David Evans v. Philadelphia Bourse.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestbezat and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit by an architect for his compensation. Before Barratt, J.\nAt the trial there was evidence offered for plaintiff which tended to show that the parties treated the drawings furnished by the plaintiff as those stipulated for by the contract.\nThe court charged in part as follows:\n[Look at the probabilities; search for inconsistencies ; find the contradictions. The preponderance of the evidence may aid you, but it is not always the best guide. In this case you have the plaintiff\u2019s sworn testimony as to a large number of alleg\u2019ed facts. Against it you have the sworn testimony of some five or six witnesses, and inmutes and resolutions of the bourse made concurrently with the alleged happenings.\nWell, this may mean much, it may mean little, and you may conclude that it means nothing. It may or it may not be conclusive. Let us take an illustration, not of the conditions met with in this case, but the reliability of preponderance of evidence in some cases. Suppose that a small child should tell you that he saw a large wolf run away with an unusually small lamb. As against this ten adults testified that this was not the case at all, but that the real fact was that this very small lamb was actually running away with the large wolf. It would not take a jury very long to determine where the truth lies, notwithstanding ten against one. Of course, as I have told you, this is not intended to illustrate the condition of the evidence in this case as you have it before you, but simply to call your attention, to the error that a jury might fall into by deciding questions of fact upon preponderance of evidence alone. It is simply one of the elements properly to be taken into consideration in an effort to ascertain where the real truth lies.] [4]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $17,520. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned among others were (4) portion of charge as above, quoting it, and (34) refusal of binding instructions for defendant.\nMay 14, 1906:\nJohn F. Lewis, with him Francis S. Laws, for appellant.\nO. Berkeley Taylor, with him John Gf-. Johnson, for appellee."
