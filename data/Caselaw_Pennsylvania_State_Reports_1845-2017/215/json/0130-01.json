Hoover, but Albert is to have $1,200 loss than the others, the amount I charged against him for the House and Lot which I have given to him during his lifetime as before mentioned, their heirs or legal representatives.\u201d\nIt is argued by appellant that in this latter clause the testator has used words which bring the devise within the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, and that this construction must carry with it the language of the first devise to Albert with remainder to his children. But there is no occasion to do this. Testator\u2019s intent is clear and his language is not within any rule that requires his actual intent to be disregarded. Children is primarily a word of purchase, and is never to be construed otherwise except where the testator has clearly used it as a word of limitation. See Keim\u2019s Appeal, 125 Pa. 480, a much stronger case than the present. There is nothing in this will to indicate any such use. The words \u201c heirs and assigns\u201d and \u201c heirs or legal representatives\u201d in the clauses quoted do not refer at all to the grandson Albert but to his children to indicate that they were to take in -fee. Prior to our wills act unless such words were used the children would have taken only life estates, and the previous custom of conveyancing has in many cases been continued' ex abundanti cautela.\nJudgment affirmed.",
