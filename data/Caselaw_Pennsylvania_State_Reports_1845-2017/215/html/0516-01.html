    <p id="b551-10" data-blocks='[["BL_551.11",551,[192,1667,1179,759]]]'>Though the Act of May 29,1885, P.

On this manifestly correct theory the claim of the appellee for compensation for the injuries sustained was submitted to the jury. If a pipe as laid on a public highway becomes a dangerous obstruction to travel, it is the duty of the township authorities to abate the danger, or to take such action as will protect the public from it when using the highway kept open as an avenue for travel, which must always be safe.</p>

His complaint is of the negligence Of the township. If the gas company was negligent, its negligence is not a question involved in this proceeding.</p>
