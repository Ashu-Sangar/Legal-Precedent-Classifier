The remedy provided by section twelve of the Act of February 19, 1849, P. L. 79, is applicable only where a railroad company constructs its road on lands taken in the exercise of the right of eminent domain.</p>

The purpose of said conveyance was to furnish the Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and Boston Railroad Company with a site over which to extend its road by means of an embankment ten or twelve feet high, covering the entire strip, and the embankment was constructed accordingly by said company. In part consideration for their deed the company covenanted “ to erect and maintain a suitable road crossing as provided by law.” Stoneburner parted with his title to one Anthony in the year 1896, and the crossing stipulated for as aforesaid not having as yet been provided, and the defendant having succeeded to the franchise and liabilities of the Pennsylvania, Poughkeepsie and Boston Railroad Company, it was agreed between Anthony and the defendant that the crossing should take the form of an opening through the embankment, which was ac<a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>cordingly made and so continued until May 20,1902, the plaintiff having succeeded to Anthony’s title iii the meantime. On the date last mentioned, the defendant closed' the opening, which is the injury complained of. The prayer of the bill is for a mandatory injunction to restore the opening.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b176-4" data-blocks='[["BL_176.5",176,[239,604,1197,977]]]'>Substantially the only defense set up is want of jurisdiction in this court to grant the relief prayed for on the theory that section 12 of the Act of Feb. 19, 1849, P. L. 79, 2 Purd. 1796, prescribes a different remedy that is full, adequate, complete and consequently exclusive. I cannot accept this theory. As I read said section it applies only where a railroad company constructs its road on lands taken in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, and when that happens the duty to maintain a crossing is imposed by the statute creating the duty.- In the case at bar the' duty rests entirely in contract, which differs the case from Dimmiek v. D., L. &amp; <em>W. </em>R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/180/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="180 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="888394" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0468-01">180 Pa. 468</a>, so much relied on by defendant. Nor can I accept the theory that the injury suffered by. the plaintiff can be easily compensated by a common-law action, for- the injury is a continuing one requiring many actions. Moreover, the act causing the injury was done suddenly during the temporary absence of the plaintiff, who promptly protested against it as soon as discovered, elements that are persuasive in application for mandatory injunctions.</p>

It is further ordered that the defendant pay the costs.</p>
