It is true, the trust created by the will of John Sheets is an active one. This the Supreme Court decided when the will was before it for construction, but the trust is for administration and distribution and was vested in the executor by virtue of his office as executor, and the duties thereof on his death devolved upon one legally authorized to take his place in the management of the estate. The act of February 24, 1884, section 31, provides as follows: “Administrators de bonis non, with or without a will annexed, shall have power to demand and recover from their predecessors in the administration, or their legal representatives, all moneys, goods and assets remaining in their hands, due and belonging to the estate of the decedent,” etc.</p>

Barnitz, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%2025" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Watts 25">9 Watts, 25</a>'2. Prior to its enactment an administrator de bonis non, could not recover the assets in the hands of his predecessor who had died; then the creditors, legatees or distributees of the estate were under the necessity of resorting <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>to the personal representatives of the deceased executor or administrator to obtain satisfaction of their respective claims, but now they look to the successor who has all the powers of the original administrator and whose administration is a continuation of the original administration, under a separate responsibility, but by the same authority: Scott on the Intestate Law, 518-521. All assets belonging to the estate of the decedent, remaining in the hands of the first administrator, or to which he was entitled but had not administered, must pass into the hands of the successor in office.” And on page 620, he says: “ Aside from the personal estate which remains in specia, and was not administered by the first executor or administrator, and the uncollected debts owing to the estate, the administrator de bonis non may recover the assets remaining in the hands of his predecessor. He can bring suit immediately, but the defendant may have proceedings stayed until the account shall be adjusted, and then the judgment shall be for the balance.”</p>

Hosier, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%20188" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="62 Pa. 188">62 Pa. 188</a>, an active trust devolved upon the executor of Nathan Woods to invest $5,000, a legacy to the testator’s granddaughter, which was to be paid to her when she came of age, but if she died before without lawful issue, then over. The executor finally administered the estate and filed an account of his administration, which was referred to an auditor and confirmed. He died, having this $5,000 in his hands. The question arose whether his administrator or the administrator de bonis non cum testamento annexo of the estate of Nathan Woods was entitled to this fund. The case turned on the question whether this legacy was a part of the undistributed estate of the testator, or whether it was held by the executor as testamentary guardian of the granddaughter. The court decided that the legacy was part of the undistributed estate of Nathan Woods, and should go to his administrator with the will annexed. That the executor had fully administered and settled the estate and filed an account of his administration, was not considered as a defense to the claim of the administrator de bonis non to receive the fund; on the contrary, it was indispensably necessary, in order to authorize the court to render judgment for the balance in the executor’s hands. According to this case, Strebeigh, as administrator with the will annexed, was entitled to receive the invested se<a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>curities if they were still a portion of the estate of John Sheets, and as to this there can be but little question.</p>

After the arrival of the daughter at age, the executor sold the real estate and received the proceeds. No account of the trust was ever settled by the executors. John Schaeffer was appointed by the court of common pleas trustee of the fund, and petitioned the orphans’ court for an account. It was held by the court that the trust for the widow was annexed to the office of the executors, and on the death of both could only be exercised by the administrator de bonis non, that Schaeffer as trustee had <em>no </em>interest in the estate or right to demand an account or to receive the proceeds.</p>

The executors renounced, and letters of administration with the Avill annexed were granted by the register. The administrators thus appointed settled their account and were discharged by the orphans’ court, which appointed another administrator de bonis non with the will annexed. It was held that the trust was confided by the will to the executors, and upon their renunciation the duties of it devolved upon the administrators with the will annexed, and after their discharge upon the administrator de bonis non, and that the court of common pleas had no power to appoint a trustee <em>to </em>manage the trust fund created by the Avill. The court, on page 256, says : “ The defendant and Henry Shultz, then, by receiving the appointment of administrator cum testamento annexo, became invested with the right to take charge of and manage the fund claimed in this action, according to the direction of the will, until they were dismissed from the administratorship of the estate. After that, however, upon the appointment of the administrator de bonis non, and his giving <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>the requisite security, they ought to have paid the fund over to the administrator de bonis non, because it was still to be regarded as assets belonging to the estate of the testator, and liable for the payment of any debts which might be made to appear against it remaining unpaid. The duty of settling and paying such debts devolved upon the administrator de bonis non, and it would, therefore, seem to be proper that he should have the right of receiving the means necessary to enable Mm to do so.” This right of the administrator de bonis non to receive the property of the estate was thus decided, notwithstanding the fact that the testator died on January 39, 1811, and that the legatee did not make application for the appointment of a trustee until April 20, 1837. It is true in this case that the administrators cam testamento annexo were dismissed upon their own application, under the third section of the act of 1797, which provides that they, “ with leave of either of said courts, may be dismissed from the duties of their appointment and surrender the residue of the estate under their care to such person or persons as the said court may appoint.” But the residue of the estate which the administrators are required to surrender the court says not only refers to and includes the unadministered part of the estate in its most legal and technical sense, but all the assets-of the estate which remain in their hands.</p>

The court, on page 336, says : “ However, we are clearly of the opinion that the power in the will of James Hunt was vested in his executors virtute officii. It was to make distribution, and the fact that the portion of the daughters was to be set aside and held in trust for them, did not change the character of the power.
