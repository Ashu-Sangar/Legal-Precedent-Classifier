He paid therefor, of his own moneys, the sum of $23,698. The next day Mrs. Parry agreed, in writing, with Harris, that upon the receipt of the said annuity, she would indorse and deliver the same over to him, or his designated agent. The bond is now and has been continuously in his possession, and was never delivered to Mrs. Parry.</p>

The only consideration was, evidently, such desire. The moneys were his own and though, after his death, he could not control the payments, yet the agreement, which must be taken as part of the transaction, and which was effective only <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>during his life was legal and one which he could enforce. He had a right to reserve this power of control during, but not beyond his life, and during that period he could designate the purposes for which the said moneys were to be used. The first check, at least, received in accordance therewith, was delivered to the plaintiff under the terms of that agreement. In his testimony, the plaintiff says that he told Mrs. Parry that he intended giving her an annuity, instead of paying her the monthly sums as theretofore; that in case of his death, he would like to make this annuity, keeping it under his control, but so that it would be self-operating when he died. Mrs. Parry testifies that he said to her, “ I am thinking of buying you an annuity,” and that she replied', “ That is very kind, but what is the need of that? You will always have moneys to pay me what you are paying me now,” and that he replied, he would be better satisfied, to buy an annuity. Therefore he bought an annuity for her, and took from her an agreement that he should have its control during his lifetime.</p>
