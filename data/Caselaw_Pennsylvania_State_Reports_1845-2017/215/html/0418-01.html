The referee disallowed the claim, and exceptions were dismissed by the court below. The trust company has taken this appeal, claiming that the Tradesmen’s National Bank had nothing more than a secret lien in the way of a pledge or mortgage, and that its title could not prevail against the receiver.</p>

But as the claim of Moors &amp; Company is sufficient to absorb the entire fund, if the claim of the bank be excluded, it is not apparent how the trust company as receiver can participate in any event.</p>
    <p id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[121,740,1182,95]]]'>The findings of fact by the referee and his conclusions of law, as to the point in question, are as follows :</p>
    <p id="b453-5" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[122,843,1181,460]]]'>3. The four “ Turtle Receipts,” Nos. 2,792, 2,794, 2,795 and 2,796, given the bank by Keen-Sutterle Company, taken in connection with entries on books of Keen-Sutterle Company and the memorandum accompanying the collateral note, sufficiently described certain wool then in possession of Keen-Sutterle Company (being the 312 bales described in Invoice No. 3,392, covering shipment of wool per steamship Maryland from Suffert VonLaer &amp; Company, of London) to sustain an equitable lien thereon as against Keen-Sutterle Company.</p>
    <p id="b453-6" data-blocks='[["BL_453.6",453,[121,1312,1182,408]]]'>4. The Turtle Receipts were not warehouse receipts (Tradesmen’s Nat. Bank v. Jagode, <a href="/pa/186/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="186 Pa. 556" data-case-ids="989646" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0556-01">186 Pa. 556</a>) but taken in connection with promissory note given by Keen-Sutterle Company to the bank, the memorandum accompanying the same and the entries on the books of Keen-Sutterle Company, they sufficiently evidence an intent on the part of Keen-Sutterle Company to give the bank an equitable lien on the goods therein described as security for the payment of said note.</p>

    <p id="b453-8" data-blocks='[["BL_453.8",453,[121,1883,1182,561]]]'>We have found no reason to question the correctness of these findings. When the bank made the loan, it had title to the wool, as against Keen-Sutterle Company, and the right of possession. Under the authorities cited by the learned referee, we think the right of the bank was good as against general creditors, and against the assignee. The wool was turned over to Jagode &amp; Company prior to the time of the insolvency of the Keen-Sutterle Company, and was not in the physical possession of the latter when the receiver took charge. The referee cites from the opinion of this court in Wright v. Wigton, <a href="/pa/84/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="84 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1053549" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0163-01">84 Pa. 163</a>, as follows:</p>

We agree with his application of the law to the facts of this case as expressed in the following statement; “ While the goods were then in the possession of Jagode and Company, they were in their hands as factors or agents of the Keen-Sutterle Company, and it was entirely competent for the Keen-Sutterle Company to have agreed with the bank at that time that it should have a lien, subject to the factor’s lien of Jagode and Company, upon these goods as security for its debt, and as shown by the cases already cited such an agreement would be valid and enforceable as against the general creditors of Keen-Sutterle Company or the assignee for the benefit of such creditors.”</p>
