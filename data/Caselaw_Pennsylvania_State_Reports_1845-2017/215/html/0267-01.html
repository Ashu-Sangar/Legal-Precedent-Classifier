The most important question that arises is whether an equitable conversion is effected by the language of the will. Upon this depends the propriety of the allowance, as credits to the executor of payments made by him in connection with certain real estate in West Virginia believed both by testator and his son, one of the executors, to be owned by him. The auditing judge was of opinion that a conversion resulted from the provisions of the will and therefore the expenditures by the executor are proper charges against the estate. At the argument of the exceptions to this conclusion, the main subject of contention was that the expenditures were unnecessary and excessive, and consequently little attention was directed to the question of conversion. The court, not being furnished with a copy of the will, was led, from the references to it in the adjudication, to reach a conclusion contrary to that of the auditing judge; that an equitable conversion did not take place.; that the credits referred to should not be allowed and conse<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>quently the exceptions to their allowance were sustained. Subsequently, however, the attention of the court was called to the entire contents of the will. And upon motion of counsel for the executor of the dead executor, in an informal manner it is true, and as if an application for a reargument had been made, granted, the auditing judge was authorized to hear and determine the question, together with other subjects of exception de novo. The readjudication has accordingly been filed wherein the auditing judge adheres to his former opinion, and exceptions thereto are again before the court.</p>
