    <p class="summary" id="AA6" data-blocks='[["BL_298.6",298,[271,841,1195,821]]]'>Whether the codicil disposing of the estate which the will gave to the widow of the testator in the event of her dying intestate, creates a valid executory bequest of what may remain undisposed of at her death, or whether the attempted limitation is wholly void by reason of the prior absolute gifts, is a question not to be determined until the happening of the contingency, if it should happen, for which the codicil seeks to provide. We have not the necessary parties before us; and it is a well-settled principle of jurisprudence that such questions are not to be decided in advance: Langdale v. Briggs, 8 De G., M. &amp; G. 391; Fabian’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Phila.%20175" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 Phila. 175">18 Phila. 175</a>; Willard’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/65/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="65 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="430639" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0265-01">65 Pa. 265</a>; Hano’s Estate, 8 Pa. Dist. Rep. 353, and as we have not the advisory jurisdiction of the English Court of Chancery (Morton’s Estate, <a href="/pa/201/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="201 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="925681" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0269-01">201 Pa. 269</a>), it would be a useless waste of time if we should venture to express any opinion on the subject.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b298-7" data-blocks='[["BL_298.7",298,[269,1670,1191,458]]]'>We think it clear, however, that the widow cannot be called upon to enter security for the protection of such rights, if any, as may be conferred by the codicil. The will gave her the residuary estate, absolutely, coupled, it is true, with precatory words, but coupled also with an express declaration that she was not to be fettered in her disposition of the estate given. The codicil provides that if she should die before making a will different from one already made, “ then and in such case” certain additional legacies and bequests should be given.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b298-8" data-blocks='[["BL_298.8",298,[268,2136,1190,304]],["BL_299.2",299,[160,389,1186,619]]]'>It is a canon of interpretation that a clear gift by will or codicil will not be cut down by subsequent words or codicil except to the extent which, with equal clearness, is thus indicated: Whelen’s Estate, <a href="/pa/175/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="175 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="880511" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0023-01">175 Pa. 23</a>; and here it is conceded that the widow’s right to dispose of the estate, either while she lives or by will taking effect at her death, is not reduced by the cod<a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>icil. Upon what principle, then, can she bo required to enter security; and if she can be, how is the amount to be determined? Clearly, the entry of security, at all, would interfere with the free use of the property and with her power of alienation by deed, gift or will; and the decisions with regard to a life estate in articles quae ipso usu consumuntur are entirely applicable; see Randall v. Russell, 8 Merivale, 190; Westcott v. Cady, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Johns.%20Ch.%20884" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Johns. Ch. 884">5 Johns. Ch. Rep. 884</a>. Even if there had been a trust for life of the widow, with power to her to dispose of the estate by deed or will, she would, under the doctrine of Bard-ford v. Street, 16 Yesey, 135, have the right to demand possession; see also Forsythe v. Forsythe, <a href="/pa/108/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="108 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="539273" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0129-01">108 Pa. 129</a>.</p>
