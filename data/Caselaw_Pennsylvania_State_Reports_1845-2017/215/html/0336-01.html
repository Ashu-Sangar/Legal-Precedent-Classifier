And clause 1 of said section provides that “ Any city erecting or purchasing water or gas works under the provisions of this act, shall and they are hereby required to constitute a department to be called the water and gas department,” etc. But clearly that cannot apply to our case. Our waterworks were neither erected nor purchased under the provisions of that act. And the attempt made in 1881 to establish a water department was invalid because the city had not complied with the act, by purchasing or erecting either gas or waterworks. The attempt was irregular also because it purported to establish a water department only, when the act says the department shall be called “ the water and gas department.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[108,896,1191,1499]]]'>The acceptance of the Wallace act only operated to repeal such local laws as were inconsistent with it. In sec. 56 of said Act (P. L. 1874, page 230), it is provided that “ no such acceptance shall be construed to be a repeal or surrender of any rights, powers, privileges and franchises heretofore by law conferred on such city, not inconsistent with the provisions of this act.” See also City of Williamsport v. Brown, <a href="/pa/84/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="84 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1053576" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0438-01">84 Pa. 438</a>. The acts relating to cities of the third class do not change the title to any property. Hence, the legal title to the waterworks property must be where the act of 1867 placed it, in the commissioners of waterworks in the city of Erie. Municipal government is the creature of the legislature ; what the legislature gave it can take away. There are no private vested rights. The water commissioners as individuals have no greater rights in the waterworks than any other citizens. The title is in the board, not the men. While local or special acts of this nature cannot now be enacted, yet they may be repealed, and provisions relating to cities of our class may be made so as to transfer the title to the <em>city; </em>and also changing the mode of appointing the commissioners so as to provide for their election by the citizens or by the councils, or by appointment by the mayor. The whole matter rests with the legislature chosen by the people. It is of no advantage to the court to appoint the commissioners. In every instance the legislative intent has been clear not 'to include Erie’s waterworks under the general laws. For even the late Act of May 16, 1901, P. L. 224, in sec. 10 thereof, on page 233, water boards like this are exempted from its operation. The new constitution did not avoid existing commissions.</p>

In our opinion, the constitutional provision requiring an appropriation before the incurring of a liability by a municipal commission applies to cases where the commission is using the funds of the city, or where the contract of the commission binds the city. Here the commissioners are not using the money of the city, nor do their contracts bind the city. They are using their own money, and their contracts are valid as against the commissioners of waterworks in the city of Erie. And, as they have funds on hand sufficient to pay for the improvement now in process, no increase of debt is made against anyone, and the water board in Erie City is more than a municipal commission. It is a corporation.</p>
