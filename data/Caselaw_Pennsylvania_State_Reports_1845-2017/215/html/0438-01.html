No such error has been shown here.” After commenting upon the discreditable condition of the record the chief justice goes on to say: “ The confusion and uncertainty in regard to the date of notice and other matters may also well suggest to the court whether a rehearing of the case on the regularity of the whole proceeding in regard to the judgment may not be advisable. Such rehearing is for that court, not for us.”</p>

The present rule to open the judgment was, therefore, granted. Depositions have been taken and argument heard by the court in banc, and, with the concurrence of all the judges, the rule has been made absolute. No opinion was filed at the time, but, inasmuch as an appeal has been taken we deem it our duty to the Supreme Court to give our reasons for this action.</p>

It seems to be undisputed that the plaintiff filed a statement on April 21, 1903, which bore date April 23. He says this was a mistake, and that he put the date April 23 on the paper on the 21st because-he had just written that date on a promissory note. He <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>further states that on April 21, after filing his statement, he gave to the defendant’s counsel a written notice that he had done so, and that unless an affidavit of defense were filed within fifteen days he would ask for judgment; that upon this notice he had written the words “ service accepted ” (without any date) under which defendant’s counsel wrote his name; that he (plaintiff) afterwards wrote in the date April 28, 1903, above the signature of defendant’s counsel, which act, by the way, he terms an indiscretion and then, noticing that this was a mistake, changed it to April 21, 1903, at the same time placing the date, April 21, 1903, under his own signature to the notice; that he then took the paper to the prothonotary’s office and made and subscribed an affidavit that he had served the notice on April 21; that this affidavit was either made on May 6 (when it is marked as filed) and the jurat dated May 7 by his own mistake, or it was made and filed on May 7 and marked by a mistake of the prothonotary’s deputy as filed on the 6th.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b475-3" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[170,1327,1184,303]]]'>The defendant’s counsel denies on oath that the notice was served on him on the 21st of April, but says that he accepted service of it on the 23d, at which time a copy was handed to him by the plaintiff, on the back of which he (defendant’s counsel) indorsed the date of service, to-wit: April 23,1903, in pencil.</p>

Assuming the defendant’s version of the date of notice to be the true one, the affidavit was filed in time and the judgment prematurely taken. Assuming the plaintiff’s version to be true the defendant’s counsel moved promptly to have the default excused, and his client afforded an opportunity to establish its claim of a just defense to the action. In his affidavit he avers the existence of a meritorious defense, and explains the delay in filing it by saying that for upwards of fourteen days the defendant had three clerks engaged in compiling the items essential to a complete detailed affidavit of defense. Taking this explanation in connection with the belief of the counsel, as appears from his testimony, that he had fifteen <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>days from April 23 in which to file the affidavit (even though it were assumed that he was mistaken in that belief), we are of opinion that this judgment should be opened and his client given an opportunity to be heard on the merits of the case.</p>

Nor is the number and term of the case and names of the parties specified in what is termed “ si. fa. sur. mort. in case of Bank vs. Cook,” so that the same would be readily found by reference to the indices kept by the prothonotary, in an attempt to verify the claim for costs paid, nor is it stated when said costs were paid.
