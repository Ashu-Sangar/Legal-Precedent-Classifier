    <p id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.8",155,[145,835,1180,252]]]'>Appellant was elected a supervisor of the township of Nether Providence on February 21, 1905. On May 4,1905, a petition of citizens was filed in the quarter sessions and subsequently on rule to show cause, etc., the court declared the office vacant for failure to enter security as required by law.</p>
    <p id="b155-7" data-blocks='[["BL_155.9",155,[142,1094,1182,459]]]'>The Act of March 16, 1860, P. L. 174, provides in section 2 that “ any officer or officers failing to give the security required by the first section of this act within one month after his election, then his or their offices shall be declared vacant, and the court of quarter sessions shall appoint one or more who shall hold his or their office till the next election.” The learned judge below held this section to be mandatory without regard to the reasons for the failure of compliance. This construction raises the only question in the ease.</p>
    <p id="b155-8" data-blocks='[["BL_155.10",155,[140,1562,1181,458]]]'>Section 1 of the act provides that “ it shall be the duty of the township auditors and borough councils to require .... supervisors of the roads in each township and borough .... before entering upon their duties to give bond, with security, to be approved by the auditors or borough councils, in a sum not less than double the probable amount of the tax which may come into the hands of said officers,” with a proviso that each officer may give security individually, and have only a several liability for his own acts.</p>
    <p id="b155-9" data-blocks='[["BL_155.11",155,[138,2029,1182,412]],["BL_156.1",156,[290,374,1188,411]]]'>It was held in Stephens v. Potter, 4 Weekly Notes of Cases, 375, that the omission of a supervisor to give bond does not ipso facto oust him from office, at the end of thirty days. “ It required ” said this court, per curiam, “ judicial action to declare the office vacant. The duty is cast in the first instance upon the township authorities to require the bond to be given.” And this requirement it is to be further observed is not an immaterial formality, for the bond and security are <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>to be approved by the auditors or borough councils, in a sum not less than double the probable amount of the tax which may come into the hands of the said officers. Such “ probable amount ” is an estimate at best and the duty and power to make such estimate, at least in the first instance rest upon the town, ship authorities. Until they have fixed the sum the new officer cannot reasonably be charged with knowledge of the required amount of his bond.</p>

It appeared that no meeting of the township auditors had been held until more than thirty days after the election, but that at the first meeting the appellant had appeared and offered his security, but the auditors had refused to accept it on the ground that he was indebted to the township in a small sum, which, however, he disputed. This court said the conduct of the auditors was unwarranted, and reversed the judgment of ouster.</p>

L. 537, under which any person appointed or elected to any township office except constable and neglecting or refusing to serve should forfeit the sum of $20.00 — a reminder of the far away days when public office was regarded as a private burden, e. g., the minutes of the council of Philadelphia for October 3, 1704 record that “Alderman Griffith Jones is elected Mayor, of which he accepted, and moved that the ¿£20 fine laid upon him for refusing to accept of the Mayoralty the last year, may be remitted to him, and it is granted,” and on October 1,1706 “Alderman Story refusing to accept of the office of Mayor, therefore he is fined by this common council, the sum of twenty pounds.” 1 Watson’s Annals 58-59.</p>
