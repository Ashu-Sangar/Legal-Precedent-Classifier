    <p class="summary" id="b607-7" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[155,1098,1185,771]]]'>The defense is that the notes are without consideration, and is in substance that she, the defendant, is the widow of Charles H.

    <p class="summary" id="b607-8" data-blocks='[["BL_607.7",607,[153,1877,1184,463]]]'>The Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344, sec. 2, permits a married woman to make all contracts except that “ she may not become accommodation endorser, maker, guarantor or surety for another.” The defendant was an accommodation maker for her husband on the notes given in April, 1903, and consequently could not be held liable for their payment. There was, however, a moral obligation on her to pay them, as the City Saving Fund and Trust Company advanced the money to her husband because of the notes signed by her.</p>

The question, then, for our consideration is, would the original notes which imposed no legal liability on her, but which she was under a moral obligation to pay, be such a consideration as would make any contract she made, after the death of her husband, to pay them binding on her.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[300,662,1189,563]]]'>In making the original notes the defendant, although at that time a married woman, as we have said, assumed a moral obligation to pay them. A moral obligation is defined in Bailey v. Phila., <a href="/pa/167/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="167 Pa. 569" data-case-ids="866855" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0569-01">167 Pa. 569</a>, to be an obligation “ which cannot be enforced by action, but which is binding on the party who incurs it, in conscience, and according to natural justice.” And again, “ A duty which would be enforceable by law, were it not for some positive rule, which, with a view to general benefit, exempts the party in that particular instance from legal liability. ... In this state it is held that such a moral obligation will sustain an express promise to pay.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b608-6" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[297,1234,1187,1086]]]'>In Hemphill v.

In Kelly v. Eby, <a href="/pa/141/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="141 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="974895" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0176-01">141 Pa. 176</a>, a loan was made to a married woman, who, after the death of her husband, promised to pay it. Justice Mc-Cullom says: “ If the loan was made to the appellant as claimed, she was under no legal obligation to pay it; but the moral duty arising therefrom was a sufficient consideration to support an express promise made after coverture.” In Brooks v. Merchants’ National Bank, <a href="/pa/125/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="125 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="563990" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0394-01">125 Pa. 394</a>, a married woman who, as a member of a firm, signed notes which she was under no legal obligation to pay, was held to have rendered herself liable to pay renewals of the notes made after the death of her husband, the moral obligation to pay the original notes being a sufficient consideration for the renewals.' These authorities effectually settle the question of the sufficiency of the consideration for the notes here sued on and render the defendant liable for their payment.</p>

L. 194, settles this contention. It is as follows: “ The instrument is not invalid for the reason, only, that it is antedated or post-dated provided this is not done for an illegal or fraudulent purpose. The person to whom an instrument so dated is delivered acquires the title thereto as of the date of delivery.” The notes, therefore, speak from the date of delivery, which was after the defendant was discovert. At that time there was no limitation on her power to make any contract. If she choose to date the notes back to render herself liable to pay back interest, it did not make the notes invalid. We are of the opinion that the affidavit of defense does not contain a legal defense, and we, therefore, make absolute the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and enter judgment for the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of $22,857.25.</p>
