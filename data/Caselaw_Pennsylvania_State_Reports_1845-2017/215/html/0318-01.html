At the time of this transaction a written agreement between the parties was executed by which the defendant agreed to pay upon demand, and after the expiration of a certain period, the sum of $8,000 “upon the transfer of said preferred stock,” to defendant. It was also provided that to secure said payment defendant would give his promissory note, and that “the certificate of said preferred stock shall also be attached in the nature of collateral security to the said promissory note,” and that upon the payment of the note the said preferred stock shall be returned to defendant. The agreement made no mention of the common stock. The defendant in his affidavit of defense averred that the common stock belonged with the preferred stock, and that plaintiff was not entitled to recover unless he returned the common as well as the preferred stock. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit of defense was sufficient to prevent judgment.</p>
