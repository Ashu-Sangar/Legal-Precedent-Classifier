The conditions being about the same, was not their testimony worthy of consideration by the jury; was it not really worth more than that of a non expert, who knew the property intimately in 1889, and who knew the stream at that time and might be called upon to testify^ to the depreciation or non depreciation. It took no feat of the <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>imagination on the part of plaintiff’s witnesses to arrive at a conclusion, nor were they called upon to differentiate as to the two periods of time. As the court viewed it, it was simply asking for an opinion which the witnesses were capable of giving from knowledge obtained from experience and good judgment. The question of whether a witness in this class of cases is properly qualified, is often very perplexing, both to counsel and the court, and, in later years, it has largely become the practice to practically make every witness an expert, qualified by examination of the property, acquiring a knowledge of the market value of property, etc., in order that he may pass the ordeal and be permitted to give his opinion under oath. It does not always appear plain that there is any certain rule; each case must stand on its own bottom and be governed by the circumstances as they arise in its trial. It is the interpretation of this court, applied to this class of cases, that some knowledge qualifies, the extent of the same affecting the credibility and the weight of the testimony. A man experienced in water powers, making a careful examination of a stream for the purpose of arriving at its value for power purposes, does not simply consider it as he sees it before him, but he takes into consideration the country through which it flows, and how it is liable to be affected by droughts, whether it will get low or dry up in the summer, etc. With this knowledge derived from experience, applied to the case before him, why is he not competent to testify to a depreciation in 1889 as well as now? Is it any more difficult to estimate back to 1889 than to estimate into the future ? Besides, added to their own judgment was the testimony of experts as to the actual flow of the water about the time of the examination and which should be considered, the height of the stream in 1889, and upon which the calculation of the number of gallons of water taken daily could be arrived at and applied to the case.</p>

To the mind of the court the qualification of witnesses called by plaintiff, justified the permitting of their opinions to go to the jury as to the question of depreciation, leaving the matter after all, to the jury to judge of the same, taking into consideration the credibility and weight of their testimony.</p>

The evidence submitted showed the fact that the defendant borough in 1889 adopted a resolution, and erected an impounding reservoir, gave a contract for its erection, that the same was erected, pipes laid, water diverted and conducted to1 the borough. In addition it gave bonds to certain individuals for condemnation and appropriation of said stream, and at least one case was tried in court resulting in a verdict for the landowner.</p>

The defendant borough entered upon no property of the plaintiff and his silence for a number of years does not affect the time of the appropriation or taking, nor fix the date at which the inquiry should be directed in estimating the injury alleged. The date when the property was affected was when the appropriation was made, namely, in 1889. This position is well settled in Graham v. Pittsburg, etc., Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/145/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="145 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="825898" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0504-01">145 Pa. 504</a>, to wit: that in assessing damages for such appropriation they were to be computed as of the date of the filing of the bond, but the jury should compare its value as of the date of the lawful appropriation with the value at the same date as affected by the railroad.</p>
