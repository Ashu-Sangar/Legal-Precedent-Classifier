    <p class="summary" id="b687-6" data-blocks='[["BL_687.10",687,[197,864,1177,356]]]'>[Look at the probabilities; search for inconsistencies ; find the contradictions. The preponderance of the evidence may aid you, but it is not always the best guide. In this case you have the plaintiff’s sworn testimony as to a large number of alleg’ed facts. Against it you have the sworn testimony of some five or six witnesses, and inmutes and resolutions of the bourse made concurrently with the alleged happenings.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b687-7" data-blocks='[["BL_687.11",687,[194,1230,1180,927]]]'>Well, this may mean much, it may mean little, and you may conclude that it means nothing. It may or it may not be conclusive. Let us take an illustration, not of the conditions met with in this case, but the reliability of preponderance of evidence in some cases. Suppose that a small child should tell you that he saw a large wolf run away with an unusually small lamb. As against this ten adults testified that this was not the case at all, but that the real fact was that this very small lamb was actually running away with the large wolf. It would not take a jury very long to determine where the truth lies, notwithstanding ten against one. Of course, as I have told you, this is not intended to illustrate the condition of the evidence in this case as you have it before you, but simply to call your attention, to the error that a jury might fall into by deciding questions of fact upon preponderance of evidence alone. It is simply one of the elements properly to be taken into consideration in an effort to ascertain where the real truth lies.] [4]</p>
