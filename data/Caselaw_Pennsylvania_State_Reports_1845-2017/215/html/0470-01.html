It characterized him as a “sycophantic Justice,” and in unmistakable language accused him of being party to a conspiracy to humiliate, by sending to jail overnight, a person charged before him with misdemeanor. “Never in coercion days in Ireland,” the article said, “was there a more wicked conspiracy to deprive men of their right to their spoken opinion, and to railroad them to prison for daring to stand up in defense of those rights.

And as the principle of free speech, so dear to all Americans is involved, the matter must be fought out with these ignorant foreigners until they are taught that they are not now in barbarous Russia. The last and worst feature of the Dillionis episode was the prosecution, on Friday night, before a Justice named Mulderig, of the Rev. J. J. Fletcher, the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, of Pittston, an eminent Christian minister, on trumped up charges under the disorderly conduct Act of 1895.</p>

Mr. Fletcher’s offending is that he has stood up in defence of Dillionis and in behalf of that constitutional right of every American, free speech. It appears that on the night of February 3d, the reverend gentleman went to Booth’s Hall, Pittston, and on his arrival he found a fight on, the crowd having Dillionis in a side room. Mr. Fletcher endeavored to assist him, and remonstrated with the assailants. These very assailants are now the prosecutors of Mr. Fletcher and it was hoped by the assistance of one Mulderig, Justice of the Peace, at Inkerman, that they would humiliate him and compel him to spend a night in jail. The evidence of the prosecutors to the effect that he was flourishing a revolver was entirely disproved, but the sycophantic Justice immediately gave judgment.</p>

If it was malicious, it was libelous. It must be adjudged malicious, except it be s'hown to be true or justifiably made. Its truth was not asserted, and dare not be assumed. Though untrue, it might yet have been justifiably made. -If a privileged communication, it was justifiable, and the publisher of it may not be held legally answerable. It was a privileged communication if made upon proper occasion, through proper motives, upon reasonable cause, and made in the proper manner. Since the immunity of a privileged communication is an exception to the general rule that nothing short of proof of the truth is a defense to a libel, he who relies on the exception must prove all the faets necessary and bring himself within it: Conroy v. Pittsburg Times, <a href="/pa/139/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="139 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="11251605" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0334-01">139 Pa. 334</a>. A party defendant is relieved of this burden when the publication intrinsically supplies the required facts. But such is not the case here. Admittedly this was a privileged communication so far as regards the occasion of its publication. It was a criticism of the official conduct of a public officer, always a proper subject for public discussion and information. As was said in Neeb v. Hope, <a href="/pa/111/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="111 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="545487" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0145-01">111 Pa. 145</a>, and repeated in many other cases, the conduct of public officers is open to public criticism, and it is for the interest of society that their acts be freely published with fitting com<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>ments or strictures. But privileged occasion, without more, can justify only in exceptional cases, as where the publication itself or the circumstances connected therewith, negative the presumption of malice. If there is that in the publication which furnishes a basis for reasonable inference that malice was back of it, the burden remains with the party charged to establish either its truth or the probable ground for believing it true. When such is not the case there must be some evidence beyond the mere fact of publication; but there is no requirement as to what the form of evidence shall be. It may be intrinsic, from the style and tone of the article: Conroy v. Pittsburg Times, supra. “ If the communication contains expressions which exceed the limits of privilege, such expressions are evidence of malice and the case shall be given to the jury.” Neeb v. Hope, <a href="/pa/111/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="111 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="545487" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0145-01">supra.</a></p>

This man Mulderig has certainly mistaken his vocation, and has not yet realized-that he is living in the land of the free.” We are of one mind that the extreme severity of the criticism indulged in here, the epithets and language employed in connection with the charge preferred, the reference to appellant’s past record, all tend to overcome the prima facie presumption of protection under the privilege, and were sufficient in themselves to put upon the defendant the burden of justifying.
