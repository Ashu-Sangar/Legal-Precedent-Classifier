No matter in what form the guarantee of dividends may be made, they can be paid only out of the net profits. An agreement to pay even though there be no profits, would be void as against public policy. Since their payment then depends upon profits, it would be postponed during years of business depression which showed no net profits.

(190) sec. 529 d, the rule is thus stated: “If the contract with the preferred stockholders guaranteed or entitled them in general terms to a certain annual dividend, not making the dividend payable in each year dependent upon the profits of that year, the dividends are cumulative ; and if the profits in any year are not sufficient to pay the dividend, it must be paid, in addition to subsequent dividends, out of the profits of subsequent years, before any dividends can be paid to the holders of common stock.”</p>

The author says, “ If preferred stock is issued, with out any mention of whether or not the dividends are cumulative, then the law makes it cumulative. As soon as there are net profits available for dividends, the corporation must pay the preferred dividends and all arrears thereon before a dividend is declared on the common stock. This is a well-settled rule at common law in this country and in England, and is not only equitable, but is in accord with the understanding of the business community. The right of the preferred stockholders to arrears of dividend is not deemed waived by delay, nor in any way, except upon clear proof of intent to waive.”</p>

It seems to us that a reasonable construction of the contract requires us to hold that it means simply that whenever there are profits to divide the company is to see to it that the holder of preferred stock has received the stipulated amount of ten per cent per annum before making any award to the other stockholders. The case of Henry v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 1 DeG. &amp; J. 606 (638), is recognized as the leading authority on the subject under consideration, and Lord Cranworth there makes a suggestion which has much force, as a reason for the view he adopts. He says, “ If the directors are, as probably they will be, ordinary shareholders, they will have an interest so from time to time to set aside portions of their funds for the benefit of the company in the next half year as to prevent the preference shareholders from receiving a dividend in full, and they will thus create a larger fund for the division on the next occasion, the entire benefit of which, on the argument of the defendant, will accrue to the benefit of the ordinary shareholders. . . . When I see that on one construction of those acts the legislature will have given to the directors an interest in opposition to their duty, and that on the other construction they will not have done so, I am led strongly to believe that the latter is the sounder interpretation.”</p>

No such object was of course before the directors in refraining from the payment of annual dividends, but the possible result shows how such a power might be exercised to deprive the preferred stockholders of their contract rights, and a construction that would permit of such a result is to be avoided.

Are the preferred stockholders to be charged, as against the amount in arrears for the years from 1893 to 1901 with the amount paid in excess of ten per cent during the years 1860,1863 and 1866 ? The preference created by the statute gave to the holders of the preferred stock, the right to receive $5.00 per share per annum on each share of stock held by them, before the other stockholders were entitled to anything. That was the extent of the preference. If the funds applicable to a dividend amounted to just enough for that purpose the other stockholders took nothing. But when each class of stock had been paid ten per cent, they were equal, and equally entitled to partake of whatever remained in the fund applicable for dividend purposes. The preferred stockholders were not creditors, nor was the amount paid to them in excess of ten per cent in any one year to be charged to them as an advance payment upon any future dividends that might be earned or divided in coming years. There was no preference shown in the distribution of these extra dividends. All the shareholders fared alike in so far as they were concerned. The preference created under the act of assembly went only so far as to give to the preferred stockholders a right to claim the first proceeds out of the fund applicable to dividends, to the extent of $5.00 per share, per annum on their stock, and no farther. After that amount was paid the common stockholders were entitled to participate, and did so participate, taking during the years when the extra dividends were paid, the same amount per share, as the preferred stockholders. So that the extra payments during the years mentioned cannot be considered as overpayments to the holders of preferred stock. If the preferred stockholders had been limited, under the terms <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>of the contract, to ten per cent per annum in any one year, and all the balance of the fund had belonged exclusively to the common stockholders, then the contention that these extra dividends should be set off as against the arrears would be sound. But there is no such limitation in the act. The preferred stockholders stood upon the same plane as the others, with the additional advantage that they had the first right to partake in the distribution of profits up to the limit of 15.00 per share per annum, and if necessary, the whole amount of the profits might be taken for that purpose, even if thereby the other stockholders were excluded. We agree with the conclusion of the learned court below, that the holders of preferred stock are entitled to have the arrears paid to them by the defendant company, without any deduction on account of dividends paid at a time when there had been no deficit. In so far as the excess of such payments over the ten per cent per annum to the preferred stockholders was concerned, it was declared not as a matter of preference, but as an equal distribution to all stockholders.</p>
