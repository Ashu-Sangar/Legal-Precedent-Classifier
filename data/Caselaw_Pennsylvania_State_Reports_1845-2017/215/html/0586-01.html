The first is to the payment of $99.50 to “ A. E. Groff, board, etc., decedent’s wife.” This exception was not resisted, nor was the credit in any way explained by the accountants. The exceptants manifestly were mistaken, as there is no such credit. We find what was referred to by them, but which they incorrectly deciphered or misunderstood, to be, “Paid A. E. Groff boarding, etc., decedent and wife $99.50.” The accountants’ receipt shows that the payment was “ in full for boarding for Solomon O. Groff and wife.” The debt apparently was the testator’s, in which case, if his estate is solvent, the payment was not an improper one. If, on the other hand, the estate is insolvent, and such are the indications, only a pro rata dividend can be allowed on account of this claim. The accountants are surcharged $99.50, with the subrogated right to present the claim for payment.</p>

They were present and remained mute. The <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>widow’s appraisement could not be found. An unsuccessful search was made for it. The record shows that there was an “appraisement of $300 worth of goods and chattels claimed and set apart for the use of Susanna Groff, widow of said deceased.” That “ goods and chattels ” belonging to the estate to the value of $300 were appraised and set apart for the widow, seems probable from the fact that none were inventoried nor accounted for. This exception is sustained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[150,793,1180,1237]]]'>Among the testator’s investments was a loan of $3,500 to his son, Wayne I. Groff. This was secured by a judgment note, entered in the court of common pleas of Lancaster county, and which was a lien on certain real estate. This judgment was revived by the accountant himself against himself on December 11, 1903. It does not appear that it was paid before December 27, 1905, at which time a deposit of $5,089 was made to the credit of “Wayne I. Groff one of the Ex.” For about five years, until August 29, 1905, Wayne I. Groff, the active executor, deposited the money of the estate to his individual account and used it indiscriminately with his own. Authorities are unnecessary, though abundant, to support the obviously just demand that the accountants be surcharged with interest on this loan. The judgment was an interest-bearing investment made by the testator. Its payment alone could interrupt the running of interest, and even then if the money had been mixed with the accountants’ funds and used as their own, interest would be chargeable; nor would they have escaped the payment of interest had they deposited the principal to an executor’s account and permitted it to remain idle all these years. The first exceptions to both accounts are sustained, and the accountants are surcharged with legal interest on $3,500 from April 1, 1898, the time to which it had been paid, until December 27, 1905, amounting to $1,625.15.</p>

Scarcely had they assumed the responsibilities of the trust when they were- beset with suits. Each of the four disappointed and disinherited children of the testator opened up on them with the batteries of the courts. Their position was precarious. Either horn of the dilemma was charged with danger. A passive yielding to the demands of the claimants guaranteed no more protection against surcharges than an active resistance of them. If they had information sufficient to support a reasonable belief that the demands were unjust, such information as would have influenced a careful, prudent man to resist them, they ought not to be punished for attempting their defeat, if it was done in a proper way and at a fair cost. Unquestionably, the way for them to proceed was to employ counsel and be guided by them. This they did. No blame can be attached to them for the manner in which the cases were tried. For this their counsel were responsible. While the costs and charges seem extravagant, we, nevertheless, are at a loss to see how-the accountants could have escaped the majority of them. They were in the hands of their lawyer, whose fees, together with those of expert witnesses, whom they wanted and personally subpoenaed, alone added over §2,200 to the expenses, in addition to fees amounting to $250 in the first account. The accountants are less censurable by reason of having made these payments by installments than they would have been had they paid a bill for the aggregate amount at the conclusion of the services. Even if the amount had been the same, the condition would have been diffierent. If, after their labors had ceased,<a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>counsel had made an unwarrantable charge, accountants would have been justified in indulging in a sixth lawsuit rather than pay it, or they could have asked the court to pass on it at the audit. They then would have acted with their eyes open and with a remedy at hand. As it was, they were hampered. It will be seen that their first fee paid counsel in the second account was on December 7,1900, the next on October 16, 1901, the third on April 8, 1908, and the last one on January 12, 1906. During this time litigation was active. Rules and trials and appeals and arguments were happening. Demands for fees, no doubt, were made and fees were paid. True, at any stage, accountants could have refused payment, and counsel could have refused to serve. Even if accountants had been willing to assume the responsibility of a suit for a balance which might be claimed by counsel, they would, in addition, have been in danger of being held accountable for an adverse determination of these suits. To discharge counsel, who are supposed to have their cases well in hand, when they are about to engage in trials, or after trials, pending motions, rules and appeals, might be regarded as a more disastrous spoiling of an estate than to pay the fees demanded. These accountants appear to have been in a trap, and one which, under the circumstances, they could not have avoided.</p>

This contention is not without merit. It would have more force if the bequests to these two sons were not subject to the life estate in the widow. As executors they could not afford to neglect the trust even if they appeared to be guarding their own interests. Their personal interest, nevertheless, subjects their administration acts to more than the ordinary scrutiny. Their motives are more likely to be questioned and their judgment criticised than those of one free from personal interest. Nevertheless, if their conduct has not been injuriously selfish and has been free from fraud, they ought not to be made to suffer. From what we now know it probably would have been to the advantage of all had they offered no resistance to three of the claims, but if they had so done, they might not have es<a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>caped a surcharge. The cestui que trust, who now makes no complaint, might then have taken exception to the payment of notes tainted with the suspicion of fraud.</p>

They made these payments when they had a fighting chance to win all the cases. This strengthens the idea that they paid only what they believed proper, or that from which they could not escape. If .they had been successful, ultimately every dollar of these costs would have come out of their pockets. These credits we will not disturb.</p>

One of them as a witness was asked the value of specific services. He estimated those rendered in the Sprecher case, which involved about $100, to be worth $50.00. As to the other cases, he protested his inability to apportion them. We recognize a lawyer’s difficulty in attempting to fix a charge for specific professional work when it is a part of a series of services. It is less embarrassing when the services are distinguished by independent suits. A lawyer’s work cannot be measured as is a piece of calico or a cask of molasses. Usually, he makes a lump charge. ■ If the lump is not too large, nothing more is necessary. When its payment is resisted, it is incumbent upon him to make an attempt at an analysis and a particular valuation; do that, at least, which will throw the most light upon his work and its value. Disagreeable though this may be, at times it is unavoidable. The only evidence of this character which we have fixes the value of counsels’ services in the Sheaffer case at $200 to $250, in the Kirk Johnson case at $200 to $250, in the Maria Groff case at $300 to $400, and in the L. S. Groff case at $250 to $300.</p>

They had ample warning and every reason to expect the present contest. Even if they thought <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>the bill a fair one, out of an ordinary precaution they ought to have postponed its payment until it had been allowed by the court at the audit.

We would allow liberal compensation for accountants’ extra work excepting for the credit of $300 — widow’s exemption. This suggests bad faith and shatters confidence in accountants’ integrity of purpose. The widow’s exemption has been mislaid, concealed or lost. The record shows that goods and chattels of the value of $300 were appraised and set apart for their use; with a full knowledge of this and without having inventoried or charged themselves with anything except a judgment note, a mortgage and some money in bank, they deliberately take credit for $300 as having been paid to the widow on account of her exemption. It looks like a premeditated attempt to appropriate that amount of money. There does not seem to be a palliating circumstance. If goods and chattels were not set apart for the widow, if she elected to retain $300 out of “ bank notes, money, stocks, judgments or other indebtedness,” or out of real estate, why didn’t they say so ? They did not forget it, for it was rung into their ears with a persistency equaled only by the earnestness with which the exception Avas pressed, yet of this they did not speak nor did anyone speak for them. If any explanation was possible, the withholding of it is unpardonable. That part of the exception covering accountants’ compensation, $175, and the accountants’ claim for extraordinary labor, $500, is sustained, which with the previous surcharges will amount to $2,999.65, and make the balance in the account $8,775.27.</p>
