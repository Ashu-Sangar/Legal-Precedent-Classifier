One of the purposes of making the sale was to have the property improved, and before it was consummated, David Thomas, the husband of the plaintiff, and W. L. Adams, the purchaser’s husband, arranged with the Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Savings Fund &amp; Loan Association that it should lend Mrs. Adams $6,600, secured by mortgage on the premises, $6,000 of this sum to be paid out as the houses to be built thereon progressed. Mrs. Thomas and husband executed a deed to Mrs. Adams on April 15, 1902, and Mrs. Adams and her husband, a mortgage <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>to Mrs. Thomas to secure the balance of the purchase money, $8,000, which contained a clause providing that the mortgage given at the same time by Mrs. Adams to the Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Savings Fund &amp; Loan Association should be a prior lien. These papers were delivered at the same time, the mortgage to Mrs. Thomas being left with C. L. Stevenson, the attorney of the association, who did not file it for record until November 6, 1902. A contract was made b}r Mrs. Adams for the erection of three houses on this property, and the association advanced money on the Adams mortgage as the houses progressed; one of them was nearly completed when, owing to the failure to make sale of the-house and insufficiency of funds, the work stopped, and finally the Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Savings Fund &amp; Loan Association obtained judgment and issued execution, against Mrs. Adams for the collection of the mortgage debt, purchased the property, finished the buildings, and now holds the title thereto.</p>

The plaintiff conveyed to Mrs. Adams, property for $8,600, an inflated price, taking mortgage for $8,000, fully the market value of the laud. The vendee, who was merely a figurehead in the transaction and never paid a penny on account of the purchase money, then entered into a no-lien contract with an irresponsible contractor for the erection of three houses on the lots. The purpose seems to have been to improve them at the expense of credulous material-men and subcontractors, so that the plaintiff should not in any event be liable for their claims. It was necessary, however, to have some money to carry out the project, and plaintiff’s husband, who acted as her agent in the whole transaction, undertook to raise the money by negotiating a mortgage of Mrs. Adams on the property with the defendant. The lots were then subject to prior liens and defendant’s officers would surely have been very negligent had they not required that the lien of the purchase money mortgage given by Mrs. Adams to the plaintiff should be postponed to the lien of its mortgage. As a condition precedent to making the loan, they required that it should be so postponed; the plaintiff’s husband as her agent assented to this and it was so provided in the Adams mortgage; and whilst there is no direct evidence contradicting the plaintiff’s testimony that she did not know that this provision was incorporated in the mortgage, the probabilities are she did. The defendant then advanced its money on the mortgage, Mrs. Adams’s irresponsible contractor abandoned his contract before finishing any of the houses, she was unable to complete them and the defendant to protect itself was compelled to purchase the liens prior to its mortgage, bid in the property at a sheriff’s sale, finish the houses and settle with creditors, who had filed mechanics’ liens against the buildings, at fifty per cent of their claims. At the hearing of this cause it was contended by counsel for the plaintiff that as there had been a no-lien contract for the construction of the buildings, the mechanics’ lien creditors could <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>not collect their claims, and that therefore the payments made to them by the defendant were in fraud of plaintiff’s rights ; when in point of fact, if there was a fraud perpetrated, it was in not paying them in full. Although the mortgage to the defendant was given by Mrs. Adams, it was made and the money advanced for the plaintiff’s benefit; she was virtually the debtor; and as she did not pay the debt, and the defendant was compelled to purchase the property to protect itself, she has no legal or equitable claim to it.</p>
