The agreement in this case is in the contract between the parties, lessor and lessee, and is of a very indefinite and inconclusive character, providing that the arbitration proceeding covenanted in the twelfth paragraph of the indenture of lease may be had under the act of 1836 and be proceeded with in the coui’t of <em>common </em>pleas of Luzerne county.

It is a separate clause providing for a special tribunal to settle a special subject of dispute, a technical and professional tribunal for a technical, scientific question, to wit: how much minable coal still remains unmined in the land.</p>
