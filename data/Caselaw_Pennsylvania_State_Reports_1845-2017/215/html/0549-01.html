L. 368, and in the opinion which we filed on December 19, 1903, the said act was not considered, nor was it contended by the counsel that the claim in dispute was in any way controlled by said act. Therefore, our decision then made was upon the <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>question of sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of payment arising after the lapse of twenty-one years.</p>

On April 1, 1862, a deed for said tract of land was executed to Azariah DeHaven by his brothers and sisters, as heirs of James DeHaven, deceased, for the sum of $6,134.37, subject to the following charge, viz.: ‘ Subject and charged with the principal sum of $2,044.79 during the lifetime of Ann, the widow of said deceased, the interest of said principal sum to be paid annually on the first day of April to said widow, and after her death the said principal sum of $2,044.79 to be paid immediately to the heirs and legal representatives of said James DeHaven, deceased.’ The evidence shows that written on the above-mentioned deed are the accounts of the payment of interest on said sum for many years. The principal of this dower was never paid, and it was not contended by anybody seriously that Azariah DeHaven ever paid any part of it except the share of James, his brother, which was advanced to James, before his mother’s death, to enable him to buy a farm.</p>

Two of these properties were charged with dowers, and said dowers were referred to twice in the mortgage given for the $1,400, as follows : ‘ The first and second above-mentioned tracts are respectively subject to dowers, as by indentures may appear,’ and again, ‘ subject to the aforesaid dowers.’ Azariah’s deed and the said mortgage were recorded on the same day, to wit: July 11, 1894, and as soon as recorded sent back to him.</p>

L. 368, viz.: “ That in all cases where no payment, claim or demand shall have been made on account of, or for any ground rent, annuity or other charge, upon real estate for twenty-one years, or no declaration or acknowledgment of the existence thereof shall have been made within that period by the owner of the premises, subject to such ground rent, annuity or charge, a release or extinguishment thereof shall be presumed, and such ground rent, annuity or charge shall thereafter be irrecoverable.”</p>

The charge was created by the deed of April 1, 1862, and it would become due and payable immediately on the death of Ann DeHaven, which occurred on March 2, 1876. It appears that the heirs of Barbara Handwork did not present and demand their claim to her share of this charge till May <em>24, </em>1902, about twenty-six years after it became due by the very terms of the deed creating it. A careful examination of the evidence in regard to the payment of interest upon this so-called dower charge shows that the last payment of interest was made on March 26, 1875. This was about one year prior to the death of Ann DeHaven. The only other evidence of recognition of the existence of this charge which seems to us worthy of consideration, is contained in the mortgage executed and delivered by Azariah DeHaven, in July, 1904, to Cyrus G. Huyett. In that mortgage occurs the following: “ The first and second above-mentioned tracts are respectively subject to dowers, as by indenture may appear,” and again, “ subject to the aforesaid dowers.”</p>

We are still of the opinion that it is some evidence upon that question. But inasmuch as the mortgage was made to a stranger, so far as the Handworks are concerned, we cannot see how it furnishes sufficient evidence to relieve the claim from the effect of the act of 1855.</p>

This question was clearly ruled in the appeal of Stephen Wingett, <a href="/pa/122/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="122 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1948423" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0486-01">122 Pa. 486</a>, where, on page 494, Mr. Justice Williams says : “ Nor is it necessary to plead this act. It is a defense under the general issue, and may be set up before an auditor where no formal pleadings are provided for; and, unless the claimant makes the proof of formal demand, or part payment, or other explicit acknowledgment of the existence of the lien asserted, within the time fixed, the act extinguishes the claim. Proof of mere nonpayment is not enough. The nonpayment must be accounted for consistently with a <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>positive assertion of the demand on the one hand, or an explicit acknowledgment on the other.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b587-5" data-blocks='[["BL_587.4",587,[195,467,1183,1284]]]'>It is urged that the statute of limitations is not applicable in a dower case, the debt being of record, and DeHaven et ux. v. Bartholomew, <a href="/pa/57/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="57 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="1010430" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0126-01">57 Pa. 126</a>, is cited. That case was strictly dower, and it was not created by a voluntary deed like our case. Moreover, the plea was non assumpsit infra sex annos, and the question of the effect of the act of 1855 was not considered. It is also contended that the latter act does not relate to dower. That may be conceded, and yet it does not help the argument because in strictness this case was not dower, although so named by the parties. It was a charge upon the land, created by voluntary deed. The Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 356, and the Act of May 8, 1895, P. L. 44, are also cited. But these acts are not inconsistent with the act of 1855. The act of 1895, by its very terms, covers charges under deed, will, mortgage, dower, recognizance, judgment, decree or other obligation or instrument creating charges upon land and provides a method for the release and discharge of the same after twenty-one years from the maturity of the charge. This act seems to place charges upon land created to secure dower upon the same footing as other charges by deed, etc., and by its plain terms all such charges seem to be barred after the expiration of twenty-one years from the date when the same becomes due and payable, where no payment has heen or shall have been made within said period on account of such encumbrance or charge by the owner or owners of the land.</p>

And, therefore, it was the duty of the court below, and also of this court, to take notice of the acts of 1855 and 1895, which are general laws, even though the counsel did not cite said acts or refer to them either in his printed or oral argument. Notwithstanding this, we are of opinion that the exceptants did not lose their legal rights under these statutes because they were not specially pleaded.</p>

J.: “ Mere admissions made to a stranger, or implied from transactions with him, may possibly be corroborative, and admissible in evidence upon that ground, where there is proof of a distinct and unequivocal acknowledgment to the ground-rent owner ; but we cannot think that every such loose admission is, of itself, sufficient to make the question of extinguishment or release a question of fact for the jury, if all the other facts essential to bar action exist in the case. The declaration or acknowledgment which the legislature contemplated is one, which, if satisfactorily proved, conclusively, and as a matter of law, rebuts the presumption of extinguishment or release. If the recital in the deed of August 20, 1878, falls short of being such an acknowledgment or declaration, then, by the express stipulation of the case stated, judgment was properly entered for the defendant. It should be noticed that this clause of the deed added nothing whatever to, and took nothing from, the rights or remedies of the ground-rent owner. It was not a declaration or acknowledgment made to him or his agent, or which was intended to inure or did inure by operation of law to his benefit.”</p>

To apply a different doctrine to the present case would require the overruling of that case, and we discover no sufficient ground for doubting its soundness. We are, therefore, of opinion that there was error in not holding the so-called dower charge extinguished and released by the lapse of time. This conclusion requires the sustaining of the 4th and 14th exceptions and the decree of the court below is now reversed, and it is ordered that the fund in question be awarded to the parties lawfully entitled thereto, excluding the claim of the appellee under the so-called dower charge.
