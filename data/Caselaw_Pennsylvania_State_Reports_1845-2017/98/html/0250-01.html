That plaintiff had not become a bona fide holder of the note in suit until after its maturity, but that said D.

J., it appeared in evidence that Stoddard was the manager of defendant’s business. That the note in suit was given to Ploutz by defendants, and that on October 11th 1877, he had indorsed same over, to plaintiff, together with several other notes, as collateral security for an indebtedness already incurred by him to the plaintiff. Defendants offered to prove what the condition of the accounts between defendants and D. Eh Ploutz was on January 17th 1878, at the maturity of the note, also to prove that at that date and thereafter up to the time of trial, defendants had a perfect defense to said note in the hands of D. H. Houtz’; also to prove that at said date and continuously thereafter up to the time of trial, D. K.'Ploutz was indebted to defendants in a much greater amount than the note in suit. Objected to by plaintiff, as incompetent and irrelevant. Objection sustained. Evidence excluded. Exceptions. First, second and third assignments of error. The court charged, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>

And if this suit was brought by Houtz against <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>them, of course their defense would be perfectly good; but as it is brought by the bank, we think they cannot set up any defense they might have against Houtz, because the bank holds it apart from the knowledge of any such defense. While a defense of this kind might be set up where the note is held, as this one is, as collateral security, it would be the duty of the defense to show that the note was held as collateral security, <em>and second that the debt for which it was talcen as collateral was paid. </em>But we think in this case they have not made out such a case as would entitle them to this defense, and therefore, under all the evidence, we think the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict for the amount of the note and interest and protest fees.”</p>

This was error. The bank was not a holder for value. It had paid nothing for the note, and under all the authorities, the defendants could set up in this suit, any defense they would have been entitled to make, had the action been by Houtz, it was not necessary to prove the payment of the debt for which the note had been pledged.</p>
