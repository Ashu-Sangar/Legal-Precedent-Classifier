The defendant pleaded specially that the plaintiff had brought a former suit for the same cause of action in the Court of Common Pleas of Blair county, to October Term 1875, No. 191, wherein the plaintiff recovered a verdict and judgment for $1836.46; that the defendants sued out a writ of error to the Supreme Court, whereupon the said judgment was reversed and the said Supreme Court subsequently discharged a rule to show cause why a <em>venire facias de novo </em>should not be awarded (see Peuna.

What is the difference, where the court below submitted the case to the jury, and a verdict and judgment was had for the plaintiff, but the judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court without a new venire <em>1 </em>In England, it was always the practice under the statute 21 James I., to bring a new action in such cases; and our Act of March 27th 1713, § 2, Purd. Dig. 932, pi. 20, which is copied from that of 21 James I., expressly authorized a plaintiff in such case to commence a new suit within a year after the judgment of reversal. In order to expedite business, the Supreme Court adopted the practice of allowing a new venire, but it is always a matter of discretion. Sterrett <em>v. </em>Bull, 1 Binney 238, is the first precedent in this state for allowing a <em>venire facias de novo : </em>Mercer <em>v. </em>Watson, <a href="/watts/1/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Watts 330" data-case-ids="1838095" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0330-01">1 Watts 330</a>, 333-34.</p>

But this case was fully tried and reviewed on the merits, and this court decided that the plaintiff had no cause of action, because the damage was caused by the act of God (6 Norris 234). A.nd because the plaintiff had no cause of action, this court overruled his motion for a <em>venire de </em>novo, and that judgment was final: Mayer <em>v. </em>Walter, 14 P. F.

It was a judgment by this court, in case of a general verdict and judgment, on error by one who had recovered a previous verdict and judgment against the same party for the same land and on the same title ; yet the two judgments were held insufficient to bar another action of ejectment by the other party. In delivering the opinion of the court Mr. Justice Kennedy said, “A judgment merely reversing the judgment of the court below rendered on a general verdict, may be, and often is, for a cause that does not ultimately vary or change the final determination of the ease.....It may furnish some ground to presume, that the party against whom the writ of error was sued out, or the court, or both, if you please, thought that from the nature of the case that had been declared, a <em>veni/re facias de novo </em>would not be likely to be available to the defendant in error : but not to prevent absolutely his bringing a new action, in case he should <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>afterwards change his mind, or discover that he can supply what was wanting before, or in any way overcome the difficulty or objection then interposed to his recovery.”</p>
