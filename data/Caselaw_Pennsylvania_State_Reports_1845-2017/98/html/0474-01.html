A mortgage cannot, like a bill of exchange, be revivified after payment, by assignment to a bona fide holder. Bell had no right of recovery on the mortgage against Reineman, and could convey no better title to an assignee of the mortgage, who omitted to make inquiry of the mortgagor, where such inquiry would have developed the fact that the mortgage was paid. In such case,' the assignee of the mortgage takes it subject to all the equities of the mortgagor existing at the time of the assignment. Bell’s right, after the assignment of the mortgage to him, was an equitable interest in the mortgaged premises, and not in the mortgage. Hence, he stood in the position of one, who purchases land, subject to an existing mortgage, which lie assumes to pay as part of the purchase money. Such a purchaser cannot take an assignment of the mortgage and again assign it, so as to . give his assignee a right to recover against the mortgagor : Sellers <em>v. </em>Benner, 13 Norris 207.</p>

S. Bell, who was assignee of the mortgagee, without inquiry of the mortgagor, and without obtaining from him a certifícate that he had no defence to the mortgage. In thus taking the mortgage without inquiry the bank took the risk of a defence by the mortgagor. This principle has been so frequently ruled that it is needless to cite the cases. It is equally well settled, however, that the assignee of a mortgage takes it subject only to the equities between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, and not to equities between the mortgagor and a prior assignee of the mortgage: Blair <em>v. </em>Mathiott, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20262" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="10 Wright 262">10 Wright 262</a>; Downey <em>v. </em>Tharp, 13 P.

S. Bell and one John M. Tiernan, by which the said coal was to be held by Reineman for the joint benefit of the three, the agreement reciting that “ one-half is to be owned by Adam Reineman, and the other half by John M. Tiernan and A. S. Bell; but the deed for it is made to Adam Reinemanthat he, Reineman had paid the entire purchase money, one-half $4,500 in cash, and the other half by giving the mortgage in controversy; that Bell and Tiernan had covenanted to pay the mortgage as soon as it became due ; that Bell did pay the money to the mortgagee, but instead of having the mortgage satisfied of record, procured an assignment of it, and subsequently assigned it to the bank.</p>

Of course the mere covenant by which Bell and Tiernan bound themselves to -pay. the mortgage, standing alone, would not be sufficient. But we have the additional fact that Bell actually paid the mortgagee, and paid him with the money of the mortgagor; that is to say, with the unpaid purchase-money left by Reineman in the hands of Bell and Tiernan for that very purpose, and which they had jointly covenanted to so apply. It was, therefore, a payment by Reineman by the hands of Bell. The act of Bell in taking an assignment of the mortgage to himself was a fraud. His covenant bound him to pay the whole of the mortgage, and he had no equity which would justify him in keeping it alive to compel contribution from Tiernan, or for any other purpose.</p>
