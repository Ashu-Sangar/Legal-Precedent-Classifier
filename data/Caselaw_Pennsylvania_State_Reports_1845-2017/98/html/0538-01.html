B. W. Gill, an attorney-at-law in Pittsburgh, as their argentand attorney, for the purpose of investment, on the understanding that Gill was to pay interest on the money from the time he received it until he invested it. On September 17th 1S77, the plaintiffs sent the sum of $1,300 to Gill’s office, with a message that it was for investment. Mr. Gill was absent from the city, and the money was left with his son and business assistant, who gave the following receipt:—</p>

On the same day a writ of sequestration, issued from the Orphans’ Court, was served upon the bank, and the said balance standing to Gill’s credit, was paid to the sheriff, who afterwards, under an order of the Orphans’ Court, paid the same to Gill’s assignee in bankruptcy.

    <p id="b554-10" data-blocks='[["BL_554.14",554,[263,1236,1173,938]]]'>The defendant’s fifth point ought to have been affirmed. If, as was alleged, the money was placed in Gill’s hands for investment, with an understanding or agreement that until he could find a satisfactory mortgage he should pay interest thereon, the plaintiffs below cannot hold him as a trustee, nor follow his deposit in the bank as trust money. As the court below negatived the point, we must assume the jury would have found the facts as stated therein. The plaintiffs cannot treat Gill in the dual character of trustee and debtor. Undoubtedly the receipt by him of the money for investment^ ]vjtb.QUÍ ijnwe, 'vyould have made him^/tuugtee. The money would have been trust money, and if misapplied, could have been followed until it reached the hands of an innocent holder for value. But the agreement to pay interest necessarily implied the rightjo use the money. Interest is the price or consideration for Jfhte ruse of money. It-follows that Gill became the nmreMsSSjgy or debtor .of the plaintiffs, subject to the duty of investing Ri^-money iaa mortgage when a suitable opportunity should oe¿UB?v^nU|tlfe mean time he had the right to use it in any way liig convenience or necessities required. When deposited in the bank, it was the money of Gill, not of the plaintiffs, if the facts be as stated in the point.</p>
