A. subsequently instituted proceedings against the company to recover those damages,, assigning his claim at the same time to O.

      <em>“ </em>Are damages for taking property by a railroad company which arise by an act of appropriation under the state power of eminent domain, and which do not rest in contract express or implied, the subject of attachment on what is commonly called attachment execution? <em>We </em>are not aware that .this point has been decided. It must, therefoi’e, be solved in the light of the statutes and analogous cases. It is certainly determined that the process of attachment is evidently founded upon and operates upon what must be regarded as demands, although not, technically, debts: Girard Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Field, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20133" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Wright 133">9 Wright, 133</a>. Had Saylor a demand against the Sunbury and Lewistown Railroad Company when the attachment issued ? That company had entered upon his land, appropriated a ptortion to the .uses of its road, and they had giveu no bond. An entry under these circumstances is sometimes spoken of as a trespass and tort, as in McClinton <em>v. </em>Fort Wayne Road, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20404" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="16 Smith &amp; H. 404">16 Smith 404</a>. But the company is empowered to enter under the grant from the Commonwealth, first pjaying or securing the price, &amp;c., and the remedy of the owner is to have his damages assessed under the law. [When an entry is made, the owner has a demand for the injury which he sustained, and although this demand is not the result of a contract with the owner, yet it is a demand which the law gives him, because his property lias been taken, not against, but in accordance with law. Something has been taken from him by law, but it must be paid for. It is a legal right which he is authorized to enforce against the company; in <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>substance, is it anything but a debt ? So many acres of land are taken, and they are to be paid for, just as if under a bargain and sale, except the price is not fixed,] and in McClinton <em>v. </em>Railroad, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20409" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="16 Smith &amp; H. 409">16 Smith 409</a>, Judge Agnew takes this view when he says that whilst the compensation to the owner is often denominated damages, it is really the price of a purchased privilege. [Now, why should not such a claim and right be the subject of attachment ?]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[248,776,1167,1024]]]'>“It is contended, however, that the damages are unliquidated, and speculative, and that the machinery provided for their ascertainment is special and exceptional. True, they are unliquidated, but not speculative. There is no such thing as punitive damages; on the contrary, the standard of measurement is severely fixed by law. The viewers are to estimate and determine the quantity, quality and value of the land taken or occupied, or to be taken or occupied, allowing for the advantages or disadvantages which may or have resulted to the owner, and, having weighed all, determine whether- any, and if any, what amount of damages, has been sustained. In Garland '&amp; Bierne <em>v. </em>Cunningham, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20228" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Wright 228">1 Wright 228</a>, it is held that foreign attachment will lie for such damages resulting from the breach of a contract as may be reduced to certainty by a definite standard, but not where they are speculative, and it is said, on page 232, that that is all that is required, for <em>id ceri/wm est quod certum reddi potest. </em>[In the case of railroad damages the rule is fixed, the standard certain and known, and they are simpfiy compensation for the injury sustained. There are no contingencies upon which the claim rests, it is a clear recognized right, to be liquidated by a view, which is to be conducted under the direction of positive statutory provisions, and the market value of the land taken is to be given. Eor these reasons we think this demand could be attached.”]</p>

Railroad Co. Neither debt, assumpsit, nor covenant would lie to recover in this case ; at most there was only a liability to account according to the special mode prescribed by law, or to surrender the possession of the land occupied, as Saylor might elect, which is a very different thing from a liability for the payment of money: Caldwell <em>v. </em>Klotz, &amp;c., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.N.C.%20164" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 W.N.C. 164">1 W.

Then certainly the attachment would take nothing; the attaching creditor could not have applied for the appointment of viewers to assess Saylor’s damages. The owner of the land only can do that.</p>
    <p id="b171-6" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[177,940,1175,1153]]]'>The court below admits the claim to be unliquidated, but not speculative. We cannot agree to this. In addition to the compensation allowed for the value of the land taken, the jury are to take into consideration and make just allowance for injuries done to the land not taken; the cutting off the communications of the farm, of the barn-yard and barn; the increased difficulties of access and inconvenience caused by the cuts through the land; the shape and position of the fields; the cutting off of wTater; the inconvenience of crossing the railroad. In assessing damages the whole tract must be considered, not merely the land taken. Dangers and delays, and depreciation from crossings are items of damage; disadvantages to the rest of the property from the manner in which it may be cut, allowing for advantages from the road ; how much the burden of fencing the railroad detracts from the value of the land. While the damages to be recovered may not be exactly speculative, yet the various elements entering into consideration in assessing damages renders the amount recoverable very uncertain. In the very nature of the case, the standard for liquidation must be variable — the amount to be recovered cannot be determined by any fixed rule. What one jury would think a reasonable and fair compensation, under the same facts and evidence another jury might regard as exorbitant. It requires the instituting of* proceedings by Saylor and the judgment of viewers as to whether or not the railroad company was liable to pay him anything. If the advantages were greater than the disadvantages, the viewers would award less damages than if the reverse were true.</p>

There was no contract relation between Saylor and the railroad company ; on the contrary, the claim is for unliquidated damages for a tortious act. Such a claim has never been held to come within the attachment laws. It was said by Thompson, J., in Girard Fire Ins.

The reason for the exception has sufficient ground to operate on in the exclusion from it of such claims as are contingent, and such as possess no fixed standard for liquidation like torts or damages for breach of contract. . . . They want tangibility, and are not .attachable, nor would they be the foundation for the process.” Even when the claim arises from a breach of contract it cannot be attached unless the damages can be reduced to certainty by a definite standard ; nor where they are speculative or incapable of being ascertained by a fixed standard : Carland <em>v. </em>Cunningham, 1 Wr. 228.</p>
