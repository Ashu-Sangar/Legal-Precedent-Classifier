The foundation of the action is the acceptance of the devise and the implied promise which arises thereupon. It is therefore an action of debt grounded’on a contract, without specialty. But the contract is an implied one, and it is said that the statute of limitations is not a bar to an action of debt on an implied contract; even though if the action were assumpsit for the same cause, the statute would be pleadable: Richards <em>v. </em>Bickley, 13 S. &amp; R. 399, is relied on, and the remarks of Mr. Justice Duncan give color to this contention, and it is thought it receives some support Railway Go. <em>v. </em>Moore, 14 P.

And where the executor may be held at law, that is in some courts held sufficient to bar a claim for a legacy after six years: Smith <em>v. </em>Remington, <a href="/barb/42/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="42 Barb. 75" data-case-ids="5116690" data-case-paths="/barb/42/0075-01">42 Barb. 75</a>; Kane <em>v. </em>Bloodgood, <a href="/johns-ch/7/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="7 Johns.

Now all this shows that the statute would apply to a legacy, were it not set up by a trustee. In Thompson <em>v. </em>McGaw, four reasons are given why the plea of the statute to an action for a legacy cannot be interposed. 1st. Because debt for legacy is not grounded on any lending or contract; which, as applied to our case of a devisee, is not tenable, as we' have seen. 2d. Because an executor is a trustee, which is a valid reason — but the defendant is not an executor. 3d. Because the legatee may be <em>ignorantofthe </em>bequest, or <em>absent </em>in other states. But here the legatees knew of the will and lived in the same town, and with reasonable diligence might have known of the contents of the will. Besides, mere want of knowledge that one has money due another and that the statute is running, in the absence of concealment and fraud, is not enough: Downey <em>v. </em>Garard, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20H.%2052" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="12 H. 52">12 H. 52</a>; Campbell <em>v. </em>Boggs, 12 Wr. 524; Rhine <em>v. </em>Evans, 16 P. F. S. 192; Barton <em>v. </em>Dickens, 12 Wr. 523. I think the fact'that the legatee was ignorant of his legacy, if it may be an answer to the plea of the statute in a-<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>given case, ought not to prevent the setting np of the statute in every case. The fourth reason is that, if acquainted with the fact of the bequest, he is not bound to <em>demand </em>his legacy within the statutory period, and this reason is much insisted on in Patterson <em>v. </em>Nichol. But in the. case of a devisee who lias become liable to pay a legacy by acceptance of a devise, a demand is not necessary before suit: Zacharias <em>v. </em>Zacharias, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20H.%20455" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="11 H. 455">11 H. 455</a>. And when a demand is necessary the plaintiff must make it in season, and cannot take advantage of his own fault: Campbell <em>v. </em>Boggs, 12 Wr. 526.)</p>

H. of L. Cases, 656. And I think would have held a wife also barred, who sued for her separate estate, because she could sue at any time, and without her husband, or at least without his consent. Not being under any disability to sue in equity, why should the court give effect to the exception in the statute in her favor founded only on such disability <em>f</em>

    <p class="summary" id="b442-7" data-blocks='[["BL_442.7",442,[251,1207,1169,1095]]]'>‘‘ In 1713 we adopted the statute. We had no court of equity. The husband and wife joined in an action at law for the sepal’ate property of tlie wife, but the principles of equity governed. The recovery was for the use of the wife, nor can it be doubted that he would not have been allowed to conti’ol the action or dissent from the bringing of it. The court would have protected the wife’s right as fully as a court of equity. While, then, the action of debt, for example, by the wife for her separate property fell within the Act of 1713, within its terms and the mischief it was intended to remedy, her case was not in fact within the mischief intended to be guarded against by the exception to the act — for she was not in fact as to her separate property under any disability to sue. The statute of limitations is a statute of peace and repose — and a defendant ought not to be deprived of the benefit of it, by the mere technical need of joining a husband with his wife in an action at law. Aside from that technical legal requirement, the case, in Maine shows that Mrs. Snyder is not within the exception to the statute, and that the lapse of twenty-five years is a bar to her recovery. If that case is good law it is the disability to sue that the exception meant to cover in the case of a married woman, not her general disability from coverture — for in that state she is of course under her general disability. At the time the statute was passed, confined as it was to actions <em>at lam, </em>where separate estates were not recognizable, the disability to site and of coverture were the same.</p>

The, right of action upon which the suit, was founded was an alleged liability of the defendant to pay to his sisters, the plaintiffs, a sum of money which he was directed by his father’s will to pay to them in consideration of a tract of land devised by the will to him. The language of the will as to the payment of the money, is, <em>“for which </em>devise, I will and direct that Henry shall pay in equal proportions to my two married daughters, Susannah Etter and Eliza Snyder (for their own separate and exclusive use), at the rate of twenty dollars per acre, the same to be paid in four equal annual installments, the first of which is to become due and payable at the expiration of five years after my decease.” The testator died in December 1847, and the action was not brought until 1880. The only question brought here is, as to the effect of the plea of the statute of limitations, which was sustained by the court below, as to both the plaintiffs. Mrs. Etter became <em>discovert </em>in February 1871 by the death of her husband. Mrs. Snyder is still <em>covert </em>and her husband has joined in the suit. The case was argued and decided in the court below, upon the concession, that this is not the case of a legacy charged on land, and that an action of debt was therefore the proper remedy. As the payment of the money to the sisters was apparently, under the , peculiar phraseology of the will, in part at least, the <em>considerar tion </em>of the devise to the defendant, we are not prepared to assent to the correctness of the concession. But that question is not before us, and therefore we forbear either its decision or its discussion. On the. general question of the application of the statute of limitations to the liability of the defendant, we concur with the learned court below in holding that the obligation of the defendant is subject to the operation of the act. By accepting the devise he agreed to pay the sum given to his sis<a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>ters, according to the terms of the will. That .agreement is an implied contract without specialty, and is therefore within the letter of the Act of 1713. All the cases hold that when the devisee accepts • the land in such circumstances, he thereby agrees to pay the money which he is by the will directed to pay. j lie becomes subject to a personal liability to pay, and that too, whether the money is charged on the iand or not. Thus in Brandt’s Appeal, 8 Watts, on p. 202, we said : “ If the sons accepted the lands devised,'they became personally liable to pay the legacies, at the times, and in the payments, directed by the will: if not paid, the legatees could sue and recover them by levy and sale of any goods or lands of the devisees.” In Lobach’s Case, <a href="/watts/6/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="6 Watts 167" data-case-ids="1846069" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0167-01">6 Watts, 167</a>, we held that the acceptance of a devise of land charged with the payment of a legacy, creates a personal liability for its payment on the part of the devisee. On p. 170, Kennedy, J., speaking of the effect of the a¿ceptance of the land by the devisees, said: “ This, perhaps, without more, ought to be considered sufficient evidence, in ordinary cases, to establish an agreement on the part of the devisees to take the lands devised to them upon the terms and conditions set forth in the will; and likewise of an engagement on their part to fulfill and perform them, whatever they may be.” See also Miltenberger <em>v. </em>Schlegel, 7 Barr on p. 243, and the cases there cited. Now an engagement, undertaking, or agreement to pay, is essentially a contract to pay. Such certainly is its status in legal contemplation. The law recognizes and enforces the obligation, and it can only do so upou the footing of a contract. The terms of sncli contracts as the present are found in the will, and the obligation to comply with those terms is implied from the acceptance of the devise. We do not consider it is any reply to the plea of the statute, to sa.y that this is an action for a legacy, and in such cases the statute is not a bar. That is true in the ordinary actions for legacies against executors, and the reason is that the liability of an executor to pay a legacy is not grounded upon any lending or contract. He is a trustee wdio is charged by the will with the performance of the duty of paying legacies, and against that form of obligation the statute of limitations is no bar. The case of Thompson <em>v. </em>McGaw, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20163" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="2 Watts 163">2 Watts, 163</a>, cited for the plaintiffs, is decided upon that very ground. We are therefore of opinion that the plea of the statute is a good bar to the cause of action set up in the present case. As Mrs. Etter was <em>sui juris ■ </em>more than six years before suit brought the defence was good as to her.</p>
    <p id="b445-6" data-blocks='[["BL_445.6",445,[159,2271,1167,134]],["BL_446.1",446,[318,445,1171,885]]]'>But the case of Mrs. Snyder stands upon a different footing. She was a married woman at all times since her legacy became due, and she is still married. The learned judge of the court <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>below thought that she could not take advantage of the exception in favor of married women in the Act of 1713, and that the plea of the statute was a good bar to her claim also. His reasoning is certainly very forcible if the proposition were as to how the law <em>ought </em>to be in such cases. But we must confront the positive terms of a statute directly and literally applicable to the case, and here we consider there is no alternative. The language of the third section of the Act of 1713 is most explicit, and it provides in express terms that several classes of persons under disabilities are not barred by the statute until six years after they have recovered their ability. These persons are, those who are “ within the age of twenty-years, feme covert, non compos mentis, imprisoned or beyond the sea.” The privilege of freedom from the liability to the statute is common to them all. No one of the classes is more or less entitled to the exemption of the third section than any other. This statutory exemption has never been repealed expressly or bjr implication. It is the law of the Commonwealth at this day, and we must respect it. The plaintiff, Mrs. Snyder, comes directly within its terms and is entitled to its benefits. As to her, therefore, the plea of the Statute of Limitations is no bar and it is overruled.</p>
