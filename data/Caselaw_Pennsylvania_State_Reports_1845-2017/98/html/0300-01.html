In consequence of these representations and solicitations Morgenrath and John did not bid, and Betz having bid a small sum, refrained from running the property up higher. Maurer acted in a similar manner, being partly Írompted, one witness testified, by a promise on John B. &gt;outy’s part to pay the amount of a debt due him by Richard B. Douty if he would cease bidding. Scott &amp; Sons, who were mortgage creditors of Richard 'B.

Douty, the lessee, was dead, and his interest had passed by assignment or sheriff’s sale, in a suit by his assignee, Helfen<a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>stein, the lessor, could not be a witness under the act, for the case would then be ruled by the case of Karns <em>v. </em>Tanner (16 P. F. Smith, 297). Joseph Maurer, I think, cannot be said to be the assignor of- the thing or contract in action. He was not a party to the lease. His estate has an interest.in the thing, but the assignor of the thing or contract in action and also the assignee or lessee are both living. If the defendants and Joseph K. Maurer both claimed under Richard B. Douty, and he, the said Douty, was dead, perhaps the case would be something like Diehl <em>v. </em>Emig (15 P. F. Smith, 320). There the alleged assignor of the thing or contract was dead. The plaintiff, who was offered as a witness to prove the deed or contract, was contesting the title of the executors of such alleged assignor. But it is argued that, although, as the record now stands, the suit is between these defendants who .are living and the administrators of Joseph Maurer, deceased, it is not a case that properly comes within the proviso to the 1st section of the Act of 15th April 1869, because the administrators could have, brought an action of ejectment in their own names, that they were mere trustees, and if they had brought suit in their names as administrators, the word administrators would have been mere surplus-age, and that by bringing suit as administrators they could not deprive the opposite party of their right to give evidence. All the late cases decided by the Supreme Court of this state treat actions brought in the lifetime of both parties, but where one dies and his executors or administrators are afterwards substituted as parties, as actions by or against executors, administrators, etc. I was at first inclined to adopt the views of counsel of defendants, but an examination of the authorities satisfies me that the suit could have been brought by the administrators as such. All interests arising out of land as are denominated chattels real, go to the executor or administrator, and not to the heir. This includes all estates for years, however long the period of their duration (3 Redfield on Law of Wills, 142). Where the testator holds a term for years it will rest in the executor and he is obliged to accept of the same (143). The personal representatives of a termor may maintain ejectment where the testator had a lease for years, or from year to year, whether the ouster was before or after his death. See cases cited (1 Williams on Executors 706). According to those authorities, I think the action could have been brought in the names of the present plaintiffs. The 3d section of the Act of 13th April 1807 (Purdon 534, pi. 12), provides that “No writ of ejectment shall abate by reason of the death of any plaintiff or defendant, but the person or persons next in interest may be substituted in the place of the plaintiff or defendant who shall <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>have died, pending the writ.” This action having been brought to recover possession of an interest arising out of land, denominated a chattel real, which, upon the death of the lessee or termor, went to his executor or administrator. That being so, these administrators were the persons next in interest. They were properly substituted in the place of the plaintiff. If they could not have been so substituted as to the persons next in interest it would in my opinion be hard to tell who would be the proper persons to substitute. If I am <em>correct </em>in this, then this is now an action by administrators, and the parties to the action who are living are incompetent to testify to anything that took place before the death of the other party. This is what is offered to be&gt; pi'oved. Both parties admit that the offer is to prove what took place before the death of either John B. Donty or Joseph K. Maurer. On the subject of those administratore’ right to maintain the action in their representative chai’actei*, I would further state the rale as it is stated by Chief Justice Gibson in Kline <em>n. </em>Guthart (2 Penrose and Watts 491), that when the action is on a contract with the decedent or for a toi’t to the goods before they have actually come to the executors’ possession it can be maintained by him only on the decedent’s title, and consequently only in a representative character, but when it is on a contract since decedent’s death or for a tort to the goods in the executors’ possession or for converting or detaining them having escaped from liis possession, etc., it can be maintained by him only in his own right, and naming him as executor will not change its nature. The text-books and many other cases maintain this doctrine. In the present case the executors or adxninistx’atoi’s were never in possession of the leasehold pi-emises. The light of possession, if any there was, was in their intestate in his lifetime. He had brought this suit to recover the possession. He died, and his administrators have been substituted in his place as the pei’sons next in interest. I think it is generally understood that to recover assets of the testator, when the executor never had possession, the suit is to be brought in his representative character. There, the intestate’s right, if any he had, to the lease or term of yeai-s, beloxigs to these plaintiffs, as administrators. They never had possession, and may not be able to dispose of it, unless they can recover possession. The cause of action is not one, in my opinion, that sprung up or was ci'eated since the decedent’s death. For a bond or a horse that had been taken out of the decedent’s possession in his lifetime, and which had never been in possession of the executor or administrator, the suit would probably be brought in their names in their representative character, and if this is so, why can not an action be bx’ought in the same manner to <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>recover chattels real or term of years, the possession of which had never been in the executors or administrators.</p>

In the latter case alone would the provisions of the act of 1869 forbidding a party to testify when the assignor of a chose in action is dead apply. Nor should the witness have been rejected because Maurer’s administrators were parties to the record. The statement of their representative capacity was mere surplusage. Nor was the death of John B. Douty or the joinder of his executors sufficient ground to exclude the witness. The defendants having formed a partnership the title to the leasehold of the colliery devolved on the survivors. The joinder of the executors of J ohu B. Douty- was therefore improper.

The issue trying was whether the title of the defendants below, acquired by means of a sheriff’s sale, was fraudulent and void as to the defendant in the execution, and his creditors, by reason of certain 'acts and declarations of the defendants, at the time of the sale. The property in dispute, and for which this ejectment was brought in the court below, was a leasehold known as the “Benjamin Franklin Colliery,” situated in Northumberland county. The offer was to show, by the record of a judgment in Schuylkill county, what the defendants’ real and personal property in that county sold for, and what took place at the sale. We are unable to see how the title to the leasehold in Northumberland county can be affected by what occurred at a subsequent sale of the defendant’s property in Schuylkill county. If the sheriff’s sale in Northumberland was conducted according to law, and the defendants resorted to no trick or device .to depreciate the property and prevent competition, they-acquired a good title, and it cannot be affected by what took place subsequently in Schuylkill.</p>

The court below rejected-the defendant, Thomas Baumgardner, as a witness, for the reason <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>that he was incompetent under the act of 1869. He was not rejected upon the ground that the assignor of the thing or contract in action was dead, but because the action was by administrators. At the time the witness was offered, the case stood thus: Charles P. Helfenstein leased the premises in dispute to Richard B. Douty. The interest of Douty was first sold by the sheriff to the defendants, one of whom was the witness offered. The interest of Douty was sold by the sheriff a second time, and purchased by Joseph K. Maurer, who brought this ejectment. Afterwards Maurer died, and his administrators were substituted as plaintiffs. John B. Douty, one of the defendants, died a few days after the service of the writ upon him. More than five years after his death, the plaintiffs’ counsel issued a scire facias to bring his executors upon the record as defendants. The executors paid no attention to the writ, never appeared, were never ruled to plead, and no judgment by default was entered against them.</p>
    <p id="b326-6" data-blocks='[["BL_326.6",326,[281,1169,1171,631]]]'>The learned judge was clearly right in holding the witness was not incompetent, because the assignor of the thing or contract in action was dead, and it is unnecessary to add anything to what he has said upon this head. The other branch of the case is not so clear. It may be assumed, however, that the placing of the executors of John B. Douty, upon the record as defendants, does not affect the competency of the witness. The executors were unnecessary parties, and had no business upon the record. When John B. Douty died, his interest in the lease passed to his surviving partner. The executors had nothing to do with it except to see that the surviving partner accounted for its value. The plaintiffs could not, by having improper parties placed upon the record, deprive the defendants of the right to be examined as witnesses,-if otherwise entitled thereto.</p>

The cases show it is not material whether they are there as original or substituted plaintiffs, provided they are proper parties. It was contended they were not necessary parties; that the administrators could have recovered in ejectment had they omitted setting forth their representative character; that the letters of administration were but a link in the chain of evidence to make out-their title; that they were under no duty to spread it upon the record, and that its absence could not be taken advantage of, by either plea or demurrer. It may be conceded the plea of <em>ne ungues administrator </em>would not be a proper plea, and that the action might have been sustained without the administrators declaring in their representative character, yet such <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>admission would not carry with it the principle for which the defendants contend. The administrators were proper parties. The lease was a chattel real and goes to the administrators. The latter were entitled to bring ejectment in their representative character. Being properly upon the record, we think the case comes within the Act of 1869, and that the court below was right in excluding the witness.</p>

This instruction was too broad. It withdrew from the jury the question whether an actual fraud was committed. All the authorities, require that this question shall be submitted to the jury : Dean <em>v. </em>Connelly, 6 Barr 238; McMichael <em>v. </em>McDermott, 5 Harris 353. Even if a fraud were intended, yet if none was' committed, neither the defendant nor his creditors have just ground of complaint. Abbey <em>v. </em>Dewey, 1 Casey 413, merely decides that if the purchaser resorts to a trick or any fraudulent device to obtain the property below its value, and thereby purchases it for less than it would have sold for at a fair sale, the sale to him is void. It is true there are cases which hold that such sale would be void even if the property sold for its full value : Stainies <em>v. </em>Shore, 4 Harris 203. But they are manifestly instances in which there was proof that some one was prevented from bidding who would have paid more than the full value. The defendant in an execution has the right that his property shall bring all that the fancy or the caprice of bidders will give. If a purchaser will give twice its value, the defendant is entitled to his bid, and, in such case, it is no answer to say the property brought its full value. But such instances are exceptional, and are not to be presumed. As a general rule, where property has brought its full value, there is no room for the presumption of fraud in the sale. . And even a combination between creditors does not necessarily indicate fraud. Creditors whose ihoney is iii peril have rights as well as debtors. It was said in Smull <em>v. </em>Jones, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 128" data-case-ids="1852646" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0128-01">1 <em>W. </em>&amp; S. 128</a> : “ Lien creditors, as well as others, may purchase jointly at sheriff’s sale, if all be open and fair. A combination of interests for that purpose is not neeessárily corrupt. It is the end to be accomplished which makes such a combination lawful or otherwise; if it be to depress the price of the property <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>by artifice, the purchase will be void ; if it be to raise the means of payment by contribution, or to divide the property for the accommodation of purchasers, it will be valid.” Slingluff <em>v. </em>Eckel, 12 Harris 472, merely decided that when one judgment creditor agreed to pay the claim of another judgment creditor, if the latter would not bid, the contract was a fraud against the defendant if he had not acceded to it; and even if he had, the other creditors might be affected by it. The court very properly declined to enforce such a contract, upon grounds of policy. This presents a very different question from the one we are considering. The issue here is whether the defendants had been injured by an actual fraud.</p>
    <p id="b328-6" data-blocks='[["BL_328.6",328,[256,944,1170,373]]]'>There may be instances which will readily suggest themselves, where by agreement but a single creditor should bid for all. Such an arrangement might even be in the interest of the defendant himself. The crucial test of all such arrangements is whether it is fair and without intent to depress the property and get it at an under value. This question must in all cases be referred to the jury, and it was error in the court below to rule it as a question of law irrespective of the element of fraud in fact.</p>
    <p id="b328-7" data-blocks='[["BL_328.7",328,[255,1327,1171,639]]]'>The answer of the learned judge to the plaintiff’s fourth point (sixth assignment) is open to the same criticism. The jury were told that if either of the defendants, at the time of the sale, induced Joseph 3L Maurer to believe that they were bidding in the colliery for Richard ; or that they promised to pay his claim against the defendants, and that if by either of said means Maurer was induced not to bid, it was a trick and contrivance, and avoided the sale to the defendants as against the plaintiffs. Here the question of fraudulent intent is again omitted. The jury were substantially instructed that the mere fact that either of the defendants stated that they were buying the property for Richard was a fraud, no matter whether the statement were true or false.

Says I, ‘John, you have a chance to get your money.’ He said he wouldn’t do it. Then I says to him, ‘ N ow,’ *ays I, ‘ John, 1 don’t know what more any honest man would •want than dollar for dollar, with interest to date,’ says I, ‘ strangers, let alone being brothers.’ That wouldn’t do ; he would not take it. I came down to Weaver’s hotel. I met Mr. Baumgardner in the office or just coming in the office of the hotel there. Says I, ‘ Mr. Baumgardner, will you take dollar for dollar for your claims against me, dollar for dollar, with interest to date?’ Ho, he wouldn’t, he wouldn’t have anything to do with it.” Mr. Fageley was examined and said that he told Richard to make this offer, and promised the necessary funds. Yet it is apparent from the testimony he had no idea of the amount of money that would be required ; he thought some $18,000. to $20,000, whereas the indebtedness for cash advanced and indorsements to Baumgardner, Wm.

They had a clear right- to hold the colliery until repaid from the profits all their cash advances and liabilities for indorsements. The colliery was sold March éth 1873; the conversation Richard speaks of was about the middle of May succeeding. In the meantime it is not alleged that any considerable amount of profits had been realized. But expensive and extended repairs had been made. The offer did not include these repairs, nor the indorsements of Wm. H. Douty. It might well therefore be refused, and yet be no violation of the implied trust in Richard’s favor. There was no denial of his right to claim the colliery after the purchasers had fully realized their claim. It is a trust enforcablein equity. But this attempt to wrest the colliery from the defendants eight months after they acquired title, before they had even a chance to reimburse themselves, upon such flimsy testimony as that detailed by Richard B. Douty, is not entitled to succeed. We are of opinion that upon this branch of the case the court should have given the jury a binding instruction. There was not suffi<a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>cient evidence of the bad faith- of the defendants to have submitted to the jury.</p>
    <p id="A2X-" data-blocks='[["BL_330.6",330,[259,516,1170,629]]]'>The learned judge evidently misunderstood the object- of the plaintiffs’ first point. The point was: “ That the plaintiffs have not shown any title in them to enable them to maintain this action, and the verdict should be for the defendants.” New judges would understand that under this point was concealed the fact that the plaintiffs by an oversight had omitted to offer in evidence their letters of administration. This was purely a technical matter; the answer of the judge disclosed that he did not understand the point to refer to it. If a specific instruction was desired upon the effect of the omission referred to, the judge should have been asked for it when he answered the point. This would only have been just to the court below. The plaintiffs’ title was defective in the absence of the letters of administration: But were this the only error we would not reverse.</p>
