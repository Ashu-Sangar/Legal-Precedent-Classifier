The corporation appealed from the settlement on the following grounds: 1. Because it imposes a tax on income derived from loans of the United States : 2. Because it imposes a tax on income derived from loans of the State of Pennsylvania, which, by the terms of the acts which authorize their issue, were expressly made payable free of State taxes: 3. Because it disallows the claim of the company, in estimating its <em>net </em>income, to deduct from its gross receipts its loss on United States securities, purchased above par'and paid off by the <em>government at </em>par.</p>

The court, therefore, overruled the first two grounds of appeal. As to the third objection, the court said, in an opinion by Henderson, J., “But there is a farther contention — the corporation defendant, iu estimating its net earnings, claimed to deduct from its gross receipts its loss on United States securities, purchased above par and paid off by the government at par. This claim was disallowed by the accounting officers. The argument in form of this proposition is not without some plausibility. It is crude aud difficult to answer. If a man gets less for a thing than he paid for it, he meets with a loss, and it impairs his capital. But it is the <em>annual </em>net earnings that are taxed. A diminution of capital does not necessarily diminish the annual net earnings. To adopt the rule here contended for would be to east an uncertain factor into the account. For this is purely a matter of speculation. The tax is assessed upon the net earnings, it rises and falls with them, not <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>with the capital; with the net earnings, not with the earning capacity. If the corporation is inactive or its capital lies idle, it produces no basis of taxation.</p>

Clearly not, except as the depreciation affects the <em>a/nnual </em>net earnings. <em>We </em>should prefer to say that the premiums paid for the bonds <em>should </em>have been deducted when the investment was made, and might properly have been accounted for and taken from the gross receipts. But certainly the State cannot now settle a profit and loss account running through several years and many transactions. The law requires an <em>annual settlement </em>producing an annual tax, and upon an annual basis.”</p>

But the Act of January 7th 1879, imposes a tax on income “ from all sources.” It is clear that as to so much of the “income” Avhich is derived from United States securities, the act is unconstitutional.

Our franchise is to insure houses from fire, but our income from the bonds remains constant, whether we insure much or little or not at all.

In the former case the tax may be constitutional, even though a portion of the corporation’s capital is invested in United States securities, or other non-taxable property: Savings’ Society <em>v. </em>Coite, 6 Wallace 594; Provident Institution <em>v. </em>Massachusetts, Id. 611; Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Loud, <a href="/mass/99/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="99 Mass. 146" data-case-ids="2139835" data-case-paths="/mass/99/0146-01">99 Mass. 146</a>. There is also a distinction as to the liability to taxation of property itself, according to its different stages of existence. Thus, in the State Freight Case, 15 Wallace 232, the Supreme Court held that a tax upon freight transported from State to State was invalid; biit at the same term, and in the next succeeding case, the same court held that a State tax upon the gross receipts of railroad companies is valid, though the gross receipts are largely made up from freight transported from State to State : State Tax on Gross Receipts, 15 Wallace, 284. The ground of the decision was that after the money lias come into the treasury of the company it has lest its distinctive character as freight by having been incorporated into the general mass of tlip company’s property. So, although certain imports in original packages are non-taxable, yet when the articles imported have been incorporated with the mass of property in the country, they lose their exemption: Brown <em>v. </em>Maryland, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wheat.%20439" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="12 Wheat. 439">12 Wheat. 439</a>, 441; Waring <em>v. </em>Mayor, 8 Wallace 122; Pervear <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 5 Wallace 479. So also the change from net earnings into dividends creates a new kind of property, subject to another kind of tax: Jones <em>&amp; </em>Nimick Man’fg. Co. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 19 P. F. Smith 137.</p>

Such property springing from one source may thus be differently taxable in its several stages, as gross receipts, net earnings or dividends.</p>
    <p id="b66-6" data-blocks='[["BL_66.6",66,[262,692,1166,430]]]'>The company suffered no “ loss ” by the payment at par of bonds which they purchased at a premium. The premium was the price of the extra security of the investment. Each year diminished the annual proportion of premium originally paid, and if any abatement should be made, it should only be the proportion chargeable during the tax year of 1879, and that would be merely speculative. But if it be a loss, it is a loss of capital, and cannot be deducted in computing a tax upon net earnings for any one year. A diminution of capital does not necessarily diminish the annual net earnings.</p>

It was also claimed that, in ascertaining its net earnings or income, the difference between the par value of $307,000 United States bonds whicli were called in and paid during the year, and the price at which they were purchased several years before, should be treated as a loss and deducted from its gross receipts. The accounting officers having refused to allow any abatement on account of either of these three items, the tax thereon, amounting to $2,068.19, was paid under protest and an appeal taken from the settlement. The decision of the court below was also adverse to the plaintiff in error on the points in controversy. The questions thus presented by the record are, whether, the income derived from either class of bonds, is exempt from taxation; and whether the difference between the price paid for the <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>United States bonds and their par value, should be regarded as a loss and deducted from the gross receipts.</p>

It is a tax on the corporate franchise of the plaintiff in error, measured by its net earnings. The right of the state to impose a tax on the franchise of any corporation that is indebted to it for existence and protection, is too clear for argument. If the right exists, as it undoubtedly does, the manner of its exercise must be left to the wisdom of the legislature : and, perhaps no standard or measure of taxation can be adopted that will operate more justly and equitably than a <em>per centum </em>on net earnings or income.</p>

When so paid it loses the non-taxablo characteristic of the bond on which it accrued, and should thenceforth be treated as any other species of income derived from other sources. But,'as already intimated, the tax is not laid on-the money and other receipts of the company.

Under a similar law in Massachusetts it was held that a savings institution having a portion of its deposits invested in Federal securities was liable to a tax on such deposits as fully as on account of other deposits, nothwithstanding the securities were declared by the act of Congress, under which they are issued, to be exempt from taxation under State authority : Provident Institution v.
