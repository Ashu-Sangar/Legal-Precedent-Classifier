If such payments be made out of the capital, the latter will be gradually consumed, and the time may come when there may be no fund left, and consequently no annual income.

    <p id="b366-11" data-blocks='[["BL_366.16",366,[285,2053,1168,331]]]'>It was held in Spangler’s Estate, 9 Harris 335, that the interest and not the principal of a trust fund must bear the expense of administering it. Were it otherwise, the entire principal might bo absorbed in paying the trustee’s commissions upon income.

      <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>The learned judge of the Orphans’ Court ordered that the sura of $103.13, composed of an allowance for compensation to the accountant, taxes paid by him, and sundry costs and ex-. [Deuses connected with the filing of the account, and the audit thereof, be paid out of the principal of the fund, upon the ground that'the cestui que trust was the primary object of the testator’s bounty, and that it was the intent of said testator that she should have “ all possible benefit from the fund consistent with its being in the hands of a trustee.” The difficulty in this view of the case is that the will of Jacob Butterbaugh expressly provides that in case of the decease of Mary Ilollinger, the cestui que trust, before her husband, the share of said Mary in the testator’s estate shall go to her children on their attaining the age of twenty-one years. It is her share that is to go to her children upon the contingency referred to; not what may be left of it. Such share cannot be preserved unless the income of the fund is made to bear the cost of its administration. The case does not need elaboration. It is ruled by Spangler’s Estate.</p>
