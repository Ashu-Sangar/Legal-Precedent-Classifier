All of the parties to the proceeding wore satisfied. Mr. Miles might have objected to the appropriation of the money of Miles &amp; Bell to pay Mr. Bell’s debt. But he never has objected, nor has he ever taken any step to avoid the judgment. It is true he says in liis testimony that the appropriation was made without liis consent. But he does not say it was done without liis knowledge. If he had knowledge, which is probable, and did not object, it is too late to do so now. It is settled by a bead roll of authority that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be attacked collaterally.</p>
