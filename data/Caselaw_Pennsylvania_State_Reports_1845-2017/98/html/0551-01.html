With this we cannot concur. We think that the penalty must be limited to illegal charges made by the officers specifically mentioned in the act. This seems so apparent from the act itself that it is difficult to comprehend the force of a suggestion to the contrary.

The clear intention of the legislature in enlarging the words was to impose the penalty upon <em>all </em>transgressing public officers, whether named in the preceding Fee Bill, or entitled to fees fixed by some other Act of Assembly. An inspection of the 25th section of the Act of 1814 shows that when the legislature intended to confine the operation of the Act, it used appropriate language to that effect.</p>

Act of 1814, and consequently not within its penalty. The Act of the 8th of April, 1864, allows him to collect from the delinquent tax-payer ten per centum in addition to the amount of the tax, and this ten per centum is his full compensation, and any additional charge of any kind is illegal and void. Moreover, his warrant to the constable was altogether ultra vires: he had no power to issue such a writ, and the constable had no power to execute it. The only legal warrant was that of the treasurer to Conner; this was his authority tó demand and collect the taxes found in his schedule, and he liad no power to delegate that authority, by his waiTant or otherwise, to some other person. Under tlie act of 1834, he might, with the approbation of the treasurer, employ a suitable person to act for him “ in the execution of his warrant ” ; that is, the warrant issued to him by the treasurer. Hence, his deputy, if he has one, acts under the same power that he does. All this is very plain and obvious to any one who takes the pains to read the provisions of the statute, and how this collector and the constable, to whom he directed his sham warrant, came to pursue the course they did, is a matter hard to understand.</p>
