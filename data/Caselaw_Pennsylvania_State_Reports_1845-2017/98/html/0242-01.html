The law applicable to this case is not settled beyond doubt by the authorities that have been cited here. The law relating to the rights of mortgagors and mortgagees in cases like this seems to be in considerable confusion, from the law cited before us; and, as I understand the eases cited in this State, the law in Pennsylvania differs from that in other States, notably in Maine and Massachusetts. But as wo are administering the law in Pennsylvania we must respect the decisions of <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>our own courts, and must endeavor to decide our cases so that we may be within the line of the judicial thought of this State.</p>

It is clear that Mrs. Lou-den put a house back on this property voluntarily. • There was nothing that would require her to build a house there. There was neither law nor equity that could be called upon to compel her to do any such thing, and we think that the value of this house that has been built is immaterial in this issue, for several reasons. First, if Mrs. Louden, or those who represent her, is entitled to all this insurance money and all this mortgage money, she does not claim anything for the property that has been built. If, on the other hand, she held that money — received that money from the insurance company in trust for her son — or if in law she was bound to apply it to the mortgage, and the surplus was to be held in trust for the estate of Charles <em>W. </em>Sweeny, why then, if trust funds, she had no authority to use them for building the house without due authority of law, and none is shown. And hence it is of no importance in this case, as we look at it, what the value of the buildings are that have been put upon this lot.</p>

Now, in some States — Maine and Massachusetts — it is competent for the person who has a mortgage against real estate to take out a policy of insurance, and if the property burns down, the party holding the mortgage can recover all their insurance money, and then proceed with the mortgage and recover all the mortgage. In this State we think that the law is different, a'nd I believe that the case„s cited here — the case of Smith against the Insurance Company, 5th Harris 253, to the Insurance Company against Updegraff, 9th Harris 513, indicate a different view as the law in this State.</p>

That I believe to be the law in this State; so that, applying it to this case, Mrs. Louden could insure the <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>whole of this property, and if she did insure the whole of it by this policy, then, if there was a loss, and she received a sum of money sufficient to satisfy this mortgage, and to compensate her for any loss-she might sustaiu on her other insurable interests, she was bound to satisfy the mortgage to the extent of the funds. She could have insured her interest alone — she could have recited that fact — and in that event she would not have had to account for anything to the owner of the real estate. If the sum was sufficient when she received it she would be bound to apply it. . . . She received $3,681.52, between $200 and $300 more than the amount of the mortgage due at the time she so got the money; so that, in our view, whether this insurance was on the whole property or whether it was on her mortgage and dower interest is no1- of much importance, as the loss was amicably adjusted by a compromise for a sum sufficient to cover the mortgage interest and a sum equivalent to a fair valuation of her dower interest.</p>

In such case we contend it is the law of Pennsylvania, as well as of other states, that in case of loss or damage to the premises by fire, before the mortgage has been paid, the mortgagee may .recover from the insurance company on its policy, without any obligation to apply the insurance money so received in satisfaction of the mortgage debt; but on -the contrary, the mortgagee may regain the insurance money and also recover from the mortgagor the full amount of the mortgage. This is so on principle as well as on authority. On principle— because there is no privity in fact or law, as to the contract of insurance, between the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The mortgagee pays the premium, and if there is no loss by fire, or if the mortgage is paid, lie cannot call on the mortgagor to pay the premium, but he must lose it. <em>E converso, </em>the mortgagor cannot claim a benefit under the policy. The underwriters insure for the benefit of the <em>insured, </em>not for another, and the mortgagor, in case of loss, can no more claim the benefit of that contract against the mortgagee than he <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>can against the insurance company. The insurance is wholly a collateral contract, with which the mortgagor has no concern. The two claims are distinct and independent. The mortgagee insures not his debt, but his interest in the property as security for the debt. There is no question here as to the mortgagee’s insurable interest, for the company paid the insurance money by a compromise settlement. In this case the mortgagee had a right of dower in the premises, besides her lien as~ mortgagee, and she expended the insurance money in building another house on the lot; but apart from these facts a mortgagee insuring his debt, estate or security may recover the insurance, without prejudice to his claim against the mortgagor. Both mortgagor and mortgagee may insure the same property, and each may recover, on his own policy, to the amount of his interest ; but neither can claim the benefit of a policy underwritten for the other. The contract of insurance is a mere personal indemnity against loss to the person with whom it is made; it is not incident to the estate so as to run with the title or be available by a stranger.</p>

In case the mortgaged buildings are destroyed by fire, and the company pays the mortgagee the insurance money exceeding the mortgage debt, the company not only thereby fulfills its contract of indemnity, but it in equity extinguishes the mortgage. It is said as the mortgagor did not pay the premium, he cannot reap an advantage from the insurance policy, to which he was not a party; but the mortgagee’s <em>insurable interest </em>was derived from the mortgagor by virtue of the mortgage — the mortgagor thus enabled the mortgagee to insure, and that benefit accruing to the mortgagee is sufficient consideration to support the mortgagagor’s claim in equity to have the insurance money, less the premium, applied to his mortgage debt. »</p>

She paid the whole premium. The houses were wholly destroyed. She compromised with the insurance company and received the money. Soon thereafter, with the money received, she erected a new house on the premises in place of those destroyed; but, the evidence indicates, of less value than the former.</p>
    <p id="b263-12" data-blocks='[["BL_263.15",263,[167,1893,1167,340]]]'>A careful examination of the whole evidence fails to show any declaration of Mrs. Louden that she understood the insurance to be of the mortgage. The amount of the risk taken on the buildings was much greater than the sum due on the mortgage. While the fact that she rebuilt with a part of the money received could not change the previously existing rights of the parties, yet it is persuasive evidence that she understood the estate, and not the debt, to have been insured.</p>

To support this view they cite Smith <em>v. </em>Ins. Co., 5 Harris 253 ; Ins.
