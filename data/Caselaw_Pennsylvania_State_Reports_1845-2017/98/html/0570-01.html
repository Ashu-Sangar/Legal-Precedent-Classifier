It would be to impose upon the county a part of the expense of litigation in each cause tried, or at least in all causes taken to the Supreme Court, that ought to be borne by the parties as a part of the legitimate personal expenses of a suit, as much so as counsel fees.

They simply requested the stenographer to do what the law required him to do, viz.: to make and file the transcript.

So it is not burdensome upon the county to call upon it to pay the expense of the transcripts; but whether burdensome or not, it is sufficient to say the law says it must be done.</p>

Certainly, the Act does not repose unlimited discretion in the counsel on both sides of the case to order transcripts of voluminous notes, which may prove unnecessary and useless, at the expense of the county treasury.</p>

Dig. 2054, authorizes the judges of the several courts of the Commonwealth to appoint a stenographer who shall be paid $10 for each day spent by him in taking notes in court, and be paid by the county or counties forming the judicial district. Section 4 imposes additional duties and declares by whom such services shall be paid. He is required “ to furnish a copy of his notes of testimony written out in long hand upon the order of the court or the request of counsel in the cause, during the progress of the trial or at any subsequent time; also within a reasonable time after trial to transcribe all notes, not previously transcribed by order of the court, which transcripts shall be filed and made a part of the records of the case.” Provided in the discretion of the court with the consent of counsel, he may be excused from transcribing notes and furnishing transcripts; but then he shall preserve the notes for future reference or transcripts if desired. The section proceeds, the transcripts thus made shall be furnished at a compensation specified, <em>“ </em>to be paid by the county in which the notes ai’e taken, when the transcript is ordered by the court, or when made for the purpose of being filed; and by the counsel in the respective cases, when ordered by them.”</p>

During the progress of the trial “ or at any subsequent time,” counsel in the case may require the evidence to be written out at length ; but whenever so required by counsel, the compensation therefor shall be paid by the counsel ordering the same. The Act contains no language imposing a liability on the county to pay, when the transcript is ordered by counsel, whether it be during, or after, the trial. The language imposing the liability to pay on the counsel ordering it, is the same in each case. Making a copy for counsel during trial, will not dispense with the obligation of the stenographer to make another to file after trial. He is only ex-<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>cnsed from making one to file tliat lie lias previously transcribed ‘‘ by order of court.” The counsel has a right to procure a transcript for his own use.

The liability of the county for further compensation to the stenographer, cannot be enlarged by any action of counsel in the case.
