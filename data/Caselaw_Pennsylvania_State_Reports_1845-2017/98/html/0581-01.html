The proposition is divisible, the point is double. One part.of it declares, as a result of the facts hypothetically stated, that the assignment would be void. We state if this change was fraudulently made it would be void and not prejudice any right or any parties intended to be defrauded. But the other part of the point asserts that this alteration was in the direct line of the title of the defendant, and that he was bound to notice it, and if he failed to do so, he was not an innocent purchaser without notice.

We say that is the law if the facts be so found. But the plaintiffs in the case say that is not so. They say that is not so and that the evidence does not justify the jury in forming that conclusion.

The doctrine that a bona fide purchaser acquires title discharged from all secret equities, does not apply to this case. The plaintiffs’ judgment became a valid lien on Guthrie’s title, August 6th 1875, before the forged deed from Guthrie to Maguire was placed on record, and the latter was ineffectual to divest the plaintiffs’ legal right. Iu such case, a purchaser under the void deed acquires no title, even though the record did not disclose anything to put him on inquiry.

The evidence was insufficient to show a fraudulent or even material alteration, and the jury so found. It was proved that Maguire had in fact held title two or three years before he re assigned to Guthrie, but it was claimed that the alteration of the deed operated retrospectively and made the deed absolutely void. This does not follow, if the title was in Maguire, any more than if the conveyance to Maguire, originally made in good faith, had been then physically destroyed. Neither its destruction nor its fraudulent alteration would operate to re-vest the estate in Guthrie prior to such destruction or alteration.</p>

    <p id="b599-8" data-blocks='[["BL_599.7",599,[168,893,1166,1241]]]'>’ The hypothetical facts of this point were an absolute obliteration of the actual date of an instrument conveying title to land, and the substitution, in place thereof, of an anterior and false date. Beyond all question, such an alteration of such an instrument would be a forgery as against any person affected by the change, and who was not a party or privy to it. The plaintiffs claim to be, and apparently are, such persons. They acquired title by purchase at sheriff’s sale under a judgment entered August 6th 1875. "Whatever title Guthrie, the defendant in that judgment, had on that day, in the land in controversy, passed to the plaintiffs by their-purchase. This gives them a sufficient interest to question the condition of Guthrie’s title. Now the legal effect of the alleged alteration was to divest Guthrie’s title as of August 6th 1875, by subjecting it to the operation of a transfer dated December 20th 1874. lie held title by a deed in fee simple dated September 6th 1872, which on its face contained no conditions or qualifications. But the defendant Clapp claims to have been, and apparently is, an innocent purchaser for value of Guthrie’s title as it stood on the record. Tested by tlie record alone, bis claim would be good because that afforded no evidence of the forgery. In this condition of things the plaintiffs’ second point was put in order to charge the defendant with the effect of the forgery, for the reason that the forged instrument was itself a link in his chain of title. He does, and must claim title directly through that paper. The question is reduced to one of the plainest and simplest character, to wit, does a forged deed pass the title which it assumes to convey, as against one who has no participation in, or knowledge of the forgery <em>% </em>Of course it can accomplish no such result.</p>
    <p id="b599-10" data-blocks='[["BL_599.8",599,[170,2134,1164,298]],["BL_600.1",600,[261,428,1172,2003]],["BL_601.1",601,[186,430,1162,132]]]'>The second point of the plaintiffs was answered by the court below by their saying, in effect, that tlie defendant would not be affected by tlie forgery, because lie could assert the rights of an innocent purchaser without notice if he used reasonable diligence to obtain access to the original papers, but without success, and the title, as recorded, was fair and free from blemish. The consequences of such a doctrine would be of a most <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>seiious character if it received the sanction of the courts. For then it would only be necessary for the forger of a deed or mortgage, after having it placed on record, to lose or destroy the original instrument and convey his title to an innocent third person for value, pretending to him that the original paper was mislaid and would be subsequently delivered. Of course, a purchaser who examines the records is protected by them as far as they can protect him, but he necessarily takes the risk of having the actual state of the title correspond with that which ■appears of record. The language of this court in the ease of Arrison <em>v. </em>Harmstead, 2 Barr 191, fully illustrates this subject: <em>“ </em>A deed, good in its creation, may become void by matter ex post facto, as by interlineation, erasure, or by alteration in a material part. But a deed may be good in part and void in part. It may be good against one person and void against another.” . . . “ It is said that Mrs. Lewis is a bona fide purchaser without notice, and that the action may be sustained on that ground. But conceding that she is, her situation is no better than the fraudulent grantor’s. Although the title of the grantor was, in its inception, good, it became entirely void by matter ex post facto. At the time of the assigm&amp;eut, the title being avoided, tile assignor had nothing to convey; of course nothing passed to the assignee. It may be, and perhaps is, a a hard case. Fraud may be committed on an innocent pui chaser, who may find it difficult to guard against imposition. This is conceded; but it is far better to encounter this risk, than to give the least countenance to any alteration whatever of a solemn instrument of writing, which would certainly be the result, if the guilty party could escape the consequences of his fraud by a transfer to a person who might assume the garb of an innocent purchaser for a valuable consideration. We cannot lay too many restraints upon trick, artifice and fraud.” In Van Amringe v<em>. </em>Morton, <a href="/whart/4/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Whart. 382" data-case-ids="1835030" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0382-01">4 Wh. 382</a>, it was held that if a deed which has been executed and acknowledged by the grantor with a blank for the grantee’s name, be surreptitiously and fraudulently taken from the grantor’s house, and the blank filled up, no title passes thereby; and a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration from the person holding the deed stands in no better situation than such fraudulent holder. In the case of Wallace <em>v. </em>Harmstad, 8 Wright on p. 494, Woodward, J., speaking of the cases of Arrison <em>v. </em>Harmstead, 2 Barr 191, and Wallaces. Harmstad, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.W.%20Harr.%20462" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 W.W. Harr. 462">3 Harr. 462</a>, said: “The stern ruling in those cases was applied without hesitation to a bona fide purchaser of the ground rent without notice of the fraud, so that, as far as concerns Arrison and all persons claiming under him, the part of the deed which was intended to enure to his benefit, may indeed be said to be dead. It was not merely a voidable instrument, <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>it was void. It was called a forgery and treated as sucb, and neither law nor equity would tolerate it even in the hands of an innocent purchaser.”</p>
