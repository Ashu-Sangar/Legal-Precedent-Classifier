In an action against a railway company to recover damages for a loss of plaintiff’s property by a fire alleged to have been caused through the negligence of the company defendant in permitting sparks to escape from its engines, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the alleged negligence.</p>

When in such case it appeared that plaintiff’s loss, if indeed it was caused at all by the defendant’s negligence, was attributable entirely to the escape of sparks at a particular time from one of two particular engines, evidence was held inadmissible on the part of the plaintiff, in order to prove defendant’s negligence, to the effect that sparks of unusual size had been emitted for some time prior to the fire by defendant’s engines generally.</p>

Where a witness testifies to having seen a certain event take place, evidence is admissible, in order to discredit his testimony, to the effect that there were obstructions between the place where he was at the time and the place where the event occurred, which would have materially interfered with his view. Whether or not those obstructions must have altogether prevented the witness from observing what he has testified to, is for the jury.</p>

J., the following facts appeared : — The plaintiffs’ mill was situated so that its nearest point was at the distance of 109 feet from the railroad. On the night of June 11th 1874, it was destroyed by fire. The plaintiffs alleged that the tire was caused by sparks of an unusually lai’ge size thrown out by a locomotive of the defendant company. There was no direct evidence that the fire was caused in this manner; but the testimony on both sides indicated that if the fire was so caused, the sparks came from either one or the other of two locomotives (Nos. 21 and 126) which drew the first and the second sections of the “ Anchor freight train ” on the night in question. The sections were running about a mile and a half apart. Several witnesses testified that these two engines attracted their attention, about the time and place in question, because of the unusual quantity of fire and sparks thrown from their stacks. There was a strong wind blowing from the direction of the railroad towards the mill. Soon after the second section passed the mill, the fire was discovered.</p>

Two brakemen on the second section testified that they saw a light in the engine-house or boiler-room of the mill when they passed it. Other witnesses testified that they had passed the mill a short time before the fire and saw no light or lire. The defendant proved that the two engines in question were provided with spark-arresters of the most approved construction, which were examined at the shops of the company both before and after the run of June 11th 1874, and were found to be in perfect condition; Their employes also testified that there was not any unusual or improper emission of sparks from either of the said engines on the night in question.</p>

That fact may be inferred like any other fact. We think we are bound to submit that question, to be determined by you from all the evidence in the case, and the only evidence that I now recollect of, is merely the testimony as to an unusual quantity of sparks and fire thrown by these locomotives on the occasion of the burning of the saw-mill and other property. If you can reasonably and fairly infer from this evidence that the defendant’s spark arresters were not in order, or that they had not spark arresters on, or, if they had, that they were out of order, and not sufficient to prevent the emission of sparks, you have the right to so find. Whether I am right in submitting this question to you to be determined from this evidence alone, I am not clear, but I say to you at this time that I do submit that question to you to be determined by you from this evidence. In the case of Hendrickson <em>v. </em>The Reading Railroad Company, there was evidence that the locomotives were run at an unusual speed, and that they set fire to grass and fences, as well as the plaintiff’s property along the line; and all this was submitted by the court as evidence of carelessness and improper running on the part of the employés of the railroad company.

If it was alleged that such large- cinders did not come from either of those engines, it was peculiarly within the power of the defendants to show that. But we should have been permitted to show the fact that numerous fires had been caused in that manner, and to have produced in evidence specimens of the cinders found the next morning after the fire between the railroad track and the mill. Such evidence, in the absence of contradiction, was the best which the nature of the case would permit, and would warrant an inference by the jury, that the defendant’s engines were not in proper condition on the night of the fire. Evidence of other fires occurring about the same time has been held to be admissible to show negligence : Huyett <em>v. </em>Reading R. R. Co., 11 Har. 373; Lehigh Yalley R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>McKeen, 9 Nor. <em>122; </em>Penna. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Stranahan, 29 P. F. Smith 405 ; Field <em>v. </em>New York Central R. R.

The instruction of the court that, even if the mill, 109 feet from the railroad, was burned by sparks from the defendant’s engines, such fact constituted ‘‘ no ground for an inference that such burning was caused by negligence, and was no evidence of negligence,” really took the case from the jury, and was in opposition to almost every decision on the subject. Experience has demonstrated that railway companies, by the use of mechanical contrivances, can effectually prevent the escape of fire from engines, which could communicate fire to such a distance, and railroad companies should be held to a strict measure of accountability for failure of duty in such respect: Lackawanna <em>&amp; </em>Bloomburg R.

The evidence below established the fact that if the plaintiffs’ property was destroyed by fire communicated by defendant’s locomotives, it was done by engine No. 21 or engine No. 126,'and by no others. Hence it is entirely clear that evidence that other engines upon some other day threw out an unusual amount of large sparks and live coals was immaterial, and if received could only have confused, and might have misled the jury. Nor would it have been evidence to show that the spark-arresters on engines 21 and 126 were out of order. This point does not need elaboration, for it has been expressly ruled in Erie Railway Company <em>v. </em>Decker, 28 P. F. S. 293. Huyett <em>v. </em>The Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company is not in point. There the evidence was that the plaintiff’s house was set on fire by sparks from some one or more of several engines passing by on that day and about the same hour. Sparks were seen flying from the engines to the distance of more than fifty yards, and fences and fields were set on fire iu several places about the same time. So, in Lehigh Valley R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>McKeen, 9 Norris 123, the allegation was that the fire was caused by engine No. 133, going northward, and the evidence in relation to the character of the sparks was limited to those thrown out by the engine in question on the day of the fire and for some time before.</p>
