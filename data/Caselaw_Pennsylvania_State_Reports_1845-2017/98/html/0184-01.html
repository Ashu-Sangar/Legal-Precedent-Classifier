First, because the debt sought to be attached is not such a debt due to the defendant as is contemplated by the Act of Assembly authorizing the writ <em>of </em>execution attachment to issue. The charter of the Lycoming Fire Insurance Company is a part of every contract of insurance it enters into. By its charter this company cannot levy and collect assessments from its members for the purpose of increasing its cash balance, nor for any other purpose than that therein prescribed, viz.: to pay <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>losses and incidental expenses. The company, as a corporation, cannot do as they please with the fruits of such assessments ; they are mere trustees, whose duties it is to ascertain from time to time the amounts of money to be raised, to ratably assess the same on its members, and, when collected, appropriate the money to the persons and purposes for which it was raised. They can only make such assessments for certain purposes, and, when collected, they cannot use the money for any other purpose. The assessments due from these garnishees are, therefore, not due to the defendant in its own right, although, collectible in its name, but belong to those policy-holders who have suffered the losses for which it was laid. As has been said by our Supreme Court, they have an immediate vested interest in them: Rhinehart <em>v. </em>Allegheny County Mutual Insurance Company, 1 Barr 359 ; Coston <em>v. </em>Same, Id. 322.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b202-6" data-blocks='[["BL_202.6",202,[329,1061,1169,513]]]'>“But another reason why this writ will not lie in this case is, because a remedy for the payment of this debt is provided by the charter of the company and it must be pursued. The charter provides that debts of this kind shall be paid by assessments to be levied on the premium notes of those persons who are members of the company at the time of the happening of such loss. In all cases where a remedy is provided or duty enjoined or anything directed to be done by any act or acts of Assembly of this Commonwealth the said act shall be strictly pursued,” &amp;c.: Act of March 21st 1806, Purdon’s Digest, p. 58, pi. 5. That such remedy is exclusive is held in Koch <em>v. </em>Williams-port Water Company, 15 P. F. S. 288, and many other eases.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b202-7" data-blocks='[["BL_202.7",202,[325,1573,1168,810]]]'>“ If this company should neglect or refuse to make and collect assessments to meet its losses, it could be compelled by mandamus to do its duty in this regard. If it should attempt to use such funds when collected for any other than the purposes for which they were raised, it could be enjoined from so doing at the suit of any one interested. Thus we find the remedy provided is ample; and that it is appropriate and should be strictly pursued becomes apparent when we consider the rights of all the parties in the premises. In the People’s Fire Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Iiartsliorne &amp; Co., 9 Norris 470, Mr. Justice Sterrett, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: “ The essential principle on which mutual insurance companies are oi’ganized, is that each member will pay his proportionate share of expenses incurred and losses which happen during the period of his membership.” From this it follows that members of such companies are not liable for losses which occurred before they became members, nor after they ceased to be such. They ought not to be compelled by any process of law to pay any portion of a loss for which they are not liable as a member.</p>

These assessments are laid for a sufficient sum to pay the debts for which certain members are liable; if they are diverted to the payment of other debts for which those members are not liable, how is this deficiency to be made up ?

There was no appropriation of the assessments to particular losses; neither the creditor members nor the garnishees had been notified of any such appropriation, and even if intended to have been made by the company, they cannot set it up against a judgment creditor under a cash policy.

    <p id="b205-7" data-blocks='[["BL_205.7",205,[141,1106,1179,341]]]'>In Peterson <em>v. </em>Sinclair, 2 Nor. 250, as in several cases therein cited, it was held that a balance due on a subscription to the stock of a corporation was attachable, as other debts. In the present case, when the assessments on the premium notes were levied, a certain percentage of the stock of the .company became due and payable; and we cannot see why such a debt-could not be attached by an outside creditor, as: well as the balance due on an ordinary stock subscription.</p>

He is therein interested to the amount of his assurance, and no further. If he meets with a loss ho requires payment, but he can require nothing more, and it is none of his concern how the money is raised by'which he is paid. If payment is refused he must' pursue his ordinary legal remedies, arid to him attaches none of either the rights or disabilities of membership. It is true, that the charter of this company provides that assessments on premium notes may be made to pay its losses ; but what has the plaintiff to do with that ? It is said he might compel the officers of the corporation by mandamus to assess its premium notes. This might, indeed, be so, if any creditors of a corporation could compel the officers thereof by mandamus to collect the notes, stock subscriptions and other assets due it, in order to meet his demand, but not otherwise. But this is a process for the collection of corporate debts which is as yet novel and untried, and when tried, if ever such an attempt is made, will, in all probability, prove a failure. A member of the company might be entitled to a writ of this <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>kind, but certainly a stranger can avail himself of no such process. What then remains? Here is a certain amount of money in the hands of one of the garnishees, and the others are debtors of the company by reason of assessments on their premium notes; therefore, as to those assured on the stock side of the company, the money thus in hand, and the money thus due, has been made from, or is due on, stock subscriptions, and, bence, tbe case falls within the rule of Peterson <em>v. </em>Sinclair..</p>
    <p id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.6",206,[270,774,1173,939]]]'>Put it is said this assessment was made for a special purpose ; certainly, and that purpose was the payment of the debts of the company then outstanding, among which was that of the plaintiff, but for some reason or other it was not so appropriated. The loss of the railroad company was regularly adjusted and the usual certificate given, but this, when due, was not cashed, and tbe plaintiff was compelled to proceed to judgment and execution by attachment. Now, it is admitted' that the company is, or was, at the time of the trial of this case, solvent, hence, this contention is not complicated by the question of insolvency; neither is it denied that the premium notes held by the company were assessable for the payment of this debt, or that the assessment was lawfully made and partially paid into the hands of Mr. Watson, one of the garnishees. Here then, are found in the hands of these garnishees, money of, and debts due, the defendant, and why these are not attachable on an honest and regular judgment against this solvent corporation, is something which we cannot understand. Prima facie, the presumption is that the plaintiff is entitled to the ordinary legal process in order to make its money, and we do not think that either the reasoning of the court below, nor of the counsel for the defendant, has satisfactorily rebutted that presumption.</p>
