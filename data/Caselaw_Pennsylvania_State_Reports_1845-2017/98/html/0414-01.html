A. was the owner of a tract of land which was subject to the lien of several judgments, one of which was held by B. Being desirous to sell the tract, he applied, through his counsel, to B. for a release. Said counsel stated to B. that he was informed and believed that the property would realize more then sufficient to pay off her judgment, and those prior thereto, and she, by his advice, accordingly executed an instrument by which she agreed that the land should be sold clear of her judgment, provided that the purchase money should be applied <em>to the </em>payment of said judgment, according to its priority of lien. A short time afterwards the land was sold and conveyed to 0., but for a sum insufficient to pay any part of B.’s judgment, according to its priority. It did not distinctly appear whether, at the time of the sale, C. had any knowledge of the contents of B.’s instrument of release or not.

But the record shows that her judgment could not be reached by any appropriation of the moneys derived from the Small lands ; so that if the application by the attorneys-in-fact was not according to priority of liens, still she was not injured thereby.

If she relied on the statement of Judge Kimmell, as to the amount of such judgments, she cannot visit the consequences of this mistake upon the Smalls. The presumption is that the latter purchased on the faith of the release, and there was some evidence to sustain it. But whether they did or did not is immaterial: Cover <em>v. </em>Black, 1 Barr 493.

Wilbur’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.N.C.%20133" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 W.N.C. 133">10 W. N.

Bodey, 6 Harris 207, the question was iu substance raised and determined the other way. In this case the plaintiff had notice from the record of the sale to Burkholder, and the release was executed within a month after the sale to Christian Wingert, who had six months within which to record 1ns deed. In such case'a party releasing is bound to search the record or make inquiry: Patty v. Pease, 8 Paige Chan. 277; Guion v. Knapp, 6 Ibid. 35. It cannot be that a purchaser of part of <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>land bound by a judgment must at once, in spite of all obstacles, give <em>actual </em>notice to^ all the lien creditors of his vendor not to release his remaining lands. The case is different from that where a creditor having a lien on tract A. is required to notify another creditor having a lien on tracts A. and B. not to release tract B. If the release is valid as to Smalls’ land, it must be valid as to Burkholder’s and Wingert’s lands; because the right ■of a prior purchaser to have the lands of a subsequent purchaser protect his, is an <em>absolute right inherent m the </em>transaction, and therefore the lien creditor <em>cannot </em>release the last land sold without thereby relieving also the first whether he has knowledge of the first sale or not: Paxton <em>v. </em>Harrier, <a href="/nc/46/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Jones 312" data-case-ids="8682368" data-case-paths="/nc/46/0312-01">1 Jones 312</a>.</p>

    <p id="b434-7" data-blocks='[["BL_434.10",434,[315,1073,1168,556]]]'>The plaintiff held a judgment against Martin B. Wingert, which was a lien on three tracts of laud. On the 28th September 1875, she executed a writing whereby she agreed that the agents of the owner of the land should sell one of the tracts clear of the lien of her judgment, provided the money produced by the sale be applied to the payment of her judgment according to its priority of lien. On the 2d October following the tract was sold and conveyed to Adam Small and Henry Small, two of the defendants. On distribution of the proceeds according to priority of liens, the money did not reach the judgment of the plaintiff. Thereupon she afterwards issued this scire facias, with notice to all who had purchased lands originally bound by her judgment.</p>

      <a class="bracketnum" href="#b428-6" id="ref_b428-6">1.</a> The plaintiff claims she executed the writing relying on representations made to her that her judgment would be paid in full out of the proceeds .of the sale about to be made to the Smalls. The latter, however, made no such representations, nor did any person acting in their behalf. If she was misled by the counsel and opinion of her own friend and adviser, the defendants are not to be prejudiced thereby. The payment of the judgment was not a condition precedent to the'sale or to divesting the lien. The application of the money was intended to be <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>made after the lien was divested. She authorized the sale to be made so as to discharge her lien. The authority to the attorneys to sell existed. The Smalls having purchased and paid the purchase money in good faith their title cannot be impaired by verbal declarations made to her without their authority or knowledge. Nor does it matter whether they had knowledge of the contents of the paper. The vendors having full power to sell, the purchasers took the title discharged from the lien. The first three assignments are not sustained.</p>

      <a class="bracketnum">2.</a> The writing clearly indicates an intention to discharge from the lien those lands only thereafter to be conveyed. She expected the judgment to be paid out of the proceeds ; but she did not intend to release, nor did the writing profess to release, any other lien or security she held. She had no knowledge of the previous conveyances. She was under uo obligation tó exr amine or inquire if such had been made. It is claimed that inasmuch as the deed to Burkholder had been recorded on the 17th. May 1875, she had constructive notice of the conveyance. Undoubtedly that would .have been notice to one about to take a conveyance from Wingert, that he' had previously conveyed : but it is not such notice as to prevent her from releasing the lien on some of the lands, and keeping it good on other lands bound thereby. If the vendees under prior conveyances desired to prevent her from releasing the lien .of her judgment on other lands of the defendant, they should have distinctly notified her, before her release, of their purchases, and cautioned, her against doing any act by which their rights might be diminished. Nothing less than this would prevent her from releasing the lien on a part of the lands, and holding it good on others.
