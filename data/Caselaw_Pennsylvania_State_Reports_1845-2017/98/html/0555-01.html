Irwin, by virtue of said warrant, proceeded to levy upon and sell at constable’s sale, on July 18th 1879, certain of the improvements on said premises, consisting of two houses, a large stable and other outbuildings, occupied by Becker.

    <p id="b574-6" data-blocks='[["BL_574.6",574,[296,523,1172,757]]]'>At the time of the forfeiture there were three distinct breaches of covenant on the part of the lessee. 1. The rent was in arrear; 2. The taxes were unpaid; and, ¿j. The lessee liad mortgaged his leasehold, which in law was equivalent to an assignment of it. Each of these breaches was a ground of forfeiture. When the distress was made for the rent the overdue taxes were not included in the landlord’s warrant., as they might have been, under the terms of the lease. Including the taxes in the warrant was optional, and their omission by the landlord deprived him of no right. If, at the time the-rent fell due, there were other breaches of covenant, he had the right to collect his rent by distress, and at the same time proceed to forfeit the lease for such breaches; otherwise he might lose his rent by reason of the forfeiture. This view renders it unnecessary to discuss the question how far the forfeiture could have been sustained under the circumstances had the non-payment of the rent been the only breach of covenant by the leasee.</p>

We need not speculate how far the proceedings were invalid as to him had he objected to them. But he has never made such objection, and is not now in court denying the regularity of the proceedings. The objection comes from a party who is a stranger to the transaction, and who has no equity to be heard. The mortgage upon the leasehold through which he claims title fell with the forfeiture. The creation of the mortgage was prohibited in substance by the lease, and was a ground of forfeiture. The lessee, having <em>no </em>right to assign his lease, could not do so indirectly by mortgaging it. As against the landlord the mortgage was a nullity, and it cannot be successfully set up as against the title acquired through the forfeiture and constable’s sale. That title is now in Louis Schafer as trustee for Mrs. Becker, who furnished the money out of her separate estate to pay the bid at the constable’s sale. The original lease was to Frederick Becker, her husband. It is not pretended that she <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>had any interest in this lease, and she certainly was not a party to it. It is true she joined in the mortgage of the lease, but that was merely through the ignorance or carelessness of the scrivener. The mortgage covered other property which admittedly belongs to Mrs. Becker, and her joining in the mortgage of the leasehold of her husband was simply, a blunder.
