In the former case the lien of the mortgage attaches, as a first lien, to the mortgagor’s purpart in severalty. In the latter case, I contend, the mortgage will continue to be the first lien on such an interest in the augmented purpart as will represent the mortgagor’s equal share, and a second lien on the excess ; and the owelty, which represents the purchase money of the excess parted with by the other co-tenants, will be a first lien on such excess, and a second lien on the original share. A sale under the mortgage passes only the original interest of the mortgagor, and of course the mortgage is entitled to be first satisfied out of the proceeds. But by the rule adopted by the court below the effect of an unequal partition is to convert the first lien of the mortgage on the original interest into a second lien on the whole acquired interest, subject to the owelty. As the mortgagee cannot be heard in the partition, the result is that, without a day in court, his first lien on the mortgagor’s original interest is taken away from him for the benefit of the parties credited with owelty in a partition had subsequent to the date of the mortgage. It is argued that the mortgagee of an undivided interest takes subject to the co-tenant’s right to a partition. True, but this right is to enforce a fair and equal partition of the land, or, if that cannot be made, to have it sold at public sale. No co-tenant can <em>compel </em>another to accept an augmented purpart at a valuation ; this is a privilege which one or more co-tenants may elect to accept; but, if such co-tenant has previously mortgaged his undivided interest, he has deprived himself of such privilege, unless his incumbrancer be secured. It is said a sale in partition would divest the mortgage : true, but such sale is a public sale at which the mortgagee may bid, and the lien is merely transferred to the fund; while the mortgagee can in no way protect himself against the selection by his mortgagor of an augmented purpart.</p>

Yet this is the equivalent of a selection by the mortgagor of an augmented purpart at a valuation subject to owelty. If each of two co-tenants mortgage his undivided interest, and in a subsequent partition A. takes the whole land at a valuation, the .mortgage given by B. would, according to the doctrine of the court below, be converted practically into a first lien on the whole land, and slipped under the other mortgage, as the owelty charged would be first applied to it and stand for its use. The anomalous result is reached of the lien of a first mortgage being opened up, <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>not only to let in a prior lien, but also to become a second lien on an after-acquired interest! But how? Land cannot pass as appurtenant to land; nor by virtue of warranty, nor by any doctrine of conversion or substitution. If the owelty be paid, the result would be to give the mortgagee a better security than he had before the partition, which is equally anomalous.

Nesmith, <a href="/watts/3/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Watts 314" data-case-ids="1841336" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0314-01">3 Watts 314</a>; Allen <em>v. </em>Reesor, 16 S. &amp; R. 10. The appellant claims that a sale under the mortgage passes only the mortgagor’s first estate, leaving the second still in the mortgagor subject to the owelty. But the purpart would then be held in common, undivided and indivisible, unless by some accident both titles should become united in the same person. The tenant entitled to owelty would have a lien on an uncertain interest, and if such interest were sold on the lien, the purchaser — whether the tenant or a stranger — would hold in common, and “partition” would be defeated. It is the right of partitioned to acquire their purpart in severalty. Where the purparts are unequal the interest represented by owelty is converted into personalty, and is a fixed lien on the-entire purpart; and one co-tenant cannot by mortgaging his interest or by any other act limit or take away the rights of the others : Diermond <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/yeates/2/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Yeates 324" data-case-ids="812679" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0324-01">2 Yeates 324</a>; Bavington v.

If the mortgagee had brought ejectment or foreclosed his mortgage before partition, and bought in the mortgagor’s undivided interest he would have held-it subject to partition, and subject to the lien of owelty that might be charged on his purpart. lie can be in no better position by waiting until after partition to foreclose. The allotment of a purpart in partition is not like the acquisition of a new and independent interest, as was the case in Eandell <em>v. </em>Mallett, cited by the other side.

If necessary to effect the legitimate purpose of partition, such a lien must yield some of its former binding force, and may even be wholly divested. Hence, notwithstanding the Act of 23d March 1867 declares that the lien of a first mortgage shall not be destroyed or in any way affected “ by any judicial or other sale whatsoever,” yet where after the commencement of proceedings in partition one of the co-tenants executed a first mortgage on his undivided interest, and the proceedings in partition resulted in a sale by the sheriff, it was held that the lien of the mortgage was thereby divested: Wright <em>v. </em>Vickers’ Adm’r, supra. The case was not ruled on the ground that the mortgage was executed during the pendency of the proceedings in partition; but on the broader ground of the paramount rights of tenants in common to make partition and to enjoy all the incidents • flowing therefrom. Section 38 of the Act of 29th March 1832, Pur. Big. 436, pi. 150, provides in case equal partition in value cannot be made, and the court orders the purparts to those entitled thereto, it shall award them “subject to <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>the payment of such sum or sums of money as shall be necessary to equalize the value of said purparts according to the said appraisement thereof.” The purpart of which the proceeds are now in contention, was so allotted “ subject to the payment as owelty in partition” of sums sufficient to equalize the valuation. The lien of the recognizance- then attached to the whole estate thus taken : Long <em>v. </em>Long, <a href="/watts/1/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 Watts 265" data-case-ids="1838033" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0265-01">1 Watts 265</a>; Cubbage <em>v. </em>Nesmith, 3 <a href="/watts/1/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Watts 265" data-case-ids="1838033" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0265-01">Id. 314</a>.</p>

The former are in the line of title, and must be looked for in the proceedings of partition; liens in the latter court are outside of the line of title. A judgment docket is required to be kept in the Common Pleas for the information of subsequent lien creditors’ and purchasers. None is required in the Orphans’ Court. To ascertain in regard to a lien there, the proceedings in partition must be examined: Riddle <em>&amp; </em>Pennock’s Appeal, <a href="/wright/1/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Wright 177" data-case-ids="625806" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0179-01">1 Wright 177</a>.</p>

Whether the tenant’s previous interest in the whole was large or small it matters not when he takes a purpart charged with owelty. He takes it as a whole. The recognizance to secure-the payment thereof- attaches to the whole. Why shall it not become the first lien thereon ? A co-tenant for whoso benefit the recognizance is taken, may be divested of his whole estate in all the land partitioned. His only security for payment is the recognizance. There is no line of separation or division running through a purpart by which it can be divided to apportion liens.</p>

Hence, although a previous lien on an undivided interest may, in form, be displaced by the lien of the owelty in partition, yet the effect is more imaginary than real. It will practically bind land of a value equal to that on which it was a lien before partition. The partition has added to the value of the estate of the tenant a sum equal to the amount of the owelty charged thereon.</p>
