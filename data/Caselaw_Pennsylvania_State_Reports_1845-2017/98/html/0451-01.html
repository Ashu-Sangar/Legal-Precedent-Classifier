If there was no actual agreement 'to submit the adjustment to Norris and Kriner, but they were employed to make an estimate as proof of loss, then the value put by them on the building is not conclusive, and the jury are at liberty to adjust this loss upon the proofs before them. The policy sued on was.concurrent with another of same amount. The defendant would be liable, therefore, in that event, for only half the actual loss incurred. For example: if the building was found to be worth $1,200 defendant would be liable for one-half 'that amount, and interest thereon.”</p>

Tins point called upon tbe court to lay down a rule to govern tbe jury in fixing tbe value of tbe building, and it should have been affirmed, Tbe answer neither affirms nor denies’ tbe point. In fact, it cannot be said to be responsive. We have no fault with that part of it which says: “If tbe jury find that there was actual submission of this loss to tbe determination of arbitrators, and sucli determination lias been made without fraud on tbe part of tbe plaintiff, or tbe arbitrators, or gross mistake, it is binding upon both parties.” After stating tbe converse of this proposition tbe learned judge said : “ Then tbe value put by them upon tbe building is not conclusive, and tbe jury are at liberty to adjust this loss upon tbe proofs before' them.” Put bow adjust tbe loss upon tbe proofs before them? It was just here tbe point was intended to indicate tbe rule, and tbe answer wholly fails to furnish it. This was error.</p>
