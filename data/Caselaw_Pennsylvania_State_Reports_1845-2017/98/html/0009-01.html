McGettrick. The real estate of the intestate was sold under an order of the Orphans’ Court of Lancaster county, by a trustee appointed for that purpose to distribute the proceeds. Before the auditor, the share of said <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>Eleanor J. McGettrick was claimed by one Robert Taylor, under a deed executed by her to him for her interest in the decedent’s real estate, duly recorded in Lancaster county. Eleanor J. McGettrick claimed the same share, and alleged that the said deed to Taylor had been procured by him from her by fraud at a time when she was incapable of executing a deed by reason of intoxication, and that it was without consideration. The auditor reported, as a fact, “ that the grantor was intoxicated when sho signed the deed, and for several months before.” Taylor objected to the jurisdiction of the auditor to inquire into the validity of the recorded deed, and contended that if the grantor desired to attack it, she must do so by proper proceeding in another Court. The auditor reported on this point as follows: “ The auditor has been unable to find a single case where this point arose. All the cases say that the validity of a judgment cannot be attacked before an auditor for the purposes of distribution, unless, perhaps, when collusion is alleged between the debtor and the creditor, and subsequent creditors will be defrauded, ... In the appeal of the Second National Bank of Titusville, <em>i </em>Norris 531. the Supreme Court say: <em>‘ </em>All the cases say that the mere fact that the debtor has been overreached, and a fraud perpetrated upon him by the creditor, gives no right to the other creditors to attack him collaterally'. . . . . In such cases the only person who can impeach the judgment is the defendant himself, <em>and this must be done by a motion in the proper Gourt to open it.’’</em>

But there is no analogy between a deed and a judgment. The fact that the deed was recorded in the recorder’s office does not make it a record in the sense that a judgment is a record. The Orphans’ Court has jurisdiction in the distribution of a decedent’s estate to ascertain the parties who are entitled to share therein. The power to decide all questions essential to distribution is incident to the power to distribute, and the validity of this deed was such a question. A deed <em>inter gya/rtes has </em>no more sanctity than any other contract under seal, 'and it may be impeached in any Court in which it is set up as evidence of a claim : Whiteside <em>v. </em>Whiteside, 8 Harris 474 ; Rice’s Appeal, 29 P.

The proceeding was in the nature of a bill in equity, not an audit for distribution. In McMurray and wife <em>v. </em>Davis, o W. N. C. 305, Dundas’s Appeal is commented upon, and it is there held that a bill in equity is the most appropriate remedy, if not the only one, in such a case as this. The contest here is not between an executor or administrator and a distributee; it is as to who owned an interest in certain land, and was entitled to the proceeds of the sale of it. The jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court by Act of June 16,1836, § 19, Purd. Dig. 1104, pi. 8, is extended to the partition of the real estate of intestates among the heirs; it is nowhere extended to the investigation into the validity of a deed executed by an heir to an outside party. None of the cases cited by the appellant decide that it is so extended. Rice’s Appeal, 29 P. F. Smith 182, and <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>Campbell’s Appeal, 30 Id. 315, are both cases in equity. It is settled that an auditor cannot inquire into the validity of a judgment, and we contend that, by analogy, he cannot set aside a deed. Such a result can only be obtained by a bill in equity in the Common Pleas, or if the Orphans’ Court has concurrent jurisdiction, by a formal proceeding by petition, answer, and proofs.</p>

    <p id="b26-7" data-blocks='[["BL_26.10",26,[296,870,1168,725]]]'>In this case the proceeds of the sale, under an order of the Orphans’ Court, of the real estate of an intestate, were in the hands of the trustee for distribution. One of the claimants to the fund was a niece of the intestate. Her share of the proceeds was claimed by the appellee, Robert Taylor, by virtue of a deed to him from the appellant for her interest in the lands sold. This deed was attacked as having been obtained fraudulently from the appellant and as being consequently void. The auditor held that he had no jurisdiction to inquire into the validity of the deed, and for that reason declined to consider the merits of the controversy, and awarded the share of the appellant to her grantee. On exceptions taken to this action of the auditor, an application was made to the Orphans’ Court for an issue to try the validity of the deed to Taylor, but the Court refused the issue, holding that the appellant was bound by the action-of the auditor, and that the latter had decided adversely to her claim.</p>
    <p id="b26-8" data-blocks='[["BL_26.11",26,[288,1594,1168,813]],["BL_27.1",27,[145,425,1168,430]]]'>We are of opinion that the auditor was mistaken in supposing he had no jurisdiction to inquire into the validity of the deed, and that the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court was in error in dismissing the appellant’s exceptions to the report of the auditor. It is, of course, undisputed that the Orphans’ Court has exclusive jurisdiction to distribute the estates of decedents among those entitled to them. Such distribution necessarily includes the power and the duty to ascertain the persons to whom distribution must be made. When the share of one who is apparently entitled is claimed by another, such claim must be established in the proceeding for distribution, and as it must be there established, so it may be there impugned. There is no occasion to resort to any other court, or to any other proceeding, to determine the validity of the claim, as the Orphans’ Court has full power and adequate procedure to dispose of the controversy. If a deed or other instrument is set up as a muniment of title for the interest of a distributee, an attack upon its validity is in no respect an impeachment of it in a collateral proceeding. A deed is not a proceeding nor the result of one. It <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>is not a judgment of a court, nor a decree of any species of tribunal. It is but an instrument <em>vni&amp;r partes, </em>and has no higher sanction than can be given to it by the act of the parties. As such it must abide the tests of all voluntary contracts. It is therefore as liable to impeachment as any other form of contractual relation, and is necessarily subject to be invalidated whenever it is proffered to a tribunal as a basis of a right. These considerations are fundamental, and the authorities which prove that the judgment of a Court cannot be impeached collaterally, and is therefore obligatory upon an auditor, have no application.</p>
