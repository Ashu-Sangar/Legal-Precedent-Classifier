A., B., aud several others signed a contract of subscription, whereby each agreed to advance a certain sum of money to a corporation to promote an industrial enterprise. The corporation contracted to repay the various advances as soon as possible, and undertook to pay to the various subscribers its entire income for the ensuing three years. A. paid the amount of his subscription. B. failed to do so. Subsequently the corporation passed a resolution abrogating the terms of the subscription, and in a few months failed. A. then brought an action against the corporation to recover the amount of his subscription, and obtained judgment. Subsequently he caused a writ of attachment execution to be issued upon said judgment, wherein B. was summoned as garnishee, but said writ was not issued until more than three years after the execution of the original contract of subscription. <em>Reid, </em>that B.’s contract was merely to loan money to the corporation upon the terms stipulated in the contract of <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>subscription, that those terms being abrogated, the corporation having failed, and the time within which it was implied that he was to loan the money having passed, the company had no semblance of right to force him U&gt; loan the money. <em>Held, </em>further, that A., standing in the shoes of the company, had no further or other rights than were possessed by it, and that the garnishee was therefore entitled to judgment.</p>

More was subscribed than was asked. Coleman and some others loaned the amounts they subscribed, but some of -the parties, including Nellis, neglected or refused to make the loan.</p>
    <p id="b483-8" data-blocks='[["BL_483.11",483,[166,1297,1173,1024]]]'>The subscription was a mutual agreement to loan money to the corporation, and was so understood and acted upon by all parties. The instant the money was advanced it became a debt of the corporation. "Whether the borrower had the right to pay it, or the lender to demand repayment, immediately, is immaterial in this action. Nor is the question in any way raised, whether a subscriber, who refused to make the loan, became liable for damages to the corporation, or to his co-subscribers. The contract was dated July 16th 1875, and within a year thereafter the company resolved to give its notes to all its creditors, discriminating in favor of those who had paid cash on the guaranty fund by contracting for a higher rate of interest. No subscriber was bound to loan on these terms. As early as March 1876, and before the date of that resolution, Coleman brought suit for the amount he had .loaned, declaring on oath it was a loan, and in due course of procedure recovered judgment. The company failed. After that resolution, and after its failure, the company had not a semblance of right to demand of a subscriber that he advance the money. But aside from the resolution and failure, if by the terms of the subscription it was implied that the loan should be for three years, that time had ended before this suit against Nellis. Under the uncontroverted facts the company could recover nothing on the contract for a loan. Its creditor, by attachment in execution, has no better right.</p>

There ■ was no <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>agreement betweeu the subscribers to pay, or to guarantee the payment of each other’s loans. Coleman did not promise to pay Nellis whatever sum he should loan to the company, nor did Nellis make such promise to Coleman. If this judgment stands Nellis will be compelled to pay another’s debt, although he in no wise became surety for it. Had Nellis made the loan he could have recovered judgment in like manner as Coleman did, and would have as good right to demand payment of Coleman, as Coleman has of him. Conceding the validity of the contract betweeu the corporation and Nellis, specific performaiice would not be decreed in equity, and at law the corporation could recover at most only nominal damages. Where two men agree' that each will loan a third a sum of money, aud one keeps and the other breaks his promise, no legal principle will enable the lender to compel the other promisor, as garnishee in an execution attachment, to pay what he had promised to loan to said third person.</p>
