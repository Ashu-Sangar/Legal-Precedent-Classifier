Subsequently A. brought suit against said bishop to recover damages for the injury done him by reason of the defendant’s action as above stated. On the trial of the cause the court, at the request of the plaintiff, coustrued the effect of the defendant’s letters, as explained by that of the plaintiff, saying that their effect was simply to remove the plaintiff from the care of his church, and to prohibit him from exercising priestly functions in W., but not to prohibit him from exercising piiestiy functions in the rest of the diocese. A verdict and judgment being rendered for defendant, and plaintiff having assigned the above construction of said letters for error, Held, that the construction was correct and did not constitute error.</p>

In the case above set forth, the court instructed the jury that the plaintiff had been removed by defendant from his charge, but that in order to enable him to recover damages they must be satisfied that said removal was uulawful and wrongful. The court then further left it to the jury to say whether or not the plaintiff had faithfully performed certain duties required of him by the law of the Boman Catholic Church, the principal of which wore the accurate keeping of accounts of church receipts and expenses, and the exhibition of the same at stated periods to the bishop. If plaintiff had not performed these duties then the court instructed the jury that his removal by the defendant was lawful and reasonable. Held, without deciding whether or not this instruction erred in the plaintiff’s favor, that it certainly did not constitute error of which he could take advantage.</p>

It is the duty of the court to construe matters of evidence which are in writing. This letter is the act of the bishop by which the plaintiff was removed from his office. The point we now have before us asks that the court shall construe it, without giving us any suggestion upon which branch of it they desire us to make the construction; but the point following, to which we will presently refer, presents their views in that respect. (The court here read the letter.) Now, we say to you, first, that this‘letter is a <em>onere </em>removal, and not a suspension. It also contains a prohibition against the person to whom it is addressed, forbidding him from exercising priestly functions m Williamsport. It makes no accusation of crime nor of moral fault. You will observe in the first sentence of the letter: ‘ Your administration of the affairs connected with the Clutrch of the Annunciation has been such,’ &amp;c.; it does not read: Your administration of the Church of the Annunciation <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>has been such ; but it is upon the administration of the <em>affairs connected with </em>the church — not the churchly duties themselves, but affairs connected, with them — which is the cause of his feeling “ compelled to remove,” not to suspend — -there is no such word here. Much discussion has been had before you in regard to the meaning of the words sub gram, as used here. The connection in which they occur is this : £ And I now forbid you to exercise any priestly function in Williamsport even to say mass. This prohibition;’ now the prohibition is something which has been prohibited or forbidden, and it therefore applies to the sentence immediately preceding, which forbids him to exercise any priestly function in Williamsport. £ This prohibition binds' <em>sub gram? </em>That is, you are to consider this a serious precept, a serious command, a grave command of your superior. If you violate this prohibition you will commit a grave offense. And you will observe that is the inference from it, and when we give the interpretation to this sentence, £ if you violate this prohibition you will commit a grave offense,’ you observe that those words apply then to something yet to take place. If you do hereafter disobey this order you will commit the offense. It does not and cannot be made to relate to the £ administration of the affairs connected with the Church of the Annunciation,’ as mentioned in the first part of the letter. It has nothing to do with that.</p>

Before the removal he could not go into another pastor’s church to officiate without an invitation so to do ; and nothing prevented him after his removal from accepting all such invitations outside of Williamsport. This not only courtesy but common decency demands, in all religious bodies. No priest or preacher thinks of going info another’s church to preach without an invitation. He has no right to do so. We think this the plain and sound interpretation of this letter, and that it is not a difficult one to understand' at all.] We think this is not only the plain interpretation of the words of the letter, but from subsequent acts it seems plain that such was the meaning intended by the person who wrote it, and, also, that that was what was understood by the person who received it. That such was meant by the bishop is made manifest by his subsequent treatment of Father Stack when he called <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>upon him ; and that such was understood to be the effect of the letter by Father Stack when he received it is manifest from the letter which he wrote to Father Keeper, four days later (Nov. 9th 1871), in which he says : ‘ Things have gone very well with me at headquarters. I have been treated kindly and considerately. The bishop says he will give me a mission of good income and free of debt.

He is not referring at all to his removal of the priest, but to his intended treatment of the congregation. This seems plain from the very reading of the letter itself. That he had an intention of doing this thing, and that Father Stack knew that he intended to do it, is manifested in the letter which Father Stack wrote to Father Keeper on the 9 th of November, four days afterwards, because, in that letter, in addition to what I have read, he also says: ‘Heholds to his in<a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>tention of punishing the Irish congregation of Williamsport — • says he will not send a priest there for some time.

That is the law. But we deem it necessary to say something to you in regard to the manner of arriving at the amount of damages, if you should find that this act was unlawful. You observe nothing is claimed here but actual damages. There is no claim made by way of vindictive damages for a malicious act. A full statement has been given to yon by the counsel- for the plaintiff, of the evidence covering the receipts of the church from the time Father Stack left it until the bringing of this suit. It is unnecessary for me to recapitulate it. A few general observations are, however, deemed necessary. The first is, if you find the act an unlawful one, in ascertaining the damages done by the removal of the priest from his office as pastor of this church, you are to remember that the priestly office is not an office held for profit or for the accumulation of gain. You are also to remember that the injury complained of here, the removal of the plaintiff; from his office, has not impaired his physical or mental pow'ers. As we remember the testimony of the witnesses, it was to the effect that the obligation of the priest bound him for life, and excluded him from occupation which -was denominated by the witnesses — I think by the plaintiff himself — as sordid trade, buying or selling; and there may be, therefore, kinds of employment which he might be engaged in which would not come under the head of sordid trade. After ascertaining this probable income, if he had continued in his office, you must then deduct a sum which would be equivalent to the probable earnings of the <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>plaintiff in such other employment as he is permitted to engage in — if you should find there are any — and which he might earn by a reasonable exercise of his physical and mental powers.”</p>

      <em>“ </em>Now, let us look at what the plaintiff was deprived of in this case. It is claimed that he was removed from his office as pastor of the Church of the Annunciation. The removal is admitted. Let us see what he was deprived of. ' <em>We </em>find in the evidence that the plaintiff was the pastor of the Church of the Annunciation, in Williamsport; that he had been placed there by the bishop of Philadelphia, and that, by the erection of the diocese of Scranton out of the territory which comprised the diocese of Philadelphia, he became subject to the bishop of the diocese of Scranton, who is this defendant. We also find that both the plaintiff and the defendant held office under the laws, customs and established usages of the Catholic Church in the United States at the time of the injury complained of. They were both equally bound by these laws when they took their offices, and they both agreed to obey these laws, and to conform to these usages. These laws and usages not only regulated their conduct in their respective offices, but also governed their official relations with each other. Now, the injury complained of here is one arising out of the conduct towards each other of the plaintiff md defendant as officers of the church. They were both bound to know the laws, customs and usages of .the church under which they accepted their offices. Each was bound to the church to perform all the material things required of him in his office, and each had agreed to submit to and be governed by these laws. Thus we find that the laws of the church must govern both the plaintiff and the defendant in their official action towards each other. They both consented and agreed to this. What title had the plaintiff to this office of which he has been deprived? Where did he get it ? How does lie hold it? We find that he was invested with priestly orders by the bishop of Philadelphia, and the obligations which he took at that time were read in your hearing. They bind liim for life under the promises of obedience and reverence to his bishop or ordinary. [Whatever <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>office he holds he got from the bishop, and he holds it subject to the will of the bishop. It was not an office of his own creation. He had not made it. He did not own it as we own other property. He was placed in possession of it subject to the will of the bishop who might be over him.] (13th assignment of error.) The plaintiff was bound to know the law and established usages of the church under which he held his office, and it was his duty to perform everything prescribed for him to do as a priest, and it was his duty to perform fully, as required by the laws of the church under which he was acting, all things required of him a; pastor of the particular church which he then occupied. What power had the bishop over this pastor, under the laws of the church? [We say to you that under the law of the church, governing both the plaintiff and the defendant, and governing their relations with each oilier, the bishop had not only the right, but it was his duty to remove the plaintiff for any cause which ■would be deemed sufficient to warrant such an act.] Put the bishop had no light to remove this plaintiff from any malevolent or capricious spirit; he had no right to exercise this power of removal without a reasonable cause. If the bishop removed the plaintiff in good faith, and for a reasonable cause, believing that it was for the best interests of the church or the good of the plaintiff that he should do so, then his act was not unlawful, nor was it wrongful. [We say to you as a matter of law that if the bishop removed the plaintiff for reasonable cause, and believed that the act was for the best interests of the church and the plaintiff, then this act of removal was not unlawful or wrongful, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action.] If the bishop did what was his duty in the premises, under the law of the church, and the circumstances of the case, he cannot be held responsible for the injury following from the lawful performance of his duty. Was there, then, any reasonable cause for this removal? That is finally the question which you are to determine as a question of fact. Did the plaintiff, Father Stack, perform all the material duties of the office from which he has been removed ? If he did, there could be no cause for his removal. Did the plaintiff neglect to perforin any of the material duties of his office? If he did, then were'they of such a character as would be deemed sufficient cause for his removal ? The principal allegation of neglect against the .plaintiff here is that he neglected or refused to keep proper memoranda or books of account of the doings in his pastorate; second, that he neglected or refused to make annual returns to the bishop of the transactions of his pastorate, especially as to the financial concerns thereof; and, third, that he did not confer with his bishop with regard to the amount of his own salary. Now, the matter of keeping <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>books and memoranda for tbe purpose of enabling tbe priest to make up his accounts, you are to understand as not including an intricate system of book-keeping. It is not expected that the priest should have a set of books such as a merchant would have. As you will see, all that is needed is the two sides, cash received and cash paid out; and you will see, also, that it requires no skill to keep such an account. All it requires is the ability to write and make figures.....</p>

It is not for you to say, nor is it for us to say, that these matters are of no importance. The only question is, are they required by the church ?

Now, did the plaintiff neglect and refuse to perform his duty ? It will be your duty to consider all the evidence in ascertaining and settling this question.

You have from him what kind of books or memo<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>randa lie kept of his accounts.

An example of the manner in which these accounts may be kept was introduced when Father Garvey was put upon the stand, and you see what a simple account it is. Did the plaintiff furnish annually to his bishop a statement of the transactions and of the financial condition of his pastorate ? Could he at any time have furnished such a statement as was required of him ? The bishop, in his testimony, says that he urged him over and over again, wrote to him time and time again, urging him to do his duty in this respect, and that he did not do so. Is there any denial of that evidence? [Is it true that the bishop urged him and repeatedly wrote to him for his statements, and is it true that he never sent them to the bishop, or that the bishop never received them ?

The bill, answer and evidence were all directed to one single question, viz., whether the summary removal of the plaintiff and the prohibition to exercise priestly functions in Williamsport, without regular accusation, hearing or trial, was unlawful; and the decree was explicit that it was unlawful.

There are some grounds, no doubt, on which a bishop may lawfully remove a priest from one pastorate to another ■without trial, and without reflection on his character: as for bodily illness, mental infirmity, blindness, etc.; but we assert that there is no law of the church nor law of the land, which authorizes a bishop to remove a priest from his pastorate for any cause affecting his character or involving a criminal offense, without a regular accusation, hearing, or trial. The real ground of removal here is shown by the evidence to be alleged mismanagement by Father Stack of the finances and the appropriation of funds of the church to his own use. The letter of removal, 'although ingeniously written, admits the cause of removal to be the plaintiff’s “ administration of the affairs connected with the church.”- Every one knew that this referred to the charge that Father Stack had been-receiving and retaining church funds, without accounting therefor. Under the laws of the church, a priest charged with a moral offense is entitled to a hearing before two priests and the bishop. Such a trial is a condition precedent to removal, or other punishment, and no demand by the priest is necessary. Hut here there was no hearing, no trial, no conviction, nothing but charges, followed by summary punishment. A priest’s profession is his property, and to deprive him of it arbitrarily is opposed to the law of the land as well as that of the church. It is said he was not deprived of his office, that lie is a priest still and will be until death. Admit it, but he is removed from his living annexed to his office, and prohibited from exercising priestly functions in his parish. He cannot intrude into another parish to officiate. This is virtually a <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>dismissal, and is at least a deprivation of property <em>pro tmito; </em>lie is entitled to be restored, if but for the purposes of trial: Kerr’s Appeal, 8 Norris 97, 112; Fields <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 Casey 178.</p>

Whereas, very often it has been called into doubt by some whether prelates of the church had power in these states of the Union to depute priests, send them into another part of their diocese for the purposes of the sacred ministry, and also recall them when they judge fit in the Lord, we admonish all priests who live in this diocese, whether ordained therein or admitted into the same, that, mindful of the promises that they have made at their ordination, they refuse not to attend any mission that shall be assigned them by their bishop, if the bishop judge i't sufficient for the decent sustenance of their livelihood, and consider also that that office be suitable to their strength and health. By this declaration, however, we wish to change nothing as to those priests who hold parochial benefices, of which one only, to wit, in the city of New Orleans, is as yet known to exist in this country.

The Fathers of this Plenary Council, however, are of the sentiment — their mind is — that gradually, and as far as circumstances will allow, our discipline in this matter may be conformed to the discipline of the universal church, or the universal discipline of the church.” “ We will, therefore, or wish that through all these provinces, especially in the larger cities where there are many churches, a district after the manner of a parish,, with accurately described limits, be assigned to each church, and that the rector thereof be accorded the right parochial, or <em>quasi </em>parochial rights.”</p>

But the law relating to such case throws no light on the question of the bishop’s power of removal. Nor do the laws respecting parish priests, in Catholic countries, control enactments made for the government of bishops and priests in this country. It is true, as the plaintiff contends, and for which he cites Dr. Smith’s Elements of Ecclesiastical Law, p. 381, that pastoi’s in the United States should not be dismissed from their parishes, <em>ratione crimmis, </em>save on regular trial; and no priest accused of an offense shall be punished save on regular trial. This has no bearing on the question of the bishop’s power of removal at his discretion. As quoted in the plaintiff’s own testimony, the same author, p. 170, § 401, says, “ Ecclesiastics Who are amovable at the will of the bishop may be, even against their will, dismissed .without such trial or sentence.” And p. 178, § 417, “ The following ecclesiastical office-holders, chiefly, are amovable at the nod of the bishop — at the bishop’s will; . . all pastors in this country, save one, perhaps, in New Orleans.” And p. 179, “ Again, bishops in this country do not, as a rule, remove pastors without sufficient reasons. Hence, in ease a pastor is removed <em>sine </em>causa, without at the same time being placed over another congregation of equal importance, he may have recourse to the superior for redress, since such removal would seem to be not only illicit, but invalid.” The author treats a dismissal, <em>ratione cri/irdnis, </em>as a very different thing from a removal for grave reason by the bishop, at his will.</p>

It is not alleged that such removal had been declared unlawful previous to the litigation between these parties.

And though it is said that the priest got his office from and holds it subject to the will of the bishop, and does not own it as other property, it is also said that both were bound to know the laws and established usages of the church which regulated their conduct in their respective offices and governed their official relations with each other.</p>

His profession is that of a priest in the church. He acquired it by compact. He holds it under a promise to obey the laws of the- church and the proper orders of the bishop. Were his contract void for its immorality or illegality, he could recover nothing for its breach. If illegal, he is neither entitled to restoration nor to damages for his removal. If legal, and his removal was authorized by the terms of the compact, no law of the land is violated. In this country the Church is completely separate from the State. Every church organization is voluntary on the part of its members, and the terms and conditions depend entirely upon its own rules. The profession of priest or minister in any denomination is taken subject to its laws. These he agrees to obey. If they become distasteful to him he can withdraw — no power can compel him to remain and perform his priestly functions; but if he violates the laws of his church, or disobeys the lawful commands made in accord with his compact, the civil courts will not maintain his footing in the church. If the <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>plaintiff was removed in accord with the law of the church he has no cause of complaint.

It is a universal rule of law, applicable not only to this subject, but to all subjects connected with legal administration, that one who becomes a member of any church or other society thereby consents to be governed by the rules, or laws, of such organization, and that he cannot justly claim to have suffered wrong or injury by the enforcement of such rules upon himself or his property, upon the maxim, <em>volenti non fit imjuria. </em>And this maxim applies to cases when the party voluntarily ¡alaces himself in a position ultimately to have an act done affecting his interests, or done at the will of another, as if he subjected himself directly and immediately to the act; upon the principle that one who puts the slowest agencies at work, which are sure in the end to produce a given result, is as truly the author of the ultimate result as if produced by ever so immediate and direct causes. 3. That the courts will not interfere with the internal police and discipline of churches or other voluntary societies, so long as they keep within the reasonable application of their own rules, which were known to the members, or might have been learned by them, upon reasonable inquiry, at the time of connecting themselves with the society or church.”</p>

He sought no redress under the law of his church, but at once resorted to the civil courts. Without saying that the court below erred in his favor — this question is not raised in the record — he was allowed the utmost latitude consistent with the religious liberty of the church. The Catholic priest is as much bound by the law of that church as is any Protestant preacher by ihe'law of his. A principle which would authorize the civil courts to interfere with the pastoral relations, or with the operation of church laws, or with the discipline of members, in one religious organization, would also in all. others. The church should be free to deal with its members, officers and ministers, according to its laws and established usages. It would be a grievous wrong to the church to rule that its priests and ministers are exempt from its proper discipline and authority because of their profession.

Did it make such accusations against the plaintiff as gave him the right to have these vague accusations defined, and tried upon full notice and hearing, and opportunity of defense?” All through the trial, and in the points he submitted, the plaintiff claimed it was the province of the court to <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>construe or interpret the letter; and we are of opinion that the interpretation was coi’rect. Little will be added to the remarks of the learned judge of the Common Picas. In reading the letter, the law of the church respecting removal should be kept in view. Removal should not be made but for grave and sufficient reason. If the bishop cannot refer to the unskillful or careless management of the affairs of the church, or other fault, which mars the priest’s usefulness in the congregation, without being held to the making of a criminal accusation, it were vain to enact that he may remove him, and to admonish that he do not remove without grave cause. The language of the letter implies bad administration of the affairs of the church. This is a grave cause, and could arise from one or more of many defects, in the priest not constituting an ecclesiastical offense. Sufficient reason -may exist calling for removal where there is none for accusation and trial, or for suspension. In plain terms, the plaintiff was removed, and forbidden to exercise any priestly functions in Williamsport. This prohibition did not extend elsewhere, and the simplest rule of interpretation limits its operation to the place that is named, leaving him in possession of his priestly faculties, with liberty to exercise'them in other places in’ like manner as any other unemployed priest. The church was located in Williamsport and embraced the English speaking or “Non-Gennan Catholics ” of Williamsport — the only other Catholic Church in that place being the German — ■ and the prohibition was cdmplete as to Williamsport. To have made it less extensive would have left an open door for its evasion. The words “ <em>sub gravi </em>” relate to the prohibition, and if they mean all that the plaintiff says they do, he would suffer nothing because of them so long as he should keep the promise made at his ordination. It was unnecessary to assign a cause for the removal; the letter contains no accusation of crime, or of moral fault, yet states the grave reason. Rut if the words admit equally well of two constructions, one in accord with the lawfulness of the accompanying act, and the other opposed, they shall be taken in the sense which so accords; for it will not be presumed that a man intends to give a bad reason for a lawful act, thereby vitiating the act itself.</p>

Within four days thereafter the plaintiff called on the defendant at Scranton, and from there wrote to Rev. J. Kœper, pastor of the German Catholic Church in Williamsport : “ The bishop says he will give me a mission of good income and free of debt. He thinks, very properly, that I do not relish the idea of paying off debts, or engaging myself with <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>brick and. mortar. . . He holds to his intention of punishing the Irish congregation of Williamsport; says he will not send a priest there for some time. On reflection J. think this course may prove beneficial. I intend going to Friendsville with Slattery for Sunday, and preaching for the natives.” This is convincing that the plaintiff knew he was simply removed and that he still possessed his priestly faculties, 'with liberty to exercise them outside Williamsport wherever invited. He thought it might prove beneficial to punish the Irish congregation, and concedes that he did not relish paying off debts or engaging with brick and mortar. He was promised and was willing to accept another mission. Although smarting under his removal, he then felt no sting of an accusation for an alleged offense, nor did he claim a trial, nor did he think the removal unlawful based on the ground that he so disrelished paying debts that he had not well administered the affairs of the church. His own testimony reveals that he afterwards refused a mission because he thought it not good enough, and then it entered his mind to contest the removal — not by recourse to. the bishop’s superior — ■ but in the civil courts.</p>

It was said, in Byrnes’ Admrs. <em>v. </em>Stewart’s Admrs., 3 Desanssure 478, “It cannot be doubted that a man’s trade or profession is his property.” That a Roman Catholic priest has a right of property in his profession is distinctly affirmed in Cummings <em>v. </em>State of Missouri, 4 Wallace 277. A section of the new constitution which operated as a bill of attainder against him was therefore held to be in conflict with the constitution of the United States. The right of property in a profession was recently affirmed in the case of Steinman and JBLensel, members of the Lancaster bar.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> The property of a priest of the Church of Rome in his profession, is of especial value to him, inasmuch as being once ordained as such his obligation is to serve in the priesthood for life, and it is declared in the English edition of the Council of Trent, page 175, that “ it beseems not those who are enrolled in the divine ministry to beg or exercise any sordid trade to the disgrace of their order.” Once a priest, then as long as he remains true to his church, his main temporal property is his profession.</p>

This is clearly an after-thought. It was addressed to him alone. The complaint was of his administration only. lie alone was forbidden to exercise priestly functions. The <em>sub gram </em>bound him alone. The name of the congregation was not mentioned. Still further, in paragraph YI. of the bishop’s answer under oath to the bill in equity, he “ denies that it was his intention, either expressed or implied in said letter of removal, to close the said church against the contributors, pew-holders and congregation.”</p>

It contained no words of Christian counsel or advice. It is true, it gave the disgraced priest the liberty of calling on the bishop, who promised to inform him of his further intention.</p>

As we said before, Mr. Stack “ was not only deprived of his right of property as pastor of that particular church; but he was also prohibited from exercising any priestly functions as a means of support elsewhere. The literal reading of the order forbade the exercise of such functions in Williamsport. Inasmuch, however, as he had been assigned to no other parish, the effect was to close the door of every parish against him.”</p>

O’Hara’s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>But when the attempted removal is under circumstances reflecting on the priest’s character and affecting his property in his profession, he is entitled to notice of the specific cause of complaint, and to an opportunity for refuting the charge. Without such notice, the removal is wrongful. The Minister of St. Mark’s Evangelical Church of Butler <em>v. </em>Kopp, not reported; McAuley’s Appeal, 27 P. F.

In the full answer of the bishop he does not deny this averment, nor does he charge any spiritual or temporal maladministration. In paragraph VII. of his answer he avers, <em>inter alia, </em>“that the said letter of removal and the removal in fact of the said complainant from his charge was not' of the nature of ecclesiastical censure or punishment.” He further proceeds to deny that the removal is unwarranted by the law of the Catholic Church or is contrary to the law of the land, and avers the act was one of ecclesiastical discipline authorized by the church, and “ not within the jurisdiction of civil authority.” This last averment sharply presents the real issue in the case. It .is useless by any ingenious argument to cover it up or to avoid it. Are the civil courts powerless to intervene to protect rights of property when an attempt is made by any church organization, to strike them down?</p>

We affirmed the decree, thereby subjecting him to costs as fully as the court imposed them on him. If he has succeeded in the present case in showing that in fact cause for dismissal or removal did exist, although not previously charged, it should go in mitigation pnly of damages and not so operate as to bar the right of action. The evidence of an intention to transfer the plaintiff to another parish is very meager and unsatisfactory. The one he named was not vacant; besides, the congregation there was so small that to accept it, if not filled, would have been understood by the entire priesthood as a species of degradation and punishment. When this idea was stated by the plaintiff to the bishop, the latter answered he deserved the punishment, “ because you are too proud.” This was an admission of an intention to punish the plaintiff, not for any of the causes alleged on the trial, but by reason of his being proud only.</p>

When no other place is provided for him he is simply dispossessed. The plaintiff was upt only dispossessed; but the strong sentiment and power of the church barred the door of every other church against him. We would sustain the 11th, 12th, 18th, 14th and 15th assignments, and such parts of the others as are in conflict with this opinion. The affirmance of this judgment is fraught with mischief that strikes at the very foundation of our civil government. It is the recognition of an authority as superior to the organic law of the land.
