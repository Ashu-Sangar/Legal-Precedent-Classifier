The .court professed to act under the Act of May 1st 1861, P. L. 680. But that act by its terms applies-only to cases where an executor, <em>after </em>the grant of letters testamentary to him, “ is wasting or mismanaging the estate <em>under his </em>charge, or when, for any reason, the interests of the estate or property are likely to be jeoparded by the <em>continucmce </em>of any such executor,” &amp;c. In such casos the court may either require security or vacate the letters, but there is no authority in this or in any other act to require security in advance. Parsons’ Appeal, 1 Norris 465. The court based its action on the statement that Louis was a “ non-resident,” and a man of no estate. But he was not a nonresident of the state, he lived in Philadelphia; and a residence in anotner county was no bar to his qualifying as executor.- The <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>testatrix exercised her legal right to appoint him an executor, and whether he has any estate other than that devised to him, or not, is immaterial.

Now, suppose a case where the executor named in the will is notoriously a rascal, must the court award him letters testamentary to enable him to obtain possession of the estate, and then wait' until it is “ being mismanaged,” and, perhaps, wholly carried off, before it can require security or vacate the letters ? This case is hardly less strong. The testatrix made her will in 1873, and circn instances changed before she died in 1879. The testimony showed that Louis failed ; had judgments entered against him, which have never been paid; that he embezzled money in a position of trust; that his mother lost all confidence in him, and said she intended to die intestate; that in 1874 he wrote to her: “ I will return you the will left with me, as it is not worth the paper it is written on; you know the divine contempt I have for all my kindred.” The facts would have justified his dismissal as executor, and the court acted leniently in merely demanding security. In Pipers Appeal, 8 Harris 67, a trustee was dismissed before he had entered on his duties. The proceedings in that case were under the Act of June 14th 1836, which is similar to the Act of 1861. The facts in this case are stronger than in Kellberg’s Appeal, 5 Norris 129; McKennanUy.
