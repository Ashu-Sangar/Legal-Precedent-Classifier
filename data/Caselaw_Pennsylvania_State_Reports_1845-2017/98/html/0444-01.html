The minutes of this meeting, as printed in the evidence, did not show that the board then adjourned to meet at any time certain, nor did it appear Avhether any meeting was held between June 2d and September 2d, 1879, nor that any standing regulations existed for periodical stated meetings. The meeting of September 2d adjourned to meet on Tuesday evening, September 15th at School House No. 1, at which time and place no one appeared except Roache, who adjourned the board “until Thursday evening at six o’clock in m. at No. 1 School House.” On the following Thursday evening, September 18th, Roache appeared alone and again adjourned till Tuesday evening September 23rd at six o’clock at the same place. It did not appear that the other directors had any notice of these adjournments, although they were regularly entered on the minutes. On the last named evening, Roache was the only one that appeared, when he proceeded to fill vacancies by declaring Thomas Maxwell’s seat vacant, he having been absent from more than' two preceding meetings, and appointed Laurence Moran in his place. Roache and Moran then appointed Thomas Burns to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Leach (who had resigned and moved from the district); they then adjourned to Wednesday evening, the 24th, at 7 p. m., ail of which proceedings were entered on the minute book. The old board having no notice of this meeting, Burns, L. Moran and Roache met and declared the seats of Thomas M. O’Donnell, Thomas T. O’Donnell and John M. Moran, vacant, for absence from four regular meetings, and appointed Michael McNulty, Patrick O’Donnell and Francis Luddon in their places. Ón {September 26th, the new board — so called — met and transacted some business, and again, on October 4th following, Lawrence Moran, Thomas Burns, Iieury Roache and John M.

O’Donnell by vote reinstated, which proceeding was afterward “ cancelled by order of the board.” From that time until June 1st 1880, both boards of school <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>directors claimed each to be the acting board, and each held their meetings and kept their separate records.</p>

    <p id="b463-7" data-blocks='[["BL_463.7",463,[169,1150,1164,87]]]'>In the face of such facts as these, it is too clear for argument, that the plaintiff had no case.</p>

If the assumption of the plaintiff be correct, then might there be any number of school boards, acting for a district whose contracts would, as to third persons, be good and binding, and their powers to involve the district in debt and confusion could only be determined by a judgment on a writ of quo warranto ; but it certainly requires no serious argument to prove the unsoundness of a doctrine such as this.</p>
    <p id="b463-9" data-blocks='[["BL_463.9",463,[156,1875,1174,512]],["BL_464.1",464,[313,450,1174,132]]]'>The position in fact is, that any half dozen men may, without warrant of law, assume the rights and duties of the legally constituted and acting board of directors, and make contracts by .which the district must be bound. This assumption, however, is so unreasonable that it cannot be’law. But’here are two de facto boards; the one has made a contract with the plaintiff,the other has notified her that it has repudiated that contract; that it is null and void for want of authority in those making it. How is a question of this kind to be determined without determining the legal right of the two boards ? And suppose, for instance, that each board had employed a different teacher to occupy the same school house. How then ? Could both contracts <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>be enforced against the school district? Certainly not. It would then be, as it now is, a question as to which of these' boards had the power to contract for the services of a teacher.</p>
    <p id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[313,579,1166,172]]]'>The next question is, had Henry Roache, under the circumstances, the power to declare and fill vacancies ?

    <p id="b464-7" data-blocks='[["BL_464.7",464,[309,748,1177,769]]]'>The board had been regularly adjourned from the 2d to the 15th of September, to meet at School House No. 1. At that time and place, none of the directors were present, except Henry Roache, who took it upon himself to adjourn the meeting until the succeeding Thursday evening, at which time, no other members of the board being present, and probably, for the very good reason that they had no notice of the time and place appointed for it, he again adjourned until the 23d inst. At this time, again finding himself the only one of the directors present, he declared' the seat of Thomas Maxwell vacant and appointed Lawrence L. Moran to till his place. Now the Act of May 8th 1854 thus provides : “ If any person, having taken on himself the duties of his office as director, shall neglect to attend any two regular meetings of the board in succession, unless detained by sickness or prevented by absence from the district, or to act in his official capacity when in attendance, the directors present shall have power to declare his seat in the board vacant, and to appoint another in his stead to serve until the next regular election.”</p>

It is only where a director has neglected to attend two successive regular, or as defined in Zulich <em>v. </em>Bowman, 6 Wr. 83, stated, meetings of the directors, that his seat can be declared vacant. It is true, that the Act of 1862 provides that if there are no standing regulations for periodical meetings, in that case <em>“ </em>every meeting held in succession, from the first meeting held for organization, by adjournment to a time and place certain, and so entered on the minutes,” shall be regarded as a regular meeting. But, unfortunately for the plaintiff’s case, it does not appear by the minutes that there was any adjournment of the meeting for organization, on the 2d of June, to the 2d of September. It follows, that as this meeting was not a regular meeting, within the meaning of the Act of 1862, neither, under the ruling in the case above cited, were the adjourned meetings of September 15th, 18th and 23d, regular meetings. As we are thus thrown back upon the Act of 1854, <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>it is clear that tlie appointments of Poaehe and his appointees were without authority and void.</p>

After a good deal of hesitation we have come to the conclusion that, all other things being regular, the resolution would be.good and binding upon the district. The minutes show that at that meeting, four directors, Burns, McNulty and the two Poaches were pi’esent, and it further appears, by the same minutes, that the resolution passed unanimously; in other words, by the affirmative vote of every member present. This, according to the ruling in Tobin <em>v. </em>Morgan, 20 P. F. Smith 229, was a substantial compliance with the fourth section of the Act of April 11th 1862.</p>
