Shortly after his death the register granted letters of administration to Mrs. Brubaker, the elder daughter. Mrs. Wolf thereupon presented her petition to the register, setting forth that the letters had been granted to Mrs. Brubaker without the petitioner’s knowledge or consent, and contrary to the assurance of the deputy register, that, although no caveat was filed, letters should not be granted to either until both had been heard; that Mrs. Brubaker being confined to her resi-. deuce by illness, the petitioner agreed with her that nothing should be done until her recovery, but that at Mrs. Brubaker’s request the deputy register visited her at her house, and there <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>privately administered tlie affirmation and issued the letters. The petitioner averred that she had an equal right to administration with her sister, and prayed to be joined with the latter in the administration.</p>

Depositions were taken under a rule to show cause, which in part sustained the allegations of the petition, and after argument the Court (Patterson, J.) filed an opinion in which he said: “ The Act of March 15th 1832, directs that, after the widow, letters shall be granted to such of the intestate’s kindred as may be entitled to the residue of his personal estate, preferring' always such as are in the nearest degree of consanguinity. These two, the only children, and sisters, are equally entitled to share the decedent’s personal and real estate, and are equally near in degree of consanguinity to the intestate. Would not, then, the granting of letters of administration to this appellant (Mrs. Wolf) only put both sisters on a perfect equality <em>% . . . </em>Put the Court does not feel at liberty to enjoin a joint administration between these sisters; indeed, the prevailing rule is, not to force a joint administration on unwilling parties.</p>

The register himself could not revoke his action except for cause: Sliomo’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 356; Hood on Executors 64, 467; Toller on Executors 89; 1 Williams on Executors 371. The Court acknowledged that a joint administration by the sisters would be improper under the circumstances, and to escape that fell into the more serious error of awarding a separate administration to each, for which there is no warrant in law.</p>

The letters to Mrs. Brubaker were obtained by a trick, in violation of an understanding that nothing should be done until both should be heard by the register. Courts will not encourage indecent haste in securing administration by such means. As the two daughters are the only persons interested in the estate, no injustice can arise from the fact that letters were issued to each, instead of to them jointly. Such is the practice in England, and our statute does not forbid it.</p>

Ten days after his decease letters of administration on his estate were duly granted by the register to Mrs. Brubaker, the elder daughter; and on September 2d the petition of the younger daughter and her husband was presented, praying that she be joined with her sister in the administration already granted. This application was refused by the register, and thereupon the petitioners appealed from his decision to the Orphans’ Court, and a rule, with notice to Mi’s. Brubaker, was granted, to show causo why Mrs. Wolf should not be joined in the administration. Under this rule depositions were taken by both parties, and tlie Court, after hearing, on January 29th 1881, made a decree sustaining tbe appeal, and ordering letters of administration to be issued to Mrs. Wolf “ on her father’s estate, upon her entering good and sufficient security with the register for the faithful performance of her duties as administratrix, providing her husband’s assent is obtained ; which assent will be evidenced by his joining in the administration bond.”</p>
    <p id="b37-8" data-blocks='[["BL_37.10",37,[173,1871,1163,171]]]'>It is contended that the Court erred in thus ordering letters of administration to be issued to Mrs. Wolf, and in forcing a joint administration, against the consent of Mrs. Brubaker, to whom letters had been previously granted.</p>

But tlie C'ourt does not feel at liberty to enjoin a joint administration between these sisters ; indeed, the prevailing rule is not to enforce a joint administration on unwilling parties.”</p>
    <p id="b38-6" data-blocks='[["BL_38.6",38,[281,587,1169,886]]]'>It is very evident from this that the Court recognized the impropriety of attempting to create a joint administration against the protest of one of the parties thereto. The nature of the oflice forbids it. Joint administration necessarily involves joint liability, and no one can be compelled to assume such responsibility. Due regard to individual rights, as well as the interest of the estate, require that administration should not be committed to two or more persons unless they mutually agree to accept the trust. Nor does the decree in this ease require joint administration. If it did, it would be manifestly wrong; but its effect is to create two separate, co-ordinate administrations on the'same estate, and for that reason it is equally objectionable. Such a thing is unknown to our jurisprudence, even in theory, and in practice it would be entirely impracticable. Under the English statute, the Crdinary may commit the administration to the widow and next of kin jointly, or he may grant to one exclusive administration of a particular portion of the goods of the intestate, and to the other a separate administration of the residue; but no warrant for any such practice as that contemplated by the decree of the Orphans’ Court can be found in our statute.</p>
    <p id="b38-7" data-blocks='[["BL_38.7",38,[272,1482,1166,899]],["BL_39.1",39,[150,420,1167,684]]]'>When the class primarily entitled to administration consists of several persons, it is the duty of the register to grant letters to such one or more of them as he shall judge will best administer the estate. lie may thus grant letters to them all jointly, if they so desire; or, in liis discretion, he may select one of them and commit the administration to him alone, to the exclusion of the others; and, when properly exercised, his discretion is not the subject of review either in the Orphans’ Court or here. lie is not bound to select the oldest in preference to the youngest of the class entitled to administration. Primogeniture gives no right of preference, so as to weigh against the wish of the majority of interests; yet, if things are precisely equal — if the scale is exactly poised — being the elder brother would indine the balance: Hood on Executors G4; 1 Williams on Executors 427. And the same principle applies to the elder of two sisters. In Shomo’s Appeal, 7 P. E. Smith 35G, it is said that among children the right does not depend on seniority ; it is entirely in the discretion of the register; but when he has exercised his discretion by selecting one of the sons, it is no longer in his power to revoke the letters elms granted and issue them to another, except for sufficient <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>cause. <em>“ </em>Wlieu administration lias been committed to any of the next of kin, others, even in the same degree of kindred, have, during the life of the administrator, no title' to a similar grantHood on Executors, 64. In the case before us the two daughters of the intestate were equally competent to administer, and the register might have granted letters to both jointly if they liad so desired; but he was not bound to do so. In the exercise of his discretion he selected Mrs. Brubaker, who requested that letters should be issued to herself alone. Having done so, it was not in his power to revoke the letters thus granted, or to join the younger sister in the administration against the will of the other. Nor is there 'anything in the circumstances, as disclosed by the testimony, to justify the Court in reversing the decision of the register, and creating a dual adminfetration, which, if it could be permitted to stand, would undoubtedly be prejudicial to the interests of the estate.</p>
