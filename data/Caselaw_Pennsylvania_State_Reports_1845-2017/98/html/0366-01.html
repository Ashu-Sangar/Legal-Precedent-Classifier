If the assessment on the seated list by Kramer of seven hundred and thirty-five acres, included this land in dispute, and you find from the evidence that the taxes of 1862 and 1863 were paid before the 13th June 1864, then the land would be discharged from taxes, and the sale would give no title.

To show that the number of acres named in the assessment exceeded or fell short of the actual number within said bounds, by no means determines the question. If the quantity in the assessment was too great it does not follow that the disputed laud was included ; nor if not enough, that it was excluded. The quantity returned and assessed would be a fact to consider in ascertaining if the land in dispute was a part of the tract assessed. The defendants claim their tract extended to No. 1434, and that No. 1434 is east of the land in suit.</p>
