All of the stock was held, and the stockholders resided, in the state of New Jersey. The steam ferry-boats were all registered there under the laws of the United States; lay there at all times except when engaged in navigation; the company had its wharf there, as also its business office, and there its officers and men resided. It had no other connection with Pennsylvania except a wharf or slip rented in the city, where it landed and received its freight and passengers.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b122-8" data-blocks='[["BL_122.7",122,[279,1361,1176,896]]]'>It is conceded by the attorney-general on the argument that there was none prior to that on the 1st day of May 1868, the 4th section of which, it is contended, enabled the officers to impose a tax under these words: “That the capital stock of all companies whatever, incorporated by or under any law of this Commonwealth, or incorporated by any other state and lawfully doing business in this Commonwealth, shall be subject to pay a tax into the treasury of the Commonwealth annually, at the rate of one half mill for each one per cent, of dividend made or declared by such company; and in case of no dividend being made or declared by such company, then three mills upon a valuation of the capital stock of the same, made in accordance with the 2d section of this act.” That valuation was to be made under oath by the officers of the company, and if the state officers were dissatisfied with the valuation, then to be made by themselves. Was this New Jersey corporation doing' business in this state according to the meaning and intention of that statute ? Was it subject to a taxation on the whole value of its capital stock as 'imposed? If not on the whole, on what part ? Was the defendant exempt from taxation on the ground of trade and commerce between the states ?</p>

Its boats stopped at a wharf or slip daily, in landing its freight and passengers. For the <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>most part passengers stopped on and off at that point. The company had no office and owned no land. Did the legislature intend by such a transaction of business that this company should be taxed on its whole capital stock, or even on the half of it? For, if it can be taxed on the half, it can on the whole. If the Northwestern Railroad, with a capital of forty millions, incorporated under the laws of Illinois or Wisconsin, should occasionally land a car-load of grain in Pennsylvania, our officers could lawfully tax it at the rate of three mills on its whole capital stock,' although there was not a dollar of its stock held in this state, nor any of its stockholders residing here, or any office or warehouse opened within our borders. With quite as much plausibility could the whole stock of the Erie Railway be taxed in Pennsylvania, because that road passed through twenty-six miles of our territory, or the wdiole stock of the Lake Shore and New York Central, including the Lake Shore road from the city of New York to Chicago, be taxed because the road ran through the triangle. Such a system of taxation was never practiced in Pennsylvania. We tax in proportion to the capital employed or ground used in our state, not in proportion to the whole capital stock. Some appraisement is always made, and regard had to the use made of the occupancy. Rut it is urged that one-half of the river ferried over belongs to Pennsylvania. The river is one of the great highways of nature, and no state has a right to the water. Any state, or the nation at large, has an equal right of navigation. No one can claim an exclusive right. Vessels from Maryland or Virginia have an equal right to sail on its waters with Pennsylvania or Jersey, even to the margin of low water. We are referred by the attorney-general to the case of the Trenton, Delaware, Bridge Company, reported in 9 Am. Law Register, (O. S.) 298, to show that this company can be taxed to the value of one-half of its capital. We are unable to see the slightest analogy between the cases. That company was incorporated by both states; the bridge was authorized by both; it was a permanent and solid structure, erected equally over the so.il of each, and although the most of the stock may have been held, in New Jersey, that was unimportant. The structure was on the territory of each, and this state would have the same right to tax that part within her borders that she would. a tract of land improved by New Jersey capital. The mere right of navigation over public waters is different from building permanent structures by authority of our laws. New Jersey neither asked nor was required to ask for leave to navigate the river, nor had it any neeessity to ask for leave to land its <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>passengers. 'It liad that right by the comity of nations and the navigation laws, and our state could not prohibit it.</p>

Here it has none over either. How can it tax the stock ? It has no jurisdiction over it, as it is nowise held in this state. The legislature might impose a tax on wharfs, ships, &amp;c., but it probably never has, and if it might so do, or has so done, this tax has not been so imposed. It would be by valuation, or by the trip, and it is held that it may charge for the use of wharfs, &amp;c., a reasonable sum, hut not by the tonnage of the vessel: 20 Wallace 577, 582. And ships may be taxed to the owner, like other property, at his residence: 9 Otto, 283-4. These vessels are all registered at their port in New Jersey, where the owners and masters reside, and it is clearly settled that they cannot be taxed by reason of going into, landing or trading in any other port in the United States; therefore where a vessel was registered in New York it could not be taxed for trading in Mobile, or any of the ports of California or Oregon: Hays <em>v. </em>Steamship Company, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20Howard%20596" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="17 Howard 596">17 Howard 596</a>; 23 New York 227. It would interfere with the commerce of the states if the vessel could be taxed at every port where it landed : 16 Wallace 475. The property is there for a temporary purpose, and does not become incorporated with that of the state: Idem. 476. And touching at a port, and trading there, did not render the vessel liable to be taxed there: Idem. 478-9. Congress has the power to regulate the commerce of the country, and the states cannot impose a tax on it otherwise or greater than that imposed by congress, nor can the effect be changed by changing the name, or taxing the occuS/tion of the master. Per Grier , J., in the Passenger Cases, 7 oward 458. The state cannot tax the landing of passengers: Idem. Onr state can neither tax nor prohibit this New Jersey corporation from landing its passengers in this state, for if we can tax we can prohibit, as was declared by Chief Justice Marshall in several of the early cases, and the principle is fully recognized in Crandall <em>v. </em>State of Nevada, 6 Wallace 35. The state cannot change the effect by taxing the bill of lading instead of the registered vessel, or its freight: Almy <em>v. </em>State of California, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20Howard%20169" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="24 Howard 169">24 Howard, 169</a>. All taxation must relate and be limited to persons, property or business within the state, all must apply to one or the other: 15 Wallace 300. In the present case our state cannot lawfully impose this tax; it is not on the person or property, all of which is situated in New Jersey ; nor can it on the business, for that is protected for the benefit of trade, there being none other conducted than the landing and receiving of passengers. This is part of the com<a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>merce of the country. The passengers are secured in going and coining by the federal constitution, nor can these principles be evaded by attempting to impose the tax on the stock of the company ; it is a mere change of name and cannot change the effect. We are, therefore, clearly of opinion that the whole of this tax is illegal and assessed without authority, and even if our statute would bear the construction put on it by the state officers it would be in violation of the laws and Constitution of. the United States.</p>

It is not within the <em>power </em>of the legislature of this commonwealth to tax the defendant in error under the circumstances set forth in the case stated. The right to tax must rest upon protection of persons or property. In this case, no such protection has been afforded. This state has no legal right to stop such ferriage. The right of navigating the navigable rivers of the United States belongs to all its'citizens. Whilst a state may refuse to permit a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, when it can only be done through its comity, it is powerless to prevent the citizens of any other state (and corporations may be such) from doing what is lawful for them to do by reason of their citizenship. As was said in Crandall <em>v. </em>Nevada, <a href="/us/73/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="6 Wall. 35" data-case-ids="3453960" data-case-paths="/us/73/0035-01">6 Wall. 35</a>, “a tax imposed by a state for entering its territory or harbors, is inconsistent with the rights which belong to citizens of other states as members of the Union.” The citizens of New Jersey have a right to be transported to Pennsjdvania across the river Delaware, and it is not competent for the legislature of the latter state to prevent them, by forbidding the masters of the vessels conveying them to land, or by imposing a prohibitory tax as a condition precedent.</p>

Besides this, in all of said cases, the tax was, in substance, upon the capital actually employed within the taxing state. In Hays <em>v. </em>S. S.

If any state possesses a power to prevent the landing of vessels, why may it not compel, as a condition of such landing, the duty of paying a tax upon the vessel so landing ? If it is illegal to do this, can it be less so to tax the whole capital of the corporation as a condition of such right ?</p>

The answer is, at Gloucester and Philadelphia. Its whole income was derived from the transportation of freight and passengers from its wharf at Gloucester to its wharf at Philadelphia, and from its wharf in Philadelphia to its wharf in Gloucester. At each of these points it had a place, that is, a wharf, where its main business, namely, its receipt of freight and passengers, was transacted, and, for that business, it was just as much dependent upon the one place as upon the other. Again, a wharf, or landing-place, was necessary at each end of its route ; the one it occupied at Gloucester was owned in fee, and the one in Philadelphia it held under a lease, but as it could hold by purchase, in New Jersey, only by virtue of the power derived from the statutory will of the legislature of that state, so it could hold by lease in Philadelphia only by the implied consent of the legislature of this Commonwealth.

The subject-matter of the proposed taxation is capital stock of a foreign corporation. The corporation defendant is established and exists by the law of New Jersey. Its entire capital is there held by persons who reside in that state. Its place of business, its officers and all its property are within that jurisdiction. It has never received, or claimed, the benefit of any legislation of this Commonwealth. Have we the right in these circumstances to tax its capital stock ? In the case of the State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds, <a href="/us/82/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="15 Wall. 300" data-case-ids="3424279" data-case-paths="/us/82/0300-01">15 Wall. 300</a>, it was held that <em>“ </em>the power of taxation, however vast in its character and searching in its extent, is necessarily limited to subjects within the' jurisdiction of the state. These subjects are persons, property and business. Whatever form taxation may assume, whether as duties, imposts, excises or licenses, it must relate to one of these subjects. It is not possible to conceive of any other, though,' as applied to them, the taxation may be exercised in a great variety of ways.” Now in the present case the proposed tax is levied upon a form of property — capital stock. It is not a tax upon persons, natural or artificial. It is not, specifically, a tax upon business. By the case stated it is declared that it is a tax upon the capital stock of the corporation defendant, and it is agreed that if the court shall be of opinion that the defendant is not liable to pay a tax on its capital stock judgment shall be entered in its favor. In view 'of these consiclerations the question recurs, how can this tax be sustained? It is directly and speeifi- • cally a tax upon capital stock which is neither in fact or law within the jurisdiction of the State of Pennsylvania. In the case of Maltby <em>v. </em>Reading &amp; Columbia R. R. Co., 2 P. F. Smith on p. 146, this court said: <em>“ </em>It is undoubtedly true that the legislature of Pennsylvania cannot impose a personal tax upon the citizen of another state, but the constant practice is to tax property within our jurisdiction which belongs to non-residents.” <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>. . . <em>“ </em>There must be jurisdiction over either the property or the person of the owner, else the power cannot be exercised; but where the property is within our jurisdiction and enjoys the protection of our state government it is justly taxable, and it is of no mbment that the owner who is required to pay the tax resides elsewhere.” See also St. Louis <em>v. </em>The Ferry Co. 11 Wall, on p. 430. It is clear to my mind that, viewed as a tax upon property which is not within the jurisdiction of this Commonwealth, the proposed tax is invalid.</p>
    <p id="AaF" data-blocks='[["BL_132.6",132,[294,811,1181,1576]],["BL_133.1",133,[168,423,1168,1831]]]'>But it is claimed that the corporation defendant does business within the Commonwealth, and therefore comes within the words of the 4th section of the Act of May 1st 1868, which imposes taxation upon the capital stock of all companies incorporated by the law of this Commonwealth, or of “any other state, .and lawfully doing business in this Commonwealth.” The conclusion is drawn that because the defendant does business within our limits the tax upon its capital stock is lawful for the reason that the statute authorizes it. It will be perceived that this conclusion is not legitimate unless, as to this particular case, the statute is a valid exercise of legislative power; Without that element the words of the statute, as to the present controversy, are merely nugatory, and hence we are at once and necessarily remitted to the inquiry, can the Legislature lawfully impose such a tax ? It may be conceded that, as a general rule, if the particular business done is done by virtue, or, indeed, by permission, of legislative authority, the right to tax exists. For then, there is a subordination of the corporate action to the legislative will which carries with it the power of prescribing the terms upon which the corporate action shall be exercised. This would certainly apply to all cases in which the right to come within the territorial limits of the state, and construct buildings or works of any kind, and cany on business, is conferred upon foreign corporations. When such corporations ac'cept such privileges, they of course become subject to the jurisdiction and supervision of the legislative authority from which those privileges are obtained. But this doctrine fails of application if the particular business done does not depend upon either the express or implied consent of the legislative authority of the territory where it is conducted. This leads us to consider the character of the business done by the corporation defendant. In the case stated this subject is thus described : “ It (the defendant) has never transacted any other business saving that of ferrying passengers and freight across said river between said town and city.” The points between which this carriage of freight and passengers transpires are the town of Gloucester, in the state of New Jersey, and the city of Philadelphia, in the <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>State of Pennsylvania, and tlie space traversed is the water of the river Delaware, and the means employed are steam ferryboats. The waters of the river Delaware, at the port of Philadelphia, constitute one of the highways of nature, and the commerce of all the states, indeed, of all the world, may traverse them without the necessity of obtaining the consent of the legislature of Pennsylvania. When the ferry-boats of the defendant touch the territory of Pennsylvania at their landing-place in Philadelphia, they are in contact with our soil, but they have not traversed any portion of it. The surface of the river being that of a public navigable stream, does not belong to the coterminous states in the sense of exclusive ownership, whatever may be the title to the bed underneath. In the case of St. Louis <em>v. </em>The Ferry Co., <a href="/us/78/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="11 Wall. 423" data-case-ids="3414183" data-case-paths="/us/78/0423-01">11 Wall. 423</a>, it was held that the ferryboats of a corporation incorporated in one state and carrying passengers and freight forward and back across a river to a city situated in another state, are not taxable under a law taxing boats within the city, in a case where the relation of the boats to the city was simply that of contact, as one of the termini of the voyage. In this case the boats plied between East St. Louis, in the state of Illinois, where the Ferry Co. was incorporated, and the city of St. Louis, in the state of Missouri. On p. 431, in speaking of the relation of the boats to the city, the court say, “ Their relation to the city was merely that of contact there, as one of the termini of their transit across the river in the prosecution of their business.” This being so it is evident that in traversing the river the boats of the defendant are not to be regarded as in the use and occupancy of any part of the soil of the state. Is, then, the discharge and receipt of passengers and freight on and from the wharf at Philadelphia, such a transaction of business within our territory as subjects the parties engaged in it to state taxation for the exercise-of the privilege? In other words, may a state impose taxation either directly or indirectly upon traffic between the states? I am clear that such a power does not exist, because it would be in direct contravention of at least two distinct provisions of the federal constitution. 1st. That which declares that “no state shall, without the consent of congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws.” 2d. That which declares that congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes.</p>

In Brown <em>v. </em>State of Maryland <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>(<a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wheat.%20119" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="12 Wheat. 119">12 Wheat. 119</a>), Ch. J. Marshall, in defining commerce, said, “Commerce is-intercourse; one of its most ordinary ingredients is traffic.” Again, in Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden (<a href="/us/22/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="9 Wheat. 1" data-case-ids="1421263" data-case-paths="/us/22/0001-01">9 Wheat. 1</a>), he said, “ Commerce undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more, it is intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between nations and parts of nations, in all its branches, and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse.” . . . “ The power over commerce, including navigation, was one of the primary objects for which the people of America adopted their government, and must have been contemplated in forming it.” . . . “The word used in the Constitution then, comprehends and has been always understood to comprehend, navigation within its meaning, and a power to regulate navigation is as expressly granted as if that term had been added to the word ‘commerce.’ . . . The subject to which, the word is next applied is to commerce ‘ among the several states.’ The word ‘ among,’ means intermingled with — a thing which is among others, is intermingled with them — commerce among the states cannot stop at the external boundaiy line of each state, but may be introduced into the interior.” These judicial definitions are sufficiently precise to establish that the word ‘ commerce,” as used in the federal Constitution, imports and ncludes intercourse and traffic between the states of the Union &gt;ver navigable waters, as well as between the states and foreign countries. It follows, as was held in the cases cited and in other cases, that the power to regulate inter-state commerce resides in the federal government and not in the states, and therefore the right to conduct this commerce or traffic does not depend upon the will of the states, but may be exercised altogether independently of them. Cb. J. Marshall further said, in the case last cited : “ The power of congress, then, comprehends navigation, within the limits of every state in the Union, so far as that navigation may be in any manner connected with ‘ commerce with foreign nations, or among the several states or with the Indian tribes.’ It may of consequence pass the jurisdictional line of New York and. act upon the very waters to which the prohibition now under consideration applies.” While it is undoubtedly true that commerce among the states is a subject of congressional regulation and control, it is also true that a great variety of legislation by the states may lawfully be applied to it. These are ordinarily called police regulations, and are known as inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws and others of a similar character, and they are clearly defined by Agnuw, J., in the opinion of this court in the case of Craig <em>v. </em>Kline (15 P. F. S. 399). 13ut the power to impose taxation in any form npon inter-state commerce has been uniformly held by the Supreme <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>Court of the United States, and by several of the state courts of last resort, to reside in congress alone. Accordingly, in whatever form the question has arisen, and with whatever degree of indirectness state taxation has been imposed upon either foreign or inter-state commerce, it has been always rejected by the supreme judicial authority of the land, as an incompetent exercise of legislative power by the states.

But it was held that the license fee was, in practical effect, the equivalent of a duty on imports, and that it was also a restriction upon foreign commerce, and therefore came in conflict with both the constitutional prohibitions above stated. The Chief Justice reasoned thus: “.There is no difference, in effect, between a power to prohibit the sale of an arti- • <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>ele, and a power to prohibit its introduction into the country. The one would be a necessary consequence of the other. .No goods would be imported if none could be sold. No object of any description can be accomplished by laying a duty on importation, which may not be accomplished with equal certainty by laying a duty on the thing imported, in the hands of the importer. It is obvious that the same power which imposes a light duty, can impose a very heavy one ; one which amounts to a prohibition. Questions of power do not depend on the degree to which it may be exercised. If it may be exercised at all, it must be exercised at the will of those in whose hands it is placed.” It seems to me that this reasoning is entirely applicable to the case at bar. If the business done by the defendant may be used as a means of imposing a tax not otherwise lawful, and yet this business is not subject to the taxing power of the state, then all inter-state commerce, and, indeed, foreign commerce also, becomes dependent upon the will of the states, and may be controlled and even prohibited by them, though in clear violation of the constitutional provisions. If Pennsylvania may impose a tax on the capital stock of a foreign navigation company, because one of its vessels touches at one of her ports, and there discharges and receives passengers and freight, then every' other state at whose ports other vessels of the same company may transact the same kind of business, may impose the same tax. Or if the same vessel touches at different state ports on our coast, the entire capital stock of the company owning her may be taxed at each port, and thus the whole commerce conducted by such company may be destroyed. The case of Brown <em>v. </em>Maryland, above cited, proves that it is not at all necessary to show that such results liave followed or will follow; it is enough to show that they are possible. In discussing the clause relating to the regulation of commerce, Oh. J. Marshall further says: “ If the states may tax all persons and property found on - their territory, what shall restrain them from taxing goods in their transit through the state from one port to another for the purpose of re-exportation.” . . “ Or from taxing the transportation of articles passing from the state itself to another state for the purpose of traffic ? ” Here is a direct denial of the right to do the very thing which is sought to be done in the present case; to wit, taxing the transportation of articles from state to state. It matters not that it is indirectly done. The result is precisely the same as if done directly. It cannot be that a state may tax the capital stock of a corporation <em>because </em>it does a certain kind of business, when the business itself is not within the power of state taxation. In the case of McCulloch <em>v. </em>Maryland, before quoted, the Chief Justice said : “ That the power<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>td tax involves the power to destroy; that the power to destroy may defeat and render useless the power to create; that there is a plain repugnance in conferring on one government a power to control the constitutional measures of another, which other, with respect to those very measures, is declared to be supreme over that which exerts the control, are propositions not to be denied.”</p>
