On the same day, a few hours before his death,, he executed his last will and testament, signed by a mark, in the presence of subscribing witnesses, whereby ho deviled and bequeathed to his wife, Ann McCort, all his property, real, personal, and mixed, and appointed his friend, Father Anthony F. Haul, sole executor. This will Was admitted to probate by the Register of'Wills, November 26th 1875, and letters testamentary were granted to the said executor.</p>

It was'averred in the appeal that the testator died without leaving to survive him father, mother,' widow, issue, sister or brother, except the appellant, who as only brother was the only person interested in the estate.</p>

It does not repeal the Act of 1832, which made a decree of probate conclusive as to personalty, if unappealed from, for three years. Prior to the Act of 1856 a parly desiring to contest a will as to realty could do so by an action of ejectment within an indefinite time, or until barred by the common law presumption. The Act of 1856 was passed to remedy this mischief, by compelling a contestant to bring his “ action at law ” within five years: Kenyon <em>v. </em>Stewart, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20179" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Wright 179">8 Wright 179</a>, at p. 189. Its title is, “An Act for the greater certainty of title and more secure enjoyment of' real estate.” It expressly applies only to real estate, and yet if an appeal can be taken after three years and within five years, and the will fails upon an issue <em>devisavit vel </em>non, it must fail as to both realty and personalty. As to realty, probate of a will is <em>prima faeie </em>evidence, and the burden of proof is on the contestants ; but the appellant’s contention would change this principle, because, on an appeal and an issue <em>devisavit vel </em>non, the proceedings are <em>de novo. </em>The Act of 1856 provides that probate shall be conclusive unless within five years “ those interested to controvert it shall by <em>caveat </em>and <em>action at law </em>” 'contest its validity. This does not give an <em>appeal, </em>as under the Act of 1832, but relates to the former method of contesting by action of ejectment, trespass, etc. This court said, in Kenyon <em>v. </em>Stewart <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20179" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Wright 179">(supra),</a> “ The word <em>caveat </em>is inaccurately used here. . .. . It always precedes the act, and is never heard of as a means of undoing what has been already done; but the other words, “ action at law,” are sensible, and mean an ejectment, as in this case, or any proceeding where the issue is <em>devisavit vel non.”</em>

The Act of 1856 may and should be construed m <em>pari materia </em>with that of 1832, and in harmony with the common law, giving it effect as a statute of limitation and making no other change than inquiring contestants as to realty to bring their ejectment within five years, or the probate will be conclusive.</p>

    <p id="b50-9" data-blocks='[["BL_50.14",50,[295,1681,1167,553]]]'>The act inferred to makes the decree of the register before whom probate of any will, devising real estate, is made, “ conclusive as to such realty, unless within five years from the date of such probate, <em>those interested to contest it </em>shall, by <em>caveat and action at law, </em>duly pursued, contest the validity of such will, as to such realty.” Three things herein stated require our notice : 1. The’judicial and conclusive character of the register’s decree ; 2. The fact that five years is given within which to controvert such decree and contest the validity of such will; 3. That the act is limited to a devise of realty, hence it in no way affects the probate of a will, so far as it concerns personal property; as to it the limitation as found in the Act of 1832 continues to apply.</p>

      <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>
      <em>and action at law,” </em>as the beginning and ending of the procesa by which the register’s decree is to be controverted. Without an interpretation such as this we make the statute one of limitation only; we refuse to the sentence of the register the force of a judicial decree ; wo must strike out the word caveat as meaningless, repudiate the idea of a controversy involving the sentence of probate, and limit the contest to any action at law which may involve the issue of <em>devismitwl non. </em>Yet it is obvious that the framer of the act had all the while in his mind ■a contest over the validity of the probate, for such probate shall be conclusive unless “ <em>those interested to controvert it” </em>shall, by caveat, etc., contest the validity of such will. From this, it would seem clear, that the right to contest, the will is limited to those who may be interested to controvert the probate. This, however, can have force only on the hypothesis that the will, after probate, cannot be attacked except by a contest over the decree admitting it to proof. We can, indeed, readily imagine a case, as that of a purchaser after such decree, who may have no interest whatever in the probate, and is yet interested to contest the will. How, then, is all this to be harmonized and reconciled ? Certainly only by the construction recognized in Wilson <em>v. </em>Gaston — that is, by making all persons who may, within the five years, happen to be, or to become, interested in the will, interested also in the probate. In this way no right, unless perchance it be one purely technical, is taken from any person, and, at the same time, the provisions of a valuable statute are saved.</p>
