These include a threshold objection to temporary judicial assignments to the Court and a challenge to a now-supplanted order that previously had dismissed the appeal. In addition, a jurisdictional question has been raised concerning whether a common pleas court’s denial of a motion for a protective order seeking, in advance of a videotape deposition, to restrain any public dissemination constitutes a collateral order subject to as-of-right interlocutory appellate review. Finally, on the merits, a challenge is maintained to the common pleas court’s refusal to issue a protective order proscribing such dissemination.</p>

No. 4017.1 (permitting the taking of “[a]ny deposition upon oral examination ... as a matter of course as a video deposition”), which was scheduled for one month later.

The lawyers couched these concerns variously, explaining that they were based, in part, on their client’s status as a public figure and upon the prior course of dealings between the Appellant, Appellee, and Ap-pellee’s media employer. <em>See, e.g., </em>Statement dated March 16, 2012, in <em>Dougherty v. Heller, </em>No. 00699 Dec. Term 2009 (C.P.Phila.) (“N.T., Mar. 16, 2012”), at 23 (reflecting the observation of one of Appellant’s attorneys that “[y]ou are the media and we’re here because of what we contend to be malicious conduct by the media of a public figure”). Raising the potential for unjust and unreasonable embarrassment to <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>their client, counsel indicated that they would require assurances that the videotape would not “be used for any other purpose or released to any other third parties outside of relationship with any filing in this case or court proceeding.” <em>Id. </em>at 8-9; <em>see also id. </em>at 4-6,10,12.</p>
    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[194,623,1153,842]]]'>Appellee’s attorney, for her part, repeatedly indicated that she intended to use the videotape solely for purposes of the litigation, and that she would abide by all of her obligations under the Rules of Civil Procedure and the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>See id. </em>at 6, 11-12, 16-17, 24-25, 30. She declined, however, to make the specific commitment that was asked of her. Counsel highlighted that she had given a month’s notice of the deposition, but that no objections had been raised or particular conditions sought throughout the ensuing time period. In this vein, the attorney asserted that it was unreasonable for Appellant’s lawyers to make special demands at the outset of a duly-noticed deposition. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 9-10 (reflecting the remark by Appellee’s counsel that she would not “agree to something when I haven’t thought about it, I don’t know what your concerns are, I haven’t spoken to any of my clients”).</p>
    <p id="b571-5" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[192,1489,1153,573]]]'>Appellee’s attorney then suggested an arrangement whereby the videotape deposition would proceed as planned, and she would agree not to give the tape to anyone for ten days, during which time Appellant could seek a protective order or other relief from the common pleas court. <em>See id. </em>at 12-13, 18-22. Furthermore, counsel stated, if such a motion were to be filed, she would commit that there would be no dissemination of the video pending a court ruling. <em>See id. </em>at 24-25 (“I’m willing to agree that to go forward with the videotaped deposition, to have the deposition videotape remain basically in escrow until you get a ruling from Judge Allen[.]”).</p>

In the discussion, one of Appellant’s attorneys expressed, as follows, a <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>reluctance to involve the common pleas court, because he foresaw that it was unlikely that a protective order would issue:</p>

    <p id="b572-7" data-blocks='[["BL_572.7",572,[269,972,1155,417]]]'>Nevertheless, Appellant’s counsel insisted upon a commitment that the video would not be released to any third party “for televising or whatnot,” without permission from the common pleas court. <em>Id. </em>at 18. In the absence of an agreement on their specified terms, the attorneys would only permit their client to participate in the deposition if it were to proceed ■without videotaping. Since this was unacceptable to Appel-lee’s counsel, <em>see id. </em>at 32-33, the deposition was aborted.</p>
    <p id="b572-8" data-blocks='[["BL_572.8",572,[270,1415,1153,365]]]'>Appellee then filed a motion to compel the videotape deposition as authorized by Rule of Civil Procedure 4017.1. She highlighted that, under the rules, failing to participate in a video deposition may not be excused on the ground that discovery sought is objectionable “unless the party failing to act has filed an appropriate objection or has applied for a protective order.” <em>Id. </em>No. 4019(a)(2).</p>

No. 4012(a) (“Upon motion by a party ..., and/or <em>good cause shown, </em>the court may make any order which justice requires to protect a party ... from unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden or expense[.]” (emphasis added)). At issue, she explained, was the deposition of a public figure in a case involving matters of public concern. In Appellee’s view, speculative embarrassment from the mere possibility of dissemination of unknown content <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>cannot constitute “good cause.” In this regard, Appellee referenced several decisions of federal courts which had refused to enter protective orders, where the proponent failed to demonstrate “specific prejudice or oppression that will be caused by disclosure” or “concrete reasons justifying a protective order,” as contrasted with “unverified fears.” <em>Pia v. Supernova Media, Inc., </em><a href="/frd/275/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="275 F.R.D. 559" data-case-ids="4276923" data-case-paths="/frd/275/0559-01">275 F.R.D. 559</a>, 560 (D.Utah 2011); <em>cf.

Further, Appellant asserted that there was a long history of acrimony between Appellant and Appellee’s media employer. Appellant continued to explain that none of the seventeen other depositions that had been noticed and/or conducted in the case was accomplished, or was sought to be undertaken, with video recording. In support of his position, Appellant also referenced a series of federal and state decisions, although in these instances, protective relief was granted. <em>See, e.g., Stern v.

Appellant’s request was made in the embryonic stage of litigation, prior to rulings on admissibility, prior to filings of post-discovery dis-positive motions, and prior to trial. Had Appellant sought broader relief or sought protection to prevent disclosure of information during trial, Appellant would have needed to satisfy a more stringent evidentiary burden; however, on this record, at the pre-trial stage of the litigation process, the Trial Court abused its discretion in determining that Appellant had not established “good cause” and denying a protective order preventing dissemination of the visual record of Appellant’s deposition for non-litigation purposes.</p>
