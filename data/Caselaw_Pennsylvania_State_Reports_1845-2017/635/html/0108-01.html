Tax Review Board Decision, 4/11/12, at 3-4. Notwithstanding this denial of <em>refunds, </em>the Review Board, <em>sua sponte, </em>awarded Taxpayers <em>credits </em>for their overpayments. Specifically, the Review Board concluded that because Philadelphia Code § 19-2610 requires the Department to establish regulations<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> for credits <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>“to be granted on <em>any </em>overpayment of estimated tax payment,” the Department was required to credit Taxpayers for overpayments for tax years 2003 and 2004.

The court agreed Taxpayers’ refund requests were untimely but, unlike the Review Board, determined “due date” referred to the payment due date rather than the filing due date, finding § 19-1703(1)(d) was unambiguous because it did not mention returns. Trial Court Opinion, 12/27/12, at 6. While filing deadlines could be extended, and were here, the payment deadline remained April 15. The court further concluded no equitable exception to the three-year limitation applied because Philadelphia Code § 19—1703(1)(d) was a statute of repose, given that the provision delineated a period that began with a “definitively established event.” Trial Court Opinion, 12/27/12, at 8. Similarly, because the “plain, unambiguous language” of § 19-2610 “clearly expressed an] entitlement to a credit for any overpayment without providing” a limitations period, the trial court affirmed the Review Board’s credit determination. <em>Id., </em>at 9.

Like the trial court, the Commonwealth Court determined the relevant refund and credit provisions were unambiguous. The majority agreed the absence of “return” in § 19—1703(l)(d) supported the conclusion that “due date” referred to the payment due date; thus, Taxpayers’ refund requests were untimely since they were not filed within three years of the payment due dates. The majority also agreed no equitable exception to the three-year limitation applied, observing the trial court’s conclusion comported with case law. <em>City of Philadelphia v. City of Phila.

Specifically, the court rejected the City’s argument that since <em>Phila.

Gas Works </em>used the terms interchangeably, whereas the pertinent provisions in this matter used the terms distinctly. Moreover, as § 19—1703(1)(d) did not mention credits, the court reasoned the provision was unambiguous, and therefore, there was no need to ascertain legislative intent. And, even if the relevant provisions were ambiguous, the court concluded ambiguities were to be construed in Taxpayers’ favor. <em>Keystone Health, </em>at 13 (citing <em>Skepton v.

Noting § 19-1703(l)(d) does not mention credits, they argue City Council could not have intended § 19-1703(l)(d) to apply to credits for overpayments because both the BPT and the relevant credit provisions were enacted after § 19—1703(l)(d). Finally, given that a taxpayer has a vested right to a refund but must continue to engage in business to actually receive a credit, Taxpayers submit credits and refunds are materially different.</p>

Echoing President Judge Pellegrini, the City contends there is no meaningful distinction between the net effect of a credit and refund. The City argues the trial court’s prospective budgeting distinction is flawed because the purpose of a time limitation is to allow a governmental entity to conclusively extinguish a claim for retroactive payment—regardless of whether it is termed a credit or refund.</p>

Further, the City argues Taxpayers’ contention that BPTR § 205 and § 19-1703(1)(d) must be read <em>in pari materia </em>lacks merit because: (1) the provisions do not relate to the same subject; (2) <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>allowing BPTR § 205 to serve as an exception would swallow the three-year limitation since the regulation also applies to self-amended federal returns; and (3) Taxpayers should have known they overpaid the City.</p>

Moreover, while § 19-1703(1)(d) deals with City taxpayers generally, BPTR § 205 applies to a discrete class of City taxpayers, <em>ie., </em>Method II BPT filers whose net income was subsequently adjusted. Broadly, both provisions deal with City taxpayers, but adopting Taxpayers’ logic would require every City tax provision and Department regulation to be read <em>in pari </em>materia—an untenable result given the diverse spectrum of taxes the City imposes. <em>See generally </em>Phila.

As stated by the City, construing § 19-1703(1)(d) and BPTR § 205 as one provision would allow a narrow cii-cumstance to swallow the general three-year limitation. As evidenced by their suggestion that the three-year limitation either commences on the due date of the amended return or is extended until the amended return’s due date, even Taxpayers cannot specify the precise result of reading the two provisions together. Under the former, Taxpayers would have had until 2012 to file their refund requests. Thus, we are unpersuaded by the argument that BPTR § 205 resets the three-year limitation in § 19—1703(1)(d).</p>

Rather than imposing a tax, § 19-1703(1)(d) defines a time limitation for seeking a refund. Relatedly, we conclude § 19-1703(1)(d) is a statute of repose and thus reject Taxpayers’ equitable argument. The Commonwealth Court has previously addressed this issue. <em>See Phila. Fresh Food, </em>at 805 (“[S]ection 19-1703(1)(d) is a statute of repose.”). As mentioned <em>supra, </em>a statute of repose delineates a defined time that begins with a definitely established event, independent of the injury or its discovery. <em>Abrams, </em>at 211; <em>see also Phila. Fresh Food, </em>at 805.

Instead, § 19-1703(1)(d) begins with a definite and independent event—the later of the payment date or the payment due date—and runs for three years. Hence, Taxpayers’ ability to pursue refunds was extinguished in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and relief under the recoupment doctrine is unwarranted. <em>See </em>Taxpayers’ Brief, at 58 n. 12 (conceding argument under recoupment doctrine would be “affected” if § 19—1703(1)(d) is statute of repose).</p>

Whereas a refund involves an immediate liability to be paid by the City, a credit is an offset against future liability owed to the City. Stated otherwise, a refund must be paid promptly, while a credit allows the City to prospectively budget the liability—a difference we find material. There being no time limitation listed within the credit provisions, it is unreasonable to impute § 19—1703(1)(d)’s three-year limitation on claims for refunds to claims for credits—to do so would impermissibly rewrite the relevant provisions to insert a term where it does not exist. <em>See Allright Auto Parks, Inc. v.

Code § 19-2610 (requiring the Department to promulgate regulations to provide for credits to be granted on overpayments of estimated taxes), and Section 202(A) of the Department’s regulations, Phila. Bus. Peiv. Tax Reg. § 202(A) (implementing Section 19-2610 by prescribing that overpayments of a current tax year are to be applied first to the payment of an estimated tax for the tax year that follows or to other taxes due, then, in the absence of a refund, to future tax years). Upon review, I differ with Taxpayers’ contention that these provisions were intended to encompass allowance for credit claims beyond the time period permitted for seeking refunds. In this regard, I do not view the filing of an amended tax return as harkening directly back to estimated tax payments, because there is a <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>material, intervening event, namely, the filing of an initial return. After the filing of the initial return—and its reconciliation of estimated tax payments with tax liabilities (particularly where this process encompasses provision of refunds or credits to taxpayers)—associated estimated tax payments can no longer be viewed in isolation, but rather, must be considered in light of the reconciliation which has occurred.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

Rather, while acknowledging that there is ambiguity, but applying a construction favorable to the government, I conclude that City Council intended for the reconciliation of estimated tax payments to be accomplished in tandem with the timely filing of an initial return. Thus, consistent with the City’s position, I believe that the only appropriate procedure for a timely recoupment request is to seek a refund under Section 19-1703.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>
