The dissenting members, on the other hand, observed that, procedurally, the IRE had been conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Act. Furthermore, they attributed significance to the fact that employers do not participate in the process of selecting IRE physicians, and that such function is administered by the Bureau. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 511.2(1) (specifying that IRE physicians are to be “chosen by agreement of the parties, or as designated by the department”).

According to Claimant, the WCJ supplied appropriate supporting justifications for her judgments, based upon her determinations that Dr. Lateef “was not the proper specialist to perform the IRE and he did not properly assess all of the conditions that were disabling Claimant.” Brief for Claimant at 21. Claimant maintains that, because Employer had not requested an IRE within the 60-day time frame specified in Section 306(a.2)(1), Dr. Lateefs testimony had no special effect, but rather, merely served as evidence in the proceedings on Employer’s modification petition. Similarly, Claimant’s <em>amicus, </em>the Pennsylvania Association for Justice, particularly criticizes the Commonwealth Court for treating Dr. Lateefs status as a qualified impairment rating examiner as foreclosing the rejection of his testimony by the fact-finder on its substantive merits. <em>See </em>Brief for <em>Amicus </em>Pa.

As previously observed, the enactment imposed a cost-containment regime focused upon “impairment,” as opposed to “disability,” the latter of which traditionally was the core of the workers’ compensation scheme. <em>See generally </em>Torrey <em>&amp; </em>Greenberg, 6 West’s Pa. Practice, § 6:1. As with other instances of experimental legislation, conceptual and other difficulties with the impairment rating scheme have become evident over time. For example, the statute facially contemplates the initiation of a mandatory, determinative impairment rating evaluation process within a specific, narrow time frame. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 511.2(1). However, the AMA Guides preclude such a rating unless and until the examinee has reached maximum medical improvement. <em>See Combine v.

For example, on its face, Section 306(a.2) authorizes subsequent impairment rating examinations to assess whether “the employe’s condition <em>improves </em>to an impairment rating that is less than fifty per centum,” 77 P.S. § 511.2(5) (emphasis added), thus appearing to contemplate a baseline established by an initial rating. Similarly, Section 306(a.2)(6) references the “status of the impairment,” which may be <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>determined through an ongoing series of medical evaluations. <em><a href="/nj/197/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="964 A.2d 776" data-case-ids="3677587" data-case-paths="/nj/197/0604-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 511.2(6).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

As Employer observes, to the degree that the WCJ's decision harkened back to the full range of Claimant’s initial work-related injuries, it was facially in tension with the nature of an IRE, which assesses the examinee’s present condition. In this regard, medical improvements occurring between the time of the initial injury and the examination may resolve impairments; indeed, as noted, the doctrinal underpinnings of the Medical Guides are rooted to the occurrence of maximum improvement and “permanency,” <em>see </em>AMA Guides §§ 2.5e, 2.5f.</p>
    <p id="b626-6" data-blocks='[["BL_626.6",626,[280,1784,1152,474]]]'>We also agree that the WCJ’s concern with “lumping” medical conditions is too underdeveloped to be accorded controlling significance. The AMA Guides themselves establish broad categories of impairments tied to functional sub-units of a whole person, such as the nervous system. <em>See </em>AMA Guides, Ch. 13. Accordingly, in furtherance of a reasoned decision, the WCJ should have explained how Dr. Lateefs categorizations were inconsistent with those he was required to implement, per such guidelines.</p>

In this regard, although Employer treats the WCJ’s decision as entirely superficial, Employer itself presents a shallow argument in its repeated assertion that Dr. Lateef accorded the maximum impairment rating available to Claimant’s brain injury. <em>See </em>Brief for Employer at 7-8, 16, 19. In point of fact, the physician assigned the maximum rating available within the class of impairment that he selected (“Moderate abnormalities”), but higher percentages attend more severe classifications. <em>See </em>AMA Guides, Table 13-8. For this reason, most assuredly, 20 percent impairment is not necessarily “the maximum rating permitted under the AMA guidelines.” Brief for Employer at 7-8.</p>

Bud Lateef dated Feb. 10, 2011, in <em>Rhodes, </em>No. 390-391992, at 10. According to the AMA Guides, however, an examination for neurological impairment “should be based on a detailed mental status examination, often in concert with neuropsychological assessment and testing.” AMA Guides § 13.3d. Like the WCJ, we find little in Dr. Lateefs deposition or report to suggest that such a detailed mental status examination was undertaken. <em>Cf.
