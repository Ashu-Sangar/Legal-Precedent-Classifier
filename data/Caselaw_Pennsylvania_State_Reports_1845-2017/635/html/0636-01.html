We note that this Court has treated statutes of limitations as warranting strict construction, given that their purpose is to prevent stale claims which might prejudice the defense. <em>See, e.g., Bonfitto v.

This statement about strict construction is somewhat confounding, since the Statutory Construction Act directs, generally, that statutes not expressly subject to strict construction under this enactment’s own terms are to be construed liberally to promote their purposes and in the interests of justice. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(c). <em>See generally </em>Perry Dane, <em>Jurisdictionality, Time, and the Legal Imagination, </em><a href="/citations/?q=23%20Hofstra%20L.%20Rev.%201" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="23 Hofstra L.

In context, in this line of cases, it <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>appears that the Court meant that statutes of limitations are to be construed in favor of the defendant’s interest in being free from stale litigation (which entails liberal construction in favor of the statute’s litigation bar). <em>See, e.g., Bonfitto, </em><a href="/pa/391/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="391 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="1276834" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0187-01">391 Pa. at 188</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20277" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="137 A.2d 277">137 A.2d at 278</a>. In all events, this “strict construction” in favor of a defendant’s interests is certainly a tempered application, as, for example, the Court allows for tolling of certain limitations periods via a particular construction of the term "accrual” (of actions), as that term is employed in the statutory delineation of methods of computing periods of limitations generally. <em>See Wilson v.

      <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>This brings us to the larger question: Is a departure warranted in this case? In my view—and implicitly in the majority’s—justice is disserved by the strict application of the rule that the addition of a “new party,” so defined, triggers a “new eause of action” that is precluded by the limitations period when it has run before the attempted substitution. Over time and in this case, the rule has lacked the flexibility necessary to maximize the likelihood that the outcome of litigation will be resolved justly on the merits rather than expediently based upon rigid application of a formalistic rule. Many other jurisdictions have eschewed this formalism, in deference to equitable principles that we, too, generally honor. As noted by the majority, in some instances our precedents have led to results that fly in the face of the liberal allowance of amendment and substitution prescribed by Pa.R.C.P. 1033, our case law thereunder, and Pennsylvania precedents antedating that Rule. <em>See, e.g., </em>Maj. Op. at 647, 139 A.3d at 1247 (acknowledging that “the Court’s precedent has taken a hard line relative to proceedings errantly initiated against deceased persons”). Furthermore, while Rule 1033 does not expressly allow post-limitations period substitution, that Rule conspicuously does not preclude it. <em>See id. </em>at 646, 139 A.3d at 1246. As well, our former precedents dealing with the broader question regarding when a substitution entails the addition of a “new party,” at least in this court, are quite old, have not recently been reaffirmed, and are arguably “unworkable,” at least in some cases, as the confusion and surfeit of legal theories characterizing the instant case’s path through the courts aptly demonstrates. <em>See Fridenberg; Citizens United, <a href="/us/558/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="558 U.S. 310" data-case-ids="3639027" data-case-paths="/us/558/0310-01">supra.</a></em>

In tandem with this observation, the majority alludes to the time-honored principle that, in deriving rules from past precedents, we must read the prior holdings "against their facts." Maj. Op. at 647, 139 A.3d at 1247. This is true as far as it goes. However, it does not cure the complicating factor that few rules can be extracted when comparisons of the facts in one case to the next are conducted at a microscopic level, because any two cases rarely will be factually identical. Hence, merely citing this principle does not justify distinguishing cases on factual differences that are immaterial to the legal question presented.

Even courts applying F.R.C.P. 17 and its state analogs do not allow amendment in <em>all </em>cases, even when to do so would not change the claims raised or prejudice the adverse party. <em>See Gardner v.
