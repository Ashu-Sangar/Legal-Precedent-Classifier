As previously explained, disturbance of a jury verdict on weight-of-the-evidence grounds would be appropriate only in an exceptional case where the evidence weighs very heavily against the conviction. Here, however, per the trial court’s review of the record, and ours, we do not find that the jury lost its way or embarked upon a manifest miscarriage of justice by convicting Appellant on the three counts of first-degree murder. In terms of Meighan’s testimony, the jurors were made aware of the witness’s entanglements in the criminal justice system, including his <em>crimen falsi </em>convictions, <em>see </em>N.T., Apr. 26, 2013, at 879-80, he was subject to extensive cross-examination, <em>see id. </em>at 884-943, and Appellant’s counsel took pains to cast suspicion upon the testimony in his closing remarks, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.T., May 3, 2013, at 1720-1721. Furthermore, the jurors were entitled to treat Appellant’s admitted <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>omissions and lies in his statements to police as evidence of his consciousness of guilt. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Viewed in its totality, we find, the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to enable a reasonable jury to find all elements of the crimes of first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Commonwealth v.

He asserts that he suffered a panic attack after encountering the bodies of his family members, as evidenced by the fact that an emergency medical technician found him to be flushed and perspiring profusely and recorded his elevated heartbeat and blood pressure readings. Additionally, Appellant relies on testimony from a psychiatrist, Christine Martone, M.D., that he presented at a suppression hearing. In this regard, Dr. Martone testified that the effect of Appellant’s panic attack, coupled with an administration of five milligrams of Valium while being transported to the hospital, deprived Appellant of the ability, subsequently, to knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently make statements or give consent. <em>See </em>N.T., Apr. 30, 2013, at 13.</p>
