      <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>In his first guilt-phase claim for relief, Appellant asserts that the common pleas court erred when it denied a pretrial motion seeking to suppress evidence taken from his residence. Appellant styles this claim as follows: “Search of House Impermissible as Beyond the Breadth of a Search Warrant Describing Criminal Conduct <em>in a Detached Garage.” </em>Brief for Appellant at 18 (emphasis adjusted). Consistent with this framing, Appellant’s argument assumes that the affidavit of probable cause supporting the initial warrant described criminal conduct only in the garage. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(depicting the underlying circumstances as involving “[a] search warrant issued 10/22/2008, describing criminal conduct (drug sales) from a garage building detached from a home”); <em>id. </em>at 19 (suggesting that “the search warrant affidavit (controlled drug buys from garage) did not describe conduct in the house”). While indicating that it is permissible to extend an authorized search of a residence to the curtilage, Appellant contends that such an approach should not operate in the reverse, particularly given the decisions of this Court allocating to residences the strongest protection from unreasonable searches. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Brion, </em><a href="/pa/539/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="539 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="474153" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0256-01">539 Pa. 256</a>, 257, <a href="/pa/539/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="652 A.2d 287" data-case-ids="474153,7866155" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0256-01,/a2d/652/0287-01">652 A.2d 287</a>, 287 (1994) (characterizing the right to privacy in one’s domain as “sacrosanct”).

In responsive opinions, this author, Justice Baer, and former Justice Nigro advanced the position that the (d)(6) aggravator should be limited to six major felonies that are specifically enumerated in a statutory definition of "perpetration of a felony,” which is presently reposited in the section of the Crimes Code addressing the substantive crime of murder, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d). <em>See Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/583/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="583 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="687694" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0358-01">583 Pa. at 392-99</a>, <a href="/pa/583/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="877 A.2d 433" data-case-ids="687694,8955379" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0358-01,/a2d/877/0433-01">877 A.2d at 453-58</a> (Saylor, J., concurring and dissenting, joined in relevant part by Nigro, J.); <em>id. </em>at 387, <a href="/pa/583/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="877 A.2d 433" data-case-ids="687694,8955379" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0358-01,/a2d/877/0433-01">877 A.2d at 450</a> (Baer, J„ concurring and dissenting).

We believe that the common pleas court’s reservation about other state legislatures determining felony status when implementing their own policy-based judgments concerning penalties is of lesser concern than application of a disparate common-law or equivalency construct pertaining to out-of-state offenses. Moreover, and again, at least after rejection of the minority position in <em>Robinson </em>that the peipetration-of-a-felony aggravator was subject to a discrete statutory formulation, <em>see supra </em>note 6, we discern no evidence that the General Assembly intended for different conceptions of the term "felony” to apply as between Sections 9711(d)(6) and (d)(9).</p>

In some recent decisions, this Court has transferred death-penalty appeals to the Superior Court, which administers as-of-right direct appellate review in non-capital cases, when it has become clear in our own review that a death sentence is unavailable. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em><a href="/pa/592/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="592 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="3556469" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0411-01">592 Pa. 411</a>, 418, <a href="/pa/592/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="925 A.2d 167" data-case-ids="3556469,8303294" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0411-01,/a2d/925/0167-01">925 A.2d 167</a>, 171 (2007). Here, however, the guilt-phase review is not burdensome and was complete as of the time it became clear that imposition of a life sentence was required. Therefore, and to promote efficiency, we have completed the guilt-phase review, above.</p>
