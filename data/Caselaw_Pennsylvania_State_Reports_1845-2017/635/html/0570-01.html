On October 29, 2011, a snowstorm affected PPL’s service area, causing over 388,000 PPL customers to experience disruption in their electrical service. In November of 2011, the PUC received an anonymous tip letter supposedly authored by a PPL employee. The tip letter alleged that PPL violated its priority-ranking policy when restoring power after the October 2011 snowstorm.</p>

The investigation resulted in PPL and the PUC, through I <em>&amp; </em>E, entering into a settlement agreement, which the PUC Commissioners were required to consider for approval. Under the agreement, PPL did not admit to any wrong doing; however, it agreed to take corrective action to safeguard against a similar incident occurring in the future. In addition, the parties agreed that PPL would pay a civil settlement fee of $60,000.</p>

The OOR agreed with both Appellants and held that Subsection 335(d) requires the PUC to disclose redacted versions of the requested documents. Thus, in relevant part, the OOR’s final determinations granted Appellants’ appeals. The PUC appealed both cases to the Commonwealth Court.

However, the focus of their argument shifted away from the redaction portion of the subsection and onto the definition of “commissioner” as that word is used in the context of the subsection. More specifically, the PUC and PPL argued that, when Subsection 335(d) utilizes the term “commission” in referring to the public release of “any documents relied upon by the commission in reaching its determination,” “commission” means “the PUC Commissioners,” not the PUC in its entirety, because only the PUC Commissioners can make determinations or otherwise take official action under the Sunshine Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> PUC’s Commonwealth Court Brief at 16. The PUC and PPL averred that the sought-after documents were not submitted to the PUC Commissioners during their consideration of the settlement agreement; thus, because the PUC Commissioners did not rely on the documents when they approved the settlement agreement, Subsection 335(d) does not require disclosure of those documents. <em>See </em>66 Pa.C.S. § 335(d) (providing that “any documents relied upon by the commission” shall be made part of the public record and released publicly).</p>

In this regard, Appellants highlighted that the Code defines “commission” as “[t]he Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission of this Commonwealth.” 66 Pa.C.S. § 102.</p>

The court concluded that this result is dictated by the fact that only the PUC Commissioners have the authority, by majority vote, to make a decision, enter into a settlement, and take official action. <em><a href="/a3d/106/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="106 A.3d 193" data-case-ids="6893866" data-case-paths="/a3d/106/0193-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a3d/106/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="106 A.3d 193" data-case-ids="6893866" data-case-paths="/a3d/106/0193-01">at 199</a>. In support of this conclusion, the court cited Subsection 301(d) of the Code, 66 Pa.C.S. § 301(d). This statutory subsection provides, in relevant part, that “[a] majority of the members of the commission ... shall constitute a quorum and such majority, acting unanimously, shall be required for any action, including the making of any order or the ratification of any act done or order made by one or more of the commissioners.” 66 Pa.C.S. § 301(d).</p>

For example, Subsection 3.113(a) grants “Commission staff’ the discretion to conduct informal investigations “in appropriate circumstances regarding the condition and management of a public utility or other person subject to its jurisdiction.” 52 Pa.Code § 3.113(a). Subsection 3.113(b)(3), on the other hand, dictates what official actions, per the Sunshine Act, must be taken when resolving informal investigations, such as “the Commission” considering a settlement at a public meeting. 52 Pa.Code § 3.113(b)(3). The PUC and PPL point out that only the PUC Commissioners consider settlement agreements at public meetings. The PUC and PPL aver that, under this regulation, only documents relied upon by the PUC Commissioners in their official agency actions, such as approving a settlement agreement at a public meeting, are subject to disclosure. <em>See </em>52 Pa.Code § 3.113(b)(3) (providing that “[ejxcept for staff reports and <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>other documents covered by a specific legal privilege, documents relied upon by the Commission in reaching its determination shall be made part of the public record”).</p>

The provision specifically precludes access to agencies’ “investigative materials” concerning non-criminal investigations. 65 Pa.C.S. § 67.708(b)(17)(ii).

On the other hand, Section 335(d) classifies entry into settlement agreements as being within the category of “official action” as defined in the Sunshine Act, <em>see </em>66 Pa.C.S. § 335(d) (conditioning mandatory disclosure upon, <em>inter alia, </em>“ent[ry] into a settlement ... or <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>

C.S. § 335(d). In my judgment, the Legislature’s underlying purpose was to ensure that the public record associated with official action (such as the Commissioners’ approval of the I <em>&amp; </em>E/PPL settlement) transparently reflects the basis for the associated decision-making. <em>Accord PUC </em>v. <em>Seder, </em><a href="/a3d/106/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="106 A.3d 193" data-case-ids="6893866" data-case-paths="/a3d/106/0193-01">106 A.3d 193</a>, 199 (Pa.Cmwlth.2014) (“Section 335(d) is essentially an open docket provision solely concerned with providing access to the reasoning and bases for actions taken by the PUC, a goal which is accomplished through disclosure of the documents relied upon by the Commissioners and issuance of the opinion and order approving the settlement.”). In this respect, I also agree with the PUC, PPL, and their <em>amicus </em>that the requirement attaches at the tier of the Commission at which relevant “official action” is taken.</p>
    <p id="b649-4" data-blocks='[["BL_649.4",649,[183,1325,1153,524]]]'>Along these lines, I credit the Commonwealth Court’s position that “commission” means “Commissioners” in scenarios, such as this one, where only the Commissioners are empowered to undertake the official action in question. <em>See <a href="/a3d/106/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="106 A.3d 193" data-case-ids="6893866" data-case-paths="/a3d/106/0193-01">id.</a> </em>Accordingly, although Section 335(d) facially addresses the agency’s “entry” into a settlement agreement, given the official-action overlay in Section 335(d), I do not believe that the General Assembly contemplated attachment of the disclosure requirement upon the mere administrative action entailed in the entry into a conditional settlement agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

From the terms of Section 335(d), I discern no intention on the part of the Legislature to override the policy underlying such an exclusion in the utility setting, other than in circumstances in which investigative materials would be included as a basis for “official action” on the Commission’s part. 66 Pa.C.S. § 335(d). Construction of the statute in this fashion allows public review of the basis for settlement approval decisions, and for the Commission to be subject to public scrutiny and criticism in instances in which records might not convey adequate or sound bases for decisions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> I do not believe, however, that the statute manifests an intention to open what otherwise would be confidential investigative files, outside the scope of the RTKL’s mandatory disclosure requirements, where such materials simply were not relied upon by the tier of the Commission undertaking official action.</p>
