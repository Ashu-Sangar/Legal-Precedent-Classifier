Gaming Board Adjudication (“Adjudication”), 11/18/14, at 118. These delays, coupled with the economic downturn in 2008 which hampered the availability of credit all over the country, prompted Sugar-House to request permission from the Board to build a smaller facility that it pledged to expand once business conditions improved. The Board granted this request in 2009, and, subsequently, in September 2010, SugarHouse constructed <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>and opened an “interim” facility, which is located on the eastern side of Philadelphia near the Delaware River at 1080 North Delaware Avenue. In 2014, SugarHouse began construction on an expansion of that casino to increase both its overall size and the number of gaming offerings available for patrons.

In 2013, after these investigations were complete, the Board conducted a series of open hearings at which members of the public were permitted to testify.

At the time of Stadium’s initial application in 2012, Manoukian was the president, treasurer and director of Sterling Fiduciary Services, Inc.

After considering all of the evidence of record, on November 18, 2014, the Board voted 7-0 at an open public hearing to award the Category 2 license to Stadium. The Board explained that its selection of Stadium was based on the following factors: (1) <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>the Board considered Stadium’s hotel/casino to be “rightsized” for the Philadelphia gaming market since it would not be “overbuilt”; (2) the location of the hotel/casino, in Philadelphia’s Stadium District bordering the parking lots of the stadiums, and, hence, apart from large residential populations, was advantageous in that it was accessible by the nearly 8 million annual visitors to the sports’ stadiums, and its design, as a modern streetscape, would fit well within the overall architectural scheme of the area; (3) the geographic location of the hotel/casino relative to other existing casinos would be of sufficient distance so as to create a buffer between them; (4) the hotel/casino would be accessible by automobile from two major interstate highways—1-76 and 1-95—as well as by a nearby subway stop for those desirous of taking mass transportation from the Center City region of Philadelphia; (5) there was minimal public opposition to the proposed location, and the concerns of residents who lived in a neighborhood near the corner of Packer Avenue and Broad Streets regarding increased traffic on game days would be alleviated by Stadium’s commitment to entirely finance the construction of an additional on-ramp to 1-76 which would divert some of the traffic flow, as well as its building of the aforementioned parking garage which would absorb the increased demands for parking on days in which sporting events were held; (6) Greenwood had a proven track record in the casino industry by making Parx a top producing casino, while the Cordish Group had a similar successful background in the broader entertainment industry through the operation of its Live! facilities, one of which—X-Finity Live!—was already a popular entertainment destination located in the Stadium District; and (7) the ownership group of Stadium had the capacity to self-finance the construction of the casino and was not dependent on private financing through the credit market; thus, its ownership would not incur excessive debt which would hinder either its ability to be developed as proposed, or its ability to compete with other casinos in the Philadelphia-area gaming market.

Sugar-House contends that the Board erred in determining that its interests could be adequately represented by the OEC since that entity had already submitted a suitability report prior to SugarHouse’s filing of its petition to intervene indicating that Stadium met the statutory requirements for licensure, and it refused to take a position before the Board regarding whether Stadium’s ownership structure was in compliance with Section 1330 of the Gaming Act. SugarHouse maintains that had it been given the opportunity to intervene it would have vigorously pressed arguments regarding this issue and would have reminded “the Board of its responsibility to examine carefully the issues raised by the joint ownership of Parx and Stadium.” SugarHouse Brief (J-59-2015) at 57.</p>

The Board argues that SugarHouse did not have an interest with respect to issues concerning Stadium’s compliance with Sections 1304 and 1330 of the Gaming Act which was any different than any other citizen who seeks to ensure compliance with the law; thus, in the Board’s view, SugarHouse did not have standing to assert these issues before the Board. In any event, according to the Board, SugarHouse’s claim essentially boils down to an allegation that the OEC did not present the issues in the way that SugarHouse would have done, had it been granted intervenor status, and this averment was not a basis for it to be granted intervention.</p>

However, the issues of each applicant’s comportment with the statutory eligibility criteria were “exactly the interest[s] that OEC, as well as every other competing applicant/party, had in this matter.” Board Brief (J-59-2015) at 25. The Board stresses that OEC did fulfill its responsibility to enforce the licensing requirements of the Gaming Act in that it investigated and reviewed the background of each applicant and made specific recommendations regarding each. The Board rejects SugarHouse’s argument that because the chief counsel for the OEC took no formal position before the Board challenging the licensing structure of Stadium, the Board did not consider that issue carefully. The Board points out that, in arriving at its decision, it examined the evidentiary record fully, as was its responsibility under the Gaming Act, and, moreover, the competing license applicants—which had substantial, direct and immediate interests in ensuring that the Board considered the licensing criteria of the Gaming Act—did present arguments on this question and reminded the Board of its duty to consider all of the relevant statutory factors.</p>

The Board’s regulations do not permit a party to file either exceptions, or a motion for reconsideration or rehearing, after the Board’s final order in licensing proceedings. <em>See </em>58 Pa.Code § 494a,8(f) (expressly exempting a final order of the Board in licensing proceedings from being subject to an application for rehearing or reconsideration, and providing that challenges to a Board denial of a license are governed by 4 Pa.C.S. § 1204). As a result, the earliest possible opportunity for Market East to raise this challenge was through its petition for review; thus, we find the issue is not waived.</p>

Market East claims that the Board’s failure to conduct such an explicit analysis is “troubling” based on what it contends are “anti[-]competitive effects” of the award of the license. Market East Brief (J-60-2015) at 22. Market East cites, as support for this contention: first, the proximity of Stadium’s proposed casino to the site of the Parx Casino, which it contends are both owned by Manoukian and, thus, would have no incentive to compete against one another in the same market; and, second, the alleged competitive advantage Stadium would have over other casinos, by virtue of the access it would have to a combined list of customers from both casinos, which it would use for marketing purposes.</p>

It contends that the evidentiary record and its Adjudication both demonstrate that it was presented with, and did, in fact, consider evidence relating to the issue of concentration of economic opportunities during the process of deciding to award the license to Stadium. The Board rejects Market East’s assertion that Stadium is “another Manoukian casino,” because that conclusion disregards the fact that the Cordish Group, which owns 50% of Stadium, is a new entrant into the Pennsylvania gaming market, and that it will have the greatest share of control over the Stadium casino. Board Brief (J-60-2015) at 26.

Finally, the Board points out that the Gaming Act contemplates some degree of economic concentration, and 58 Pa.Code § 421a.5(c) prohibits only “undue concentration of economic opportunities” which stifles competition, something it maintains Stadium’s casino will not do.

The Gaming Act, by its legislative design, does not, as a matter of law, regard multiple ownership interests in and of themselves as creating either a monopoly or undue economic concentration on the part of the possessor of such interests.

Indeed, it is evident from its Adjudication that the Board evaluated and judiciously weighed evidence regarding these factors in arriving at its decision, even though it did not formally announce that it was doing so. <em>See </em>Adjudication at 76-85; 118-120 (discussing physical capacity for gaming offerings currently offered by SugarHouse, the projected physical gaming capacity of Stadium, current revenues generated by SugarHouse, and the projected revenues for Stadium); 79-82 (detailing respective ownership structures of Parx Casino and Stadium); 113 (discussing geographical proximity of Stadium’s proposed facility to existing casinos, and observing that it was far enough away from those facilities to create a “buffer” between them); 114-16 (discussing how the ownership structure of Stadium affected its ability to compete in the Philadelphia gaming market); 120, 122-23 (recognizing the effect of existing competition among casinos in the Philadelphia area for customers as undergirding Board’s decision to select the “right sized” casino for the market, not the largest casino); 124 (analyzing the degree of “cannibalization” of revenues from all existing casinos by the opening of each of the proposed casinos); 126-28 (discussing how SugarHouse has “substantially benefited” from being the only Philadelphia area slot machine licensee to date, the legislature’s considered judgment that Philadelphia was able to sustain two such facilities, the general market conditions extant in the Philadelphia gam<a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>ing market at the time of the licensing proceedings, the effect of casino closures in nearby Atlantic City on customer demand, and how competition in the Philadelphia area gaming market would be enhanced by the opening of a second casino); 155 (discussing the number of permanent casino jobs which each project would create).

Market East argues that, under the plain language of Section 1304(a), if a person or entity, or any affiliate of the person or entity, is eligible to apply for a Category 1 license, then the person, entity or affiliate is, <em>“per se," </em>ineligible to apply for a Category 2 license. Market East assails what it considers the Board’s disregard of this statutory restriction when it issued the Category 2 license to Stadium based on the Board’s alleged failure to consider Manoukian’s role in the ownership structures of both Stadium and Parx Casino. Market East claims that, at the time of Stadium’s initial application, Stadium was ineligible to apply because Manoukian, as one of Stadium’s “affiliates,” was “eligible to apply” for a Category 1 license by virtue of his ownership interest in Parx Casino, through Greenwood—a Category 1 license holder. Market East contends that, even under Stadium’s revised post-licensing structure, it was still ineligible to apply for the Category 2 license, since, in its view, Manoukian retained a controlling interest in Stadium, through what it regards as Manoukian’s continuing control of Sterling Fiduciary.</p>

Further, Market East asserts that Greenwood continues to be eligible to apply since it is required under the Gaming Act to submit a renewal application for its Category 1 license every three years. Market East additionally assails what it considers to be the Board’s overall failure to address the issue of the licensing requirements of Section 1304(a)(1) in its Adjudication, which omission it contends is reversible error.

The Board notes that, under Section 1304(a), a holder of a Category 1 license is required to be a racetrack facility which conducts racing on a specified number of days during the year, and which otherwise maintains an active role in the racing business. The Board regards Section 1304(a)’s prohibitions against a Category 1 license holder also holding a Category 2 license as designed to ensure that the holder of a Category 1 license would not also be eligible to acquire a Category 2 license for the same racetrack facility, as this would enable the Category 1 license holder to operate a casino without having to continue to conduct live racing, thereby subverting one of the primary legislative goals of the Gaming Act—the enhancement of the sport of live horse racing in the Commonwealth.</p>

Board Brief (J-60-2015) at 31 (citing 4 Pa.C.S. § 1301). The Board suggests that this legislative focus on expediting the approval process to get slot machine facilities operational as quickly as possible supports the conclusion that Section 1304(a)’s terms relating to the application process refer to <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>first-time applications for licenses after the Gaming Act took effect, not their subsequent renewal.</p>

The Board notes that, when it conducted the initial licensing process contemplated by Section 1304(a) in 2006, Greenwood applied for, and was awarded, one of the six Category 1 licenses which were initially made available. The Board asserts that, once it acquired this license, Greenwood’s status changed from that of an applicant to a license holder. As such, according to the Board, once Greenwood was awarded the Category 1 license for Parx Casino it was no longer eligible to apply for that license.</p>

The Board contends that this would create an absurd result where a Category 1 license holder would be considered eligible to apply during the three-year period that his or her license is active, and would only be out of “eligible to apply” status for the period of time his or her renewal application is pending before the Board. Consequently, the Board considers Greenwood, at the time of Stadium’s application, to have been a Category 1 license holder, which was no longer eligible to apply for a Category 1 license. The Board considers Market East’s arguments regarding the ownership structure of Stadium to be irrelevant to our interpretation of the requirements of Section 1304(a) and, instead, more salient to the question of whether the requirements of Section 1330 were met.</p>

This lends support to the Board’s contention that, once an initial applicant for a Category 1 license for a particular facility is successful, the application process has come to an end, and the applicant is, thereafter, a license holder for that facility subject to the Act’s license renewal requirements. <em>See </em>4 Pa.C.S. § 1103 (defining “applicant” as “[a]ny person who, on his own behalf or on behalf of another, is applying for permission to engage in any act or activity which is regulated under the provisions of this part.”). Thus, we reject Market East’s assertion that a person seeking renewal of an already-issued Category 1 gaming license must be regarded as “applying for” that license. However, Sections 1325 and 1326 are not dispos-itive of this question, as they do not establish the cintería which make a person “eligible to apply for a Category 1 license.”</p>

We conclude that, so long as a person holding a Category 1 license for one facility meets the criteria set forth in Section 1302 with respect to another facility, the person continues to be “eligible to apply for a Category 1 license” for the other facility.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_27" id="ref_footnote_1_27">27</a> We cannot determine from this record, however, whether Manoukian was “eligible to apply for a Category 1 license” for another facility at the time Stadium filed its application for the Category 2 license, since, as Market East points out, the Board failed to address the issue of the licensing requirements of Section 1304(a)(1) in its Adjudication.

Market East Brief (J-60-2015) at 31-32. Market East reminds that, during the licensing process, the Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement and the Board itself had serious concerns about whether Manoukian’s interests in both Greenwood and Stadium violated Section 1330, and that Stadium specifically developed and entered into the record its proposed post-licensing structure as a deliberate “work around,” to ensure that the equity interests of Manoukian would be within the statutorily mandated proportions after the license was granted. <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>

Market East Brief at 35. Market East contends that these factors, as well as certain financial transactions and arrangements made by Manoukian, the full details of which are outlined in the sealed record in this matter, collectively establish that these transfers were a “sham,” as Manoukian yielded no actual ownership or control of Sterling Fiduciary. Market East claims that the nature of these transactions raises a legitimate presumption that Ma-noukian continues to hold the controlling interest in Sterling Fiduciary and that this arrangement contravenes Section 1330. Market East decries the Board’s failure to address <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>these matters in its Adjudication, as well as its lack of discussion as to whether its consideration of Stadium’s post-licensing structure was appropriate under the Act.

Thus, the Board considers the assets, which Sterling Fiduciary possesses in the capacity of trustee, to be held for the benefit of others, and, thus, that Sterling Fiduciary cannot be regarded as either owning or having a financial interest in those assets. Hence, the Board reiterates its contention, advanced in its Adjudication, that none of the assets Sterling Fiduciary holds in the Sterling Investors Trust can be considered to be owned by Manoukian and, thus, that the only share of Stadium properly attributed to Manoukian is derived from his ownership interest in Greenwood multiplied by Greenwood’s ownership interest in Stadium—yielding a total ownership interest of 28%. The Board maintains that, even if Manoukian somehow controlled Sterling Fiduciary, that control would be irrelevant for purposes of a Section 1330 analysis, since that section only establishes restrictions on a slot machine licensee’s possession of an “ownership” or “financial interest” in another slot machine licensee, but does not <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>contain any prohibitions on the licensee’s ability to control another licensee.</p>

As this factual determination of Manoukian’s financial interest in Stadium post-licensure is necessary to ascertain whether Stadium’s post-licensing structure ran afoul of Section 1380, and since it is not our role to make such a determination in the first instance, we must remand to the Board for further proceedings with respect to this question.</p>

Stadium argues that this issue is waived since SugarHouse did not appeal the Board’s order as a collateral order at the time of its entry. Specifically, Stadium contends that the order of the Board denying the intervention of SugarHouse as to “issues of compliance with Sections 1304 and 1330” was a collateral order since it meets all three criteria established by Rule of Appellate Procedure 313(b) which define such an order: (1) it is "separable from and collateral to the main cause of action”; (2) it involves a right "too important to be denied review;” and (3) the question presented is such that if review is "postponed until final judgment” in the case, the claim will be "irreparably lost.” Stadium Brief (J-59-2015) at 8 (quoting Pa.R.A.P. 313(b)). Stadium reasons that, because the order limiting SugarHouse’s intervention was collateral, under our Court’s decision of <em>In re Barnes Foundation, </em><a href="/pa/582/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="582 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="650304,650365" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0370-01,/pa/582/0370-02">582 Pa. 370</a>, <a href="/pa/582/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="871 A.2d 792" data-case-ids="650304,650365,8979914,8979949" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0370-01,/pa/582/0370-02,/a2d/871/0792-01,/a2d/871/0792-02">871 A.2d 792</a> (2005) (holding that individuals denied intervention in Orphan’s Court proceeding regarding restructuring of a charitable trust could not appeal from final order approving the restructuring, but, rather, were required to appeal from order denying intervention, as their lack of party status deprived them of standing to appeal), it was immediately appealable within 30 days of the date of its entry, and SugarHouse’s failure to take an appeal within that time period deprived our Court of jurisdiction to presently consider its appeal.</p>

The Board also argues that the Office of Enforcement Counsel ("OEC”), which represents the Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement ("BIE"), adequately represented SugarHouse’s interests, at least with respect to section 1330. While OEC is charged with presenting BIE’s findings regarding the rigorous eligibility criteria set forth by the Gaming Act, in this case OEC declined to offer proposed legal conclusions regarding section 1330. Rather, when invited to offer legal argument regarding Watche Manoukian’s section 1330 compliance visa-vis his ownership and financial interests in Stadium Casino, LLC, Chief Enforcement Counsel Cyrus Pitre offered that it was a “complex” issue “taking into consideration the different definitions of an affiliate, an intermediary controlling interest, to decide Mr. Manoukian’s relationship to Sterling [Investors] Trust through Sterling Fiduciary Services” as well as his ownership interest in Greenwood Racing; observed that the determination would be "precedent[-]setting”; and asserted that the legal determination should be left to the Board, Notes of Testimony, Suitability Hearing for Stadium, 1/30/2014, at 85-86, Mr. Pitre added that he was "a little hesitant to give [his] opinion, which could, you know, impact how the Board makes its decision or comes to ... its interpretation.” <em>Id. </em>at 86. Thus, Chief Enforcement Counsel Pitre not only left open the legal question as to which Sugar-House wished to advocate but emphasized that his reason for doing so was to <em>avoid </em>influencing the Board’s interpretation of section 1330. This is the polar opposite of advocacy, and as to law and facts alike, a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding depends upon full and fair adversarial presentations. That being said, the majority does not clearly hold that OEC represented SugarHouse’s interests, focusing instead upon the fact that Market East presented arguments “duplicative” with those SugarHouse has presented before this Court and concluding that Market East adequately represented SugarHouse’s interests. I agree with that assessment.</p>

Op. at 359, 136 A.3d at 471. In <em>Penn Hills, </em>we recognized that, "[generally, once intervention is allowed the interve-nor is afforded all the rights of a party to the action,” and that, under the rules of the Allegheny County Board of Property Assessment, "an intervenor participates in the appeal with all the attendant rights of any other party.” <a href="/pa/519/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="519 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="1813567" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0164-01">546 A.2d at 52</a>. We also noted that, in assessing appellate rights in an administrative proceeding, "we must refer to the controlling administrative rules, as well as the enabling legislation, to determine what if anything was waived at the time this intervenor was admitted to participate in the appeal.” <em>Id. </em>at 53. <em>Penn Hills </em>did not involve the Gaming Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder, and it did not address the effect of limited intervention before an administrative body upon the standing of the intervenor on appeal.</p>

Further complicating our inquiry, a close examination of the Board's regulations reveals a confusing set of terms and definitions. First, only a “party” has a right to appeal. 58 Pa.Code § 494a. 11(a). A party is “[a] person who is named in or admitted to a proceeding before the Board and who has a direct interest in the subject matter of the proceeding.” 58 Pa.Code § 491a.2. An "intervener <em>[sic </em>],” however, is defined as “[a] person who petitioned to intervene in a proceeding and who was admitted by the board as a <em>participant </em>to a proceeding.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). A participant, in turn, is defined as "[a] person admitted by the Board to limited participation in a proceeding.” <em>Id. </em>Thus, on a plain reading of the regulations, it credibly may be maintained that a person granted limited intervention, <em>i.e., </em>a “participant,” has no standing to appeal, insofar as the regulations appear to distinguish participants from parties and restrict the right to appeal only to the latter. Conversely, an intervenor might be allowed to appeal on the basis that both an intervenor and a party are defined by reference to the “admission” to a Board proceeding. This confusion may create difficulties in a future case.</p>
