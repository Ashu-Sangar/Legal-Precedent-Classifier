As to the jurisdictional aspect (appealability), the majority explained that, in the <em>Kincy </em>decision, this Court held that an order issued under Rule of Civil Procedure 213(a) purporting to consolidate two separate actions “for all purposes” could not be accorded such effect, where different parties and different theories of liability were involved. <em>See Malanchuk v. Sivchuk, </em>1379 EDA 2012, <em>slip op. </em>at 8 (Pa.Super. Dec. 4, 2013) (explaining that <em>“Kincy </em>holds that each action retains its separate identity despite the entry of a consolidation order under Pa.R.C.P. 213”). In the majority’s view, absent a complete consolidation—which only can occur among cases sharing the same parties and claims— “consolidated” cases simply do not merge, and their separate identities remain extant for purposes of judgment and appeal-ability. Since the <em>Sivchuk </em>and <em>Tsimura </em>eases involved different defendants, the majority found that the appeal from the final disposition of the latter was proper.</p>

In this regard, the dissent highlighted the policy of limiting piecemeal appeals. <em>See generally Rae v. Pa. Funeral Dirs.
