As to the latter six of those listed issues, Johnson has not demonstrated that he is entitled to relief. In a portion of the first of his seven issues, Johnson alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate, discover, and present two alibi witnesses at trial. With respect to that claim alone, Johnson has demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact exists such that the PCRA court should have held an evidentiary hearing. Hence, we vacate the PCRA <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>court’s order on that claim, and we remand this case to the PCRA court for an ineffectiveness hearing on the alibi issue alone.</p>

In 1991, the Commonwealth charged Johnson with first-degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a), criminal conspiracy, 18 Pa.C,S. § 903, possessing an instrument of crime, 18 Pa.C.S. § 907, and recklessly endangering another person, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2705, Those charges concerned the June 10, 1993 homicide of John McDonald on a street in Philadelphia. The Commonwealth filed similar charges against Robert Holmes and Lamont Bruce. The three defendants were tried together before a jury.</p>

Some of the individuals in this group were drinking beer. Carr did not know the surnames of Billy or Rocky. At one point during the gathering, the home’s electrical power suddenly went out. Paul McDonald went inside and then downstairs to flip the tripped circuit breaker back into the on position. Carr explained at trial what happened while Paul McDonald was inside the house:</p>

Paul McDonald, the victim’s uncle, came back outside and spoke to Billy about the incident. Billy denied that he had touched Carr. He accused Rocky of being the culprit.</p>
    <p id="b736-5" data-blocks='[["BL_736.5",736,[276,969,1152,257]]]'>The victim arrived at the residence a short time later. Carr met the victim at his vehicle and explained what had happened on the porch. Visibly angered, the victim told Carr to get into the vehicle, and the two drove up and down the street looking for Billy and Rocky.</p>
    <p id="b736-6" data-blocks='[["BL_736.6",736,[275,1254,1154,526]]]'>The victim found Rocky nearby and chased him until Rocky ran into a nearby house. Lamont Bruce (also known as Wayne), who was one of Johnson’s co-defendants, approached the victim and told him that his aggressive and accusatory behavior was disrespectful to Bruce’s aunt, who apparently owned the residence into which Rocky had fled. The victim explained that he did not mean to be disrespectful, but that he only wanted to locate the person who had touched Carr inappropriately. Bruce grew angrier, and stated that “I am going to have to have you knocked off.” N.T., 5/28/1992, at 6.</p>
    <p id="b736-7" data-blocks='[["BL_736.7",736,[273,1809,1154,578]]]'>The victim returned to his vehicle and retrieved a car phone. As he walked, the victim saw Billy and confronted him, threatening Billy with physical violence if he touched Carr again, N.T., 5/27/1992, Vol. II, at 81. The victim and Billy immediately began arguing about whether Billy had touched Carr’s buttocks. Billy denied fondling Carr. The victim removed the chain that he was wearing around his neck and the rings on his fingers, acts that the people on the aunt’s porch recognized as a step in preparation for a fight. Paul McDonald pulled the victim away to prevent the fight that was about to ensue. Billy then fled the scene.</p>

      <a id="p677" href="#p677" data-label="677" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*677</a>Bruce remained at the scene and continued to argue with the victim, repeating his prior assertions that the victim was being disrespectful by being aggressive on his aunt’s porch. The victim went to his vehicle and removed a two-by-four piece of lumber from the trunk, placing it under his car. Bruce, believing that the victim was going to the car to retrieve a weapon, stated that “this nigger wants to die tonight.” <em>Id. </em>at 63. By this point, someone had called the police, who had arrived in a marked police van. Paul McDonald and his brother-in-law, Ardell McDaniel, took the victim a few houses away to talk to the police. After that discussion, the police left the scene.</p>
    <p id="b737-4" data-blocks='[["BL_737.4",737,[181,1009,1153,577]]]'>Soon after the police departed, Carr looked toward the parking area of a Pep Boys automotive service station and noticed a white Chevrolet Blazer in the empty lot. She also noticed Johnson and Robert Holmes, another of Johnson’s co-defendants, walking from the Blazer toward Bruce, who was on the porch of his aunt’s nearby residence. Johnson and Holmes talked to Bruce for a brief period, and then approached Carr and Jennings. One of the men yelled out to Carr, “where is your punk boyfriend now?” <em>Id. </em>at 56. Jennings sent for Paul McDonald, believing that something dangerous was afoot.</p>
    <p id="b737-5" data-blocks='[["BL_737.5",737,[181,1610,1156,790]],["BL_738.1",738,[276,354,1151,468]]]'>Ardell McDaniel arrived first. Holmes asked if Ardell McDaniel was one of the people involved in the earlier argument. Someone yelled out that he was not one of them. One of the men in the Johnson-Holmes-Bruce group then yelled to Carr and Jennings that “he didn’t give a fuck about [the victim’s] bitch, and the man was going to die tonight.” N.T., 5/27/1992, Vol. I, at 59. Carr then took the radio that the group had been listening to into the house at 4837 Marion Street, so that she and Jennings could go inside and shut the door and windows. When she came back outside, she saw Paul McDonald walking back towards the 4837 Marion Street house with the victim walking behind him. When Paul McDonald arrived, Holmes and Bruce were standing nearby. Some witnesses reported seeing Holmes brandishing a gun. Bruce told Paul McDonald that he hoped that the victim would <a id="p678" href="#p678" data-label="678" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*678</a>die. Paul McDonald responded by telling Bruce that the victim had calmed down, and that violence was unnecessary. The victim then arrived at the residence. Notably, all of the Commonwealth’s witnesses, including police officers who had interacted with him, stated that the victim had calmed down by this point and just wanted to resolve the situation. Nonetheless, Johnson ran between two parked cars and fired approximately six shots at the victim. Johnson, Holmes, and Bruce then ran from the scene.</p>
    <p id="b738-5" data-blocks='[["BL_738.4",738,[274,856,1149,248]]]'>Meanwhile, Carr had reentered the house to take the radio upstairs, whereupon she heard gunshots. She ran outside, and saw the victim fall to the ground. People scattered from the scene, and Carr saw a group of men running toward the white Blazer.</p>
    <p id="b738-6" data-blocks='[["BL_738.5",738,[275,1138,1150,466]]]'>Carr did not see anyone fire the shots, nor did she see anyone carrying a gun. Two days after the shooting, in an attempt to have Carr identify the men involved in the victim’s death, police detectives provided Carr with two envelopes, each of which contained eight photographs of black men. Carr was unable to make any positive identifications from the photographs. However, during her trial testimony, Carr identified Johnson, Bruce, and Holmes as the perpetrators of the murder.</p>
    <p id="b738-7" data-blocks='[["BL_738.6",738,[273,1638,1152,581]]]'>Nancy Jennings, who was Paul McDonald’s wife and the victim’s aunt by marriage, had departed the scene after the victim and Billy argued about whether Billy had touched Carr’s buttocks. Jennings returned when she saw the white Blazer pull into the Pep Boys lot. She testified at trial that she saw Johnson move between two parked cars and shoot the victim. She immediately ran into the residence and called the police. Initially, Jennings had told the police that Bruce shot the victim. Later, Jennings selected the three defendants, Johnson, Bruce, and Holmes, from photographs provided to her by the police.</p>

Jennings testified that she had named Bruce only because she was in a state of shock, which caused her to speak too quickly when interviewed by the police. At trial, Jennings also identified Bruce and Holmes as Johnson’s cohorts on the night in question. She testified that Holmes was carrying a gun when the trio returned to the scene immediately before the shooting occurred, but that she never saw Bruce with a gun. Paul McDonald also selected all three defendants from police photo arrays shortly after the shooting, although he had seen Johnson only for a matter of seconds.</p>

She knew each of the defendants in various ways for a number of years. Francis Bruce identified Johnson as the person who shot the victim. She also selected Johnson’s picture from a photo array shortly after the murder. However, Francis Bruce, an admitted crack cocaine addict, had been smoking the narcotic earlier on the day of the murder. Despite being a crack addict and despite having smoked it that day, Francis Bruce claimed at trial that she was not high when the victim was shot. After the murder occurred, Francis Bruce testified, she smoked more crack cocaine.</p>

McDaniel identified Johnson as the shooter, although he also had seen Johnson only for a few seconds prior to the shots being fired. McDaniel followed Johnson and the other men after they entered the white Blazer and fled. Eventually McDaniel stopped trailing the Blazer, because someone in the vehicle began firing shots at him. Later, McDaniel was unable positively to select Johnson’s photograph from a police photo array. However, McDaniel was able to narrow the photographs to two (from eight), and selected Johnson as the person who looked “the <a id="p680" href="#p680" data-label="680" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*680</a>most familiar of the men involved in the shooting.” N.T., 6/1/1992, at 31.</p>

When Officer Franklin arrived, a large crowd of people had congregated around the residence. Officer Franklin immediately noticed the victim lying in front of 4835 Marion Street. Officer Franklin observed that the victim was bleeding from the stomach area.</p>

He quickly learned that the victim had been arguing with another black male prior to the shooting after the black male had groped the victim’s fiancée’s buttocks. Officer Franklin first spoke to Paul McDonald. Paul McDonald told Officer Franklin that, soon after the argument, the alleged groper went into a nearby house, whereupon a different black male arrived on the scene in a white vehicle. This newly arrived person, described by Paul McDonald as a black male with a light complexion, a heavy build, and approximately five feet seven inches tall, exited the white vehicle, approached the victim from the rear, fired several shots at the victim from a handgun, and then reentered the vehicle and drove away.</p>

Detective Schol located a bullet directly below the strike mark, as well as shell casings on the sidewalk in front of 4837 <a id="p681" href="#p681" data-label="681" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*681</a>Marion Street and the neighboring residences. The casings all were fired from the same weapon. During the autopsy, five bullets were removed from the victim’s body. All five of those bullets were fired from the same gun.</p>

Officer Beres was able to lift twelve prints from the vehicle. Eugene Famiglitti, an expert in fingerprint identification from the Philadelphia Police Department’s Fingerprint Identification Unit, received the lifts obtained by Officer Beres and compared those lifts with the known fingerprints of the three co-defendants. Famiglitti was able to match some of the fingerprints to Holmes to a reasonable degree of certainty.

Paul McDonald was brought to the police station and sequestered in a room. In the meantime, counsel for Holmes and Johnson met with their clients, and then with Detective Wynn. After consultation with their clients, the attorneys produced sworn statements from Holmes and Johnson indicating that they refused to participate in the line-up process, including in the selection of the stand-in volunteers that comprised the remainder of the line-up. As a result, the line-up was canceled.

During the time that Morris observed the argument, the victim acted aggressively and abusively. He repeatedly used foul language and insulted the neighbors and the neighborhood. Morris saw the victim go to his car and retrieve an item from his trunk, although she could not identify the item. Morris then felt that she had seen and heard enough to convince her that something violent or dangerous was afoot. She went inside her house and called the police, who arrived shortly thereafter. Once the police left, Morris went back inside her residence. A few minutes later, she heard gunshots. When Morris went outside, she saw the victim on the ground.

Bruce had followed the victim, who had been chasing Rocky and screaming that he was going to kill Rocky. The victim was screaming obscenities that were directed at the neighbors and the neighborhood.

Many of the Commonwealth’s witnesses could not identify Johnson as the shooter from photo arrays shortly after the murder, but were able to identify him positively as such at trial. On the other hand, the defense portrayed the victim as aggressive, uncontrollable, and in possession of a weapon. The defense witnesses described Lamont Bruce as a peacemaker and an observer to the murder, not a participant. Every one of the defense witnesses testified that they did not see Johnson at the scene of the murder.

In <em>Batson, </em>the United States Supreme Court established a three-part inquiry to evaluate claims that a prosecutor engaged in racial discrimination during jury selection. First, a defendant must make a <em>prima facie </em>demonstration that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges upon the basis of race. Second, the burden then shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the particular juror.

Most, if not all, of the information that these individuals would have presented to the jury if called as witnesses was cumulative of the testimony already in the record. Hence, no prejudice to Johnson arose by virtue of their absence. Kelly Morris, William Maynor, and Elisha Savage all told the police that they observed the victim go to his vehicle and retrieve a weapon. The record is rife with testimony, from Common<a id="p711" href="#p711" data-label="711" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*711</a>wealth and defense witnesses alike, that the victim went to the trunk of his car at some point during the encounter and retrieved some type of a weapon, although the witnesses did not agree on the type of weapon that the victim procured. For instance, Commonwealth witnesses Carr and Francis Bruce both testified that the victim went to his car and removed a wooden object from the trunk. Sarah Morris and Jody Morris, both defense witnesses, testified that the victim went to his car and obtained a weapon, though neither could identify that weapon. Defense witness Sherri Stewart watched the victim go to his car and return with what she believed was a gun. The record is replete with evidence proving that the victim went to his car and retrieved an item, presumably to use as a weapon or in defense of himself. In this particular instance, failure to introduce more of the same does not equate to prejudice.</p>

This contrasted with the Commonwealth’s witnesses, who testified that only three people approached the victim right before the shooting. Even if Morris’ and Taylor’s reports were accepted as true, we fail to comprehend how this information would either have exonerated Johnson or undermined confidence in the verdict. The fact that there may have been more people than the Commonwealth’s witnesses observed in no way means that Johnson was not one of those people. Moreover, the central issue at Johnson’s trial was identification. The case essentially boiled down to the jury having to decide whether to believe the witnesses who claimed to have seen Johnson shoot the victim or those who claimed <a id="p712" href="#p712" data-label="712" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*712</a>that he was not there at all. Testimony regarding the number of people that approached the victim right before the murder would have been insignificant, if relevant at all, to the jury’s deliberations. Consequently, even if Johnson could satisfy all of the other elements of the failure to call a witness test, he cannot demonstrate that the outcome of the trial would have been different had these witnesses been presented to the jury.</p>

Tracey Green would have testified that her boyfriend, Franklin Snead, used the Blazer on the night in question and admitted to getting in trouble with the police for doing so. None of this information would exonerate Johnson or otherwise benefit him in a manner that would undermine the verdict. That the victim pushed Lamont Bruce is immaterial to Johnson’s misidentification defense; Johnson did not present a self-defense or defense of others defense. Were Robert Holmes absent from the scene, this also would have little bearing upon the issue of whether Johnson was the person who pulled the trigger. This testimony would not have undermined the credibility of all of the witnesses who identified Johnson to the degree that the verdict would have been different. Finally, any testimony regarding Snead and the Blazer would not have impacted the jury’s decision to credit the Commonwealth’s witnesses instead of the defense witnesses.

She also would have testified that <a id="p713" href="#p713" data-label="713" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*713</a>Johnson did not have a gun on that date, and that, when he returned after the fifteen minute interval, he acted normally, not out of breath, nervous, or in any manner consistent with someone who had just killed another person. Handy would have told the jury that Johnson does not hang out on Marion Street, and that, when he left her presence, he walked in the opposite direction of Marion Street. White would have corroborated Handy’s alibi testimony, offering that she was with Handy and Johnson for most of the day. White also would have testified that she was with Johnson for the fifteen minutes that he left Handy’s presence, as she went with Johnson up the street to throw dice.</p>

The PCRA court concluded that neither Handy’s nor White’s testimony amounted to an alibi because “neither precludes the possibility that [Johnson] shot the decedent,” PCRA Ct. Op. at 8. For purposes of deciding whether there is a genuine issue of material fact warranting an evidentiary hearing, proposed alibi testimony is not so narrowly construed. A gap in the time that Handy was with Johnson does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>disqualify the alibi proffer. To so hold, without at least receiving testimony, would mean that no proffered alibi could be successful unless the proposed testimony would account for the defendant’s movements during every second of the day in question.</p>

This sequence of events may well be possible in that time frame, or it may well be that Handy and White are lying. We do not know. Neither did the PCRA court.

We observe that the trial evidence is not so overwhelming that a hearing would be futile on its face. Although many of the witnesses that testified against Johnson identified him as the shooter, much of that eyewitness testimony was riddled with credibility problems. For instance, Carr could not select Johnson from photo arrays administered shortly after the murder, but was able to identify him over one year later. She also testified <a id="p715" href="#p715" data-label="715" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*715</a>that she did not see the shooting itself. Francis Bruce, a crack cocaine addict who had consumed the narcotic on the day in question, observed the shooter for only a few seconds. She initially identified someone other than Johnson as the shooter. Nancy Jennings initially told the police that Lamont Bruce shot the victim, but later changed her story and identified Johnson. Paul McDonald identified Johnson, but his observations of the shooter lasted mere seconds. Ardell McDaniel, who had been drinking alcohol on the night in question, identified Johnson as the shooter at trial. However, he initially could not select Johnson from a photo array. Instead, he narrowed the photos from eight to two photos, and eventually selected Johnson from the photos because he looked “the most familiar of the men involved in the shooting.” N.T., 6/1/1992, at 31. The fact that the trial court issued a <em>Kloiber </em>instruction supports the notion that the Commonwealth’s identification testimony was not ironclad. Hence, the Commonwealth’s evidence was not so overwhelming or unassailable as to deny Johnson the opportunity to present his alibi witnesses at a hearing as he attempts to prove that counsel was ineffective for failing to discover, investigate, and present those witnesses to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b775-5" data-blocks='[["BL_775.4",775,[175,1596,1155,805]]]'>The Commonwealth contends that Johnson’s claim necessarily fails because trial counsel offered “unrebutted testimony” at the PCRA hearing that he had no recollection of being informed by Johnson that Handy and White existed. Brief for the Commonwealth at 22. The Commonwealth points out that counsel also testified that he would have interviewed these witnesses had they been brought to his attention. It is true that counsel’s testimony went unrebutted at the evidentiary hearing. Yet this was not a result of Johnson’s inaction. Rather, as noted earlier, the PCRA court limited that particular hearing to trial counsel’s testimony. Johnson was not permitted to call any other witnesses. Despite this initial proscription, at the conclusion of the hearing, the PCRA court offered Johnson the opportunity to present additional testimony at a future time.</p>

What is clear is that, at all times, Johnson maintained that he was entitled to relief and requested evidentiary hearings to satisfy his evidentiary burden. In fact, Johnson requested a hearing as recently as 2014, when he filed his amended PCRA petition in response to this Court’s remand for reconstruction of the record. <em>See </em>Amended PCRA Petition, 6/15/2014, at 12 ¶ 42, 16 ¶ 62. Because Johnson has maintained his request for a full evidentiary hearing from the inception of the post-conviction proceedings, we cannot accept the Commonwealth’s argument that Johnson’s claim should be denied outright based exclusively upon trial counsel’s testimony. In sum, Johnson’s claim that trial counsel failed to investigate, discover, and produce Handy and White as alibi witnesses raises genuine issues of material fact that warrant an evidentiary hearing. We remand this case only for a hearing on the purported alibi witnesses. We agree with the PCRA court that Johnson has not demonstrated that he is entitled to a hearing with regard to the fact witnesses.</p>

Id. </em>From my point of view, <em>Kloiber </em>does not merely require that jurors be told that unreliable evidence should be treated as being unreliable; rather, it mandates that jurors are to be instructed that they must view eyewitness testimony with caution when it meets the specified criteria. <em>Accord Commonwealth v.
