Eventually, the parties entered into a loan modification agreement that increased Glover’s principal balance, monthly payment, and repayment period.

      <em>inter alia, </em>that Udren had violated Act 6 by charging unearned and excessive attorney’s fees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Because it was undis-putedly not a residential mortgage lender under Act 6, <em>see </em>41 P.S. § 101 (defining “residential mortgage lender” as “any person who lends money or extends or grants credit and obtains a residential mortgage to assure payment of the debt”), Udren filed preliminary objections, asserting that Glover had failed to state an actionable claim.</p>
    <p id="b684-4" data-blocks='[["BL_684.4",684,[271,779,1156,1243]]]'>The common pleas court agreed, finding that Udren’s conduct as a debt collector was governed by the Fair Credit Extension Uniformity Act (“FCEUA”), 73 P.S. §§ 2270.1-2270.6. <em>See Glover v. Udren, </em>No. GD-11-018015, <em>slip op. </em>at 5, <a href="/citations/?q=2012%20WL%208746652" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2012 WL 8746652">2012 WL 8746652</a> (C.P.

In terms of Act 6, because Section 406 refers only to residential mortgage lenders, the common pleas court concluded that any violation of that provision does not give rise to a remedy against Udren under Section 602. It therefore sustained preliminary objections and dismissed Glover’s complaint. While addressing related claims under the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (“UTPCPL”), 73 P.S. §§ 201-1 to 201-9.3, the common pleas court stated, “the Legislature would not have intended for legislation that is not specifically directed to debt collectors to provide a remedy for conduct that is explicitly excluded from legislation that is directed to debt collectors.” <em>Glover, </em>No. GD-11-018015, <em>slip op. </em>at 10-11.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b685-4" data-blocks='[["BL_685.4",685,[187,741,1157,1051]]]'>A divided panel of the Superior Court affirmed, holding that, because Section 406’s plain language regulates only the conduct of residential mortgage lenders, Section 502 does not authorize an action against a lender’s counsel for a Section 406 violation. <em>See Glover v. Udren Law Offices, PC, </em><a href="/a3d/92/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="92 A.3d 24" data-case-ids="6956751" data-case-paths="/a3d/92/0024-01">92 A.3d 24</a> (Pa.Super.2014). The majority rejected Glover’s contention that “person,” in Section 502, evidenced a legislative intent to make a broad set of actors liable for Section 406 violations, because the term was necessary to address, throughout Act 6’s various provisions, conduct by actors other than residential mortgage lenders. <em>See <a href="/a3d/92/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="92 A.3d 24" data-case-ids="6956751" data-case-paths="/a3d/92/0024-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a3d/92/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="92 A.3d 24" data-case-ids="6956751" data-case-paths="/a3d/92/0024-01">at 30-31</a> (“While the majority of the provisions in Act 6 apply to residential mortgage transactions, Act 6 also addresses conduct by actors other than residential mortgage lenders.... Thus, the definition of ‘person’ in section 101 makes clear that when the term ‘person’ is used, it is not limited to residential mortgage lenders.”). The majority reasoned that, had the Legislature intended Section 406 to reach law firms acting on behalf of residential mortgage lenders, it would have used express language to that effect in the text.</p>

According to Glover, Act 6’s plain language belies the Superior Court majority’s narrow construction, as it contemplates the liability of a “person,” unambiguously and broadly defined. Udren’s conduct is actionable because Udren is a “person” that collected illegal fees in connection with its’representation of the residential mortgage lender in foreclosure proceedings, she alleges.</p>
    <p id="b686-6" data-blocks='[["BL_686.6",686,[275,1795,1150,360]]]'>Glover continues that the Superior Court majority’s interpretation of Act 6 holds only residential mortgage lenders that collect their own debt accountable for the collection of illegal attorney’s fees.

According to <em>amici, </em>homeowners are often charged unearned attorney’s fees, in violation of Act 6, that increase the cost of averting foreclosure. <em>Amici </em>continue that the Pennsylvania Legislature sought to rectify abuses by several parties to the system, including residential mortgage lenders and their proxies.

It maintains that Section 502 is a generic civil-action provision, and a construction that expands Section 406 liability would require judicial revision of the statutory language. Further, relying on the common pleas court’s suggestion, <em>see Glover, </em>No. GD-11-018015, <em>slip op. </em>at 10-11, Udren claims that the Legislature would not have impliedly created liability for attorneys as debt collectors in Act 6, a usury statute, while expressly exempting them from such liability in the FCEUA, which is designed to regulate debt collection specifically. <em>See </em>78 P.S. § 2270.8.</p>
