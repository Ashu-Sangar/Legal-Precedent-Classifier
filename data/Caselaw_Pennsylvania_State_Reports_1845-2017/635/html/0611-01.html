A Local 1813 official sent a letter to all IAFF union members in the area informing them of a collective bargaining dispute between Local 1813 and Chambersburg and requesting union members, who also serve as volunteer firefighters, refrain from providing their volunteer services to Chambersburg until the dispute was resolved.

This case may be of limited utility because of its unusual factual posture, as it involves a public employer, a union representing paid professional firefighters, and volunteer firefighters, who happened to be IAFF members as a result of their employment as professional firefighters outside the borough. Secondary boycotts are prohibited to prevent the bringing of undue economic pressure upon a secondary employer who is not involved in the primary labor dispute between an employer and a labor organization. <em>Kerr v.

Both the NLRA and Pennsylvania’s labor relations statutes, which include the PLRA and the Public Employe Relations Act (PERA), 43 P.S. §§ 1101.101-1101.2301, speak <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>in terms of “employment,” “employer,” and “employee.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> In this case, Franklin is not an “employer” under either the PLRA or PERA and its volunteer members, who are free to decline to provide their services for any reason or no reason, are not “employees” under either statute.

Indeed, I find merit in the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board’s argument there are substantial differences in the statutory language of the NLRA and the PLRA. The NLRA makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization “to engage in, or to induce or encourage any individual employed by any person engaged in commerce ... to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course of his employment ... to perform any services” with the objective of “forcing or requiring any persons ... to cease doing business with any other person....” <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 158">29 U.S.C. § 158</a>(b)(4)(i)(B) (emphasis added). In contrast, Section 211.6(2)(d) of the PLRA prohibits a labor organization from “engaging] in a secondary boycott.” Section 211.6(2)(d) lacks language prohibiting inducement or encouragement, indicating an actual strike or refusal to provide services must occur for an unfair labor practice to be found. In this regard it is also notable Section 1201(b)(7) of PERA prohibits a labor organization from “[ejngaging in, or inducing or encouraging any individual employed by any person to engage in a strike or refusal to ... perform services ...” with the objective of forcing a public employer to cease dealing or doing business with any other person. 43 P.S. <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>§ 1101.1201(b)(7) (emphasis added). Thus, as demonstrated by Section 1201(b)(7) of PERA, if the General Assembly intended the PLRA to prohibit the mere inducement or encouragement of a refusal to provide a service, it easily could have included the requisite language in the statute.</p>

However, the related provision in the PLRA prohibits unions or their members only from “engaging] in a secondary boycott.” 43 P.S. § 211.6(2)(d). The language disparities between these two statutes suggest that they should be read differently. By broadening the definition contained within the PLRA to extend to inducement and encouragement, the Commonwealth Court’s opinion may lead employers to file unfair labor practice claims that our General Assembly never intended to allow.</p>

It may well be difficult to imagine how the Union involved in this case could accomplish a traditional secondary boycott in view of the fact that firefighters are prohibited from striking under Act 111 and the fact that the volunteer firefighters are not employees of Franklin Fire Company. Nevertheless, this is a question that implicates the merits, and not an impediment to jurisdiction.</p>
