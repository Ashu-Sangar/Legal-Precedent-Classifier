Appellants are the owners of a 62-acre parcel of land (the “Property”) located in Ward Township, Tioga County, which they purchased from Colgate University in 1990. Unbeknownst to Appellants, on February 21, 1894, Appellants’ predecessors in interest, Ezra and Emma Baxter (the “Baxters”), reserved by recorded deed one-half of the oil and gas rights to the Property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In May 2006, Appellants leased to Anadarko the oil and gas rights to the Property for a term of five years, expressly warranting title in all of the oil and gas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> As consideration, Anadarko agreed to pay Appellants a bonus payment of $80 per acre. Anadarko sent Appellants a Lease Purchase Report and an Order of Payment reflecting a bonus payment of $80 per acre on 62 acres, totaling $4,960. Prior to tendering the bonus payment, however, Anadarko’s land agent <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>discovered the Baxters’ 1894 reservation of one-half of the oil and gas rights to the Property, and informed Appellants that Anadarko would pay a bonus on only 31 of the 62 acres. Thereafter, Anadarko sent Appellants a revised Order for Payment, describing the subject Property as “a tract of land containing 62.00 gross acres, 31.00 net acres,” and indicating that, as consideration for the agreement, Anadarko would pay Appellants a total of $2,480. Order for Payment (R.R. at 19a). Appellants did not sign the revised Order for Payment, but subsequently accepted Anadarko’s payment of $2,480. Critical to the instant appeal, two years after executing the Lease, Appellants filed a motion to quiet title on the Baxters’ previously-reserved one-half interest in the oil and gas rights to the Property, which the trial court granted.</p>

Appellants did not cash the check, however, based on their belief that Anadarko had leased the oil and gas rights to only one-half of the Property, and, thus, that Anadarko overpaid them by $2,170. On October 21, 2011, Appellants filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the Lease “only pertains to oil and gas contained on 31 acres” of the Property. Complaint, 10/12/11, at 4 (R.R. 5a). In response, Anadarko filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that Appellants were estopped, both by their contractual promises and by the doctrine of estoppel by deed, from denying that the Lease grants Anadarko 100% of the oil and gas rights to the Property.</p>

Appellants further maintained that Ana-darko’s 2006 revised bonus payment of $80 on 31 net acres of the Property constituted a modification of the Lease. Appellants contended that, because Anadarko leased only one-half of the oil and gas rights to the Property, Anadarko could extend <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>the primary term of the Lease only as to one-half of the oil and gas rights to the Property.</p>

Moreover, the trial court determined that, under the doctrine of estoppel by deed, Appellants’ subsequent acquisition of title to the previously-reserved one-half interest in the oil and gas rights to the Property passed to Anadarko under the terms of the Lease, and that Appellants’ covenant of warranty in the Lease estops them from arguing otherwise.
