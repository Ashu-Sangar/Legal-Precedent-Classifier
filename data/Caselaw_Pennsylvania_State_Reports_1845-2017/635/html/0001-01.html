Judge R. Stanton Wettick reasoned that while the interests of insurers and insureds generally align when the insurer has accepted responsibility for defense and indemnity, the parties’ interests increasingly diverge the more the insurer believes the policy does not cover the claims, as when the insurer defends under a reservation of rights. He observed that, in a reservation of rights case, an insured would prefer to cap the potential liability as it ultimately may be responsible for the full settlement in the event that insurer is successful in its challenge to coverage, whereas the insurer does not want to settle as it would relinquish its challenge to coverage. Tr. Ct. Op., July 5, 2011 at 5.

The trial court, then, molded the verdict to include prejudgment and post-verdict interest. Insurer appealed to the Superior Court seeking application of the <em>Cowden </em>bad faith standard. The Superior Court recognized that this case presents an issue of first impression in Pennsylvania, which has nonetheless been addressed by various state and federal courts. The court further observed that the question is subject to well-settled basic principles of Pennsylvania insurance law. The court emphasized that insurance policies are contracts at heart, controlled by the language of the policy, but which include unique policy concerns requiring that any ambiguity be interpreted in favor of the insured.</p>
    <p id="b69-4" data-blocks='[["BL_69.4",69,[185,1194,1156,529]]]'>The court reiterated that Pennsylvania distinguishes between the duty to provide coverage and the broader duty to defend, which applies when the claim may potentially come within the coverage of the policy. The panel acknowledged that the insurer’s broad duty to defend is balanced by an insurer’s option to defend subject to a reservation of rights. It emphasizes that the utilization of the reservation of rights is not a breach of contract but instead is encouraged, as it provides insureds with a defense in all cases of potential coverage while coverage is being determined.</p>

The panel recounted concerns raised in other courts that insurers will be less zealous in defense and less willing to settle if the <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>insurers believe that they will ultimately not be liable for coverage. Acknowledging insureds’ interest in settling reservation of rights cases, the Superior Court noted that allowing insureds to settle seemingly violates the clear language of the policy requiring the insurer’s consent to settlement and presents the potential for collusion between an insured and a plaintiff.</p>

The second category, which is championed by ANI in the case at bar, includes <em>Vincent Soybean &amp; Grain Co., Inc. v. Lloyd’s Underwriters of London, </em><a href="/f3d/246/1129-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="246 F.3d 1129" data-case-ids="11111821" data-case-paths="/f3d/246/1129-01">246 F.3d 1129</a> (8th Cir.2001), and resembles Pennsylvania’s <em>Cowden </em>bad faith standard, although Pennsylvania cases have not applied the standard when the insured has settled absent an insurer’s consent. <em>Vincent Soybean </em>and other like cases emphasize that an insured breaches the insurance policy when it settles without the insurer’s consent. These cases, therefore, have required the insured to demonstrate that the insurer acted in bad faith in refusing to settle before requiring insurer to pay the settlement. The Superior Court opined “that the <em>Morris </em>and <em>Vincent Soybean </em>approaches tilt the playing field too much in favor of, respectively, the insured or the insurer.

The insurer properly provided independent counsel to the insured, while contesting its coverage obligations. The insurer, however, refused to engage in settlement negotiations because it contended that the tort defense would be successful. Nonetheless, the insured ultimately settled with the victim’s estate for $507,500, where the insured agreed to pay $7,500 and the estate agreed not to make further claims against insured but to seek the additional $500,000 from insurer, which constituted the policy limits. When victim sought to recover the $500,000 from insurer, insurer defended claiming that the insured had breached the policy by settling. In response, insured claimed that insurer breached the policy by reserving its rights and by refusing to approve the settlement.</p>

It recognized its prior caselaw, similar to our analysis in <em>Cowden, </em>finding that the insurer can commit bad faith by refusing to settle in an appropriate case. It extended this analysis to cases where an insurer defends its insured subject to a reservation of rights and denies consent to a reasonable settlement offer. The court recognized that the insurer does not breach its duty by denying consent because the policy provides that the insurer has control over the defense and any settlement. Instead, the court, similar to Insureds’ argument in the case at bar, held that the denial of consent to a reasonable settlement offer releases the insured from its duty not to settle absent the insurer’s consent.</p>

It notes that the <em>Morris </em>fair and reasonable standard fails to take into account the difference between this type of "soft” reservation of rights, which is unlikely to alter the interests of the parties, and a "hard” reservation of rights.

The issues presented in this case only arise in a subset of reservation of rights cases where the interests are not aligned in considering settlement. Indeed, the parties in the case at bar recognize that insureds' and insurers' interests are generally aligned even in many reservation of rights cases where settlement is in the best interest of both insurer and insured. Where the interests are not aligned, both parties are often acting with substantial uncertainty as they consider settlement. There is uncertainty whether the insurance policy covers the claim, whether the insured will be determined to be liable to the plaintiff for the damages, and, if the insured is liable, whether the damages will exceed the policy’s coverage limits. While an insurer must act as a fiduciary toward its insured, it is obligated only to provide coverage for which the insured paid premiums.</p>

This sentence broadly suggests that the insured can settle any claim for which the insurer defends subject to a reservation of rights. We agree with <em>Amici, </em>however, that not all reservations of rights are equal, see <em>supra </em>at 19 n. 13, 131 A.3d at 455 n. 13. The mere fact that an insurer restates that it will not cover what the insurance policy does not cover, where it arguably might be part of the damages sought, does not automatically result in allowing the insured to settle the entire suit. Parties and courts may need to consider whether a particular reservation of rights justifies diverging from the contract’s cooperation clause, a question which is not squarely before this Court.</p>

ANI’s reservation of its rights under the same contract did not alter this fundamental principle. The Superior Court majority treated ANI’s reservation of rights letter as a trigger for the “insured’s choice” of rejecting coverage under the express terms of the contract, <em>Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, </em>at 22, and the majority here interprets ANI’s reservation of rights as a pivotal action “asserting that the claims may not be covered by the policy.” Majority Op., at 4, 131 A.3d at 447. But, a typical reservation-of-rights letter is neither of these things; it simply puts the insured on notice—reminds the insured, actually—of various existing contractual provisions that might ultimately preclude coverage under the policy, depending upon what discovery and litigation reveals about the claims and potential liability. A reservation of rights—without more—does not change the terms of the contract, does not constitute a refusal to defend or a breach of contract, and therefore should not authorize the insured to take anticipatory action violating that contract. Thus, ANI’s conduct in reserving its rights, in the absence of bad faith, was not a repudiation or breach of the insurance contract allowing appellants to settle without permission. Moreover, under <em>Cowden, </em>an insured may recover payment from an insurer for an excess verdict or to reimburse an unauthorized settlement—essentially, damages resulting from the insurer’s breach of contract—but only if the insured can establish by clear and convincing evidence that the insurer breached its duty to act in good faith. <em>Cowden, </em>at 229.
