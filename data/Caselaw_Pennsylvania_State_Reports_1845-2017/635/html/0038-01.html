Nevertheless, since the Commonwealth clearly had committed to pursuing the relevant aggravator and the Appellant’s proposed question did not require jurors to commit to a particular result, but rather, concerned whether they could fairly consider the evidence at large and the trial court’s instructions, I do not find this factor to be dispositive.
