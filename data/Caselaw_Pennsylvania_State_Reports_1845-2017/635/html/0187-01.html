I dissented from the majority’s determination that undue prejudice as to the issue of falsity could be eliminated by a jury instruction that the opinions could only be considered for purposes of malice, at least in the context of a unified trial—that is, a single trial involving both questions. <em>See id. </em>at 257, <a href="/pa/633/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="124 A.3d 1229" data-case-ids="12280346,6847952" data-case-paths="/pa/633/0230-01,/a3d/124/1229-01">124 A.3d at 1246</a> (Saylor, C.J., concurring and dissenting). Thus, if left to my own devices, I would presently approve the Superior Court’s holding that redaction of various newspaper articles is necessary to the extent they quote or otherwise reference the Garb and Feudale opinions.</p>

Furthermore, since the <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>intermediate court’s decision concerning the need for redaction was based in large part on a holding which has now been reversed, it seems likely that, on remand, the intermediate court will need to reach a different conclusion on the redaction issue in order to remain consistent with <em>Castellani II.</em>

    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[174,658,1157,1228]]]'>As part of my responsive expression in <em>Castellani II, </em>I noted that bifurcation of the trial could “go a long way toward eliminating any unfair prejudice that the Newspaper would otherwise suffer from introduction of the [Garb and Peudale] opinions.” <em><a href="/pa/633/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="124 A.3d 1229" data-case-ids="12280346,6847952" data-case-paths="/pa/633/0230-01,/a3d/124/1229-01">Id.</a> </em>In response, the majority suggested that any bifurcation request would be “appropriate for the trial court upon remand if requested by the Newspaper.” <em>Castellani II, </em><a href="/pa/633/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="633 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="12280346" data-case-paths="/pa/633/0230-01">633 Pa. at </a>256 n. 13, <a href="/pa/633/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="124 A.3d 1229" data-case-ids="12280346,6847952" data-case-paths="/pa/633/0230-01,/a3d/124/1229-01">124 A.3d at </a>1245 n. 13. I would observe, however, that: the Newspaper previously requested bifurcation at the trial court level; the request was denied; and the Newspaper’s challenge to such denial was one of the issues it raised before the Superior Court in the present appeal. <em>See Castellani v. Scranton Times, </em>No. 1145 MDA 2012, <em>slip op. </em>at 15-20, <a href="/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2010917594" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2014 WL 10917594">2014 WL 10917594</a> (Pa.Super. June 10, 2014). Notably, that tribunal chose not to reach the merits of the issue based on its determination that the articles had to be substantially redacted. <em>See id. </em>at 24. On remand, therefore, the bifurcation issue will again be pending before the Superior Court. In this regard, to the extent the <em>Castellani II </em>majority’s expression can be read to indicate that a second request for bifurcation must now be made by the Newspaper and ruled on initially by the trial court, it was <em>dicta, </em>as the bifurcation question was not before the <em>Castellani II </em>Court.</p>
