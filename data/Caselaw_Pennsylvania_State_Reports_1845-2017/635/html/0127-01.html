Act 46 augmented Section 691 of the School Code so that the Secretary of Education could declare the School District distressed if it failed certain budgetary requirements or would fail to provide an educational program in compliance with the School Code, the State Board of Education’s regulations, or the Secretary’s standards. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 6-691(c), Act 46 also added Section 696 to the Distress Law, which provided that when the School District was declared distressed under Section 691(c), the Secretary was to appoint a chief executive officer (“CEO”) to oversee it. <em>See id. </em>§ 6-696 (1998). The CEO was given the power to suspend or revoke charters and, notably for present purposes, to suspend regulations of the State Board of Education and <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>“the requirements of this act,” <em>i.e., </em>the School Code. <em>Id. </em>§ 6-696(i)(3) (1998).</p>

These revisions provide that on a declaration of distress, a five-member School Reform Commission (“SRC”)—mostly appointed by the Governor—is to be named to oversee the School District, thus assuming various powers formerly assigned to the CEO. The amendments give the SRC, which is an instrumentality of the school district exercising the school board’s authority, sweeping powers, including “all powers granted to the superintendent by law and a special board of control under section 693[.]” 24 P.S. § 6-696(i).

In 2001, the School District granted it a five-year charter which the SRC renewed for an additional five years in 2006. As the charter’s expiration approached in 2011, the Charter School again sought renewal. The SRC responded by passing Resolution 20 of 2011 (“SRC-2011-20”).</p>

However, the Charter School was not in corrective action status. Thus, the. SRC’s suspension of Section 17-1729-A(a.1) had the effect of removing the requirement that a charter school be in corrective action status prior to the SRC placing conditions in a renewed charter. SRC-2011-20 also set forth other requirements for the renewal of the charter, including that the Charter School must agree to enroll no more than 400 students notwithstanding that, under the Charter School Law, charter schools are not subject to school-district-imposed enrollment caps. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 17-1723-A(d)(1) (providing that a school district’s governing authority may not impose an enrollment cap on a charter school absent the charter school’s consent).</p>

Additionally, its enrollment exceeded 400 students. The School District began reimbursing the Charter School for only 400 students. Thereafter, the Charter School requested, and ultimately received, funding for the additional students from the Department of Education pursuant to Section 1725-A(a)(5) of the Charter School law. That provision requires a school district to pay a charter school for each enrolled student; it also states that, in the event the district fails to make such payment, the Secretary must deduct the deficiency from Commonwealth payments that would otherwise be made to the district. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 17-1725-A(a)(5). The consequence is that, for the Charter School’s enrollment in excess of 400 students, some monies that the Department would have paid over to the School District were instead provided to the Charter School.</p>

The SRC reduced expenditures and made staff reductions. However, these retrenchments were insufficient to keep pace with revenue shortfalls. Thus, the SRC passed Resolution 1 of 2013 (“SRC-2013-1”), stating that the School District was in the midst of an untenable financial crisis. SRC-2013-1 suspended a number of sections of the Charter School Law, as well as “any applicable regulations,” on the grounds that the SRC “desire[d] to remove limitations on its power to suspend charters[J” SRC-2013-1 at 4. One category of suspended provisions concerned the nonrenewal or revocation of charters, in particular: Section 17-1729-A(a), which provides the causes and grounds for nonrenewal or revocation; Section 17-1729-A(c), which requires that a public hearing be held regarding any decision to revoke or not renew a charter; Section 17-1729-A(d), which establishes a procedure for charter schools to appeal a school district’s revocation or nonrenewal determination to the State Charter School Appeal Board; and Section 17-1729-A(f), which clarifies that, while an administrative appeal is ongoing, the school’s charter remains in effect. The resolution indicated that these additional suspensions “shall not be effective until a policy containing a set of standards and procedures is adopted by the [SRC].” <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>
    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[268,1616,1154,614]]]'>SRC-2013-1 also expanded the SRC’s authority to impose student performance targets on charter schools. As noted, Section 17-1729-A(a.1) permits the imposition of student performance targets only when the charter school is in corrective action status. SRC-2013-1 stated that the SRC “needs more flexibility in declining to renew a poor-performing charter school and desires to require all charter schools to meet specific reasonable student performance targets[.]” SRC-2013-1 at 6. Accordingly, this portion of SRC-2013-1 abrogated Section 17-1729-A(a.1)’s limitation that only schools in corrective action status may be subject to performance targets as a condition of charter renewal. <em>See id.</em>

Accordingly, SRC-2013-1 suspended those provisions, permitting the SRC to place enrollment caps unilaterally on any charter school. Finally, SRC-2013-1 eliminated the ability of charter schools to receive funding for enrolled students directly from the Department of Education. To achieve this, SRC-2013-1 suspended Section 17-1725-A(a)(5) and all associated regulations. <em>See </em>SRC-2013-1 at 7.</p>

The Charter Schools Policy states, <em>inter alia, </em>that charter schools must accept enrollment caps imposed by the SRC. It also provides that, in the absence of an agreement between a charter school and the SRC, the SRC may dictate the terms under which the charter school operates.

The Charter School asserted that this power is in violation of the non-delegation precept of Article II, Section 1 of the state Constitution. The school maintained that, while the Legislature may delegate authority to execute or administer laws, it must establish standards and limit such delegation so that the administrative agency tasked with executing the laws conducts itself in compliance with legislative purposes. <em>See id. </em>at 26 (citing, <em>inter alia, Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion Fund v.

Rather, Section 6-696(i)(3) constitutes a lawful delegation of the General Assembly’s power to suspend laws pursuant to Article I, Section 12 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>See </em>Pa. Const. art. I, § 12 (“No power of suspending laws shall be exercised unless by the Legislature or its authority.” (emphasis added)). While there is superficial appeal to the Charter School’s contention that the suspension power is so broad that it effectively enables the SRC to “legislate,” a close examination of the challenged provision and the statutory scheme of which it is a part reveals that the SRC is empowered only to suspend those <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>provisions of the Public School Code that result in financial distress to the school district for the limited period during which the economic crisis of the school district continues.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> Because Section 6-696(i)(3) does not authorize the SRC to legislate by making, altering, or repealing the law, it is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</p>

The SRC does not hold the power over basic policy choices inherent in the Public School Code, but may only exercise its discretion to suspend those provisions that preserve the school district by remediating identified types of financial distress.</p>

The standards guiding the SRC’s exercise of discretion in determining which provisions of the Public School Code to suspend appear both in Section 6-696(i)(3) itself, which enumerates several provisions that may not be suspended, as well as in the Distress Law as a whole, which, as noted, makes clear that remediation efforts are aimed at resolving the financial distress of the school district. A suspension of a provision of the Public School Code that is immaterial to the contemplated advancement of financial stability is simply unauthorized. Although the suspension power granted to the SRC is somewhat broad, it is necessarily so, as the breadth of the standard is driven by the breadth of the problem, and the problem here is unquestionably great. <em>Accord.

The Distress Law requires the SRC to submit annually a report to the Governor and the Education Committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding progress made toward improvements in fiscal and academic performance. 24 P.S. § 6-696(n.2). The General Assembly therefore brings to bear a multi-branch review of both the performance of the SRC in abating distress and, ultimately, whether financial distress continues to exist at all. By requiring the SRC to report annually to the Commonwealth’s chief executive and the legislative committees, the Distress Law holds the SRC accountable to perform in accordance with the remedial purposes of the Distress Law. Finally, the Distress Law authorizes the Governor to remove a member of the SRC prior to expiration of the term of office upon proof by clear and convincing evidence of malfeasance or misfeasance. <em>Id. </em>§ 6-696(b)(2). In my view, the improper exercise of an enumerated power, such as the suspension power, could constitute grounds for removal of SRC members.</p>

The enormity of the power conveyed and the dramatic effects resulting from exercise of that authority, however, do not render Section 6-696(i)(3) unconstitutional under the anti-delegation clause where the General Assembly made the requisite basic policy decisions inherent in the legislation and afforded adequate guidance to the SRC in exercising the suspension authority. It cannot be ignored that a party challenging a legislative enactment bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that the statute clearly, palpably, and plainly violates the constitution. <em>Commonwealth v.
