Malone Middleman submits that while liability may be warranted with respect to departing partners of a law firm under the UPA, there is no basis for successor firm liability where the tether of fiduciary duties is lacking.

It finds inconsequential that <em>Ruby </em>involved a partner to a law firm who brought the underlying case to the successor law firm, rather than an employee of the predecessor law firm (with no equity in the firm), as occurred here. This distinction, Meyer Darragh contends, merely eliminates the need for consideration of the UPA in the resolution of this case because Attorney Weiler was not a partner of Meyer Darragh and, thus, the Eazor estate litigation did not constitute “unfinished business” of a partnership.</p>

First, notwithstanding that illness prevented Attorney Weiler from ever working for Malone Middleman, Meyer Darragh contends that Attorney Weiler acted as the agent of Malone Middleman, thereby rendering Malone Middleman, as principal, bound by Attorney Weiler’s prior agreements. Second, Meyer Darragh relies on a federal district court decision in <em>Berger &amp; Montague, P.C. v. Scott &amp; Scott, LLC, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/153/0750-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="153 F.

Finally, Meyer <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>Darragh analogizes the instant case to a landlord/tenant scenario, surmising that because a lease is a contract allegedly obligating a subsequent purchaser to the terms and conditions of the preexisting lease/contract, so too should Malone Middleman become bound by Attorney Weiler’s previous contracts when it hired him.</p>

To the contrary, it submits, Meyer Darragh did not have a possessory right to any contingency fees when Malone Middleman commenced representation of the Eazor estate. Malone Middleman asserts that when a client discharges counsel and severs the contractual relationship, any recovery of a contingency fee must be based on the nature of the work performed up to that point; where the contingency has not occurred, the fee has not been earned. Here, Malone Middleman concludes, because settlement had not yet been reached when it began representing the Eazor estate, Meyer Darragh’s only right to fees would have been through a <em>quantum meruit </em>action or via its contract with <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>Attorney Weiler. It argues that Meyer Darragh declined to pursue a breach of contract action against Attorney Weiler, abandoned its <em>quantum, meruit </em>claim against the Eazor estate before the trial court, and abandoned its <em>quantum meruit </em>claim against Malone Middleman by failing to appeal to this Court the Superior Court’s adverse ruling on that claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Accordingly, Malone Middleman suggests that Meyer Dar-ragh’s abandonment of its available claims cannot create “unfairness” that warrants the remedy of damages on an unrelated and unsupportable claim for breach of contract.</p>

The majority does not address the dilemma, but I fully agree with the expressions of Chief Justice Saylor regarding the predicament in which Meyer Darragh finds itself concerning the <em>quantum meruit </em>issue. <em>See </em>Concurring Opinion (Saylor, C.J.) at 447-48, 137 A.3d at 1259-60.

Further, I would refer to the Appellate Rules Committee the question of amendments to our appellate rules which account for the impact of <em>Lebanon Valley </em>in the procedural context of this case.</p>
