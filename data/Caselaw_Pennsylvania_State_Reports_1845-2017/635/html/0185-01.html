The Superior Court erred, <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>however, in then failing to grant Petitioner’s application for reconsideration of the merits of his waived claims. Accordingly, Petitioner’s Substituted Petition for Allowance, wherein Petitioner seeks a remand to the Superior Court for merits review of his claims on appeal, is hereby GRANTED, the order of the Superior Court is VACATED, and this matter is REMANDED to the Superior Court for consideration of the merits of Petitioner’s claims on appeal.</p>
