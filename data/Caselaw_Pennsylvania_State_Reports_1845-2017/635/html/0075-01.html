Plaintiffs contend that the intermediate court’s interpretation converts paragraph (b.l) into surplusage, as they state it is difficult to see what purpose a pool of furloughed employees would serve if employment prioritization is only triggered when a program is transferred as a unit. As applied here, Plaintiffs proffer that, because program responsibility for the mathematics instruction of vocational students was transferred to the school districts, including Penn-Trafford, the teachers in the pool retained employment priority as to vacancies occurring at such districts.</p>

They note, in any event, that <em>Hahn </em>was decided before the 1991 addition of paragraph (b.l), which they view as broadening the concept of a “transfer” for purposes of the Transfer Act. Further undermining Hahn’s applicability, Plaintiffs reference <em>Allegheny Intermediate Unit’s, </em>explanation that (b.l) was intended to ensure that teachers at entities other than school districts—such as vocational schools and intermediate units—would have increased protection at a time when many furloughs were anticipated due to the transfer of educational programming to school districts, which in turn resulted from a change in educational program funding. <em>See Allegheny Intermediate Unit, </em>155 Pa.Cmwlth. at 218, <a href="/pa-commw/155/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="624 A.2d 802" data-case-ids="1445838" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/155/0211-01">624 A.2d at 805</a>.</p>

It suggests this still holds true in the wake of the 1991 legislation, for at least two reasons.

It suggests the Legislature did not intend paragraph (b.l)’s hiring preference to be triggered in such event.

The issue is one of statutory interpretation, a question of law over which our review is <em>de novo </em>and plenary. <em>See In re D.L.H., </em><a href="/citations/?q=606%20Pa.%20560" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="606 Pa. 560">606 Pa. 560</a>, 563, <a href="/pa/606/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 A.3d 505" data-case-ids="4199489,7288144" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0550-01,/a3d/2/0505-01">2 A.3d 505</a>, 513 (2010). There is little doubt that the definition of “transfer” employed by the <em>Hahn </em>decision— meaning, “to carry or take from one person or place to another,” <em>Hahn, </em>132 Pa.Cmwlth. at 64, <a href="/pa-commw/132/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="571 A.2d 1115" data-case-ids="1401219" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/132/0060-01">571 A.2d at </a>1117—is in accord with the plain meaning of the word and, as such, is applicable here, since neither the Code nor the Statutory Construction Act otherwise defines the term. <em>See </em>1 Pa,C.S. § 1903(a) (generally directing that words and phrases should be construed according to common usage). The contested issue is whether a transfer of students, as opposed to programs or classes, between entities is sufficient to invoke the employment protections afforded under paragraph (b.1).</p>
    <p id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[268,1366,1153,634]]]'>A careful review of the statutory text reveals that, although the rights conferred under paragraph (a) are limited to situations in which a program or class is transferred as a unit, paragraph (b.l) is markedly different and does not suggest such a limitation. First, entrance into a pool of teachers can be predicated on the mere receipt of a formal notice of suspension. This condition, which is listed in paragraph (b.l)’s initial sentence, constitutes a separate and independent basis for inclusion in the pool, as demonstrated by the legislative use of disjunctive phraseology, As such, it applies even where no classes or programs have been transferred from the school entity in question.</p>
    <p id="b144-6" data-blocks='[["BL_144.6",144,[267,2025,1152,365]],["BL_145.1",145,[172,354,1154,625]]]'>More important, the operative facet of paragraph (b.l)—its second sentence—grants employment prioritization in situations where another school entity “assum[es] program responsibility for transferred <em>students </em>[.] ” 24 P.S. § 11—1113(b.1) (emphasis added). While this may occur when a class or program is transferred, it may also occur when students are transferred between identical or substantially similar edu<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>cational programs, as occurred in the present matter. The Legislature appears to have intended to include this latter possibility because, unlike paragraph (a), paragraph (b.l) makes no mention of any transfer of classes or programs. Indeed, to the contrary, it does not refer to transferred classes at all and, instead, centers on the circumstance that a school entity assumes program “responsibility.” <em>See generally Commonwealth v. Elliott, </em><a href="/pa/616/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="616 Pa. 524" data-case-ids="4209450" data-case-paths="/pa/616/0524-01">616 Pa. 524</a>, 534, <a href="/pa/616/0523-02" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="50 A.3d 1284" data-case-ids="4208779,4209450,7313301,7313310" data-case-paths="/pa/616/0523-02,/pa/616/0524-01,/a3d/50/1284-01,/a3d/50/1284-02">50 A.3d 1284</a>, 1290 (2012) (observing that when the General Assembly uses different words or phrases in a statutory provision, a presumption arises that the legislative body intended those words or phrases to have different meanings).</p>
    <p id="b145-4" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[172,1011,1156,520]]]'>Under these circumstances, it would be tenuous to read into the phrase, “assuming program responsibility for transferred students,” a requirement that a class or program must have been transferred as a unit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> We therefore conclude the General Assembly intended the trigger for employment prioritization under paragraph (b.l) to be broader than that of paragraph (a).

To the degree there is any remaining doubt based on the concept that a school entity’s assumption of program responsibility presupposes that a program has been transferred, we note that the Transfer Act is remedial legislation designed to protect the employment interests of furloughed professional school employees. Hence, the act is to be liberally construed to effectuate its objectives, with doubts resolved in favor of the conferral of such protection. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(c).</p>
