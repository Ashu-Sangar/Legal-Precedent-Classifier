Over the next two years, the PCRA court held seven hearings pertaining solely to Flor’s <em>Atkins </em>claim. On June 2, 2015, the Commonwealth moved for the production of documents, seeking access to “the complete records of [trial counsel] in order to review what trial counsel did and did not do in preparation for this case, to prepare cross-examination of [trial counsel], and to adequately prepare argument regarding [Flor’s] ineffective assistance of counsel claims.” Commonwealth’s Motion at ¶ 13. According to the Commonwealth, trial counsel indicated that they had no independent recollection of the investigation that they conducted to prepare for the penalty phase of Flor’s trial, nor had they retained any copies of documents related to their representation. Recognizing that its discovery request implicated privileged documents, the Commonwealth argued that Flor had waived the protections of the attorney-client privilege<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and work product doctrine<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> by asserting post-conviction claims of ineffective<a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>ness.

The court asked PCRA counsel to provide specific examples of material in trial counsel’s file that was or could be privileged.

Although the Court recognized that, “at first blush,” there might be privileged statements contained within trial counsel’s file, it offered two reasons for its broad discovery order. First, the PCRA court relied upon Flor’s guilty plea, which waived all claims against self-incrimination as to the crimes at issue. <em>See Commonwealth v. </em>

Given this plea, the PCRA court was unable to imagine that there was anything in trial counsel’s file that could be privileged. <em>See </em>N.T., 6/22/2015, at 22-23; PCRA Ct. Op. at 8 (“He plead[ed] guilty. He hasn’t said anything confidentially to his trial counsel....

Although the PCRA court recognized that “trial counsel’s documents should not typically be subjected to wholesale examination by the Commonwealth,” PCRA Ct. Op. at 10, it determined that this case uniquely warranted such an extraordinary remedy so that the Commonwealth could respond to Flor’s claims, particularly inasmuch as trial counsel could not recall the scope of their investigation. Although the PCRA court stated that documents relating to Flor’s direct appeal remained privileged and were not subject to discovery, the court did not confront PCRA counsel’s assertion that trial counsel’s file contained both trial and appellate materials distributed throughout the twelve banker’s boxes.</p>

I believe there is a middle ground, however, which is able to protect both parties’ interests. As a supervisory matter, moreover, it seems appropriate for this Court to supply guidance on the topic for purposes of further proceedings on remand. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>Because of the possibility that materials may be withheld, relative to which a reasonable argument could be made that they should be divulged, one possibility is for the common pleas court to require PCRA counsel to produce a privilege log referencing such items. This would have multiple benefits. First, it would give the Commonwealth an indication of the nature of materials which PCRA counsel has elected not to disclose and, accordingly, afford it an opportunity to contest the withholding of specific documents. Any dispute along these lines could then be submitted to the court for resolution following <em>in camera </em>review. <em>See generally LaValle v. Office of Gen.
