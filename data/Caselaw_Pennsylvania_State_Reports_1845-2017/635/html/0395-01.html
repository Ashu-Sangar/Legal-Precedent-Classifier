First, although Appellee cursorily avers that the third sentence of Section 9542 quoted above suggests that the legislature did not intend that a defendant be precluded from seeking, outside of the PCRA, relief from the collateral consequences of a conviction, we note that this same language was in Section 9542 when this Court held in <em>Ahlbom </em>that, despite the fact that the appellant continued to suffer the collateral consequences of his conviction—including a driver’s license suspension and the possibility of future sentencing and recidivist enhancements—the PCRA was the only method by which he could seek relief. Indeed, the language of Section 9542 has remained unchanged since that time. Furthermore, regardless of the legislature’s view as to the method for obtaining relief from collateral consequences in the abstract, the language of the PCRA clearly requires that an individual seeking relief from the judgment of sentence itself, as in the case herein, pursue his request for relief through the PCRA. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9542 (“This subchapter provides for an action by which persons convicted <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>of crimes they did not commit and persons serving illegal sentences may obtain collateral relief. The action established in this subchapter shall be the sole means of obtaining collateral relief and encompasses all other common law and statutory remedies for the same purpose.”). Thus, while Appellee’s ultimate goal may be to obtain relief from the collateral consequences of his conviction, he is seeking relief from his judgment of sentence; thus, the third sentence of Section 9542 is not relevant to the scenario presented in the case <em>sub judice.</em>

Here, the Superior Court’s published decision recognizes a right to collateral review of a particular ineffectiveness of counsel claim independent of the PCRA, and the Superior Court continues to issue decisions based on its <em>en banc </em>decision in the instant case. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
