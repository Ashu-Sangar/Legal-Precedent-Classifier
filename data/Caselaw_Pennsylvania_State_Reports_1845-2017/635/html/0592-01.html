Hodge regained consciousness and eventually identified Appellant as the shooter. Following a jury trial, Appellant was convicted of the first degree murder of Bass, the attempted criminal homicide of Hodge, and related offenses.

He posits that the right to post-conviction counsel encompasses the right to <em>effective </em>post-conviction counsel. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Appellant continues that, in order to obtain a remedy for a violation of his right to effective post-conviction counsel, there must a forum where he can enforce the right by challenging PCRA counsel’s performance. He further contends that, if his PCRA petition is deemed untimely filed, he falls into a “gap in this Court’s jurisprudence” because he has a right to effective assistance of PCRA counsel, but has no procedural mechanism by which to enforce that right.

It submits that this Court in <em>Holmes </em>examined the <em>Martinez </em>decision and concluded that it did not require a change in post-conviction procedures in states that preclude the presentation of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, but rather created a safety valve to allow for federal review where the underlying claim involved trial counsel ineffectiveness, and initial collateral review counsel did not recognize it. <em>See Holmes, </em><a href="/pa/621/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="79 A.3d 562" data-case-ids="4080350,7302660" data-case-paths="/pa/621/0595-01,/a3d/79/0562-01">79 A.3d at 583</a>.

In <em>Martinez, </em>an Arizona state prisoner filed a federal habeas petition, alleging a claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness, which had never been raised by his counsel during the state collateral proceeding. Because the state collateral proceeding was the first opportunity to challenge trial counsel’s ineffectiveness under Arizona law, the petitioner asserted that he had a constitutional right to effective post-conviction counsel. Although the Supreme Court declined to recognize a federal constitutional right to effective post-conviction counsel, it altered the law of <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>procedural default by creating a narrow exception modifying the Court's previously unqualified statement in <em>Coleman v.

The Court emphasized the importance of effective assistance of counsel at trial and the derivative importance of opportunities to litigate challenges to trial counsel’s performance. Notably, the Court observed that its ruling did not violate any relevant statutory law. <em><a href="/us/566/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="566 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="12188233" data-case-paths="/us/566/0001-01">Id.</a></em>
