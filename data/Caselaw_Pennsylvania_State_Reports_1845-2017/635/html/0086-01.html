In 1974, the General Assembly supplanted the extant system of providing medical treatment via a fault-based insurance system, enacting the Pennsylvania No-fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act (“No-Fault Act”), Act of July 19, 1974, P.L. 489, No. 176.

As a textual matter, and in contrast to the district court’s view, Freedom argues that Section 69.43(c) provides an either/or proposition: that reimbursements must be calculated either on the basis of a provider’s requested amount in its bill or on the basis of data from the carrier or intermediaries. It contends that reading Section 69.43 as merely <em>permitting </em>calculations predicated on these bases, but not excluding others that might otherwise comply with the MVFRL and Section 69.3, renders Section 69.43(c)’s language mere surplusage. Furthermore, Freedom submits that the General Assembly, in enacting Act 6, sought to depart from the uncertainty of assessing a provider’s charges for “reasonableness,” as under earlier statutes, and to replace it with “an objective method:” “[treatments for which a price is found on the Medicare fee schedule are to be reimbursed at 110% of the Medicare fee schedule amount, and Non-Medicare Treatments are reimbursed at ‘80% of the provider’s usual and customary charge.’ ” Freedom’s Brief at 5 (quoting 75 Pa.C.S. § 1797(a)). Freedom suggests that, unless that objective method prevails, insurers will be able to engage in flawed and/or bad faith calculations of reimbursements, and providers will lack the certainty the legislature sought to provide.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Freedom asserts <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>that State Farm’s calculations herein are evidence of such phenomenon, noting that its calculations led it to pay “11 different amount[s] to providers” for the subject medical products between June 2010 and January 2011, and that its reimbursement amounts counteract what it deems the MVFRL’s purpose in creating “non-volatile pricing” of medical products.

State Farm claims that the term “may” imparts discretion, particularly in contrast to the Department’s use of “shall” in Section 69.43(e)’s two earlier clauses. In any event, State Farm contends that interpreting Section 69.43(c) as merely illustrative furthers the MVFRL’s goals of providing coverage to automobile accident victims and containing insurance costs.

State Farm submits that the potential for insurance industry chicanery is relatively low insofar as insurers must still comply with Section 69.3’s definition of “usual and customary charge”—specifically, “[t]he charge most often made by providers of similar training, experience and licensure for a specific ... product or service in the geographic area where the ... product or service is provided.” 31 Pa.Code § 69.3. Finally, State Farm notes that a ruling that Section 69.43 provides mandatory methods for reimbursement calculation could permit providers of products for which no Medicare fee applies, and for which no Medicare data has been collected, to engage in price gouging by requiring insurers to pay whatever amount such providers have billed.</p>

Although, as the district court reasoned, the word “may,” as used in Section 69.43(c), clearly imparts discretion, the parties’ dispute concerns the <em>objects </em>of that discretion. Freedom contends State Farm has the discretion to choose between the provided bases. State Farm, on the other hand, contends it has the discretion, at its option, to choose one of those bases, or others. It notes, as the district court apprehended, that the Department could clearly have used the term “shall,” as it did in the prior two clauses of Section 69.43, to unambiguously require State Farm to use one of the two bases provided for in Section 69.43, but did not. Nevertheless, the Department’s use of “may” to confer discretion does not definitively detail the scope of that discretion, and nothing in the statutes or regulations at issue affirmatively forecloses either party’s construction, as we find both to be reasonable <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>views as to what Section 69.43 provides.

As an initial matter, we note that, since the General Assembly adopted the No-Fault Act, the law in this area consistently implicated two major policy goals: providing coverage for injured persons and providing it at a reasonable cost to the purchaser. <em>See </em>No-Fault Act, § 102(b) (“[I]t is hereby declared to be the policy of the General Assembly to establish at reasonable cost to the purchaser of insurance, a Statewide system of prompt and adequate basic loss benefits for motor vehicle accident victims and the survivors of deceased victims.”); <em>see also Pittsburgh Neurosurgery Assocs., Inc., </em><a href="/a2d/733/1279-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="733 A.2d 1279" data-case-ids="11552051" data-case-paths="/a2d/733/1279-01">733 A.2d at 1282</a> (noting that Act 6 and its amendments to 75 Pa.C.S. § 1797(a) were intended to contain medical costs so as to reduce the rising cost of purchasing motor vehicle insurance “and the resultant increase in the number of uninsured motorists driving on public highways” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Contrary to these aims, Freedom’s suggested interpretation of Section 69.43 as providing exclusive methods of calculating reimbursements would permit providers of medical <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>goods and services not contained on a Medicare fee schedule or the subject of the Medicare contractors’ data to set their prices and seek reimbursement for essentially any amount they choose to bill. <em>See </em>31 Pa.Code § 69.43(c) (providing that an insurer “may utilize the requested payment amount” or carrier data). That is, in the absence of a Medicare fee schedule or carrier data, an insurer would have no other option other than relying on the provider’s bill. In our view, such a result could lead to the unjustified inflation of charges for medical products, exhausting accident victims’ coverage limits, and potentially depriving them of benefits for further necessary medical expenses, as well as increasing automobile insurance rates.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> In this regard, we find Freedom’s interpretation beneficial to a few private interests to the detriment of the public interest, contrary to our rules of construction. <em>Cf. </em>1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1921(c), 1922(1), (4), and (5).</p>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[265,1201,1152,730]]]'>Freedom’s interpretation is also inconsistent with the Department’s definition, in Section 69.3, of “usual and customary charge” as the “charge most often made” by similar providers. As noted, under Freedom’s construction of Section 69.43(c), in the absence of a Medicare fee or carrier data, reimbursements would have to be calculated based on the particular provider’s bill. Of course, a particular provider’s bill may be well below or well above the charge most often made by similarly-situated providers in the geographic region. Accordingly, the only way to bring Section 69.3 and Section 69.43(c) into harmony is to read the latter as <em>permitting </em>insurers to “utilize” the provider’s bill or data from the carrier as a relevant, but not controlling, measure of the appropriate “usual and customary charge” for the product at issue.</p>

As an initial matter, although Freedom appears to be correct that the legislature’s adoption of Act 6 signaled a move from calculating reimbursements based on a general “reasonable<a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>ness” inquiry toward one based on more objectively verifiable data, it does not follow that it potentially mandated an assessment based on whatever providers deemed an appropriate amount to bill. Indeed, although Act 6 adopted some degree of reliance on federally-provided Medicare standards (where such standards exist), nothing in the text or purpose of Act 6 indicates that, in the absence of those standards, it sought to leave insurers at the whim of providers. Indeed, the General Assembly’s use of the language “usual and customary,” in Section 1797, suggests that market data and industry custom will come to bear on the appropriate amount of reimbursement.</p>
