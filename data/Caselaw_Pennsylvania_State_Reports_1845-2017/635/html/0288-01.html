On February 27, 2015, Governor Tom Wolf issued Executive Order 2015-05, “Participant-Directed Home Care Services” (“Executive Order 2015-05” or “Executive Order”), which focuses on individuals who receive, and workers who provide, in-home medical and personal care. The Executive Order establishes, <em>inter alia, </em>an advisory group to ensure the quality of long-term personal assistance services to seniors and persons with disabilities, and a process by which workers who provide such <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>care, and who are employed by the individuals they serve, may obtain a designated representative for discussions with the Secretary of Human Resources regarding various matters including, <em>inter alia, </em>wages and health and retirement benefits.</p>

These petitioners asserted that Executive Order 2015-05 establishes organizational labor rights for domestic home care workers, but was issued without authorization and conflicts with existing Commonwealth labor laws—specifically, the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and the Public Employe Relations Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Similarly, on the same date, David Smith and Donald Lambrecht (collectively, with Jessica Markham, Victoria Markham, Jesse Charles, Pennsylvania Home Care Association, and United Cerebral Palsy of Pennsylvania, “Petitioners”) also filed a Petition for Review in the Commonwealth Court, naming Appellees as respondents.

However, the court issued an order enjoining Governor Wolf from entering into any memorandum of understanding pursuant to Executive Order 2015-OS until disposition of the matter on the merits, establishing an expedited schedule for the filing of briefs on preliminary objections and cross-motions for summary relief, and listing the matter for <em>en banc </em>argument before the Commonwealth Court in September 2015.</p>

Noting the traditional test for standing—requiring an individual to be aggrieved, i.e., to have a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in the outcome of the litigation— President Judge Pellegrini considered caselaw analyzing standing for legislators. Observing that legislative standing-rests upon a concrete injury suffered in the legislator’s official capacity, rather than a mere generalized grievance about the conduct of government that all citizens share, President Judge Pellegrini concluded that the interests impinged by the Governor were not unique, legislative interests, but, rather, were interests common to the general citizenry. In reaching this conclusion, he determined that, at its core, Appellants’ “sole basis for seeking intervention is that the Governor’s Executive Order is illegal and that every time he takes an illegal action, he violates separation-of-powers principles because he is not <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>enforcing the laws that the [Appellants] believe are proper.” <em>Markham v. Commonwealth, </em>176 M.D.2015, at 9 (Pa.Cmwlth. filed June 3, 2015). The judge further explained that legislators do not have standing just because the Governor’s action is purportedly illegal, and the General Assembly may “offer legislation that will preclude or vitiate the Governor’s action.” <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, Appellants were permitted to participate, and subsequently participated, in the matter as <em>amicus curiae.

Appellants’ Brief at 13.

Stated another way, they assert that generalized grievances about the conduct of government do not bestow standing, but that claims that assert a legislator’s vote or official authority has been impaired or nullified are sufficient to do so. <em>Fumo v.

According to Appellants, they have standing for the same reasons presented in <em>Fumo, </em>as the Governor violated the separation-of-powers doctrine by infringing upon their exclusive law-making authority and usurping the power of the General Assembly. Appellants’ Brief at 18. Appellants further outline various types of executive orders, categorizing Executive Order 2015-05 as implementing law, and argue that only executive orders that are authorized by the Pennsylvania Constitution or promulgated pursuant to statutory authority are enforceable. Appellants contend that Executive Order 2015-05 creates law by allowing direct care health providers a process by which to seek representation and collectively bargain. This, according to Appellants, is neither authorized by the Constitution nor by statute, and violates the separation-of-powers doctrine by allowing the Governor to “circumvent” the General Assembly’s exclusive legislative function. Appellants’ Brief at 11. Appellants claim Executive Order 2015-05 effectively denies every member of the General Assembly the opportunity to vote on whether direct care health providers may organize and collectively bargain—a procedure Appellants claim is not currently provided for in our labor laws. Contrary to President Judge Pellegrini’s assessment, Appellants assert they are not contending that they have standing every time the Governor does something that is allegedly illegal, but, rather, that legislative standing is appropriate when the Governor issues an executive order that is neither constitutionally nor statutorily authorized, and, thus, acts in violation of the separation-of-powers <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>doctrine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">6</a> Thus, Appellants seek reversal of the Commonwealth Court’s order denying them intervenor status.</p>

Specifically, Appellees first note that, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, in order to intervene, individuals must have standing, Pa.R.C.P. 2327(3), (4), and to establish standing, one must have an interest that is substantial, direct, and immediate. Pointing to <em>Fumo, </em>Appellees offer that legislators enjoy standing when “a discemable and palpable infringement on their authority as legislators” is present, as compared to a general grievance about the correctness of governmental conduct, about which they do not have standing. Appellees’ Brief at 16 (quoting <em>Fumo, </em><a href="/pa/601/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="972 A.2d 487" data-case-ids="4194041,4194134,7296088,7296239" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0322-01,/pa/601/0322-02,/a2d/972/0487-01,/a2d/972/0487-02">972 A.2d at 501</a>). Similarly, pointing to <em>Wilt, </em>Appellees maintain that, once a vote has been duly recorded and the bill signed into law, a legislator has no standing to sue in his capacity as a legislator. Appellees’ Brief at 16-17 (citing <em>Wilt, </em><a href="/citations/?q=363%20A.2d%20876" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="363 A.2d 876">363 A.2d at 881</a>). Appellees outline federal decisions which they assert deny standing to legislators who claim that an executive action unconstitutionally usurped their power to legislate, but did not prevent the legislators from voting. Appellees’ Brief at 17-20 (citing, <em>inter alia, Raines v. Byrd, </em><a href="/us/521/0811-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="521 U.S. 811" data-case-ids="915902" data-case-paths="/us/521/0811-01">521 U.S. 811</a>, 814, <a href="/us/521/0811-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="521 U.S. 811" data-case-ids="915902" data-case-paths="/us/521/0811-01">117 S.Ct. 2312</a>, <a href="/us/521/0811-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="521 U.S. 811" data-case-ids="915902" data-case-paths="/us/521/0811-01">138 L.Ed.2d 849</a> (1997), and <em>Goode v.

Thus, according to Appellees, to warrant standing, the injury must be to powers unique to the legislature. Applying this standard, Appellees contend that Appellants merely raise a generalized grievance that Executive Order 2015-05 violates <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>state law, and this does not implicate the legislators’ power to vote, either by preventing them from voting on legislation or by prohibiting them from passing legislation in the future. Finally, Appellees warn that to find standing here would give Appellants an unlimited ability to challenge any action or inaction by an official or employee of the executive branch, simply by framing the issue as a violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine. Thus, Appellees seek affirmance of the Commonwealth Court’s decision.</p>

Specifically, almost 40 years ago, in its foundational decision in <em>Wilt, </em>the Commonwealth Court addressed what was then an issue of first impression regarding the standing of a legislator. There, William Wilt, a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, sought to enjoin Frank Beal, the Secretary of Public Welfare, and Grace Sloan, the State Treasurer, from operating the recently completed Altoona Geriatric Center as a mental-health-care facility, and to recoup monies expended in the purportedly improper operation of the center. Writing for the court, then-Commonwealth Court judge, later federal district judge, Glenn Mencer first noted federal standing decisions and concluded that they were in general agreement with the principles of standing in Pennsylvania. Reviewing federal decisions involving standing for legislators, the court noted that state senators were entitled to standing to challenge an alleged illegal tie-breaking vote cast by the lieutenant governor because the legislators had a “plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes.” <em>Wilt, </em><a href="/citations/?q=363%20A.2d%20876" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="363 A.2d 876">363 A.2d at 880</a> (quoting <em>Coleman v.

The senator alleged that the Governor’s failure to submit such nominees to the Senate was improper, as it deprived the senators of their right and duty to advise and consent with respect to the appointment of incumbents of public office. Governor Thornburgh filed preliminary objections arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that Senator Zemprelli lacked standing to bring the action. Citing <em>Wilt </em>for its protection-of-the-right-to-vote standing standard, as well as the <em>Wilt </em>court’s hypothetical regarding a senator’s standing to seek approval or disapproval of gubernatorial appointments, Judge David Craig, writing for the Commonwealth Court, found the standing question turned on whether the Governor had a legal duty to submit nominations to the Senate within a given time period. After determining that the nomination provision was indeed mandatory, the court reasoned that the Governor’s failure to act deprived the senator of his legal interest to advise and consent, and, thus, it conferred standing upon the senator.

Specifically, Governor Thornburgh nominated Daniels by letter to the Senate on December 24, 1980. The nomination was initially held, but on January 27, 1981, reconsidered, and a vote taken. Under relevant statutory law, 71 P.S. § 67.1(d)(4), a majority of the members “elected” to the Senate were required to confirm Daniels’ appointment. Daniels received 25 confirmation votes and 22 votes rejecting her nomination. The President of the Senate, determining that Daniels received a constitutional majority vote, confirmed the appointment. Five senators who voted against the confirmation of Daniels filed a <em>quo warranto </em>action seeking to oust Daniels from her seat, arguing that the constitutional majority should have been computed on the basis of the total number of members “elected” to the Senate, 50—rather than on the number then in office, 48. The senators’ standing was challenged by the respondents, who alleged the senators were afforded the power to cast their vote in the Daniels’ nomination, and, having voted, their special interests ceased. The senators responded that they enjoyed standing as their effectiveness as legislators had been impaired, as their votes were diluted. Concluding that the voting process itself was under attack, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that at least the possibility existed that the senators’ interpretation of the constitutional majority requirement “has resulted in some cognizable injury to [the senators] in their legislative capacity,” and, thus, the court concluded that the senators had standing. <em>Zemprelli, </em><a href="/pa/496/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="496 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1772969" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0247-01">436 A.2d at 1167</a>.</p>

(“HSP”) to construct a portion of its gaming casino on submerged lands in the Delaware River. The state legislators raised two claims of injury. First, they asserted that the Department of Commerce did not have the authority to issue the construction license, but, rather, that the General Assembly had the sole and exclusive authority to grant a legally enforceable interest in, or the license for the use of, submerged lands belonging to the Commonwealth, including those in the Delaware River.

Executive Order 2015-05 does not inhibit or in any way impact Appellants’ ability to propose, vote on, or enact legislation. The order does not touch upon the constitutional or legislative prerequisites for the voting upon and enacting of legislation. Nor does the order prevent Appellants from acting as legislators with respect to advising, consenting, issuing, or approving matters within their scope of authority as legislators. Rather, the legislators’ claim of aggrievement is only that the recently enacted Executive Order 2015-05 is a violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine, in that, they claim, it diminishes the effectiveness of, or is inconsistent with, prior-enacted legislation. Yet, these claims of injury reflect no impact on Appellants’ right to act as legislators, and are more, in our view, in the nature of a generalized grievance about the correctness of governmental conduct. Simply stated, the assertion that another branch of government—here, the executive branch through the Governor’s Executive Order—is diluting the substance of a previously-enacted statutory provision is not an injury which legislators, as legislators, have standing to pursue.</p>
