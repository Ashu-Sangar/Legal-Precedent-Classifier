Many considerations go into whether to accept a case beyond the nature of the issue: the sharpness of the dispute, the quality of the advocacy, the opinions below.

    <p id="b669-4" data-blocks='[["BL_669.4",669,[186,576,1160,886]]]'>In this case, we granted discretionary review to determine when a property is “vacant” for purposes of redeeming property under Section 32(c) of the Pennsylvania Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, 53 P.S. §§ 7101-7505. Section 32, codified at 53 P.S. § 7293(c), generally provides the owner of any property sold under a tax or municipal claim may redeem it by filing a petition within nine months of acknowledgment of a sheriffs deed and paying certain costs. 53 P.S. § 7293(a). An exception to the right of redemption exists, however, for “vacant property.” 53 P.S. § 7293(c) (“there shall be no redemption of vacant property by any person after the date of the acknowledgment of the sheriffs deed therefor”). The statute further provides a property “shall be deemed to be Vacant property’ unless it was continuously occupied by the same individual or basic family unit as a residence for at least ninety days prior to the date of the sale and continues to be so.” <em><a href="/pa/543/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="673 A.2d 898" data-case-ids="461545,7865205" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0578-01,/a2d/673/0898-01">Id.</a></em>

The case offered an apparent question of first impression respecting property vacancy versus continuous occupancy as a residence, and also promised an opportunity to examine the test promulgated below.</p>
    <p id="b669-6" data-blocks='[["BL_669.6",669,[191,1933,1157,464]],["BL_670.1",670,[271,339,1153,444]]]'>As it happens, however, in my judgment, the case has proved not to be an appropriate vehicle for providing guidance on the issue accepted, for several reasons. First, the record concerning the homeowner’s use of the property, and intention respecting the property, is minimal. Second, it is apparent there are foundational issues which are not properly in focus, such as the burden of proof, which would affect any final decision. Third, this case may be of limited utility because of its factual posture, as it involves a financial institution at<a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>tempting to redeem the property rather than the homeowner, which would be the more common circumstance, and which may be the cause of the scant record. Finally, the Commonwealth Court set forth a multi-part test in its published opinion, but then focused primarily upon the habitability of the premises in rendering its decision, making this a less-than-optimum vehicle even for consideration of the wisdom of the test. <em>See <a href="/a3d/111/0807-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="111 A.3d 807" data-case-ids="6888211" data-case-paths="/a3d/111/0807-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a3d/111/0807-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="111 A.3d 807" data-case-ids="6888211" data-case-paths="/a3d/111/0807-01">at 813</a>.

    <p id="b670-6" data-blocks='[["BL_670.7",670,[274,1049,1155,443]]]'>Like Justice Dougherty, I emphasize that our <em>per curiam </em>affirmance should be read neither as an approval nor disapproval of the test developed by the Commonwealth Court. Originally, this case appeared to be a vehicle by which this Court helpfully might define what it means for a property to be “continuously occupied ... as a residence” for purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, 53 P.S. §§ 7101-7505, at § 7293(c). Following briefing and advocacy from the parties, it turns out that this is not the case.</p>
    <p id="b670-7" data-blocks='[["BL_670.8",670,[273,1509,1156,788]]]'>The question presented on this appeal is not as simple as might appear at first blush. As the Commonwealth Court recognized, resolution of the matter requires a fact-intensive inquiry into the nature of an owner’s use of a particular property. Upon close review, the record in this case lacked the requisite inquiry into the facts, and advocacy from the parties did nothing to elucidate matters. Future cases may well present opportunities to consider and refine the Commonwealth Court’s non-exclusive list of factors and to apply them against a more developed fact record and within the context of more robust advocacy. Because we were unable to develop fully the legal issues before us, we must bide our time and allow these issues to incubate further within the lower courts, with the understanding that today’s order reflects neither an endorsement nor a rejection of the Commonwealth Court’s test.</p>
