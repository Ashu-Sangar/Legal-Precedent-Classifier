    <blockquote id="b332-15" data-blocks='[["BL_332.11",332,[315,1660,1113,524]]]'>[The School District] deliberately chose commercial properties, such as Petitioners’, for selective assessment appeals, but did not appeal assessments of any single-family-home properties, although the latter are significantly underas-sessed. The Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution prohibits disuniformity in taxation. Is a school district’s decision to appeal property assessment insulated from review because, <em>inter alia, </em>the school district has a statutory right to file appeals and can identify an economic reason for its appeals?</blockquote>
