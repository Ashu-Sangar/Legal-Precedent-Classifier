The shooting was caught on the carwash’s surveillance video, which showed Brown cleaning the tire rims of his car and Appellant approaching him from behind and shooting him in the back of the head. Following the shooting, Appellant fled the scene, and Robert Green, a carwash employee who watched the shooting take place on a monitor inside the carwash’s office, called 911. Shortly thereafter, Philadelphia Police Officer Richard Hayes arrived at the scene and observed Brown lying face down with his knees on the ground, a bullet hole in his head, and two spent cartridge casings on the ground next to his body, which ballistics evidence later confirmed were fired from the same gun. Brown was transported to Temple Uni<a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>versity Hospital, where he was pronounced dead the following day. An autopsy later confirmed that Brown died as a result of a single gunshot wound to the head.</p>

As Officer Kuzowsky approached the woman, he spotted Appellant running from the carwash. Sensing that something was amiss, Officer Kuzowsky made a U-turn and began following Appellant to the 2000 block of Buckius Street, where Appellant stopped outside of a home to speak with two individuals. Officer Kuzowsky turned on his hazard lights to make it appear as though he was waiting for someone, but Appellant noticed him, made eye contact, and pulled a black gun out of his sleeve. At that point, Officer Kuzowsky sped past Appellant, made a right onto Coral Street, and drove toward Valetta Street, at which time he stopped and exited his vehicle. Continuing to monitor Appellant’s movement, Officer Kuzow-sky watched Appellant climb into a gray Nissan pickup truck at the intersection of Coral and Buckius Streets, and proceed northbound on Coral Street. Officer Kuzowsky then returned to his vehicle and began following the truck at a high rate of speed for approximately two to three minutes until he decided to end the pursuit for safety reasons.</p>

Specifically, he described that, on the night of Friday, April 18, 2008, he was conversing outside of a bar with the family of his acquaintance “Weewee,” who indicated that a “guy with a beard” recently had stolen a gun from one of them. N.T., 11/6/13, at 66-68. Appellant detailed that, the next day, he was at the bar shooting pool with Brown, Weewee, Bobby Harris, and a man named TJ, when the men began asking whether anyone had heard about someone taking the gun or had seen anyone trying to sell a gun. Appellant testified that he informed the group that he knew who had the gun, but that the man “wasn’t going to just give it back to them.” <em>Id. </em>at 71. He then recounted that he told the group that the man wanted $400 for the gun, but <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>emphasized that “[he] wasn’t just going to send them around there to him because [he] would have to worry about it coming back here to [him] trying to do something to me for doing something to him.” <em>Id. </em>at 72. Appellant explained that, at that point, the men thought that he was trying to cover for the man who stole the gun, which caused the conversation to escalate, and ultimately resulted in security asking the men to leave. Appellant testified that, as they were leaving, the men told him “It’s cool. We won’t holler at you,” which Appellant viewed as an indication that they were “probably going to try to do something to me.” <em>Id.</em>

Appellant stated that TJ and Brown—whom he described as carrying an AR-15 firearm—were also pursuing him, but he was able to run away. Appellant noted that he had additional encounters with the men twice more that day, leaving him “scared,” “upset,” and with “no regard for anything at that point.” <em>Id. </em>at 88-89. Appellant then described that, approximately 15 to 30 minutes after his last encounter with Brown, he was walking past the carwash when he noticed Brown’s car parked inside. Appellant related that, at that point, he “was so enraged and scrambled that ... [his] passions [were] inflamed” and he believed that “either [he] was going to get killed or [he] would have to kill one of them,” or “this ain’t going to stop,” ultimately causing him to “snap” and shoot Brown inside the carwash. <em>Id. </em>at 92-93.</p>

The jury later convicted Appellant of both crimes, and the trial proceeded to the penalty phase, during which the Commonwealth offered evidence regarding Appellant’s prior murder, kidnapping, robbery, and rape convictions stemming from a 2008 incident, and Appellant offered evidence that he suffered from anti-social personality disorder and a troubled upbringing. At the conclusion of the penalty hearing, the jury found one aggravating factor—that Appellant had a significant history of violent <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>felony convictions<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>—as well as several circumstances satisfying the “catchall” mitigating factor concerning Appellant’s character and record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Ultimately, the jury concluded the aggravating factor outweighed the mitigating factor, and it returned a sentence of death, which the trial court imposed on November 15, 2013. Thereafter, Appellant filed a post-sentence motion challenging, <em>inter alia, </em>the weight of the evidence supporting the jury’s verdict. The trial court denied the motion, and Appellant filed the instant direct appeal, raising nine issues. We address them <em>seriatim.</em>

Additionally, the Commonwealth asserts that the jury was entitled to discredit Appellant’s account of the events leading to the murder and that, even if the jury believed Appellant’s testimony, such testimony could not establish a lack of malice because Appellant had sufficient time to cool off after the alleged provocation.</p>

As discussed above, the carwash surveillance video clearly showed Appellant approach Brown from behind and shoot him in the back of the head, three witnesses identified Appellant as the perpetrator, and Appellant confessed to killing Brown. The fact that Appellant placed a gun to the back of Brown’s head and pulled the trigger is itself sufficient to establish malice, <em>see Commonwealth v.

While Appellant testified that he killed Brown out of passion and fear resulting from allegedly having been provoked earlier that day by Brown and his cohorts, and while he suggests that such testimony was sufficient to support a verdict for voluntary manslaughter, critically, Appellant’s testimony did not establish that he was acting under a sudden and intense passion at the time he killed Brown. Rather, as the Commonwealth has noted, Appellant’s testimony, even if believed, indicates that Appellant had last been pursued by Brown at least 15 to 30 minutes prior to the incident, rendering Appellant more than capable of cool reflection by the time he approached Brown from behind at the carwash and shot him in the back of the head. Moreover, the surveillance footage showing Appellant walking back and forth outside the carwash minutes before the murder further supports such a conclusion, as it shows that Appellant was not acting in a fit of passion, but, rather, was carefully deliberating about whether to enter the carwash.

As discussed in detail above, during the guilt phase of Appellant’s trial, the prosecutor played the jury the car-wash surveillance video, which showed the events leading up to the shooting, as well as the shooting itself. The video depicted the events in real-time, but certain portions of the footage, which were clearly marked “SLOW MOTION,” were repeated in slow motion at one-tenth of the video’s original <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>speed in order to allow the jury to have a better view of Appellant’s face and to draw the jury’s attention to a flash coming from the gun indicating that a second gunshot had been fired. Before the prosecutor played the video, Appellant’s counsel objected, arguing that the jury should be permitted to view the video only once at its actual speed. The trial court overruled the objection, concluding that it would be a “travesty” if the prosecutor were not permitted to slow the video down to allow the jury to see what was depicted therein. N.T., 11/5/13, at 108.</p>
    <p id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[272,896,1153,688]]]'>Thereafter, the Commonwealth played the video one time in its entirety, and then played it a second time to allow Detective Thorsten Lucke, a Philadelphia Police Officer and expert in forensic video recovery analysis, to narrate and explain to the jury any alterations he made to the speed of the footage or the camera angles that were shown.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The trial court later instructed the jurors that the video was admitted into evidence “for the purpose of showing the nature of the wound received by the decedent, showing the conditions at the scene of the crime and helping [them] understand the testimony of witnesses who referred to it,” and it cautioned that they “should not let [the video] stir up [their] emotions to the prejudice of the defendant.” N.T., 11/7/13, at 38.</p>

Specifically, Appellant contends that, because his actions depicted in the video were not performed in slow motion, the slow motion video distorted the actual events to promote a finding of malice and premeditation, rendering the video irrelevant under Pa.R.E. 401 and unduly prejudicial under Pa.R.E. 403.

The Commonwealth emphasizes that, although slow motion video footage distorts reality in a sense, such video nevertheless is admissible if it will aid the jury’s understanding and if it is more probative than prejudicial. Turning to the instant ease, the Commonwealth explains that the slow motion video footage enhanced the jury’s understanding of the events surrounding the shooting because it showed the nature of Brown’s wounds and the conditions at the crime scene, and it gave the jurors a better opportunity to see Appellant’s face and that he had fired two shots at Brown. The Commonwealth further asserts that the video was not prejudicial because the prosecutor initially showed the video at full speed, allowing the jury to observe the actual speed at which the crime occurred; the portions of the video shown in slow motion were clearly marked as such; and the trial court instructed the jury regarding the purposes for which the video was admitted.</p>

Moreover, we find that the probative value of the slow motion footage outweighed any potential for prejudice, particularly given that: the jury was first shown the scenes at normal speed, which allowed it to see the true timing of the events as they transpired; the slow motion footage was clearly marked as such; and the trial court specifically instructed the jury regarding both the purposes for which it was to consider the video footage and the fact that it should not allow the video to inflame their passions against Appellant.

Indeed, as the trial court highlighted in its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the court instructed the jury to avoid media accounts of the case during its preliminary instructions; before lunch recess and evening adjournment each day; at the conclusion of the guilt phase of trial; and throughout the penalty phase of the trial. Appellant does not explain why the trial court’s efforts in this regard were insufficient to avoid any prejudice from the newspaper article, particularly in light of the fact that the jury indicated that it had followed the court’s instructions, albeit as a group. Moreover, Appellant <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>overlooks that we found similar efforts by a trial court to be sufficient in <em>DeJesus, </em>where the trial court issued only one instruction to the jury to avoid media coverage of the case and where, as in this case, it questioned the jury as a group.

Lastly, the Commonwealth contends that any purported error was harmless because the prosecutor presented overwhelming evidence establishing the significant history of violent felonies aggravator, including evidence of a prior murder conviction, as well as a conviction for multiple rapes and robberies.

Specifically, while the jury was deliberating, Sergeant Michael Be-stone of the Philadelphia Sheriffs Office advised the trial court that Appellant had been known to be aggressive towards prison officers and that the prison transportation team had observed Appellant being aggressive on the bus to the courthouse throughout the duration of his trial. Consequently, Sergeant Bestone warned that Appellant might become violent during the hearing, and he recommended that Appellant be shackled with leg irons worn underneath his clothing. N.T., 11/7/13, at 70. Appellant’s counsel initially objected to the shackling, and, in response to the trial court’s probing regarding the basis for his objection, asserted that he “fe[lt] [he had] to respect [Appellant’s] right to be free from being shackled <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>... for no reason whatsoever.” <em>Id. </em>at 67-68.

Thus, noting that “[tjhere is no basis for [the] objection,” the trial court overruled it. <em>Id. </em>at 71.</p>

Both of Appellant’s counsel stated that they had “no objection.” <em>Id. </em>at 74. The trial court then explained that it placed obstructions in front of both counsels’ tables which looked like exhibits and would ensure that the jury would not see the shackles, and it asked both parties whether they had a problem with the arrangement, to which Appellant’s counsel responded that they did not. <em>Id. </em>Appellant was then shackled and brought into the courtroom for the jury to read its verdict.</p>

Additionally, the court opined that Appellant was not prejudiced by its decision to restrain him because the restraint was worn underneath Appellant’s clothing, permitted Appellant to sit and stand without difficulty, and was further masked by the obstructions placed in front of the counsel tables, thus rendering the restraint undetectable by the jury.</p>

    <p id="b547-9" data-blocks='[["BL_547.10",547,[190,1425,1155,850]]]'>Today’s Majority concludes correctly that the slow motion video showing Cash’s actions was relevant and admissible. The Majority properly determines that any prejudicial impact that arose from slowing the video down was outweighed by the evidence’s probative value. This latter conclusion rests upon the following three points: (1) the jury also saw the video at normal speed; (2) the slow motion video clearly was marked as such; and (3) the trial court specifically instructed the jurors to avoid letting the reduction in video speed inflame their passions. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 478,137 A.3d at 1277. I agree with these three points. Further, I note that the slow motion video in this case is no more graphic than the video when played at normal speed. The slow motion video here depicts nothing gruesome or shocking that the jurors did not see when they viewed the video at its real pace. Cash’s claim under Pa.R.E. 403 is entirely unsuccessful.</p>
    <p id="b547-10" data-blocks='[["BL_547.11",547,[191,2303,1154,100]],["BL_548.1",548,[269,351,1154,785]]]'>As a general matter, trial courts must recognize that the probative benefits of frame-by-frame or reduced speed video <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>can be accompanied by patent risks. Such videos may, in a given case, accentuate images and depictions that, by their very nature, are so disturbing as to impart unfair prejudice that outweighs the video’s probative value. As one Pennsylvania court noted, “[i]n a sense, all slow motion and freeze frame video distorts reality. It distorts it in the same way that magnification of a photograph distorts reality. Such distortion may enhance the jury’s understanding or it may do the opposite.” <em>Commonwealth v. Hindi, </em><a href="/pa-super/429/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="429 Pa. Super. 169" data-case-ids="934759" data-case-paths="/pa-super/429/0169-01">429 Pa.Super. 169</a>, <a href="/pa-super/429/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="429 Pa.

Of course, this does not render slow motion videos inadmissible per se, nor do our decisions in this case and in <em>Jordan </em>mean that such videos are admissible in all cases. In short, admissibility of slow motion video requires calibrated and individualized decision-making by our trial courts rather than blanket rules of prohibition or admission.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[270,1159,1153,511]]]'>Trial courts must carefully ascertain and weigh both the prejudicial impact and the probative value of slow motion videography in each instance pursuant to Rule 403. In doing so, courts must scrupulously and contextually assess, within the particular facts and circumstances of the case, whether decreasing the speed of a video significantly enhances the violent and graphic depiction of the crime to the point at which the video becomes unfairly prejudicial, outweighing the evidence’s probative value and threatening the fairness of the trial.</p>
