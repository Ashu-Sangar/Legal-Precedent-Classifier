The issue, as stated by Petitioners, is:\n[The School District] deliberately chose commercial properties, such as Petitioners\u2019, for selective assessment appeals, but did not appeal assessments of any single-family-home properties, although the latter are significantly underas-sessed. The Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution prohibits disuniformity in taxation. Is a school district\u2019s decision to appeal property assessment insulated from review because, inter alia, the school district has a statutory right to file appeals and can identify an economic reason for its appeals?",
