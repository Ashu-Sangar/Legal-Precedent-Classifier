The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n(1) Whether the trial court erred in determining that [Petitioner] showed good cause under [S]ection 2901 of the Adoption Act to proceed with the anticipated adoption of the children[,] ... contrary to the evidence and contrary to controlling precedent and law. Specifically,\n(2) Whether the trial court erred in terminating the parental rights of the [Petitioner] when the proposed adoption by maternal grandfather would not create a new, genuine, parent-child relationship and foster the creation of a new family unit.\n(3) Whether the trial court erred in determining that the anticipated adoption of the children by maternal grandfather would be in the children\u2019s best interests.\nJustice DONOHUE did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.",
