Was it proper for the board of commissioners to consider the boundary as shown in the tax assessment records not as evidence of the location of the original line but as a practical alternative in order to resolve the continuing uncertainty as to the location of the boundary?\n2. Was it proper for the board of commissioners\u2014when faced with the inability to determine the original boundary\u2014to consider the acquiescence of the municipalities to the boundary as reflected in the tax maps, the reliance by the landowners in the affected area on that tax map boundary, and the inducement of such reliance by the municipalities in order to resolve the continuing uncertainty as to the location of the original boundary?\nPetitioner\u2019s Motion for Leave to Supplement Petition for Allowance of Appeal is DENIED as moot.",
