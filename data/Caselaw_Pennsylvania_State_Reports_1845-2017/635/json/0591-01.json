The issues, as stated by Petitioners, are:\n(1) Does the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision below, that an industrial shale gas development is similar to and compatible with uses expressly permitted in a[n] R-A District, conflict with this Court\u2019s decision in Robinson Township?\n(2) Did the Commonwealth Court commit an error of law in deciding that an industrial shale gas development is similar to and compatible with a \u201cpublic service facility!\u2019 in an R-A District when the Township made no factual finding or legal conclusion to that effect, the record contains no substantial evidence to support that determination, and the company\u2019s own witness testified that shale gas development was not similar to a \u201cpublic service facility\u201d in an R-A District?\n(3) Did the Commonwealth Court improperly decide that MarkWest Liberty Midstream, wherein it held that a compressor station is similar to and compatible with a \u201cpublic service facility\u201d in a Light Industrial District, also compels the conclusion that an industrial shale gas development is similar to and compatible with a \u201cpublic service facility\u201d in an R-A District designed for quiet, residential development and not industrial land uses?\n(4) Did the Commonwealth Court commit an error of law by relying on prior conditional use approvals that the Township issued for uses not expressly permitted in the R-A District, in order to support its decision that an industrial shale gas development is similar to and compatible with uses expressly permitted in the R-A District?",
