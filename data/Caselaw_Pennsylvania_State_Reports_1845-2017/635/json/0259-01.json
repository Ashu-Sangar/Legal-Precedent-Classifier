The issues, rephrased for clarity, are:\n1) Are the recent SORNA statutes (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9799.10, 9799.13 and 9799.14 and related provisions) punitive in nature and do they violate the ex post facto provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution?\n2) Do the SORNA statutes violate fundamental due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution?\n3) Do the SORNA statutes violate the separation of powers doctrine under the Pennsylvania Constitution?\n4) Was lifetime Megan\u2019s Law registration not part of petitioner\u2019s original guilty plea, and therefore, should petitioner\u2019s original plea, which only called for a ten-year Megan\u2019s Law requirement, be enforced?\nThe Prothonotary is directed to schedule briefing and argument in this matter together with the following matters presenting related issues: Commonwealth v. Gilbert, 181 MAL 2015 and Commonwealth v. Muniz, 684 MAL 2015.",
