        "text": "Justice DOUGHERTY,\nconcurring.\nI concur in the determination to summarily affirm the order below, writing only to explain why I agree an opinion need not accompany that mandate in this matter.\nThere are two Mnds of per curiam affirmances (PCAs): PCAs adopting the opinion below, thereby signaling the Court\u2019s approval of the mandate and adoption of the reasoning of the court below, see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Greene, 623 Pa. 23, 81 A.3d 829 (2013), and PCAs affirming only the order below, such as here. In the latter instance, the Court offers neither approval nor disapproval of the reasoning below; the Court either agrees with the mandate, or at a minimum, is unconvinced the appellant has made a sufficient showing to disturb that result. See Commonwealth v. Tilghman, 543 Pa. 578, 673 A.2d 898, 904 (1996) (when Court issues per curiam affirmance, \u201c[u]nless we indicate that the opinion of the lower tribunal is affirmed per curiam, our order is not to be interpreted as adopting the rationale employed by the lower tribunal in reaching its final disposition\u201d) (emphasis in original). I realize the practice may be frustrating for the bench and bar, particularly when the decision below is published.\nLike all courts with discretionary review dockets, this Court attempts to identify cases of broad import or interest for review. See Pa.R.A.P. 1114(b). Many considerations go into whether to accept a case beyond the nature of the issue: the sharpness of the dispute, the quality of the advocacy, the opinions below. Once we have accepted an appeal, other considerations may govern whether the case in fact appears to be the appropriate vehicle for exposition we had hoped: the state of the record, issue preservation, quality of the briefing, points made by amicus curiae, etc.\nIn this case, we granted discretionary review to determine when a property is \u201cvacant\u201d for purposes of redeeming property under Section 32(c) of the Pennsylvania Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7505. Section 32, codified at 53 P.S. \u00a7 7293(c), generally provides the owner of any property sold under a tax or municipal claim may redeem it by filing a petition within nine months of acknowledgment of a sheriffs deed and paying certain costs. 53 P.S. \u00a7 7293(a). An exception to the right of redemption exists, however, for \u201cvacant property.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 7293(c) (\u201cthere shall be no redemption of vacant property by any person after the date of the acknowledgment of the sheriffs deed therefor\u201d). The statute further provides a property \u201cshall be deemed to be Vacant property\u2019 unless it was continuously occupied by the same individual or basic family unit as a residence for at least ninety days prior to the date of the sale and continues to be so.\u201d Id.\nThe Commonwealth Court decided the case via published opinion, see Brentwood Borough Sch. Dist. v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 111 A.3d 807 (Pa.Cmwlth.2015), promulgating a multi-factor test to determine vacancy. The case offered an apparent question of first impression respecting property vacancy versus continuous occupancy as a residence, and also promised an opportunity to examine the test promulgated below.\nAs it happens, however, in my judgment, the case has proved not to be an appropriate vehicle for providing guidance on the issue accepted, for several reasons. First, the record concerning the homeowner\u2019s use of the property, and intention respecting the property, is minimal. Second, it is apparent there are foundational issues which are not properly in focus, such as the burden of proof, which would affect any final decision. Third, this case may be of limited utility because of its factual posture, as it involves a financial institution attempting to redeem the property rather than the homeowner, which would be the more common circumstance, and which may be the cause of the scant record. Finally, the Commonwealth Court set forth a multi-part test in its published opinion, but then focused primarily upon the habitability of the premises in rendering its decision, making this a less-than-optimum vehicle even for consideration of the wisdom of the test. See id. at 813. Our summary affirmance should not be read as approval of the test adopted below.",

        "text": "Justice WECHT,\nconcurring.\nI join fully in the mandate of the Court. I write separately to expand briefly on the thoughtful and useful concurring statement of Justice Dougherty.\nLike Justice Dougherty, I emphasize that our per curiam affirmance should be read neither as an approval nor disapproval of the test developed by the Commonwealth Court. Originally, this case appeared to be a vehicle by which this Court helpfully might define what it means for a property to be \u201ccontinuously occupied ... as a residence\u201d for purposes of the Pennsylvania Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7505, at \u00a7 7293(c). Following briefing and advocacy from the parties, it turns out that this is not the case.\nThe question presented on this appeal is not as simple as might appear at first blush. As the Commonwealth Court recognized, resolution of the matter requires a fact-intensive inquiry into the nature of an owner\u2019s use of a particular property. Upon close review, the record in this case lacked the requisite inquiry into the facts, and advocacy from the parties did nothing to elucidate matters. Future cases may well present opportunities to consider and refine the Commonwealth Court\u2019s non-exclusive list of factors and to apply them against a more developed fact record and within the context of more robust advocacy. Because we were unable to develop fully the legal issues before us, we must bide our time and allow these issues to incubate further within the lower courts, with the understanding that today\u2019s order reflects neither an endorsement nor a rejection of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s test.",
