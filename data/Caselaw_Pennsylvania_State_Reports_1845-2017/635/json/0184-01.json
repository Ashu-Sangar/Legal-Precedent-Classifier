Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 183 L.Ed.2d 407 (2012). As a result of the recent holding by that Court that Miller must be applied retroactively by the States, see Montgomery v. Louisiana, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 718, 193 L.Ed.2d 599 (2016), the Superior Court\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with Montgomery. Allocatur is DENIED in all other respects.\nTo the extent necessary, leave is to be granted to amend the post-conviction petition to assert the jurisdictional provision of the Post Conviction Relief Act extending to the recognition of constitutional rights by the Supreme Court of the United States which it deems to be retroactive. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(iii).\nPetitioner\u2019s Petition for Permission to Pile Amended Petition for Allowance of Appeal is DENIED.\nJustices EAKIN and DONOHUE did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.",
