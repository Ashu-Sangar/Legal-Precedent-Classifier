        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nAppellant appeals from the judgment of sentence of death imposed by a jury following the grant of a new penalty-phase hearing. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\nOn November 18, 1994, Eileen Jones and appellant went to appellant\u2019s nephew to borrow a car; the nephew gave him the keys, and appellant and Jones left together in the car. Appellant returned the car later that evening.\nThe next afternoon, appellant told his brother he murdered Jones in a nearby park by choking her with his hands and belt. Jones\u2019s body was discovered November 22, 1994; the county medical examiner concluded the death was homicide by strangulation. After a search of appellant\u2019s home, police officers recovered several newspapers from which articles regarding the recovery of Jones\u2019s body had been removed.\nAppellant was given Miranda warnings and waived his rights. He stated he borrowed his nephew\u2019s car to purchase drugs, and Jones agreed to have sex with him in exchange for the drugs. Appellant and Jones went to a park, and appellant attempted to have sex with her. Appellant stated he choked Jones to death because he was concerned she would accuse him of rape. He disposed of her body in a nearby creek.\nA jury found appellant guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. Appellant appealed, and this Court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. Commonwealth v. Smith, 548 Pa. 65, 694 A.2d 1086, 1096 (1997). Appellant then filed a pro se petition under the Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9541 et seq., and counsel was appointed. Following a hearing, the PCRA court denied the petition. We affirmed the denial of guilt-phase relief, but vacated the death sentence and remanded for a new penalty-phase hearing on the grounds that counsel provided ineffective assistance. Commonwealth v. Smith, 606 Pa. 127, 995 A.2d 1143, 1173 (2010). At that 2012 penalty-phase hearing, a jury sentenced appellant to death after finding the aggravating circumstance of a prior voluntary-manslaughter conviction, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(12), outweighed the mitigating circumstances of appellant\u2019s emotional distress, id., \u00a7 9711(e)(2), and abusive childhood, id., \u00a7 9711(e)(8). Appellant timely appealed to this Court, raising the following claims of error:\nI. Whether the trial court erred in denying [ajppellant\u2019s motion to bar the death penalty, after a delay of some 17 years, brought on ineffective assistance of counsel, during which valuable information was lost and defense witnesses died[.]\nII. Whether the trial court erred in allowing evidence of [ajppellant\u2019s prior homicide conviction[.j\nIII. Whether the trial court erred in admitting testimony that [ajppellant read books on murder and how to commit the perfect crime[.j\nIV. Whether the trial court erred in denying [ajppellant a mistrial where the Commonwealth expert witness told the jury that [ajppellant had been found guilty and place[d] on death row[.j\nV. Whether the trial court erred in ordering the jury to resume deliberations after the jury stated it was unable to reach a unanimous verdictf.j\nVI. Whether the trial court erred in not allowing [ajppel-lant to ask prospective jurors whether they could consider life imprisonment knowing [a]ppellant had been convicted of a prior homicide[.]\nAppellant\u2019s Brief, at 4.\nI. Motion to Bar the Death Penalty\nAppellant contends the trial court committed legal error and abused its discretion by denying his pre-trial motion to bar the death penalty. He notes 17 years have passed from his May 1995 conviction to final sentencing in June of 2012, which, he argues, violated his rights to due process and a speedy trial. Further, he argues this delay amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Appellant states several of his potential witnesses died between the 2002 PORA proceedings and the 2012 new penalty-phase hearing. Moreover, appellant asserts Detective Lawrence Crews, who investigated the victim\u2019s death in appellant\u2019s 1980 voluntary-manslaughter case, could not recall certain facts regarding that conviction, depriving him of details which would have been helpful to the defense.\nThe trial court found appellant\u2019s argument was a matter of first impression and looked to other jurisdictions for guidance. Specifically, the trial court looked to State v. Azania, 865 N.E.2d 994 (Ind.2007), where the Supreme Court of Indiana applied the balancing test used by the United States Supreme Court in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), to determine whether the defendant\u2019s rights to a speedy trial and due process were violated. In Azania, the defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, but the case was remanded for a new penalty-phase hearing. Azania, at 997. At the new penalty-phase hearing, 13 years after conviction, the jury returned a death sentence, which was affirmed. Id. The death sentence was again vacated, and, at the new penalty-phase hearing, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to bar the death penalty. Id. The state appealed. Id.\nThe Supreme Court of Indiana, applying the Barker test, held the 13-year delay did not prejudice the defendant or violate his due process rights. See Azania, at 1005, 1010. The court noted any prejudice suffered by the defendant due to the passage of time did not rise to the level of violating due process. Id., at 1010. The defendant had the opportunity to present evidence, and the jury could consider any impact the passage of time had on a witness\u2019s ability to testify.\nHere, the trial court likewise applied Barker, and found the delay did not prejudice appellant or violate his due process rights. Trial Court Opinion, 7/29/13, at 6-12. The court focused much of its analysis on the fourth factor, prejudice to the defendant.\nAddressing appellant\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by the delay because multiple witnesses died through the passage of time, the court found he did \u201cnot specify which [potential witnesses] would have testified ... on his behalf.\u201d Id., at 8. Further, appellant did not describe any additional testimony they would have provided to assist him. Id. The court noted the testimony of these individuals was preserved by transcripts, which were read to the jury. Id. \u201c[Without more specific allegations as to what testimony was eliminated by the passage of time, the mere general allegation that the read transcripts from prior testimony was not as powerful as live testimony is insufficient to establish sufficient prejudice to [appellant].\u201d Id., at 8-9.\nThe trial court also addressed appellant\u2019s claim that witnesses could not recall helpful details regarding his 1980 voluntary manslaughter conviction. See N.T. Sentencing, 6/18/12, at 80-82. Specifically, Detective Crews could not recall specific actions he took during that investigation. See id., at 87-88. The court concluded appellant again did not offer any specific mitigating information that was not provided by Detective Crews\u2019s testimony. Trial Court Opinion, 7/29/18, at 10. Appellant merely claims the detective\u2019s loss of memory prejudiced him, without discussing how any unstated information would have benefited the defense.\nThe trial court made the same conclusion regarding the testimony of Sonya Rollins, the sister of the victim in the 1980 homicide. In particular, Rollins could not recall specifics surrounding her brother\u2019s death. See N.T. Sentencing, 6/18/12, 46-47, 50, 58-59. The court held a more \u201cvivid recollection of the more horrific aspects of the underlying crime\u201d would not have \u201cassisted [appellant] in any manner.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 7/29/13, at 10. Appellant made no specific arguments regarding any mitigating evidence that was lost, and the court found no prejudice.\nThe trial court also found appellant\u2019s complaint that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated was without merit, holding \u201cthe Eight[h] Amendment does not protect against delaying a sentence of death because those delays are designed to afford a defendant his constitutional right to appeal and cannot become grounds for an additional appealable issue.\u201d Id., at 10-11 (citing People v. Simms, 192 Ill.2d 348, 249 Ill.Dec. 654, 736 N.E.2d 1092, 1141 (2000)). The court noted appellant invoked his right to appeal and continued those appeals on multiple occasions. Id., at 12. \u201cTherefore, [appellants complaint that the delay in his sentencing violates his due process rights, as well as his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments is unsubstantiated.\u201d Id.\nAfter careful review, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision regarding this issue. Prior testimony was preserved, absences and lapses in memory have not been shown to involve identifiable exculpatory, mitigating, or even helpful information, and in the end, appellant has not demonstrated legal prejudice. A question regarding whether a due process violation occurred is a question of law for which the standard of review is de novo and the scope of review is plenary. Commonwealth v. Brown, 617 Pa. 107, 52 A.3d 1139, 1162 (2012) (citations omitted). Upon such review, we affirm the determinations and ruling of the trial court.\nAdditionally, appellant asserts he was prejudiced by the length of time he has spent on death row. Appellant has been on death row for over 18 years, and he argues his time spent there waiting to be executed constitutes a \u201cwanton infliction of harm in violation of the Eight[h] Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 18.\nAppellant relies only on a dissenting statement by Justice Breyer in Foster v. Florida, 537 U.S. 990, 991-93, 123 S.Ct. 470, 154 L.Ed.2d 359 (U.S.2002) (Breyer, J., dissenting). There, the Court denied certiorari when a deathrow inmate claimed the 27 years he served in prison awaiting his execution amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. Id., at 990, 991-92, 123 S.Ct. 470. Justice Breyer, dissenting from the Court\u2019s denial of certiorari, noted if the inmate was executed, he would have been \u201cpunished both by death and also by more than a generation spent in death row\u2019s twilight.\u201d Id., at 993, 123 S.Ct. 470.\nThis Court has rejected the notion that excessive delays in carrying out a death sentence constitute cruel and unusual punishment, opining an \u201cappellant must show that the delay was a deliberate tactical move in bad faith by the Commonwealth and that he was prejudiced by it in order to establish a denial of due process.\u201d Commonwealth v. Clayton, 516 Pa. 263, 532 A.2d 385, 388 n. 2 (1987). Appellant has filed numerous appeals and has failed to produce any evidence that the challenged delay was a tactical move the Commonwealth made in bad faith. Therefore, the trial court appropriately denied appellant\u2019s motion to bar the death penalty.\nII. Evidence of Appellant\u2019s Prior Voluntary-Manslaughter Conviction\nIn 1980, Rollins witnessed appellant fatally stab her brother, George Sutton. Appellant pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter. Appellant asserts the trial court erred in admitting evidence of that case, arguing he was prejudiced by the presentation of facts and circumstances behind that conviction. Specifically, he claims \u201cthe Commonwealth agreed at the time of conviction, presumably after thoroughly investigating the matter, that [voluntary [mjanslaughter was appropriate. To present evidence now that demonstrated a brutal, unprovoked and malicious killing, a crime much worse than that agreed to by the Commonwealth, is simply not fair.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 20.\nIn a capital case, the trial court is required to instruct the jury regarding the aggravating circumstances specified in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d), for which there is some evidence, id., \u00a7 9711(c)(1)(i). One of the aggravating circumstances included in subsection (d) is whether \u201c[t]he defendant has been convicted of voluntary manslaughter ... committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue.\u201d Id., \u00a7 9711(d)(12). Appellant does not contend the trial court should have kept the voluntary-manslaughter conviction from the jury. Rather, he argues the underlying facts of his voluntary-manslaughter conviction should have been withheld from the jury.\nThis Court, in Commonwealth v. Beasley, 505 Pa. 279, 479 A.2d 460 (1984), stated:\nConsideration of prior \u201cconvictions\u201d was not intended to be a meaningless and abstract ritual, but rather a process through which a jury would gain considerable insight into a defendant\u2019s character. The nature of an offense, as ascertained through examination of the circumstances concomitant to its commission, has much bearing upon the character of a defendant, and, indeed, without reference to those facts and circumstances, consideration of \u201cconvictions\u201d would be a hollow process, yielding far less information about a defendant\u2019s character than is relevant.\nConvictions are defined by the essential and necessary facts upon which they are based, and judgments of sentence flow naturally from, and form an integral part of those convictions. Thus, reason impels that the construction of the term \u201cconvictions\u201d ... permit\u00eds] consideration of the essential and necessary facts pertaining to the convictions, including the circumstances of the crimes and the sentences imposed.\nId., at 465.\nFurther, \u201cthe jury not only should, but indeed must know more than the mere fact of conviction if it is to carry out its sentencing role properly.\u201d Commonwealth v. Flor, 606 Pa. 384, 998 A.2d 606, 623 (2010) (citations omitted); see also Commonwealth v. Rios, 591 Pa. 583, 920 A.2d 790, 814 (2007) (quoting Commonwealth v. Marshall, 537 Pa. 336, 643 A.2d 1070, 1074 (1994)); Commonwealth v. Young, 536 Pa. 57, 637 A.2d 1313, 1320 (1993).\nThe admissibility of evidence is \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the trial court ... [and we] will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision concerning admissibility of evidence absent an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d Flor, at 623 (citations omitted).\nThe voluntary-manslaughter conviction was the basis for an aggravating circumstance being pursued by the Commonwealth under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(12). As there are countless scenarios that could comprise this crime, the jury should know the facts behind the conviction to appropriately balance the (d)(12) aggravator against any mitigating circumstances; without the basic facts, the jury is short-changed. We And the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this evidence.\nIII. Testimony About Appellant Reading Homicide Books\nAppellant contends \u201cthe trial court erred in allowing evidence that around the time of the 1980 homicide of George Sutton, [a]ppellant read certain books\u201d about homicide and how to commit the perfect crime. Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 21. Specifically, appellant asserts the evidence had no probative value and was \u201cextremely prejudicial.\u201d Id., at 24. Appellant, however, did not raise his objections at trial.\n\u201cIssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d Pa.R.A.P. 302(a). The record reveals appellant did not object when the trial court announced its ruling on the Commonwealth\u2019s motions in li- mine regarding this evidence. See N.T. Sentencing, 6/18/12, at 4-14. Further, no objections were made during the penalty-phase hearing when the Commonwealth introduced the evidence. See id., at 38-46. Accordingly, this issue is waived.\nIV. Motion for Mistrial\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial after Dr. John O\u2019Brien, a Commonwealth witness, testified at the penalty-phase hearing that appellant had been previously convicted and sentenced to death. Appellant asserts he was prejudiced by this testimony because it signaled to the jury that he was already convicted and sentenced to death by an earlier jury. Further, he asserts Dr. O\u2019Brien intentionally made the statement about being on death row to prejudice him.\nDr. O\u2019Brien was asked questions regarding appellant\u2019s prior diagnoses for depression and anxiety. N.T. Sentencing, 6/21/12, at 258-59. The prosecutor asked Dr. O\u2019Brien, \u201c[Y]ou have heard that [appellant] has been diagnosed with both depression and anxiety in the past, correct?\u201d Id., at 259. Dr. O\u2019Brien responded, \u201c[TJhe only diagnosis of that that I have seen has been in the correctional records subsequent to his having been found guilty and put on death row.\u201d Id. Appellant\u2019s counsel immediately objected and moved for a mistrial, which was denied. Id., at 259-60. The trial court had a brief discussion with the prosecutor and appellant\u2019s counsel on how to phrase a curative instruction for the jury regarding Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s statement. Id., at 260-65. The court then instructed the jury:\nThere was a reference through the witness about death row. Following a conviction of [f]irst[-d]egree [mjurder you are placed on death row. That\u2019s what happens. You are not to draw any kind of inferences adverse to [appellant] or his guilt. That\u2019s just something that happens. I just wanted to explain that to you.\nId., at 266-67.\nWe review the denial of a motion for mistrial under the abuse of discretion standard. Commonwealth v. Travag lia, 611 Pa. 481, 28 A.3d 868, 879 (2011) (citation omitted). \u201cA mistrial is an extreme remedy that is required only where the challenged event deprived the accused of a fair and impartial trial.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). In the instant case, the prosecutor asked Dr. O\u2019Brien a question that was not such as would be expected to elicit a response about death row. The trial court provided a curative instruction to the jury after consulting with both parties, the gist of which is that appellant was on death row because of his arrest on this case, not some time prior. As such, the instruction dispelled the potential prejudice from a potential inference of prior criminality that formed the basis of the objection.\nThe law presumes juries follow a court\u2019s instructions. Commonwealth v. Baker, 531 Pa. 541, 614 A.2d 663, 672 (1992) (citing Commonwealth v. Stoltzfus, 462 Pa. 43, 337 A.2d 873, 879 (1975)). The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial because it provided an immediate curative instruction. We agree that \u201c[i]n light of the ... curative instruction and the unintentional elicitation from the Commonwealth, ... any prejudice the \u2018death row\u2019 reference may have caused was insufficient to require a mistrial.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 7/29/13, at 17. Moreover, there was no other reference to appellant\u2019s status on death row for the remainder of the penalty-phase hearing. Therefore, we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.\nV. Jury Instruction for Continued Deliberation\nAppellant argues the trial court erred when it ordered the jury to continue deliberating after the jury informed the court that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. He asserts the court abused its discretion because the jury should have been discharged pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(1)(v), and he should have been sentenced to life imprisonment.\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent out two questions for clarification. Later that afternoon, approximately four hours after deliberations started, the jury informed the court it was \u201c \u2018unable to reach a unanimous sentencing verdict.\u2019 \u201d N.T. Sentencing, 6/22/12, at 35. The trial court instructed the jury to continue deliberations, stating:\nLadies and gentlemen, this has been a four-day trial, which, as trials go, it\u2019s not a particularly long trial. However, I think that you will probably share my conclusion that it\u2019s been a very intense four days of testimony; a lot of expert witnesses, a lot of testimony, a lot of very complicated testimony. At this point in time, the [cjourt feels obligated to request that you return to your deliberations. I want to make sure that, in point of fact, we\u2019ve exhausted the possibilities of arriving at a unanimous verdict. So, at this point in time, I\u2019m going to ask you to go back. I would suggest that you ... start from the beginning, if you would; go over the aggravating circumstances; get that decided; go over the mitigating circumstances, and then review that with each other and see if you can resolve any outstanding differences and we\u2019ll see how that goes. So, at this point, I\u2019m going to send you back and ask that you return to your deliberations.\nId., at 38-39.\n\u201cThe amount of time a jury is kept together to deliberate is within the discretion of the trial judge, and that decision will only be reversed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Commonwealth v. Wharton, 542 Pa. 83, 665 A.2d 458, 461 (1995) (citation omitted). Further, this Court has previously held there is no abuse of discretion when a court instructs a jury to continue to deliberate a death sentence after a lengthy trial. See Commonwealth v. Chester, 526 Pa. 578, 587 A.2d 1367, 1381 (1991) (finding trial court did not coerce verdict of death by returning jury for deliberations after insistence that process was futile); see also Commonwealth v. Penn, 497 Pa. 232, 439 A.2d 1154, 1161 (1982) (finding no abuse of discretion after jury announced it was deadlocked after two days and returned verdict on fourth day). Here, the jury had to consider evidence regarding appellant\u2019s prior voluntary-manslaughter conviction, emotional distress, and childhood abuse. The jury then had to weigh the evidence to determine if the aggravating circumstance of voluntary manslaughter outweighed the mitigating circumstances of emotional distress and an abusive childhood. Given the complex nature of all the evidence, the trial court did not . abuse its discretion by instructing the jury to continue deliberations.\nVI. Voir Dire\nAppellant argues the trial court denied him due process and the right to a fair and impartial jury by refusing to permit the following voir dire question: \u201c \u2018You will hear that [appellant] was convicted, by plea of guilty, to the crime of [voluntary [manslaughter in 1980. Is there any one of you who feels that[,] because of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, that you would not consider a sentence of life imprisonment^]\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Proposed Voir Dire Questions, 6/11/12, No. 11. Appellant claims he should have been permitted to ask this specific question to \u201clife-qualify\u201d potential jurors pursuant to Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 736-37, 112 S.Ct, 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992), as \u201c[t]he proposed question does nothing more than identify potential jurors who cannot consider a sentence of life imprisonment for a second-time killer and asks only if the jurors can still consider life imprisonment despite the fact that [a]ppellant has previously been convicted of [voluntary [mjanslaughter.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 48.\nThe Commonwealth contends the trial court properly precluded the question as it \u201csought to place before the jury information regarding a specific aggravating circumstance, appellant\u2019s prior conviction for [voluntary [mjanslaughter, in order to learn what the prospective jurors\u2019 likely decision would be regarding the specific facts to be established during the penalty[-]phase proceedings.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 58. The Commonwealth relies on Commonwealth v. Mattison, 623 Pa. 174, 82 A.3d 386 (2013), which held: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by precluding the defendant\u2019s proposed voir dire questions that would have disclosed Ms prior murder conviction before the jury\u2019s determination of Ms gmlt; and (2) the defendant was not entitled to separate juries for the guilt and penalty phases of trial in order to \u201clife-qualify\u201d the penalty-phase jury. See Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 56-57; Mattison, at 397. The Commonwealth also cites Commonwealth v. Bomar, 573 Pa. 426, 826 A.2d 831 (2003), in wMch we stated \u201c[njeither counsel for the defendant nor the Commonwealth should be permitted to ask direct or hypothetical questions designed to disclose what a juror\u2019s present impression or opirnon as to what his decision will likely be under certain facts which may be developed in the trial of a case.\u201d Id., at 849. The Commonwealth further argues preclusion of the proposed question did not limit appellant\u2019s ability to \u201clife-qualify\u201d the jury because appellant\u2019s counsel, as well as the court itself, already \u201clife-qualified\u201d each potential juror. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 53-56.\nThe trial court concluded appellant\u2019s claim failed as a matter of law because his voluntary-manslaughter conviction was an aggravating circumstance in his present case. The court reasoned \u201c[ujnder [\u00a7 ] 9711(c)(1)(iv), the verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance[.j\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 7/29/13, at 22. Notwithstanding this was the incorrect standard as it did not account for the two mitigating circumstances, which would be weighed against the aggravator, we find the trial court\u2019s decision to preclude the proposed voir dire question was proper.\n\u201cThe scope of voir dire rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent palpable error.\u201d Commonwealth v. Karenbauer, 552 Pa. 420, 715 A.2d 1086, 1094 (1998) (citation omitted). \u201cThe purpose of voir dire is to ensure [a] ... competent, fair, impartial, and unprejudiced jury.\u201d Id. (citations omitted).\nThe term \u201clife-qualify\u201d refers to the process to identify prospective jurors who have a fixed opinion that a sentence of death should always be imposed for a conviction of first-degree murder. Commonwealth v. Keaton, 556 Pa. 442, 729 A.2d 529, 542 n. 9 (1999). There is no constitutional requirement that each prospective juror be \u201clife-qualified.\u201d Id., at 543. However, if the defendant wishes to \u201clife-qualify\u201d any or all venirepersons, voir dire must include such an inquiry. Morgan, at 733-34, 112 S.Ct. 2222. In Morgan, the United States Supreme Court stated, \u201cgeneral questions of fairness and impartiality\u201d are not sufficient to detect jurors who would automatically vote for the death penalty upon conviction, regardless of any mitigating factors. Id., at 735, 112 S.Ct. 2222. The Court noted:\n[T]he belief that death should be imposed ipso facto upon conviction of a capital offense reflects directly on that individual\u2019s inability to follow the law. Any juror who would impose death regardless of the facts and circumstances of conviction cannot follow the dictates of law. It may be that a juror could, in good conscience, swear to uphold the law and yet be unaware that maintaining such dogmatic beliefs about the death penalty would prevent him or her from doing so. A defendant on trial for his life must be permitted on voir dire to ascertain whether his prospective jurors function under such misconception.\nId., at 735-36, 112 S.Ct. 2222 (footnote and internal citations omitted).\nAppellant\u2019s proposed question is impermissible under Bo-mar as it is a question designed to elicit what the jurors\u2019 reactions might be when presented with a specific aggravating circumstance. See Bomar, at 849 (\u201cNeither counsel for the defendant nor the Commonwealth should be permitted to ask direct or hypothetical questions designed to disclose what a juror\u2019s present impression or opinion as to what his decision will likely be under certain facts which may be developed in the trial of a case.\u201d). Moreover, the jury is expressly permitted, under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(12), to consider appellant\u2019s prior manslaughter conviction as an aggravating circumstance, and 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711 (c)(i)(iv) sets forth precisely how the jury should consider aggravating circumstances in its deliberations. Therefore, the trial court followed the precise prescribed statutory scheme by permitting the Commonwealth to present appellant\u2019s prior conviction as an aggravating circumstance.\nFurther, as the Commonwealth points out, each prospective juror was already \u201clife-qualified\u201d on appellant\u2019s first-degree murder conviction. See Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 63-56 (citations omitted). Therefore, any juror who would impose death, regardless of the facts or circumstances surrounding the case, would have been identified and excluded.\nAccordingly, the judgment of sentence is affirmed.\nFormer Chief Justice CASTILLE did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustices BAER and STEVENS join the opinion.\nChief Justice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion in which Justice TODD joins.\n. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct, 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\n. Appellant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in 1980 for the stabbing death of his then-girlfriend\u2019s brother.\n. In Barker, the United States Supreme Court established a balancing test to determine whether there was a violation of a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial and due process. Barker, at 530-33, 92 S.Ct. 2182. The Court noted four factors to consider: (1) the length of delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right; and (4) the prejudice to the defendant. Id. Although the High Court did not regard any of the four factors as either a \"necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial[,]\u201d it opined courts are still required to engage in a \u201cdifficult and sensitive balancing process.\u201d Id., at 533, 92 S.Ct. 2182.\n. \"The court may, in its discretion, discharge the jury if it is of the opinion that further deliberation will not result in a unanimous agreement as to the sentence, in which case the court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment.\u201d Id.\n. Section 9711(c)(1)(iv) further provides the verdict must be death if \"the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.\u201d Id. In any other circumstance, including if the jury finds the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating circumstances, the sentence must be life imprisonment. Id.",

        "text": "Chief Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent in this case centered upon the propriety of a death-penalty verdict. Primarily, I believe that the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to elaborate upon an aggravating circumstance via testimony from the sister of the victim of a previous killing and in refusing to allow material and appropriate life qualification questions during juror voir dire.\nInitially, although I take no issue with the majority\u2019s explanation that the Commonwealth is permitted to undertake some reasonable development of the facts underlying a conviction serving as an aggravating circumstance, I am not comfortable with the concept of \u201cshort-chang[ing]\u201d a jury. Majority Opinion, at 49, 131 A.3d at 474. Evidentiary determinations are regulated by rules and precepts designed to maintain fundamental fairness and administered through the exercise of sound discretion by the trial courts. In the application, there are many instances in which relevant information\u2014favorable to either the Commonwealth or the defense\u2014properly is withheld from lay jurors. As such, and since the jurors have no personal stake in the matter, respectfully, I find the majority\u2019s \u201cshort-changing\u201d concept to be unsuited to the subject area.\nMoreover, while developing facts pertinent to prior convictions serving as aggravating circumstances may be permissible in the abstract, doing so via contested testimony of a homicide victim\u2019s close relative is, in my view, unduly prejudicial, particularly in a scenario in which the underlying conviction had been secured by guilty plea. Accord Brief for Appellant at 20 (\u201cTo present evidence now that demonstrated a brutal, unprovoked and malicious killing, a crime much worse than that agreed to by the Commonwealth, is simply not fair.\u201d). Injection of eyewitness testimony relative to an aggravator merely centered on the fact of a conviction also fosters the potential for mini-trials concerning collateral facts. While, again, I recognize that the Commonwealth is to be afforded some latitude to present factual circumstances underlying previous convictions serving as aggravating circumstances, I believe that the development should be subject to judicious control by the trial courts and that the prosecution should be required to employ a less problematic methodology (such as introduction of the guilty plea colloquy).\nConcerning the life qualification issue, I note that Appellant has presented an extensive argument predicated upon the insightful opinion of a federal district court in United States v. Johnson, 366 F.Supp.2d 822 (N.D.Iowa 2005). As Appellant relates, Johnson elaborately explains the difference between: 1) case-specific voir dire questions designed to determine whether jurors harbor some bias relative to critical facts to be demonstrated by trial evidence, and 2) interrogatories seeking to pre-commit jurors to a particular verdict. See id., at 845-49. Johnson concludes, appropriately in my view, that the former line of case-specific questions may, in fact, be constitutionally required to empanel a fair and impartial jury. See id., at 848 (explaining that a prohibition on such questions \u201cmay unconstitutionally impede a party\u2019s \u2018ability to exercise intelligently [a] challenge for cause against those biased persons on the venire who as jurors would unwaveringly impose\u2019 either a life or death sentence after a finding of guilt.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 733, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 2232, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992))).\nThe majority appears to implicitly reject Johnson\u2019s approach to case-specific questions based on the commonly-accepted admonition, as articulated in Commonwealth v. Bomar, 573 Pa. 426, 826 A.2d 831 (2003), that \u201c[njeither counsel for the defendant nor the Commonwealth should be permitted to ask direct or hypothetical questions designed to disclose what a juror\u2019s present impression or opinion as to what his decision will likely be under certain facts which may be developed in the trial of the case.\u201d Id., at 456, 826 A.2d at 849 (emphasis added); accord Ellington v. State, 292 Ga. 109, 735 S.E.2d 736, 754 (2012) (\u201c[V]oir dire is not intended to pre-try the case on hypothesized facts and get jurors to commit to the outcome based on that speculative proof.\u201d). I believe, however, that this rationale applies only to pre-commitment-type interrogatories (ie., category \u201c2\u201d in the above paragraph) and not to case-specific questions appropriately framed to inquire into juror biases relative to critical facts. See Johnson, 366 F.Supp.2d at 848-50; accord United States v. Fell, 372 F.Supp.2d 766, 773 (D.Vt.2005) (\u201cA balance must be struck between seeking to discover biased jurors who could not be impartial given particular facts and getting jurors to commit to support a particular perspective on the evidence.\u201d).\nFor my part, I would follow the lead of the California Supreme Court in People v. Cash, 28 Cal.4th 703, 122 Cal. Rptr.2d 545, 50 P.3d 332 (2002), which held that, by absolutely precluding case-specific questioning pertaining to the fact of a previous homicide during life qualification, \u201cthe trial court created a risk that a juror who would automatically vote to impose the death penalty on a defendant who had previously committed murder [or manslaughter] was empaneled and acted on those views, thereby violating defendant\u2019s due process right to an impartial jury.\u201d Id., 122 Cal.Rptr.2d 545, 50 P.3d at 342-43.\nI recognize that the form of case-specific questions geared to assessing juror biases should be controlled by trial courts, and that Appellant\u2019s specific framing was not ideal, in that the interrogatory was not couched conditionally, in terms of what the trial evidence might show. See Johnson, 366 F.Supp.2d at 849 (explaining that case-specific questions \u201cshould be prefaced by \u2018if the evidence shows\u2019 or some other reminder that an ultimate determination must be based on the evidence at trial and the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Nevertheless, since the Commonwealth clearly had committed to pursuing the relevant aggravator and the Appellant\u2019s proposed question did not require jurors to commit to a particular result, but rather, concerned whether they could fairly consider the evidence at large and the trial court\u2019s instructions, I do not find this factor to be dispositive. Indeed, only a modest adjustment to the query was required to bring it into conformance with Johnson\u2019s sound guidance.\nA fair trial before an impartial factfinder is a fundamental component of due process of law. See Morgan, 504 U.S. at 727, 112 S.Ct. at 2228-29. Voir dire is a primary mechanism by which the impartiality requirement is assessed and vindicated. See Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U.S. 182, 188, 101 S.Ct. 1629, 1634, 68 L.Ed.2d 22 (1981) (\u201cWithout an adequate voir dire the trial judge\u2019s responsibility to remove prospective jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the court\u2019s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be fulfilled. Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant\u2019s right to exercise peremptory challenges where provided by statute or rule[.]\u201d (citation omitted)). In my view, the majority\u2019s wholesale rejection of Appellant\u2019s position that reasonable, material, properly-framed case-specific voir dire should have been permitted squarely undercuts these core principles.\nJustice TODD joins this dissenting opinion.",
