The Superior Court erred, however, in then failing to grant Petitioner\u2019s application for reconsideration of the merits of his waived claims. Accordingly, Petitioner\u2019s Substituted Petition for Allowance, wherein Petitioner seeks a remand to the Superior Court for merits review of his claims on appeal, is hereby GRANTED, the order of the Superior Court is VACATED, and this matter is REMANDED to the Superior Court for consideration of the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claims on appeal.\nMr. Justice Eakin did not participate in the decision of this matter.",
