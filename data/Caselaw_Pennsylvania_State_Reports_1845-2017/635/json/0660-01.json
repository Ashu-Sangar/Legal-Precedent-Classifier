Allocatur is DENIED as to the remaining issue. The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n(1) Whether, in an issue of first impression and of critical statewide importance, the Superior Court Majority violated longstanding precedent and deviated from existing law when it read out of Pennsylvania\u2019s Autism Insurance Act a legislatively-created exception that permitted Independence, like all other insurers, to apply general policy exclusions when making coverage determinations for autism-based services?\n(2) Whether, in an issue of first impression and statewide importance, the Superior Court\u2019s reliance on the Pennsylvania Insurance Department\u2019s interpretation\u2014which conflicts with the plain language of Act 62\u2014is erroneous and cannot be said to salvage the Superior Court Majority\u2019s incorrect result?\nThe Application for Leave to File Post-Allocatur Communication in the Form of a Reply is DENIED.\nJustice WECHT did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.",
