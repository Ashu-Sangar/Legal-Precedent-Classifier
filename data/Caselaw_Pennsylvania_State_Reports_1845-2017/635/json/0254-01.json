Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 183 L.Ed.2d 407 (2012). As a result of the recent holding that Miller must be applied retroactively by the States, Montgomery v. Louisiana, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 718, 193 L.Ed.2d 599 (2016), the Superior Court\u2019s order is VACATED IN PART. The case is REMANDED to the Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings consistent with Montgomery. Allowance of appeal is DENIED in all other respects.\nTo the extent necessary, leave is to be granted to amend the post-conviction petition to assert the jurisdictional provision of the Post Conviction Relief Act extending to the recognition of constitutional rights by the Supreme Court of the United States which it deems to be retroactive. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b) (1) (iii).\nJustice EAKIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.",
