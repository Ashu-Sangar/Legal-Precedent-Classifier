      {
        "text": "OPINION\nChief Justice SAYLOR.\nIn this matter we address whether legislation designed to help the Philadelphia School District recover from financial hardship violates the non-delegation rule.\nPublic schools in Pennsylvania are governed by the Public School Code of 1949. In 1959, Article VI(F) was added to the code to assist school districts experiencing financial distress. See 24 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6-691 to 6-695 (1959) (the \u201cDistress Law\u201d). Responding to adverse financial conditions in the Philadelphia School District (the \u201cSchool District\u201d), the Legislature again amended the School Code in the late 1990s by adding provisions to the Distress Law tailored to school districts of the first class, ie., the School District. See Act of Apr. 27, 1998, P.L. 270, No. 46 (\u201cAct 46\u201d). Act 46 augmented Section 691 of the School Code so that the Secretary of Education could declare the School District distressed if it failed certain budgetary requirements or would fail to provide an educational program in compliance with the School Code, the State Board of Education\u2019s regulations, or the Secretary\u2019s standards. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-691(c), Act 46 also added Section 696 to the Distress Law, which provided that when the School District was declared distressed under Section 691(c), the Secretary was to appoint a chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) to oversee it. See id. \u00a7 6-696 (1998). The CEO was given the power to suspend or revoke charters and, notably for present purposes, to suspend regulations of the State Board of Education and \u201cthe requirements of this act,\u201d i.e., the School Code. Id. \u00a7 6-696(i)(3) (1998).\nIn October 2001, Section 696 was again amended. These revisions provide that on a declaration of distress, a five-member School Reform Commission (\u201cSRC\u201d)\u2014mostly appointed by the Governor\u2014is to be named to oversee the School District, thus assuming various powers formerly assigned to the CEO. The amendments give the SRC, which is an instrumentality of the school district exercising the school board\u2019s authority, sweeping powers, including \u201call powers granted to the superintendent by law and a special board of control under section 693[.]\u201d 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-696(i). Of central relevance here, they also transfer to the SRC the suspension powers previously given to the CEO.\nDuring the 2001-2002 school year, the School District experienced a substantial budgetary shortfall. In December 2001, the Secretary declared the district to be distressed per Section 691(c). The Philadelphia School Board\u2019s powers were suspended and the present SRC was appointed and assumed governance of the district.\nMeanwhile, Petitioner, the West Philadelphia Achievement Charter Elementary School (the \u201cCharter School\u201d) had applied for a charter. In 2001, the School District granted it a five-year charter which the SRC renewed for an additional five years in 2006. As the charter\u2019s expiration approached in 2011, the Charter School again sought renewal. The SRC responded by passing Resolution 20 of 2011 (\u201cSRC-2011-20\u201d).\nSRC-2011-20 specified that the Charter School\u2019s charter was renewable for an additional five years subject to certain conditions. It also provided that, \u201cthe SRC, pursuant to section 6-696(i)(3) of the Public School Code, partially suspends the corrective action status provision in Section 17-1729-A(a.1) of the Charter School Law....\u201d SRC-2011-20 at 2. Section 17-1729-A(a.1), the suspended provision, states that when a charter school located in a first class school district is in corrective action status\u2014meaning it has failed to meet adequate yearly progress for at least four consecutive years, see 24 P.S. \u00a7 1-102\u2014and seeks to renew its charter, the school district\u2019s governing body may place reasonable conditions in the charter that require the school to meet student performance targets within stated time periods. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1729-A(a.1). However, the Charter School was not in corrective action status. Thus, the. SRC\u2019s suspension of Section 17-1729-A(a.1) had the effect of removing the requirement that a charter school be in corrective action status prior to the SRC placing conditions in a renewed charter. SRC-2011-20 also set forth other requirements for the renewal of the charter, including that the Charter School must agree to enroll no more than 400 students notwithstanding that, under the Charter School Law, charter schools are not subject to school-district-imposed enrollment caps. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1723-A(d)(1) (providing that a school district\u2019s governing authority may not impose an enrollment cap on a charter school absent the charter school\u2019s consent).\nThe Charter School refused to sign a charter renewal agreement containing the terms of SRC-2011-20, Although the 2006 charter expired in 2011, the Charter School continued to operate. Additionally, its enrollment exceeded 400 students. The School District began reimbursing the Charter School for only 400 students. Thereafter, the Charter School requested, and ultimately received, funding for the additional students from the Department of Education pursuant to Section 1725-A(a)(5) of the Charter School law. That provision requires a school district to pay a charter school for each enrolled student; it also states that, in the event the district fails to make such payment, the Secretary must deduct the deficiency from Commonwealth payments that would otherwise be made to the district. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1725-A(a)(5). The consequence is that, for the Charter School\u2019s enrollment in excess of 400 students, some monies that the Department would have paid over to the School District were instead provided to the Charter School.\nThe School District\u2019s financial condition continued to decline between 2011 and 2013. The SRC reduced expenditures and made staff reductions. However, these retrenchments were insufficient to keep pace with revenue shortfalls. Thus, the SRC passed Resolution 1 of 2013 (\u201cSRC-2013-1\u201d), stating that the School District was in the midst of an untenable financial crisis. SRC-2013-1 suspended a number of sections of the Charter School Law, as well as \u201cany applicable regulations,\u201d on the grounds that the SRC \u201cdesire[d] to remove limitations on its power to suspend charters[J\u201d SRC-2013-1 at 4. One category of suspended provisions concerned the nonrenewal or revocation of charters, in particular: Section 17-1729-A(a), which provides the causes and grounds for nonrenewal or revocation; Section 17-1729-A(c), which requires that a public hearing be held regarding any decision to revoke or not renew a charter; Section 17-1729-A(d), which establishes a procedure for charter schools to appeal a school district\u2019s revocation or nonrenewal determination to the State Charter School Appeal Board; and Section 17-1729-A(f), which clarifies that, while an administrative appeal is ongoing, the school\u2019s charter remains in effect. The resolution indicated that these additional suspensions \u201cshall not be effective until a policy containing a set of standards and procedures is adopted by the [SRC].\u201d Id. at 5.\nSRC-2013-1 also expanded the SRC\u2019s authority to impose student performance targets on charter schools. As noted, Section 17-1729-A(a.1) permits the imposition of student performance targets only when the charter school is in corrective action status. SRC-2013-1 stated that the SRC \u201cneeds more flexibility in declining to renew a poor-performing charter school and desires to require all charter schools to meet specific reasonable student performance targets[.]\u201d SRC-2013-1 at 6. Accordingly, this portion of SRC-2013-1 abrogated Section 17-1729-A(a.1)\u2019s limitation that only schools in corrective action status may be subject to performance targets as a condition of charter renewal. See id.\nNext, SRC-2013-1 observed that the School Code does not permit limits on charter school enrollment unless the charter school agrees to such limits. See SRC-2013-1 at 6 (citing 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1723-A(d)). Accordingly, SRC-2013-1 suspended those provisions, permitting the SRC to place enrollment caps unilaterally on any charter school. Finally, SRC-2013-1 eliminated the ability of charter schools to receive funding for enrolled students directly from the Department of Education. To achieve this, SRC-2013-1 suspended Section 17-1725-A(a)(5) and all associated regulations. See SRC-2013-1 at 7.\nIn February 2014, the SRC released a draft version of its \u201cProposed Charter Schools Policy,\u201d apparently to implement SRC-2013-1\u2019s provisions, some of which, as noted, were subject to the adoption of standards and procedures. The Charter Schools Policy states, inter alia, that charter schools must accept enrollment caps imposed by the SRC. It also provides that, in the absence of an agreement between a charter school and the SRC, the SRC may dictate the terms under which the charter school operates. As well, the Charter Schools Policy sets forth new reasons to revoke or non-renew a charter that do not appear in the School Code, including that a charter school failed to comply with SRC-imposed enrollment caps.\nShortly after the release of the Proposed Charter Schools Policy, the Charter School filed in this Court a pleading styled as an Application for Leave to File Petition in the Nature of a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 3307 (the \u201cApplication\u201d). The Application, which named the School District and the SRC as respondents, was directed to this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction pursuant to Section 27 of Act 46, which states:\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear any challenge to or to render a declaratory judgment concerning the constitutionality of sections 691(c) and 696 of the act.... The Supreme Court is authorized to take such action as it deems appropriate, consistent with the Supreme Court retaining jurisdiction over such a matter, to find facts or to expedite a final judgment in connection with such a challenge or request for declaratory relief.\nAct 46, \u00a7 27, reprinted in 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-691, Historical & Statutory Notes. The Charter School also filed an accompanying Petition in the Nature of a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief, followed by a first amended petition (the \u201cComplaint\u201d).\nIn the Complaint, the Charter School challenged the constitutionality of Section 696(i)(3), arguing that it \u201cgives the SRC unlimited discretion and power to suspend provisions of the School Code without establishing standards or restraints on the use of that power.\u201d Complaint at 25. The Charter School asserted that this power is in violation of the non-delegation precept of Article II, Section 1 of the state Constitution. The school maintained that, while the Legislature may delegate authority to execute or administer laws, it must establish standards and limit such delegation so that the administrative agency tasked with executing the laws conducts itself in compliance with legislative purposes. See id. at 26 (citing, inter alia, Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion Fund v. Commonwealth, 583 Pa. 275, 331, 877 A.2d 383, 417 (2005) (\u201cPAGE\u201d), and Blackwell v. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, 523 Pa. 347, 359, 567 A.2d 630, 636 (1989)). Thus, the Charter School expressed that a delegation of legislative authority is constitutional only if the General Assembly sets forth the policies guiding the delegation and surrounds it with definite standards and limitations. See id. at 27 (quoting Bell Tel. v. Driscoll, 343 Pa. 109, 116, 21 A.2d 912, 915-16 (1941)). According to the Charter School, Section 696(f)(3) of the Distress Law lacks the limitations and standards necessary to render it a constitutionally-permissible delegation of legislative authority. See id.\nThe Charter School asked this Court to issue a declaratory judgment specifying that Section 696(f)(3) of the Distress Law, 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-696(i)(3), is unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of the General Assembly\u2019s legislative authority in violation of Article II, Section 1. It also requested preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\nThe SRC and School District (collectively, \u201cRespondents\u201d) filed an answer primarily asserting that some of the Charter School\u2019s claims were not of constitutional dimension and, as such, they were outside the scope of this Court\u2019s obligation to exercise jurisdiction under Section 27 of Act 46. Respondents did acknowledge, however, that this Court had jurisdiction over the non-delegation claim. See Response to Application for Leave to File Petition at 22-23.\nUpon review, we granted the Application and issued a preliminary injunction limited to a directive that the parties preserve the status quo as it existed when the Application was filed. We also reserved judgment as to declaratory and permanent injunctive relief and directed the parties to brief, inter alia, the non-delegation issue.\nThe Charter School largely renews the contentions it advanced in its Complaint. It suggests that Section 696(i)(3) grants unfettered power to the SRC to suspend virtually any subset of the School Code\u2019s many provisions without any standards to guide or restrain the use of that power. It claims that the SRC has now used such power to suspend laws that granted specific rights to charter schools, and it has substituted its own \u201cCharter School Policy\u201d in place of the suspended provisions. Put simply, the Charter School argues that, with respect to charter schools, the SRC has created its own law, which is contrary to Article II, Section 1.\nThe Pennsylvania Coalition of Public Charter Schools and Philadelphia\u2019s Mathematics, Science and Technology Community Charter School (\u201cMaST\u201d) have submitted a joint amicus brief supporting the Charter School\u2019s request for relief. Ami-ci suggest that Respondents\u2019 actions have jeopardized the interests and operations of Philadelphia\u2019s charter school communities, which include parents and students. Amici also assert that such actions are contrary to the interests of the larger community, including the scholastic interests of the 5,300 students on MaST\u2019s waiting list.\nRespondents observe, first, that legislative authority is the power to make, alter, and repeal laws. See Brief for Respondents at 23-24 (quoting Jubelirer v. Rendell, 598 Pa. 16, 41, 953 A.2d 514, 529 (2008)). They state that suspensions do not equate to the making, amendment, or repeal of any law, and hence, the non-delegation doctrine does not apply to the SRC\u2019s suspension powers under Section 696(i)(3). Respondents contend that the governing constitutional provision in this case is Article I, Section 12, which, by its terms, permits the Legislature to delegate the power to suspend laws. See Pa. Const. art. I, \u00a7 12 (\u201cNo power of suspending laws shall be exercised unless by the Legislature or by its authority.\u201d (emphasis added)). Further, according to Respondents, even if the non-delegation doctrine does apply, Section 696(f)(3) does not violate it. In this regard, Respondents proffer that the doctrine requires only that the governing statute as a whole make clear the Legislature\u2019s policy choices so that those on whom the Legislature confers power act in accordance with those choices. As applied here, Respondents argue, the Distress Law clarifies that its overall policy objective is to take all measures necessary to rescue a school district of the first class from financial distress, and that this policy provides a governing standard for the SRC\u2019s exercise of its suspension authority. See Brief for Respondents at 32-33 (\u201cThe policy of the [Distress Law] is clear\u2014end the distress.\u201d).\nThe Department of Education and the Acting Secretary of Education, as amici supporting Respondents, add that the School District is in a statutorily defined state of fiscal distress as demonstrated by the Secretary\u2019s issuance of a declaration of distress under Section 691. They maintain that the Legislature intended, under such circumstances, for the SRC to retain powers necessary to reverse the prevailing conditions of financial hardship and poor academic performance. Amici reason that such conditions, as defined by Section 691 of the School Code, and as further clarified by the Secretary\u2019s declaration of distress, provide adequate guidance to the SRC, thereby rendering its Section 696(i)(3) suspension powers constitutional.\nArticle II, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution states that \u201c[t]he legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\u201d Pa. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1. The non-delegation rule has been described as a \u201cnatural corollary\u201d to this text. Chartiers Valley Joint Schs. v. Allegheny Cnty. Bd. of Sch. Dirs., 418 Pa. 520, 529, 211 A.2d 487, 492 (1965); see also W. Mifflin Area Sch. Dist. v. Zahorchak, 607 Pa. 153, 158 n. 5, 4 A.3d 1042, 1045 n. 5 (2010) (noting that Section 1 \u201chas been interpreted to .,. require[ ] that the basic policy choices involved in legislative power actually be made by the Legislature\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The precept, which has its origins in the separation-of-powers doctrine, see Lehman v. Pa. State Police, 576 Pa. 365, 380, 839 A.2d 265, 274 (2003), is of early lineage, see Wayman v. Southard, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 43, 6 L.Ed. 253 (1825) (Marshall, C.J.), and was expressed by political theorists who influenced the framers of the Constitution. See, e.g., John Locke, Second Treatise op Government \u00a7 141 (1690) (observing that legislative power \u201cconsists of the power to make laws, not to make legislators,\u201d and indicating, moreover, that the legislature is not free to transfer its lawmaking powers to any other body because such power was delegated to the legislature by the people); cf. 1 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *168 (1753) (remarking that a member of the House of Commons could not delegate his vote to a proxy \u201cas he himself is but a proxy for a multitude of other people\u201d). See generally Baron de Montesquieu, The Spirit op the Laws XI:6 (1748) (suggesting that political liberty requires a separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers), quoted in The Federalist No. 47 (James Madison).\nThis Court has considered multiple categories of non-delegation challenges. One such category involves statutes in which the General Assembly enacts a law but leaves its effectiveness to be determined by another person or entity via the ascertainment of some material fact or state of affairs. For example, in Locke\u2019s Appeal, 72 Pa. (22 Smith) 491 (1873), the Court approved a local-option law by which the electors of a municipality could vote to either allow or prohibit the sale of alcohol within the district. See id. at 494-95. The Court explained that the Legislature passed the law, which included such provisions as penalties for violating any ban on the sale of alcohol, but left its effectiveness to be determined by ascertainment of a fact, namely, the majority vote of the district\u2019s electors. See id. at 498; accord Driscoll, 343 Pa. at 114, 21 A.2d at 914-15 (\u201cWhere the legislature ... delegates to an administrative body the power to determine some fact or state of things upon which it makes or intends to make its own action depend, it is the legislature which has legislated and not the administrative body.\u201d). Thus, Locke\u2019s Appeal upheld the challenged statute. See also Young v. Fetterolf, 320 Pa. 289, 182 A. 676 (1936) (approving a statute giving municipalities the option to suspend a law prohibiting certain sporting events).\nAnother category of cases in which delegation has been challenged involves the legislative establishment of primary objectives or standards and the entrustment to another entity to \u201cfill up the details under the general [legislative] provisions[.]\u201d Driscoll, 343 Pa. at 114, 21 A.2d at 915 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); cf. Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, 426, 55 S.Ct. 241, 251, 79 L.Ed. 446 (1935) (\u201cCongress may ... establish primary standards, devolving upon others the duty to carry out the declared legislative policy[.]\u201d); J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409, 48 S.Ct. 348, 352, 72 L.Ed. 624 (1928) (Taft, C.J.) (requiring an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d to which the non-legislative body must conform), quoted in Holgate Bros. Co. v. Bashore, 331 Pa. 255, 262, 200 A. 672, 675 (1938). So long as adequately-defined standards and methodologies are provided by the Legislature, the administrative action involved may be as narrow as the grant or denial of a license, see, e.g., Casino Free Phila. v. Pa. Gaming Control Bd., 594 Pa. 202, 934 A.2d 1249 (2007), or as broad as the setting and adjustment of minimum and maximum wholesale and retail prices of a commodity to ensure fairness to producers and consumers and to regulate the supply of that commodity. See, e.g., Rohrer v. Milk Control Bd., 322 Pa. 257, 186 A. 336 (1936) (adopting the Superior Court dissent as this Court\u2019s opinion).\nThe enactment under review contains aspects of both of these classifications. It assigns to an executive branch official the duty to ascertain facts preliminary to a determination that a school district of the first class is in distress. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-691(c). That part of the law is uncontroversial. The contested issue is whether the Legislature provided adequate standards to channel the SRC\u2019s discretion in choosing which portions of the School Code to suspend pursuant to Section 696(i)(3) in order to remediate such distress.\nInitially, we agree with Respondents that via the Distress Law, as amended in 1998 and 2001, the Legislature sought to empower the SRC to take actions which it might deem necessary or convenient to alleviate the School District\u2019s ongoing financial crisis. While this is a salutary goal, the means chosen to effectuate it were extremely broad: the Legislature gave the SRC what amounts to carte blanche powers to suspend virtually any combination of provisions of the School Code\u2014a statute covering a broad range of topics. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-696(i)(3) (authorizing the SRC generally to \u201csuspend the requirements of\u2019 the School Code and its associated departmental regulations). This Court\u2019s decisions addressing the non-delegation rule have never deemed such an unconstrained grant of authority to be constitutionally valid. To the extent Respondents couch the legislative intention to remediate the School District\u2019s financial distress as a standard, moreover, we find this to be more aptly described as the legislative objective. Indeed, neither Section 696(i)(3) nor the Distress Law generally imposes any discernable standards or restraints in relation to the selection of School Code provisions for suspension. Those high-level determinations are left entirely to the SRC\u2019s discretion, and it is not apparent that any mechanism exists to either channel or test the SRC\u2019s exercise of such discretion.\nThe SRC\u2019s actions in the present case demonstrate the point: the SRC suspended a number of significant aspects of the Charter School Law and, in effect, rewrote some of that law in the form of its Charter Schools Policy. One aspect of the Charter School Law that the SRC suspended sets forth the bases for nonrenewal or termination of a charter and allows a charter school which suffers an adverse decision to obtain a hearing and administrative review before the State Charter School Appeal Board. See SRC-2013-1 at 4-5; 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1729-A(a), (d), quoted in Complaint at 10-12. See generally 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1721-A (establishing the state appeal board). This suspension undermines the concept that the SRC\u2019s decision making is, realistically, subject to standards set forth by the Legislature. Furthermore, that the Charter Schools Policy is essentially a legislative document is illustrated by, inter alia, its addition of eight new criteria for nonre-newal or revocation of a charter above and beyond those decided on by the Legislature in Section 1729-A of the Charter School Law. See Charter Schools Policy at 17.\nThe Distress Law also lacks any mechanism to limit the SRC\u2019s actions so as to \u201cprotect[ ] against administrative arbitrariness and caprice.\u201d Tosto v. Pa. Nursing Home Loan Agency, 460 Pa. 1, 12, 331 A.2d 198, 203 (1975). See generally William Penn Parking Garage, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 464 Pa. 168, 346 A.2d 269 (1975) (plurality) (reciting that the non-delegation rule serves two interrelated purposes: to ensure the Legislature makes basic policy choices, and to protect against the arbitrary exercise of unnecessary and uncontrolled discretionary power). This is a substantial deficiency because this Court has generally viewed the inclusion of such limitations as a necessary condition to satisfy the non-delegation rule. See Holgate Bros., 331 Pa. at 260, 200 A. at 675 (\u201cIn all such occasions ... the legislative body must surround such authority with definite standards, policies and limitations to which such administrative officers, boards or commissions, must strictly adhere and by which they are strictly governed.\u201d).\nIn Tosto, for example, the Court considered a non-delegation challenge to the Nursing Home Loan Agency Law\u2014a statute designed to provide financing for nursing home capital improvements undertaken to accommodate the health and safety needs of a nursing home\u2019s residents. Tosto rejected the constitutional attack because the law provided \u201cdetailed guidelines for certain important agency decisions,\u201d as well as \u201cnumerous procedural guidelines for protection against administrative arbitrariness[.]\u201d Tosto, 460 Pa. at 12-13, 331 A.2d at 203. These requirements included a legislative mandate that the agency establish neutral criteria for use in determining priority among applicants and develop standardized forms for loan applications. See id. The Court concluded that the use of such \u201ccriteria and forms is an important safeguard against the arbitrariness of ad hoc decision making.\u201d Id. at 13, 331 A.2d at 204.\nSeveral months later, the Court announced its decision in William Penn. That dispute involved a tax enabling statute which, among other things, permitted courts to assess whether certain local taxes were \u201cexcessive and unreasonable,\u201d and thus, invalid. The plurality observed that the enabling law afforded substantial protections against uncontrolled discretionary power. It noted, in this respect, that the evaluation of tax excessiveness or reasonableness was assigned to the judicial branch which must explain the grounds for its decision in a reasoned opinion subject to appellate review, so as \u201cto insure the general consistency of [the courts\u2019] actions ... and to confine them within their proper sphere.\u201d William Penn, 464 Pa. at 213, 346 A.2d at 291-92. Thus, the delegation was held to be appropriate.\nOn the other hand, in PAGE the Court faced a non-delegation challenge to Section 1506 of the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act (the \u201cGaming Act\u201d), which indicated that the siting of a slot-machine facility could not be prohibited by zoning laws, but that the Gaming Control Board could, in its discretion, \u201cconsider such local zoning ordinances when considering an application for a slot machine license.\u201d PAGE, 583 Pa. at 329, 877 A.2d at 416 (quoting 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1506 (repealed and replaced)). In evaluating whether the statute complied with Article II, Section 1, the Court reviewed a number of non-delegation decisions\u2014including Tosto and William Penn\u2014and recognized that, not only must the Legislature make the \u201cbasic policy choices\u201d embodied in a law, it must also supply \u201cadequate standards which will guide and restrain the exercise of the delegated administrative functions.\u201d Id. at 333, 877 A.2d at 418 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). With this litmus, PAGE concluded that Section 1506 of the Gaming Act stood in contrast to the provisions upheld in prior cases because it did not supply the Gaming Control Board with \u201cdefinite standards, policies and limitations to guide its decision-making with regard to zoning issues.\u201d Id. at 334, 877 A.2d at 418; cf. State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam\u2019rs v. Life Fellowship of Pa., 441 Pa. 293, 298, 272 A.2d 478, 481 (1971) (invalidating a law which effectively delegated to the Pennsylvania Chiropractic Society the task of determining the requirements, quality, and nature of chiropractic continuing education).\nAlthough the present case may not be on all fours with PAGE\u2014since the legislative goal here is evident, whereas the Gaming Act gave no indication regarding what, if any, importance the Gaming Control Board should give to local zoning laws\u2014it is more like PAGE than Tosto or William Penn. As explained, there are few, if any, concrete measures embodied in the Distress Law to effectively channel the SRC\u2019s discretion as in Tosto, and there is no requirement that the SRC hold hearings or explain the grounds for its suspension decisions in a reasoned opinion subject to judicial review as a check against arbitrariness or ad hoc decision making, as in William Penn. The SRC\u2019s awareness of the objective of its mission does not equate to definite standards, enforceable guidelines, or a realistic check against arbitrary decision making. See Panama Refining, 293 U.S. at 431-32, 55 S.Ct. at 253 (explaining that, unless a statute requires the person with delegated powers to make particularized findings that certain prerequisites are met, any standards or guidelines derived solely from stated legislative policy objectives are \u201cinoperative\u201d to exert any control over that person).\nAdditionally, the Distress Law does not merely empower the SRC to grant or deny charters. It permits the SRC to govern many substantive aspects of the delivery of public education in Philadelphia\u2014including the operation of charter schools\u2014through the suspension of virtually any combination of School Code provisions and associated regulations. In this regard, Petitioner argues, persuasively in our view, that:\nThe power to suspend the requirements of the Public School Code is an extremely broad power and is especially broad in the context of this case. The Public School Code is a significant body of law that is subdivided into more than 60 articles and hundreds of statutes, with far-reaching effects on the creation, operation, finances, and legal rights of students, teachers, and taxpayers. The Code concerns widely divergent topics such as public bidding requirements, school construction, reimbursements between the Commonwealth and school districts, [and] rules for the auditing of school finances.... Pursuant to the statutes that make up the various parts of the Code, the State Board of Education has promulgated a vast set of regulations embodied in Title 22 of the Pennsylvania Code, which itself outlines an extremely complex regulatory scheme governing the manner in which public education is delivered in Pennsylvania.... [T]he SRC could potentially suspend every single requirement contained in the Charter School Law. It could, for example, suspend the provisions governing the funding formula for charter schools contained in Section 17-1725-A and do away with the School District\u2019s obligation to pay charter schools at all.\nBrief for Petitioner at 36-38 (footnotes and citations omitted).\nThe Distress Law gives the SRC these broad powers pursuant to a generalized legislative objective of mitigating the School District\u2019s adverse financial circumstances. For the reasons given above, we do not view such objective as supplying either a constitutionally adequate guiding standard or an effective channeling mechanism relative to the SRC\u2019s discretionary suspension powers.\nFinally, we find unavailing Respondents\u2019 suggestion that the non-delegation rule does not presently apply because only statutory suspensions are involved, and such suspensions are authorized by Article I, Section 12. That provision\u2019s implication that suspensions may only occur per legislative authorization does not alter the restrictions on delegating legislative decision making as embodied in Article II, Section 1.\nIn summary, we hold that Section 696(i)(3) of the School Code, 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-696(i)(3), is unconstitutional as it violates the non-delegation rule of Article II, Section 1. Accordingly Respondents\u2019 actions taken pursuant to that provision are null and void, and Respondents are permanently enjoined from taking further action under the authority it confers.\nJustice EAKIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustices TODD, DOUGHERTY and WECHT join the opinion.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion in which Justice DONOHUE joins.\n. Act of Mar. 10, 1949, P.L. 30 (as amended 24 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-101 to 27-2702) (the \"School Code\u201d).\n. In particular, a new Article VI(F) was added with the original Article VI(F), pertaining to an unrelated topic, remaining in place. It is unknown why the Legislature duplicated the article and section numbers. Such designations as used here pertain to the second Article VI(F) appearing in the School Code, i.e., the Distress Law.\n. The Charter School Law is part of the School Code and is set forth at 24 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 17-1701-A to 17-1751-A.\n. This aspect of SRC-2013-1 appears duplicative of a portion of SRC-2011-20 discussed above. It may have been intended to accomplish more explicitly what SRC-2011-20 achieved indirectly.\n. The Charter School raised additional constitutional and statutory claims. In view of our disposition below, we need not discuss them.\n. The Attorney General was served with a copy of the Complaint as it advanced a constitutional challenge to a statute. See Pa.R.A.P. 521. She indicated, however, that the Department of Education would respond in her stead. The Department ultimately chose to file an amicus brief in lieu of a responsive pleading.\n. The federal analog is reposed in Article I, Section 1 of the United States Constitution. See U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 1 (\"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\u201d).\n. The acuteness of the District\u2019s financial situation cannot serve as a basis to liberalize the non-delegation precept. See Holgate Bros., 331 Pa. at 260, 200 A. at 675 (\u201cRegardless of exigencies which at times arise or of how trying our economic or social conditions become, the powers and duties imposed by the Constitution upon the legislative branch ... remain steadfast and neither the urgency of the necessity at hand nor the gravity of the situation allow the legislature to abdicate, transfer or delegate its authority or duty to another branch of the government.\u201d).\n. A permanent injunction may issue where a party establishes a clear right to relief and there is no adequate redress at law, See Buffalo Twp. v. Jones, 571 Pa. 637, 644, 813 A.2d 659, 663 (2002). That standard is satisfied here.",

        "text": "Justice BAER,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that Section 6-696(i)(3) of the Distress Law, 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-696(i)(3), which grants the School Reform Commission (\u201cSRC\u201d) the power to suspend provisions of the Public School Code, constitutes an unlawful delegation of legislative authority in violation of Article II, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In my view, Section 6\u2014696(i)(3) does not delegate legislative power, but rather delegates the authority to suspend legislation that affects the economic stability of a school district in financial distress, which is constitutionally permissible pursuant to Article I, Section 12. Accordingly, I would reject the constitutional challenge raised by the West Philadelphia Achievement Charter School (\u201cCharter School\u201d) and deny the Charter School\u2019s request for injunctive relief.\nPreliminarily, it is relevant that the Distress Law embodies a comprehensive statutory scheme to preserve school districts that are experiencing a financial crisis by remediating identified types of economic hardship that have resulted from ordinary operating procedures under the Public School Code. The statute identifies several threshold circumstances and levels of fiscal hardship that trigger the Secretary of Education\u2019s ability to issue a certificate declaring a school district in financial distress. 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-691. When a school district of the first class, i.e., the Philadelphia School District, is deemed to be in financial distress the SRC is established to replace the school district\u2019s board of directors and assume the latter\u2019s powers and duties. Id. \u00a7 6-696(a). The SRC serves as an instrumentality of the school district to administer the operation, management and educational program of the school district. Id. \u00a7 6-696(e)(1).\nSection 6-696(i) enumerates fourteen specific powers granted to the SRC, which powers continue until the Secretary of Education issues a declaration to dissolve the SRC, purportedly when financial stability has been achieved. Id. \u00a7 6-696(e)(1). An additional power enumerated in Section 6-696(i) is the power to suspend provisions of the Public School Code, which is challenged herein. The text of Section 6-696(i)(3) provides as follows:\nIn addition to all powers granted to the superintendent by law and a special board of control under section 693 and notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the School Reform Commission shall have the following powers:\nTo suspend the requirements of this act and regulations of the State Board of Education except that the school district shall remain subject to those provisions of this act set forth in sections 1073, 1073.1, 1076, 1077, 1078, 1080, 1732-A(a), (b) and (c), 1714-B and 2104 and regulations under those sections.\n24 P.S. \u00a7 6-696(i)(3).\nReduced to its essence, the Charter School\u2019s contention, which the majority adopts, is that Section 6-696(i)(3)\u2019s suspension power is so broad that it delegates legislative power to the SRC in violation of the anti-delegation rule. This premise is based upon the purported lack of any restraints or standards contained in the statutory language of Section 6-696(i)(3) to guide the SRC\u2019s exercise of the suspension power as well as the alleged lack of any means to protect against the arbitrary or ad hoc exercise of the SRC\u2019s discretion in choosing which statutory provisions to suspend.\nRespectfully, I disagree as I believe that the General Assembly, when enacting Section 6-696(i)(3) and the comprehensive statutory scheme of which it is a part, provided adequate standards to guide the SRC\u2019s exercise of discretion in determining which provisions of the Public School Code should be subject to the suspension power. I further find there are procedures in the Distress Act that adequately protect against the SRC\u2019s arbitrary or ad hoc suspension determinations.\nMy analysis begins with an examination of what constitutes legislative power. Legislative power has been defined as the power \u201cto make, alter, or repeal laws.\u201d Blackwell v. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, 523 Pa. 347, 567 A.2d 630, 637 (1989). Accordingly, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that the Legislature cannot constitutionally delegate the power to make law to any other branch of government or to any other body or authority.\u201d Gilligan v. Pennsylvania Horse Racing Commission, 492 Pa. 92, 422 A.2d 487, 489 (1980) (citing State Bd. of Chiropractic Examiners v. Life Fellowship of Pa., 441 Pa. 293, 272 A.2d 478, 480 (1971)).\nThe legislature may, however, constitutionally delegate to another body the authority to execute and administer a law so long as the General Assembly makes the basic policy choices and provides adequate standards and guidelines to allow the other body to carry out those legislative policies. Blackwell, 567 A.2d at 637. Significantly, in reviewing the adequacy of guiding standards incorporated in a law, this Court looks to the law as a whole, considering its purpose and scope, the subject matters covered therein, the duties prescribed and the broad or narrow powers granted. Dauphin Deposit Trust Company v. Myers, 388 Pa. 444, 130 A.2d 686, 688 (1957). The General Assembly is not required \u201cto provide a detailed how-to manual within each and every legislative act\u201d in order to supply adequate standards, Casino Free Philadelphia v. Pennsylvania Gaming Control Bd., 594 Pa. 202, 934 A.2d 1249, 1252 (2007), and all details of administration need not be precisely or separately enumerated in the statute. Chartiers Valley Joint Schools v. County Board of School Directors, 418 Pa. 520, 211 A.2d 487, 492 (1965).\nWith this jurisprudence in mind, I conclude that Section 6-696(i)(3) is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power under Article II, Section 1 as it does not authorize the SRC to make, alter or repeal the law. Rather, Section 6-696(i)(3) constitutes a lawful delegation of the General Assembly\u2019s power to suspend laws pursuant to Article I, Section 12 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. See Pa. Const. art. I, \u00a7 12 (\u201cNo power of suspending laws shall be exercised unless by the Legislature or its authority.\u201d (emphasis added)). While there is superficial appeal to the Charter School\u2019s contention that the suspension power is so broad that it effectively enables the SRC to \u201clegislate,\u201d a close examination of the challenged provision and the statutory scheme of which it is a part reveals that the SRC is empowered only to suspend those provisions of the Public School Code that result in financial distress to the school district for the limited period during which the economic crisis of the school district continues. Because Section 6-696(i)(3) does not authorize the SRC to legislate by making, altering, or repealing the law, it is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.\nBy enacting Section 6\u2014696(i)(3) and the Distress Law as a whole, the General Assembly has made the basic policy determination to preserve the failing school district by identifying and remediating sources of financial distress \u201cnotwithstanding any other law to the contrary.\u201d 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-696(i). The SRC does not hold the power over basic policy choices inherent in the Public School Code, but may only exercise its discretion to suspend those provisions that preserve the school district by remediating identified types of financial distress.\nI do not believe the Legislature afforded the SRC carte blanche powers to suspend any combination of the School Code provisions. The standards guiding the SRC\u2019s exercise of discretion in determining which provisions of the Public School Code to suspend appear both in Section 6-696(i)(3) itself, which enumerates several provisions that may not be suspended, as well as in the Distress Law as a whole, which, as noted, makes clear that remediation efforts are aimed at resolving the financial distress of the school district. A suspension of a provision of the Public School Code that is immaterial to the contemplated advancement of financial stability is simply unauthorized. Although the suspension power granted to the SRC is somewhat broad, it is necessarily so, as the breadth of the standard is driven by the breadth of the problem, and the problem here is unquestionably great. Accord. Water & Power Res. Bd., Dep\u2019t of Forests & Waters, 145 A.2d at 182. Because the General Assembly can neither predict all causes of refractory distress within such a complex system nor statutorily prescribe precisely how to remedy the effects in all instances, the grant of broad authority is required to effectuate the purposes of the legislation.\nAdditionally, the Distress Law contains procedures to protect against arbitrary or ad hoc decision-making by the SRC. The Distress Law requires the SRC to submit annually a report to the Governor and the Education Committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding progress made toward improvements in fiscal and academic performance. 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-696(n.2). The General Assembly therefore brings to bear a multi-branch review of both the performance of the SRC in abating distress and, ultimately, whether financial distress continues to exist at all. By requiring the SRC to report annually to the Commonwealth\u2019s chief executive and the legislative committees, the Distress Law holds the SRC accountable to perform in accordance with the remedial purposes of the Distress Law. Finally, the Distress Law authorizes the Governor to remove a member of the SRC prior to expiration of the term of office upon proof by clear and convincing evidence of malfeasance or misfeasance. Id. \u00a7 6-696(b)(2). In my view, the improper exercise of an enumerated power, such as the suspension power, could constitute grounds for removal of SRC members.\nIn conclusion, I acknowledge that the General Assembly\u2019s grant of suspension power to the SRC has vast implications on all charter schools, as well as other individuals and entities involved in public education in the Philadelphia School District. The enormity of the power conveyed and the dramatic effects resulting from exercise of that authority, however, do not render Section 6-696(i)(3) unconstitutional under the anti-delegation clause where the General Assembly made the requisite basic policy decisions inherent in the legislation and afforded adequate guidance to the SRC in exercising the suspension authority. It cannot be ignored that a party challenging a legislative enactment bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that the statute clearly, palpably, and plainly violates the constitution. Commonwealth v. Payne, 582 Pa. 375, 871 A.2d 795, 800 (2005). In my opinion, the Charter School has simply failed to satisfy that burden here.\nJustice DONOHUE joins this dissenting opinion.\n. This provision, entitled, \"Legislative power,\u201d states \"[t]he legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\u201d Pa. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1.\n. Article I, Section 12, entitled, \"Power of suspending laws,\u201d states \"[n]o power of suspending laws shall be exercised unless by the Legislature or by its authority.\u201d Pa. Const. art. I, \u00a7 12 (emphasis added).\n. These powers permit, inter alia: the appointment of entities needed to conduct necessary fiscal and performance audits; agreements with for-profit or nonprofit organizations to operate one or more schools with funds identified in the agreement; the suspension of requirements governing the establishment of, and facilities for, charter schools; the suspension or revocation of a charter; employing professional and senior management employees without state certification upon the committee\u2019s approval of qualifications and salary; the closing or reconstitution of a school; the suspension of professional employees without regard to the section normally governing suspensions; the appointment of managers, administrators, and others to oversee operations of schools; the reallocation of resources, amendment of school procedures, development of achievement plans, and implementation of testing or other evaluation procedures for educational purposes; the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements; the delegation to a person of powers deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of this article; and the employment of persons to review the financial and educational programs of school buildings and make recommendations to the SRC regarding improvements thereto. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 6-696(i).\n. As discussed infra, the text of this provision addresses only the power to suspend legislation, not create new law, and provides guidance in that it enumerates particular provisions that cannot be suspended and to which the school district shall remain subject.\n. In presenting its argument to this Court, the Charter School points to specific actions taken by the SRC, suggesting that its quarrel is not with the constitutionality of the Legislature's delegation of authority, but with how the SRC has exercised the authority granted. In my view, the propriety of the SRC's actions is not properly before this Court as it is not within the scope of our original jurisdiction in this matter; the only question we may decide in this appeal pertains to the constitutionality of Section 6\u2014696(i)(3).\n. The standards advanced by the Legislature must be sufficiently clear and definite to guide the delegee in the performance of its stated function. Holgate Bros. Co. v. Bashore, 331 Pa. 255, 200 A. 672, 674 (1938); Bell Tel. Co. of Pennsylvania v. Driscoll, 343 Pa. 109, 21 A.2d 912, 915 (1941). The standards must also be sufficiently broad to give the delegee some flexibility to deal with the particular problem that the Legislature has asked it to address. See Water & Power Res. Bd., Dep\u2019t of Forests & Waters v. Green Springs Co., 394 Pa. 1, 145 A.2d 178, 182 (1958).\n. I appreciate that the Philadelphia School District has been in financial distress for well over a decade, but this fact cannot cloud the constitutional analysis of the challenged statutoiy language at issue. Stated differently, the SRC's continued inability to achieve economic stability within the school district has no bearing on the constitutionality of the authority granted to the SRC by Section 6-696(i)(3).",
