She had lived there in her parental residence and had taught in the public schools. When she died testate at the age of sixty, her only apparent surviving relatives were certain collaterals. By her last will, which she signed “Olive O. Jury”, she devised and bequeathed her residuary estate to her “heirs as provided by the intestate laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” The will was duly probated and letters of administration c.t.a. on her estate were granted to a local trust company, the executor named in the will having predeceased the testatrix. A final account filed by the administrator showed a balance for distribution, and the Orphans’ Court appointed an auditor to make distribution among the parties entitled thereto.</p>

He testified that he and Olive O. Jury were married on July 18, 1931, in Coshocton, Ohio; that no issue was born of the marriage; and that he and his wife were never divorced. He also introduced in corroboration of his testimony an exemplification of the record of his marriage to Olive O. Jury on file in the Record of Marriages in the Probate Court of Stark County, Ohio. The auditor specifically found, and the court below confirmed, that Ned Osthaus is the lawful surviving spouse of the testatrix. Nor do the collateral heirs dispute his status as such. Their contention is that Osthaus <em>wilfully </em>neglected or refused to provide for his wife during a period of more than one year prior to her death and that, consequently, he thereby forfeited his right to share in the distribution of her estate: see <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>Section 6(a) of the Intestate Act of 1947, P.L. 80, 20 PS §1.6(a). As already indicated, Osthans claims under the testatrix’s Avill and not against it. HoAvever, that is of no present importance. Had he elected to take against the will, he would have been met Avith the same objection by the collateral heirs: Section 9 of the Wills Act of 1947, 20 PS §180.9.</p>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[231,715,1156,1479]]]'>The only testimony adduced by the collaterals in support of their contention came from Osthaus, himself, Avho, called as for cross-examination, testified that he took up residence in Akron, Ohio, in 1919 and sometime later met Olive O. Jury who Avas attending summer school sessions at the Western Reserve University; that, during the summer of 1931, when he Avas 41 and Olive 40, they were married; and that they lived together Avhile she attended summer school but never established a common home. Olive continued to live in Shamokin, Avhere she taught school, and Osthaus lived for a time in Akron, later moving to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in order to take care of his aged and invalid mother. The only other periods during which the parties cohabited Avere when Olive was attending further summer school sessions and, on one occasion after the death of Olive’s father, when Osthaus spent “a Aveek or two” Avith her in Shamokin. The last time he saw his Avife was in 1940, but, subsequent to that, there was some correspondence between them. Admittedly, Osthaus contributed nothing to his wife’s support during the tAvo years preceding his wife’s death. For that period, his total income was $22.80 consisting of two dividends amounting to $2.80 on a share of stock and $20 which he received for jury duty. With the exception of his one share of stock, Osthaus owned no other property, either real or personal.</p>

The auditor accordingly held that Osthaus was not entitled to share in the distribution of his wife’s estate. Following exceptions by Osthaus, the auditor filed a supplemental report in which he reversed himself in part by holding that the collateral heirs had failed to prove Osthaus guilty of <em>wilful </em>nonsupport of his wife but affirmed that he was barred nonetheless from participating in the distribution of his wife’s estate by reason of a testamentary intent to exclude him as a devisee and legatee under her will. Both the collateral heirs and Osthaus filed exceptions to the auditor’s supplemental report. After argument on the exceptions, the court below reversed both of the auditor’s conclusions by holding, first, that there was no basis for concluding that the testatrix had intended by her will to exclude her husband as an heir and, second, that Osthaus’s admitted failure to support his wife raised a presumption that such nonsupport was <em>wilful </em>and, having failed to rebut the presumption, he had forfeited his right to share in his wife’s estate. The court entered a final decree against the husband on the basis of the latter conclusion, and Osthaus brought this appeal.</p>

Section 14 (4) of the Wills Act of 1947, P.L. 89, 20 PS §180.14 (4), declares that, unless a contrary intention appears <em>in the will, </em>a devise or bequest to heirs shall be held to include the surviving spouse. It is true, tliát, at common law, neither spouse was considered an heir as to the other’s <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>real estate. But, both before and after the Intestate Act of 1917, P.L. 429, which made the surviving spouse a statutory heir of the other, the use of the word “heirs” in a will was uniformly construed to include the surviving spouse if no contrary intent is expressed by the will: <em>Barnard </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/351/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="351 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="462716" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0313-01">351 Pa. 313</a>, 314-315, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20578" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="41 A.2d 578">41 A. 2d 578</a>. Such having been the established rule when the testatrix executed her will (June 18, 1941) as well as when she died (December 15, 1951), she is legally presumed to have understood and to have used the term “heirs” in accordance with the meaning which the law ascribed to it. This is especially so since, admittedly, the will was professionally drawn. And, where the plain words, of a will clearly disclose the testatrix’s intent, there is no occasion for testamentary construction : see <em>Earle </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/369/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="369 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1232349" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0052-01">369 Pa. 52</a>, 56, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%2090" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="85 A.2d 90">85 A. 2d 90</a>, and cases there cited.</p>
    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.5",232,[250,1281,1152,816]]]'>Certainly, no intention to exclude her husband as an heir is to be deduced from the fact that the testatrix executed her will by her maiden name. That was the only name by which she had been known in her locality throughout her lifetime. She had never assumed use of her husband’s surname, and the fact of her marriage had not been generally publicized. No reason appears.of record for the parties’ withholding from the public knowledge of their marriage. Prom all that appears, the marital arrangement was perfectly satisfactory to both. But, however that may be, the decedent’s testamentary intent is clear enough. She devised and bequeathed the residue of - her estate to her heirs as determined by the intestate, law, and her husband qualifies as a.member of that.class...</p>

Section 6 (a) of the Intestate Act of 1947, 20 PS §1.6 (a), which repeats verbatim, in presently material part, the corresponding provision of the Act of 1917, declares that “A husband who, for one year or upwards, previous to the death of his wife, shall have wilfully neglected or refused to provide for her, or who for that period or upwards shall have wilfully and maliciously deserted her, shall have no title or interest under this act in her real or her personal estate.” No contention is here made that there is a forfeiture because of a wilful and malicious desertion.

Indeed, the fact is that, for the two years prior to his wife’s death, Osthaus, who was then taking care of his aged and invalid mother, was utterly without funds wherewith to contribute to his wife’s support had she desired him to do so. There is nothing in the evidence indicating that there had been a change in the marital arrangement between Osthaus and his wife from what it had been from its inception and which was undoubtedly consensual when begun. Neither of them had evidenced any departure from the course both had pursued from the time of their marriage. They apparently chose to live as they did. Never did they exhibit any intention of establishing a common home; nor did they establish one. Olive returned to her teaching position in Shamokin, which made her self-supporting, and Osthaus continued to live in Akron. There is no basis whatsoever in the testimony for inferring that the arrangement was other than mutually agreeable. A wife can voluntarily relieve her husband of his duty to provide for her support: see <em>Kvist’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/256/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="256 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="1030751" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0030-01">256 Pa. 30</a>, 36, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.%20523" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="100 A. 523">100 A. 523</a>.

In-construing-the-statute, we-are required to give effect, if possible, to all-of its provisions (Section; 51 of the Statutory- Construction Act • of 1937, -P.L. 1019, 46 PS §551) and to give the words- used their common and ordinary meaning (Section 33 of the <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>Statutory Construction Act, 46 PS §533). While, etymologically, “wilful”, from which the adverb “wilfully” derives, may mean intentional, volitional, deliberate, etc., in common parlance, the word connotes fault, wrongdoing, blameworthiness, etc. Thus, Webster’s New International Dictionary (2nd Ed., 1946) defines “Willful” (or “wilful”) as meaning not only “Self-determined; voluntary; intentional” but also “Governed by will without yielding to reason; obstinate; perverse; stubborn”. That the word “wilful” ordinarily has a broader meaning than intentional or deliberate is evident from the word’s general use in common legal phrases designed to imply conscious fault or culpability, e.g., “wilful misconduct”, “wilful absence”, “wilful omission”, etc. To equate “wilfully”, as used in the statute under consideration, with “intentionally” would be to give no effect whatsoever to the legislature’s use of the term. In short, the result reached by the court below was no different than what it would have been had the statute not employed the word “wilfully”.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[170,1504,1149,818]],["BL_236.1",236,[252,334,1151,766]]]'>The cases cited by the appellees are readily distinguishable. In fact, <em>Buckley Estate, </em>supra, which the court below also relied upon for its ruling that proof of a husband’s nonsupport, without more, affords a presumption of <em>wilfiol </em>neglect and refusal to provide for his wife, impliedly recognized exactly the opposite. In the <em>Buckley </em>case, which was concerned with a husband’s forfeiture of his right to elect to take against his deceased wife’s will because of wilful nonsupport <em>and </em>desertion, the husband had been in the penitentiary for more that a year prior to his wife’s death. However, that period of nonsupport alone was not sufficient to raise a presumption of wilfulness. Thus,- Mr. Justice Stearns pointedly observed for this court that “the incarceration of the husband for a year and upwards <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>might not of itself establish either <em>wilful </em>desertion or nonsupport . . (Emphasis supplied). The opinion elsewhere reveals that the facts which gave rise to a presumption of wilful failure to support were prior incarcerations of the husband in various prisons in Pennsylvania and Ohio over a long period of time, there being no suggestion. of any resumed observance on his part, during intervening periods of freedom, of his liability for his wife’s support. Nor is it to be overlooked that, in the <em>Buckley </em>case, there was a positive testamentary disinheritance of the husband. The testatrix, having made, no provision for her husband, expressly declared that he had lost any right to take against her will.</p>

Being unable to secure further suitable employment together, they took positions in different places. Having thus separated, they never again lived together except for one brief period a few years later. Eight years thereafter the wife died. During the time of the separation, the husband made no contribution to his wife’s support although the evidence showed that she was frequently in needy circumstances and he had an income until the date of her death. The trial court deemed significant to the question of wilfulness, as indeed it was, the fact that, when they ceased to have a common home, the husband cast his wife among strangers. There is no such evidence in the instant case. Osthaus and his wife lived until her death just as they had from the inception of their marital relationship.</p>

It will suffice to state that Ned Osthaus and deceased, at the respective ages of forty-one and forty, married July 18, 1981, in Ohio, while the wife was attending summer school. The wife, a school teacher, who always used her maiden name, died December 15, 1951. During the twenty years the parties never established a common home. However, during the session of summer school and after the wife’s father died, the parties sporadically cohabited. Since October, 1940, the <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>husband never saw his wife. Correspondence passed between the parties, but the nature and contents thereof was not disclosed. During the entire period of twenty years there is no testimony that the husband ever contributed to his wife’s support. During the two years preceding the wife’s death there was affirmative testimony that the husband contributed nothing. The record discloses that decedent’s estate for distribution is $19,803.41. As there is no issue the husband’s share, if allowed, is $10,000 plus one-half the balance, a total of $14,901.70, leaving $4,901.71 for distribution among the wife’s next of kin.</p>
