L. 463, and now operates under its successor Act of May 2, 1945, P. L. 382. It was organized under an Ordinance of the Borough of West View of October 6, 1942. It acquired the property and assets of the Pittsburgh Suburban Water Service Company and is now serving water to about 90,000 customers in 15 municipalities. On August 5, 1949, the Borough passed an Ordinance providing, as an additional project of the Authority, for the acquisition, improvement, operation and leasing, either as lessor or lessee, of a building on certain specified lots in the Borough, “to be devoted wholly, or partially, for public use and for revenue producing purposes.” Such a building was accordingly constructed, consisting in part of one story and in part of two stories. 6,090 square feet of its area on the first floor is used by the Authority for its water project; 1.500 square feet are leased to a commercial tenant (Stag Shop); 6,120 square feet are leased to another commercial tenant (Star Market) ; 3,600 square feet are leased to the Borough and sublet by it, — 2,100 square feet to a commercial tenant (Gary Auto Stores), and 1.500 square feet to Peoples First National Bank and Trust Company. The entire second floor, consisting of 6,230 square feet, is leased to the Borough, which rents it out occasionally for private dances, receptions and the like, also to various fraternal and other organizations, and sometimes to. groups such as the Firemen, the Police, and the Chamber of Commerce, — these last rent free. The Borough itself does not use any part of the floor nor has it any office in the building.</p>

The Authority took two appeals to the' Court of Common Plea's, one involving the triennial assessment for the years 1950, 1951 and 1952, and the <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>other the triennial assessment for the years 1953, 1954 and 1955. It did not question the amount of the valuation but it claimed that the property should have been exempted from taxation. The court held that the part of the land and building actually used by the Authority, as well as the part used by the Borough for off-street parking, were exempt, but that all parts not so used, but rented to others, were taxable. Accordingly it granted exemption for one-quarter of the valuation placed on the buildings and three-quarters of the valuation placed on the land, thereby reducing the amount of the assessment to $99,000 for each of the triennial years in question except the year 1950 the assessment for which Avas completely cancelled because at that time no building had been erected on the land. The Authority has taken the present appeals from the court’s orders and raises the question whether the portions of the property leased out by the Authority should not have been held to be tax exempt the same as all the rest of the building, and, in any event, whether the second floor portion leased to the Borough should not have been exempted.</p>

There must, hoAVever, always be kept in mind the provisions of Article IX, section 1; of. the' Constitution that “The General Assembly..may . .'. exempt from taxation public property <em>used.for public: </em>purposes,.. ...” and section 2, that “All laws exempting property from taxation, other than the property above enumerated shall be void.” To qualify, therefore, for tax exemption it must be estab<a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>lislied that the property is being used for a public purpose and, while a declaration by the legislature as to the existence of a public purpose is entitled to prima facie acceptance as to its correctness, it is not conclusive, it being a judicial question for the ultimate determination of the courts as to whether a proposed use is a public one: <em>Dornan v.

It is argued by the Authority that since, under The General Borough Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 519, §2701, as amended by The Borough Code of July 10, 1947, P. L. 1621, §82, boroughs are authorized to provide and maintain indoor recreation centers, and since the Borough of West View was using the second floor for such purpose, the court should have held it to be tax exempt. We are of opinion, however, that the present use of this floor is not as a “recreation center” within the contemplation of the statute. That term is used in the statute in conjunction with public parks, parkways, playgrounds, playfields, swimming pools, public baths, bathing places and gymnasiums, all referred to therein as “recreation places,” and we do not think that the renting out of the floor by the Borough for private social affairs and for meetings of various organizations falls within the category of such uses.
