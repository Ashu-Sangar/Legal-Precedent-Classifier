Defendant erected a residential development thereon, known as “Plymouth Meeting Village”, consisting of 149 dwellings — four dwellings to an acre. Defendant installed no gutters, sewers, reservoirs or drains to carry off the surface waters. Each lot had its own cesspool or septic tank. The land had formerly been farm land.</p>

Plaintiffs also contend that seivage Avas mingled Avith the surface water. The chancellor found that there was no credible evidence to support these contentions.</p>
