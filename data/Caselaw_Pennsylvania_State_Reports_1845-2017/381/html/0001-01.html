Scully, brought an action of trespass against the City of Philadelphia to recover damages for injuries sustained by her as the result of a fall allegedly due to a hole or depression in the surface of Lancaster Avenue. The defect in the street was between the rails of one of the trolley tracks of the Philadelphia Transportation Company, and the City brought in the Company as an additional defendant. A jury returned a verdict of $3,200 against both defendants. The Transportation Company filed a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto which was granted. The City filed a motion for new trial which it withdrew and a motion for n.o.v. which was refused, and this appeal is from the judgment entered on the verdict. The City does not question the entry of judgment n.o.v. in favor of the Transportation Company.</p>

Lansdowne Avenue runs from the southwest to the northeast into Lancaster Avenue where it ends about 75 feet west of where 52nd Street crosses Lancaster Avenue. This results in a large intersection area. There are street car tracks on Lansdowne Avenue which extend into Lancaster Avenue and then turn north on 52nd Street. The paved <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>area of Lancaster Avenue is 50 feet in width and that of 52nd Street, 60 feet.

There was a traffic signal at this corner and another on the other side of Lancaster Avenue which the plaintiff testified she was facing when she started across Lancaster Avenue after the traffic light had turned green. She stated that she looked where she was going but her attention was distracted by an automobile which was coming from Lansdowne Avenue and turning east on Lancaster Avenue. When the plaintiff reached a point between the rails of the Transportation Company’s eastbound track, her heel caught in a hole or depression causing her to fall and suffer a broken hip. According to the testimony, the defect in the street was about two feet long, about two inches wide and from two to six inches deep.</p>

After argument before Judge McNeille, the rule was discharged. At the outset of the trial plaintiff offered in evidence paragraphs 3 and 4 of the complaint above referred to. Counsel for the City objected, calling the attention of Judge Davis, the trial judge, to the City’s contention, as stated in its petition and proposed answer, that the Commonwealth and not the City under named Acts of Assembly had the duty of maintenance and repair of the street.

The court below in answering this contention held that the City could not cure the “deficiency” in its pleading by the “technique” of judicial notice; that a statutory defense must be specifically pleaded under the local rule of the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court known as Pa. B. C. P. 1019* (i) which provides: “Whenever any right, claim or defense is asserted to be founded upon a specific statute of this or another jurisdiction or upon an ordinance, governmental regulation or rule of court, the first pleading in which such right, claim or defense is asserted shall cite, for the information of the court, the statute, ordinance, regulation or rule so relied upon.”. The City claims that the purpose of this local rule is merely to inform the court of the statute or statutes relied on in support of its asserted defense, and here <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>the court was fully apprised of the statutory law relied on.</p>

The City replies, as above stated, that the averments of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the complaint are conclusions of law which it was not required to answer.</p>

L. 589, as amended by the Act of July 10, 1941, P. L. 345, and the Act of June 1, 1945, P. L. 1242, 36 PS §961-1 et seq., §670-101. Section 5 of the Act of May 7, 1937 expressly excluded the portions of the streets which are or may be used and ocr 'cupied by the structures or surface facilities of any public utility company. This exclusion was deleted in the amendatory Act of July 10, 1941 and therefore the City contends the entire roadway of the streets was placed under the jurisdiction , and authority of the State Highway Department with the concomitant duty of maintenance and repair. However, certain limitations on the powers and obligations of the Commonwealth are set forth in Section 3 of the 1937 Act as amended by the 1941 Act, which section has never been repealed. For present purposes only one of these limi<a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>tations need be considered. Section 3(c) provides that “No city street, or part thereof, described in section two of this act, shall be taken over if an agreement has been entered into between the city authorities and the Commonwealth or any other party for the <em>maintenance </em>or construction of such street even though no formal contract has been executed pursuant to such agreement and no work has 'been done, until the terms of the agreement have been fulfilled.”.

    <p id="b65-5" data-blocks='[["BL_65.5",65,[187,847,1147,647]]]'>At the trial of the instant case there was introduced into evidence a written agreement entered into between the City and the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, predecessor of the additional defendant, dated July 1, 1907, under which the City for a stipulated annual consideration obligated itself to pave and repair those parts of the streets occupied by a traction company’s surface line with the exception that the transportation company was still required “. . . to replace or repair pavement removed or damaged by any construction or repair work which the company may undertake with reference to its tracks or conduits.”.</p>

In that case there was evidence that the hole in the street resulted from a defect in the <em>track structure, </em>more specifically a loose connec<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>tion between the trolley rail and the steel plates upon which the rail rested. Here the City, although clearly cognizant of the exception, and with ample opportunity to present evidence, if it existed, bringing it within the exception, introduced no testimony whatever as to a faulty construction or maintenance of the additional defendant’s track structure on Lancaster Avenue. Since the agreement between the City and the traction company was still in force at the time of the occurrence in question and the City introduced no evidence that would bring it within the exception provision of that agreement, as between the defendant and the additional defendant the duty to repair the paving was on the City. And inasmuch as the statute in question expressly exempts the Commonwealth where the municipality has entered into an agreement with a third party, as it has here, the City alone remained liable for the repair and maintenance of the portion of the cartway lying between the rails.</p>

If such were the legislative intention, it could have easily so provided. The exemption from obligation by the Commonwealth is not limited by the language employed to an agreement under which a third party undertakes the maintenance and repair but covers any agreement or arrangement between the City and a third party under which, in relief of the Commonwealth, maintenance and repair is assumed by one or the other of the parties to the agreement. To limit the meaning of the exemption as appellant urges, would lead to the unconscionable result that the Commonwealth would be <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>required to make the expenditure necessary to maintain and repair the paving within the trolley track area on all State highways located within the City, while the City receives from the utility and retains the amount required to cover the very work performed and paid for by the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> If it be assumed that the section of the Act in question permits of two different interpretations, then a construction that would produce such a result must be rejected.

According to the evidence there were two established crossings as shown on a chart prepared by the City’s Bureau of Traffic Engineers, the one located approximately 50 feet west and the other 100 feet east of the point where plaintiff fell. However, there was testimony by a witness for the City, an inspector of the City’s Bureau of Highways, from which the jury could find that the painted lines marking these “established” crosswalks had become “worn out” by passing traffic and at the time of the accident were so obliterated as not to be evident to the plaintiff. The plaintiff testified that she was unfamiliar with the intersection which, consisting of three converging streets, was a complex one. At the point where she proposed to cross there were no signs directing pedestrians to the crosswalks or cautioning against proceeding as she did. Of course, in the absence of any such directions or visible markings of the established crossings, the plaintiff was bound to exercise prudence in crossing the street.

In order to use the crosswalk to the west, plaintiff would have had to first walk across Lansdowne Avenue for which no crosswalk was provided; then an additional 75 feet to reach the north side of Lancaster Avenue, her intended destination. Use of the crosswalk to the east would have necessitated her travelling about 75 feet east on Lancaster Avenue to the corner of 52nd Street and then 100 feet north on the crosswalk, and in so doing she would have been subjected to traffic from several directions. The course actually taken by the plaintiff was the shortest and most direct route to the north side of Lancaster Avenue, and although not marked by lines, it had the appearance of an established crossing in that it was at an intersection and between traffic signals. For all that appears, the alternative routes were not only less convenient but fraught with more risks than the route actually taken. Consequently the instant case is governed by the principle first enunciated by this Court in <em>Samuel S. Mellor v. The Burgess and Town Council of Bridgeport, </em><a href="/pa/191/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="191 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="907082" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0562-01">191 Pa. 562</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.%20365" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="43 A. 365">43 A. 365</a>, and recently reaffirmed in <em>Scurco v.

Under such circumstances the rule is that, if the alternative route has dangers of its own and the dangers of the route actually taken are not so great and obvious as to deter ordinarily prudent and careful people from using it, the question of contributory negligence is for the jury: . .
