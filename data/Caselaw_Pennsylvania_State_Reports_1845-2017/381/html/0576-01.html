The premises were still under construction when the lease was entered into and were not completed until October <em>9, 1958, </em>when the <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>store was opened and the 20 year term of the lease began. The rent payable by the tenant during the first five years of the lease was designated as five and one-half per cent of the gross sales (excepting tobacco), and the average rentals during this period determined the minimum rental for the second five years. The minimum rental for the last ten years was based on the average rentals during the first ten years. The lease prohibited (1) an assignment, mortgage, pledge or encumbrance of the lease; and (2) a subletting of the whole or any substantial part of the demised premises without the written consent of the landlord, except as otherwise provided in Article 4 thereof. The tremendous importance of the gross sales and in turn the merchandising ability of the tenant or sublessee is obvious and it is therefore easy to understand the reason for the subletting provision and the forfeiture provisions of the lease.</p>

The record indicates that j;his total was $46,000; and after a down payment of $10,000., Bielitsky and Benjamin had five years in which to pay the balance.</p>

The so-called “License Agreement” of September 25, 1953, between Sun Ray and Bielitsky and Benjamin was a hybrid agreement which provided that Bielitsky and Benjamin were to possess and exercise complete control over the operation of the store and were entitled to all the profits therefrom except that they could not make purchases from anyone else until they were out of Sun Ray’s debt, (except for money owed for current merchandise purchases). The terms of this so-called License Agreement were confirmed by William Bielitsky who deposed, inter alia, that not only did he and his partner have full responsibility for employing and paying employees of the store and paying their Social Security and Withholding Tax, but that maintenance of the premises was their sole responsibility. Bielitsky added that fire insurance policies covering the store name his partner and himself as the insured, that all taxes are paid by them and in their names and that no accounting of the profits from this business is made to Sun Ray. Further, Bielitsky and Benjamin filed a fictitious name certificate with the Prothonotary at Doylestown, Pa., stating that they, were doing <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>business as “Sun Ray Drug Agency 559”. It is immediately obvious that this was more than a License Agreement.

We cannot agree with this contention. The Agreements may contain ambiguous language with respect to various provisions and their effect, but Article 10 clearly prohibits an assignment or a sub-lease without the written consent of Lessor, and Article 4 does not restrict or obscure this Clear prohibition nor the landlord’s option to terminate the lease to Sun Eay if the latter breached any. of the terms, or conditions of the <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>lease. Under this clear language, a contractual provision for forfeiture for sub-letting without the written consent of the lessor may unquestionably be enforced by a Court. <em>Stevenson v.
