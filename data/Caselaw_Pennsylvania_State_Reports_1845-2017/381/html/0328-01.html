Dunlap, is now deceased, and his widow has remarried, and as my grandson John M. Dunlap, Jr., is, in my opinion, <em>sufficiently </em>provided for, I hereby revoke and annul any and <em>all </em>gifts, devises and bequests contained in my said Will dated December 3, 1919, <em>in which my deceased son </em>John M.

The first thing to note <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>is tlie sweeping language of the prohibition. The testator not only revoked and annulled all gifts contained in' his will for John and his issue, but all gifts contained in his will “in which my deceased son John M. Dunlap, <em>or his wife or his issue would participate </em>in my estate . . .”. That language, that prohibition, that exclusion clause, we repeat, is broad and sweeping. Was it restricted to a gift which testator made in his will for his “son John ... or his wife or his issue”? There was no such specific or named gift in testator’s will; and there was no specific gift in testator’s will to or for the wife of his son John. Consequently, that language could not refer to any particular gift which was created by testator in his will for “John ... or his wife or his issue”. The only way John’s wife could participate in testator’s estate, as all parties agree, would be by inheritance as John’s heir or the heir of John’s son.</p>
