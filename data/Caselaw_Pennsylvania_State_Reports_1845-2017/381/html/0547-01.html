Her claim is summarized by President Judge Boyle in his opinion dismissing exceptions to the adjudication, viz.: “The claim ... is for services rendered as a nurse and housekeeper for the decedent from August 18, 1949, to April 3,1951. During this period the decedent suffered from a severe arthritic condition, arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure and tremors. He was an invalid. He was in pain continuously, unable to dress himself or walk without assistance. He drooled at the mouth and required constant attention. He had to be helped to and from the bathroom. He required enemas and massages. He weighed 185 pounds and had to be lifted and helped from his bed on account of his arthritic condition. The decedent lived alone. The claimant, Catherine Marshall, began to take care of him on August 18,1949. . . . In addition to the nursing services which Mrs. Marshall performed she also prepared and served the decedent’s meals, did all the washing for the household and kept the sickroom and the house neat and clean. . . .” It is unquestioned that the narrated services were performed by claimant and no attempt was made by appellants to prove <em>actual </em>payment. The single inquiry is, as above stated, whether or not claimant successfully overcame the strong <em>presumption of periodic </em>payments: <em>Braden Estate, </em><a href="/pa/363/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="363 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1221631" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0042-01">363 Pa. 42</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20A.2d%20734" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="68 A.2d 734">68 A. 2d 734</a>; <em>Sanders Estate, </em><a href="/pa/370/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="370 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="1234521" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0208-01">370 Pa. 208</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20923" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="87 A.2d 923">87 A. 2d 923</a>, and the cases therein cited.</p>

A. Well, at the very beginning — shortly after the will of Mary Bnrr was probated, Mr. Burr had decided to give Mrs. Marshall the house on Waite Street. . . . Q. Then you say about that time or shortly thereafter Mr. Burr wrote a will in which he left the Waite Street house to Mr. and Mrs. Marshall? A. That’s right. That was shortly after. It was while Mrs. Doherty was still there. She was here for the funeral. Q. She was here for the funeral? A. She was still in Pittsburgh at the time. She was there when this will was discussed. . . . Q. Well, I understand from your remarks now, that Mrs. Doherty, the niece, participated in the discussion with reference to the plans for that will, did she? A. She did. Q. Did Mr. Burr state what his reasons were for leaving the Waite Street property to.the Marshalls? A. I believe Mr. Burr stated, prior to Mary’s death, Mrs. Marshall came over and helped Mary and Frank, and in consideration of her services, or her coming over, he was leaving her that house.”</p>

The purpose intended to be served by Mr. Ruffennach’s testimony in the case at bar is to rebut the presumption of payment, thus aiding the claimant to discharge the burden of proof which the law imposes upon her. The decedent had told Mr. Buffennach that he was paying the claimant for her services by the. provision made for her in his will. This testimony was corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Baczkowski, the attending physician. ...” Nine other witnesses testified to hearing declarations of decedent to the effect that claimant would be provided for. Considering all the testimony, we are not prepared to accept the conclusion of the dissenting Judge that the rebutting testimony constituted merely “Loose, vague, indefinite statements made by a sick, lonely old man who appreciated the kindness of his employe, and stated to these witnesses he intended, at some future time, to make a gift to her”. On the contrary, we agree with the majority of the court below that this testimony, with all its necessary inferences, sufficiently established that claimant had not been paid periodically, but decedent intended to compensate her by a suitable testamentary provision.</p>
