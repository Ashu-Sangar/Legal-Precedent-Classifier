We stated that “The solution of the question whether a State tax falls within this latter category depends entirely on the particular facts in each instance,” and (p. 328, A. p. 799) it “is not determined by the broad concept of what constitutes interstate commerce when problems of State <em>regulation </em>are concerned; it depends rather on whether there are sufficient local incidents to validate the tax, even though the total activities from which the transaction arises may have incidental interstate attributes.” And we held in that case that sales of copper scrap made by a Pittsburgh seller to Pittsburgh buyers were properly included as gross receipts under the same mercantile license taxes as those here involved, even though the material itself never came into Pennsylvania but was delivered directly from out-of-State suppliers to parties outside the State not affiliated with either the seller or the buyers.</p>

In these the coal is sold by the appellee company, a Pittsburgh <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>dealer, to Pittsburgh buyers; the transaction of sale is consummated in Pennsylvania and clearly forms part of the total business activities of the company on which the mercantile license tax is imposed. It is true that the buyer in such transaction specifies a hind of coal which is obtainable only from an out-of-State mine and gives shipping instructions for delivery to the buyer’s out-of-State customer, but in the <em>Keystone Metal Company </em>case it was held that the fact that the sale was made in Pennsylvania by a Pennsylvania dealer to a Pennsylvania buyer was an “intrastate event” or “local activity” sufficient to justify the right of the City and the School District of Pittsburgh to include such a transaction within the measure of the mercantile license taxes. It is true also, of course, that there is necessarily involved a physical transportation of goods from one State to another, thereby constituting interstate commerce, but the mere fact that such transportation is induced or occasioned by a local-business transaction does not render the transaction exempt from local taxation: <em>Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, </em><a href="/us/303/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="303 U.S. 250" data-case-ids="6139505" data-case-paths="/us/303/0250-01">303 U. S. 250</a>, 253.</p>

But this difference would scarcely seem to be of significance from a legal standpoint because in both cases a physical transportation of the coal dr' the copper takes place across State lines and therefore interstate commerce is as much involved in the one instance as in the other. Another attempted distinction is that in the <em>Keystone Metal </em>

      <em>Company </em>case the copper was sent to a consignee in New Jersey for processing whereas in the present case the coal is delivered to an out-of-State buyer for consumption, but this fact likewise furnishes no basis for a legal differentiation because it is obvious that the mere purpose or object of the consignee in receiving the shipment has no bearing whatever on the interstate nature of the transaction. We conclude, therefore, that the transactions in Class A are includable in the volume of appellee’s gross receipts in computing these mercantile license taxes.</p>
    <p id="b601-3" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[163,948,1154,811]]]'>The same result necessarily follows in regard to the <em>transactions </em>in Classes B and D. In Class B as in Class A the sales of coal are made by a Pennsylvania dealer to Pennsylvania buyers, the only difference being that the buyer in this instance specifies a Pennsylvania instead of an out-of-State mine, a fact which, if anything, makes the transaction even more of a “local event.” In Class D the sales likewise are made by a Pennsylvania dealer to Pennsylvania buyers; although the coal is procured from out-of-State mines specified by the buyer it is delivered to the buyer or his customers in Pennsylvania. There is here, therefore, a sale in Pennsylvania and a delivery in Pennsylvania, and consequently an obviously taxable transaction.</p>

All appellee’s salesmen, with the exception of three not here involved, are located in the company’s Pittsburgh office, and, while they doubtless contact buyers outside the State in order to negotiate sales, there is nothing in the record to indicate but that all orders thus obtained were subject to acceptance, and Avere accepted, and the sales thereby consummated, at appellee’s home office. The coal in these <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>transactions is delivered to the buyer in Pennsylvania, and such a delivery has been held in certain cases to constitute in itself an adequate taxable event: <em>Department of Treasury of Indiana v.

The sales are negotiated in West Virginia but the orders are accepted, and therefore the sales contracts made, in Pennsylvania. There is a question concerning these transactions as to the place during the course of the interstate transportation where delivery is made by the appellee to the buyer. It appears that the coal is loaded on the barges in West Virginia which are towed by a boat controlled by appellee to a place on the river called Isabella which is in Pennsylvania and which is designated by the buyer as the point of destination. There the buyer takes over, loads other coal of its own <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>on the barges, and tows them by its own boat to its plant in West Virginia. It would seem, therefore, that dominion over the shipment is transferred from the appellee to the buyer at Isabella and, that being so, the transaction is one where, in addition to the fact that the final contracts of sale are made in Pennsylvania, delivery is also made within that State. Under such circumstances it is clear that these transactions also are subject to the mercantile license taxes. It is argued by appellee that the only reason for the buyer’s accepting delivery at Isabella is that, before that point is reached, the barges cannot be completely loaded because of the shallower draft of the river. But the reason for making the delivery at that point is immaterial; it is the fact of the delivery there that is controlling. Nor does it matter in this connection that appellee knows that interstate transportation of the coal is contemplated and will occur after the barges leave Isabella: Cha<em>ssaniol v.
