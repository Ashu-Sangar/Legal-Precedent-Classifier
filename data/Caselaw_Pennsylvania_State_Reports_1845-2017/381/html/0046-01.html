The plans bore the signature of the Secretary and Treasurer of the Commission under the official seal of the Commission and had the approval of the Governor and the Department of Highways as required by the Act. The resolution described the lands to be taken for the western extension of the turnpike by the metes and courses of a line, the appropriation being fixed by thé resolution at 100 feet on each side of the line defined, as shown on the plans, for a total width of 200 feet, additional lands necessary for slopes of cuts and embankments and such further lands as were deemed necessary for specified appurtenances. The resolution declared that the lands so described “shall be and hereby are acquired by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission under the provisions of the said Act of Assembly, and to the extent necessary therefor the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission hereby exercises the power of condemnation vested in it by the provisions of the said Act of Assembly.” The route of the proposed turnpike extension as described in the resolution of condemnation ran across the property of Lakewood Memorial Gardens, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation and the present appellant (hereinafter referred to as Lakewood).</p>

The viewers concluded that the time of the taking was the date of passage of the condemnation resolution and expressly so stated at the outset of the hearing as well as in their final report wherein they also awarded the petitioner damages for the property taken. Lakewood filed exceptions to the report, alleging error in the viewers’ conclusion with respect to the date of the taking. The learned court below dismissed the exceptions.

The procedure prescribed for the exercise of the Commission’s power to condemn is the same as that prescribed by the Act of May 21, 1937, P.L. 774, 36 PS §652a et seq., which created the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and clothed it with the power of eminent domain to be exercised in locating and constructing the original section of the turnpike from a point near Middlesex, Cumberland County, to a point near Irwin, Westmoreland County. The resolution of condemnation for the original turnpike location was adopted by the Commission <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>on October 10,1938, and we know of no instance where it was contended that the date of the resolution of condemnation was. not also the date of the taking. On the contrary, on three separate occasions we expressly referred to the date of the Commission’s 1938 resolution of condemnation as being the time of the taking or appropriation: see <em>Hunter v. McKlveen, </em><a href="/pa/353/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="353 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="465999" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0357-01">353 Pa. 357</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20A.2d%20222" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="45 A.2d 222">45 A. 2d 222</a>; <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/351/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="351 Pa. 139" data-case-ids="462771" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0139-01">351 Pa. 139</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="40 A.2d 404">40 A. 2d 404</a>; and <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission Land Condemnation Case, </em><a href="/pa/347/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="347 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="1217380" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0643-01">347 Pa. 643</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20910" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="32 A.2d 910">32 A. 2d 910</a>. It is true, as the appellant points out, that in those cases the time of the appropriation was assumed on the basis of undenied averments.

In <em>Philadelphia Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/364/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="364 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="1223462" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0071-01">364 Pa. 71</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.2d%20847" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="70 A.2d 847">70 A. 2d 847</a>, the question was as to the effective date of the taking under an ordinance of the City condemning certain land for park purposes. The City later attempted to abandon certain of the described lands. We held that the taking had occurred when the ordinance was enacted and the City could not thereafter abandon the condemnation. In the course of our opinion we said (p. 73), — “The ordinance was no mere authorization to institute proceed<a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>ings to condemn. It was the condemnation. Cf. <em>Danforth v.

The ordinance was intended to, and by its own force did, effect the condemnation; the direction respecting the assessment of the damages was but incidental to the principal undertaking of the ordinance: <em>Smedley v. Erwin, </em><a href="/pa/51/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="51 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="999820" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0445-01">51 Pa. 445</a>, 451.” In <em>Shields v.

The <em>Shields </em>case cited <em>Witman v. Reading, </em><a href="/pa/191/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="191 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="907003" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0134-01">191 Pa. 134</a>, 143, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.%20140" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="43 A. 140">43 A. 140</a>, and approvingly quoted therefrom as follows: “By actual opening of and construction of the street, the date of taking relates back to the date of the ordinance adopting the route; this ordinance warned plaintiffs to stop their improvement; the construction of the street was the consummation of the purpose manifested by the constructive appropriation.” Again, in <em>Jury v. Wiest, </em><a href="/pa/326/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="326 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1174480" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0554-01">326 Pa. 554</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.%205" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="193 A. 5">193 A. 5</a>, the date of a school board’s resolution condemning certain property was the date of the appropriation.

The State Highway Law of 1945, P.L. 1242, currently provides in Section 208 (36 PS §670-208) that “Such taking shall be deemed to occur only when right of way plans or construction drawings, prepared by the department, showing thereon the right of way required for highway pur<a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>poses and for slopes, shall have been approved by the secretary and the Governor and filed as a public record in the office of the department.” See <em>Department of Property and Supplies v.

It is not without significance that, whereas the original Turnpike Act of 1937, supra, required that the plans for the location of the turnpike be approved by the Department of Highways, the Western Extension Act of 1941, supra, requires additionally that the plans be approved by the Governor. Just as a taking occurs when the plans for a State highway are approved by the Governor and Secretary of Highways and filed of record in the department, so does a taking occur when the Turnpike Commission, by formal and explicit resolution, condemns the lands necessary for the turnpike extension according to plans approved by the Governor and the Department of Highways and filed of record in the office of the Commission.</p>

It is plain enough that they knew of it in March, 1950, when they bestirred themselves to obtain from the former owner an assignment of the damages due to the appropriation. If, as the appellant contends, the taking did not occur until the Commission delivered its bond to secure payment of the damages occasioned by the taking, just what moved Lakewood to seek from the former owner an assignment of the damages? The right to damages due to a condemnation accrues alone to the owner of the property at the time of the taking. Moreover, the resolution on file as a public record in the office of the Commission was sufficient notice of the condemnation. For years, the plans for a State highway, when approved by the Governor and Secretary of Highways, needed only to be filed with the Highway Department to be a matter of public <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>record. The Sproul Act of 1911, P.L. 468, did not require that the plan for a State highway approved by the Governor and the Secretary of Highways be filed anywhere except in the Department of Highways: see <em>Commonwealth v. Pardee Bros., </em><a href="/pa/310/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="310 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="1144279" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0353-01">310 Pa. 353</a>, 358, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%20396" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="165 A. 396">165 A. 396</a>. The records of the Turnpike Commission are just as public as are the records of the Department of Highways when filed in the Commission’s office which the Act of 1941 requires the Commission to maintain. Section 4 of the Turnpike Act of 1937, supra, constituted the Commission “an instrumentality of the Commonwealth” and declared that “the exercise by the commission of the powers conferred by this act in the construction, operation and maintenance of the turnpike shall be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the Commonwealth.” Likewise, Section 5 of the Western Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension Act of 1941, supra, declares that “The exercise by the commission of the powers conferred by this act in the construction, operation and maintenance of the turnpike shall be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the Commonwealth.” And, in addition to the extensive express powers conferred by Section 6, all the powers and duties prescribed by the original Turnpike Act of 1937, supra, were redelegated to the Commission by Subsection (j) of Section 6.</p>

In constitutional contemplation, it is the entry which constitutes the “taking, injury or destruction” before which compensation for the affected property must be paid or secured. The act of condemnation, however, may, and frequently does, take place some <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>time before actual entry upon the appropriated property. In such instance, after there is a physical entry, the date of the taking relates back to the date of the ordinance or resolution of condemnation. Our decisions have so recognized: see, e.g., <em>Shields v. Pittsburg, </em>supra. The confusion, which the appellant’s argument injects, arises solely from terminology. The constitutional provision cited uses the word “taking” in conjunction with “injury or destruction” and, yet, the ordinance or resolution of condemnation is referred to as the time of the taking. The word is thus used in different senses. More precisely speaking, the act of condemnation is a “constructive appropriation” (see <em>Witman v. Reading, supra); </em>it is that event to which “the taking” relates back after there has been an actual physical entry. It is as of that date that the damages to the owner, both for the property taken, injured or destroyed and for detention of payment of the damages, are to be reckoned. The Western Turnpike Extension Act of 1941 plainly recognizes that the condemnation may precede physical entry by the condemnor. The Act provides that “Prior to physical entry upon the land the commission shall be under no obligation to accept and pay for any property <em>condemned </em>or any costs incidental to any condemnation proceeding” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

From that circumstance, the court queried as to how the taking could be dated, under the appellant’s theory, from the filing of a bond when no bond is required. The appellant, apparently <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>missing the point of the argument, answered that the reason why relieving cities from filing bonds in condemnation proceedings does not violate Article XYI, Section 8, of the Constitution is because the Act, so relieving them, pledges the cities’ taxing power as security for payment of just compensation. But, that does not explain how a taking can be dated from the filing of a bond when no bond is given. Moreover, boroughs are relieved from filing surety bonds in condemnation cases and their taxing power is not pledged as substitute security. All a borough need do is give its own corporate bond without surety or sureties: see Section 1405 of The General Borough Act of 1927, P.L. 519, as amended by Section 43 of The Borough Code of 1947, P.L. 1621, 53 PS §13425. We do not find that anyone has ever questioned that a borough’s direct obligation for the damages due for an appropriation of private property does not constitutionally secure the compensation. And, that is the same kind of a bond which the Commission may give under the Act of 1941 and did give in this case.</p>

In the latter instance, from the moment of the adoption of the ordinance or resolution of condemnation, a cloud is placed on the property so appropriated. Actual physical entry may be, and frequently is, delayed. But, the owner, although still in possession, does not have the free and untrammeled use of the property. Justice therefore dictates that the taking by a public body relate back to the date of the ordinance or resolution of condemnation once physical entry is made. On that basis, the owner is entitled to damages from the date of the condemnation for detention of payment which <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>is the equivalent of the use of the appropriated property for which he is also indemnified at its market value as of the date of the condemnation. In the case of a private corporation, the resolution of its board of directors empowering its officers to take steps to condemn certain property is not a public record, warns no one and does not operate to condemn. In the very nature of the case, a condemnation by a private corporation does not take place until the corporation files its bond in court to secure payment of the compensation for the property designated for appropriation.</p>

The appellant sought in that way to enhance exorbitantly the market value of its property according to the opinions of its real estate experts. This is fully disclosed by the appellant’s offers of proof before the viewers which were rightly there rejected. Just as in <em>Witman v. Reading, </em>supra, where the laying-out ordinance “warned plaintiffs to stop their improvement” so, here, the locating resolution of the Turnpike Commission did likewise. Indeed, the appellant had no justification for undertaking improvements except at its own risk. Section 208 of the State Highway Law of 1945, P.L. 1242, 36 PS §670-208, declares that “No person shall be entitled to recover any damages for any buildings or improvements of any kind which shall or may be placed or constructed upon or within the ultimate widths and lines of any State highway after the same shall have been established for future construction and recorded as aforesaid.” While the foregoing <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>provision applies to State highways, there is sound reason why it should also he held applicable, as a salutary and just principle of law, to the Turnpike Commission’s formal location of the western extension by the condemnation resolution.</p>

(Nichols on Eminent Domain, (3d ed.), Vol. 1, Sec. 3.213 [3], p. 235.) In <em>A. H. Reid Creamery &amp; Dairy S. Go. v.

How can this Court say that such an un<a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>authorized procedure becomes a taking? Section 10 of the Act of 1941 provides: “Whenever the commission decides to acquire any lands, rights, rights-of-way, easements and franchises, or interests therein, by condemnation, as hereinbefore provided, and <em>has tendered a bond or other security to secure the owner or owners for damages, </em>and the same has been accepted, . . . <em>the commission shall have the right to immediate possession </em>of the property which is the subject matter of the condemnation proceedings and <em>may enter thereon in the name of the commission” </em>It is obvious from this provision of the Statute that any attempted condemnation by the Commission does not become binding upon it until it has filed a bond. And it is as clear as polished glass that it has no jurisdiction to enter upon the land until a bond is filed. What are the rights of the property owner in between the time of the adoption of the resolution and the time <em>of </em>the filing of the bond? According to the reasoning of the Majority, the property-owner both owns and does not own his land during that twilight period. If the Commission does not file a bond, the property-owner never loses title to the land. If the Commission files a bond, the ownership of the Commission covers the whole period in which the owner was unable to ascertain what his rights were. During this interregnum the owner may not use the property, improving it as circumstances may dictate, because whatever he spends in improvements will be lost in evaluation (if the Commission decides to take the property); and if the owner does nothing, there is the possibility the Commission will not take the property after all, and the property-owner has thus lost the opportunity to improve his property while he was waiting in St. Patrick’s Purgatory to learn what the Commission’s pleasure might be.</p>

Did the “taking” there occur when the railroad laid out the location of a certain road or when it filed its bond to guarantee to the property-owner payment for the land taken? This Court said: “The plaintiffs were under no legal obligation to refrain from using their property by reason of any expectation that the defendant might afterwards take it. . . The defendant [railroad company] acquired no right to the possession until the security was approved by the court of Common Pleas. . .

The Majority meets this obvious injustice by stating that “the owner is entitled to damages from the date of the condemnation for detention of payment which is the equivalent of the use of the appropriated property for which he is also indemnified at its market value as of the date of the condemnation.” But it is still fact that the owner may not enjoy to the fullest extent the use of his property during the period it is darkened by the legal eclipse which may or may not pass into renewed luminance. Pull use of one’s property includes exploitation of the land in such a manner as to extract therefrom the highest measure of profit. But if one is prohibited from developing his land in a way which will increase its value, it cannot be said that he is fully compensated just because the law allows him detention money on a value far below what it would have attained but for the intervention of the taking. It is for that reason that the taking should be such an act which rings a bell of warning to the property-owner that he must cease all improvement. The private adoption of a resolution is not such a tocsin. How is a property-owner to know that his land has been selected for public use? The passage of a resolution is not such an act of dramatic import as to inspire headlines in the newspapers and special mention on radio and television programs. The Majority says that “the resolution on file as a public record in the office of the Commission was sufficient notice of the condemnation.” Is every landowner required to make periodical visits to Harrisburg to search through the books of the Turnpike Commission to ascertain whether his property has been touched by the paralyzing hand of condemnation? And even if one did by chance learn of the passage of a <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>resolution which might affect his property, he still would not know by studying the resolution if and to what extent his rights were to be invaded. In approving certain drawings of the proposed turnpike the Resolution of June 19, 1949, said: “This Resolution approves in addition the said drawings 1 to 26A, inclusive, as well as the drawings made therefrom <em>and to be made therefrom; </em>including the right-of-way drawings, of the Commission, prepared according to surveys made in conformity therewith, and such surveys and drawings made therefrom, <em>and other drawings and the plans and specifications for the construction of the Western Extension of the </em>Turnpike.” How were the owners of Lakewood to know what drawings were <em>yet </em>to be made?
