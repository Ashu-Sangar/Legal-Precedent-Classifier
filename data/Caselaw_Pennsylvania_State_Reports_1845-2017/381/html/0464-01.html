McFadden, one of testator’s sons who predeceased George H., claim to be entitled to a share of the income and principal upon the theory that the testator’s dominant intent, as expressed throughout his will, was that testator’s sons and issue of sons should receive twice as much as each of testator’s daughters and other female issue. For example, in the Second paragraph of Article Three the testator provided with respect to income that whenever a descendant of his should die, <em>leaving </em>male and female <em>children </em>“the income shall be divided in such a way that the males shall receive twice as much income as the females”. Similarly, in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of section (3) of Article Fourth of his will, testator provided as follows: “And In Trust, upon the expiration of the period of twenty-one years after the death of the last survivor of the children and issue of deceased children of mine living at my death, to pay over to my descendants, per stirpes, a proportion and division of the principal of my residuary estate equal to the proportion and division of income hereinbefore provided and directed for my children or issue of deceased children, namely, the proportion of two (2) shares for each <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>male and one (1) share for each female.

Appellants of course further contend that if there be any conflict, testator’s dominant general intent must prevail over any particular intent. The appellees contend, on the other hand, that there is no conflict, but if there were one, the particular prevails over the general, and also the last expression of the testator’s intention must prevail. All rules or canons of construction are but a means to an end — namely, to ascertain and determine testator’s intent, and where a testator’s intent is manifest from the clear and unambiguous language of his will, that intent must prevail.</p>

For example, in the second paragraph he provides for a distribution of income “whenever a descendant of mine <em>shall die leaving male and female </em>children” the income of such deceased child or the issue of a deceased child shall take, etc. Similarly, upon the expiration of the trust, the trustees are directed to pay the principal in shares equal to the proportion of income hereinbefore directed <em>for his children or issue </em>of deceased children in the proportions of two parts “to my sons and their issue and descendants”.</p>
