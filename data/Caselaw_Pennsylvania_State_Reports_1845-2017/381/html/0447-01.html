Although the jury chosen to render him justice listened for three days to evidence, it was stripped of all powers of decision by the Trial Judge who effectually dictated the verdict by telling the jury that “a verdict of not guilty would be a miscarriage of justice.” This kind of language placed before the jury a dead end in their path of deliberation, it erected a barrier with which conscience, logic and intelligence could not cope. This language almost suggested to the jury that they themselves might have to answer for some species of misconduct if they acquitted, the defendant.

Judge did not intend to modify his “convicting” words is demonstrated by the fact that he immediately went on to crescendo the degree of fate which the jury could impose on the defendant. He instructed them that they, could find him guilty of sec<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>ond degree murder, they could render a verdict of first degree murder with life imprisonment, or they could return a verdict of murder in the first degree and affix the penalty at death.</p>

The full wording is as follows: “Therefore, members of the jury, depending upon the manner in which you resolve the issue of fact in this case, and apply the law, as I have previously defined it to you, to those facts, you can return one of four possible verdicts, first, a verdict of not guilty, although I previously indicated to you that it is my conviction that under the evidence in this case a verdict of not guilty would be a miscarriage of justice. However, my opinion is not binding upon you.”</p>

Of course, it is obvious that the word <em>conviction </em>rises to a higher degree of certainty than opinion. Webster’s International Dictionary defines conviction as: “State of being convinced.” “A strong persuasion or belief; as, to live up to one’s <em>convictions; </em>an intensity of thorough <em>conviction ”</em>

It would be unwarrantable to hold that the jurors in this case, who were undoubtedly laymen — not philologists or lexicoggraphers — would understand the word ‘conviction’ to be something different than ‘opinion.’ ” This argument suggests either that no member of the jury was educated enough to understand the difference between <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>“conviction” and “opinion” or that the Trial Judge was relying upon an assumed ignorance of his audience by employing language which was to be understood as meaning something other than what it actually said.

After the argumentative and partisan arguments of the district attorney and defense counsel, it is supposed that the Judge presiding over a trial will tranquilize with deliberative manner and speech the turbulent waves of thought and feeling aroused and agitated by the battling attorneys. Here, however, the Judge did not pour the oil of serenity on the billows of debate. A listening person, not noting the change in voice, or observing the identities of the speakers, might have had difficulty in determining where the district attorney ended and the Trial Judge began. At one point in his charge, after reviewing the evidence, the Judge said: “If after weighing and considering all the evidence in the case you have a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant of the crime of murder for which he stands indicted, then you must return a verdict of not guilty.” He then followed with: “Now, on what basis and what evidence could you return such a verdict?” In other words, on what possible basis could the jury even <em>think </em>of returning a verdict of not guilty?</p>

He undoubtedly was sincerely convinced that the defendant was guilty, but so long as Ave have trial by jury it is the jury which decides guilt or innocence, not the judge.

There Avas elaborate comment in graphic terms on the evidence and inferences therefrom tending to indicate, on defendant’s part, conduct inconsistent Avith innocence. The CommonAvealth’s closing argument Avas largely repeated in tenor and form appropriate only to that stage of the trial. But comment on defendant’s evidence by comparison was strikingly inadequate. The charge also reveals by innuendo, if not forthright, the court’s opinion that she Avas guilty, and Avas expressed in rhetoric which must have been a factor in moving the jury to the same opinion. <em>This is not the proper function of a </em>charge: Commonwealth v.

Considering the fact that the Judge already knew that he was ruling a manslaughter verdict out of the proceedings, his exposition on the subject was as irrelevant as a description of a trip through Egypt. However, the serious fault of the instruction on manslaughter, from the Judge’s point of view, lies not in its superfluity, but in the cumulative effect of his hammering-on the theme that there was no defense really left to the defendant. He forbade the jury to return a verdict of manslaughter; he instructed them not to be influenced by the district attorney’s statement that the prosecution did not seek or urge a death penalty; after telling the jury that character evidence with all the <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>other evidence in the case could raise a reasonable doubt capable of working a conviction, if he warned: “However, as you well know, members of the jury, persons of good reputation sometimes commit crimes,” and then proceeded to point out that the defendant had once committed an assault and battery; he replied to defense counsel’s argument as if he were an opponent in debate; and then finally he adjured the jury that to return a verdict of not guilty would be a miscarriage of justice.</p>
