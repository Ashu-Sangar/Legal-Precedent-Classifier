The small village of Forbes Road is located in Westmoreland County a number of miles distant from Greensburg. Practically all the male residents of. the village are employed by <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>the Jamison Coal &amp; Coke Company, a mining corporation operating in or adjacent to the village. For many years the Protestant residents conducted in the village an undenominational or nonsectarian church and Sunday school known as Forbes Road Church and Sunday School. Services were held either in a scout hall or in a school building. The Ministerial Association of Greensburg supplied ministers of various Protestant religious affiliations. Religious leaders were also supplied by the Salvation Army. Ministers or religious leaders were assigned regardless of their respective religious persuasions. The Salvation Army serves without any financial remuneration, has no separate creed, is not denominational, has no roll of members, but conducts religious services and acts as spiritual advisers to all who may attend its services. The various services were attended by the inhabitants of Forbes Road, irrespective of their religious faiths. The average attendance was between forty and fifty.</p>

The Jamison Coal &amp; Coke Company was anxious that a suitable undenominational church and Sunday school be maintained in the community. In the absence of suitable facilities, children were obliged, in order to attend Sunday school, to travel a number of miles to Greensburg. Many did not possess necessary transportation facilities. To alleviate this situation the Coal Company purchased a lot in the village and commenced the erection of a church edifice.

The <em>habendum </em>clause of the deed reads: “This conveyance is made to the grantee herein named so that <em>it </em>may maintain and conduct, on the premises hereby conveyed, a Forbes Road Church and Sunday School and, in the event the operation of said Church and Sunday School <em>by the grantee </em>herein named, is discontinued for a continuous period of six (6) months or longer, the lot of ground herein and hereby conveyed shall revert to and again become the property of Jamison Coal &amp; Coke Company, its successors or assigns.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

Tbe findings of fact by tbe Chancellor are not supported by tbe record. They consist chiefly of bis inferences, deductions and conclusions.</p>
    <p id="b311-5" data-blocks='[["BL_311.6",311,[171,1118,1149,1035]]]'>We agree with Judge Laird who states in bis dissent that the preliminary objections should have been sustained. Tbe Jamison Coal &amp; Coke Company clearly was a necessary and indispensable party to this proceeding. Such corporation was tbe <em>grantor </em>in a deed, under the terms of which there was a <em>reverter. </em>In the event that the <em>grantee </em>failed to operate tbe church and tbe services discontinued for a continuous period of sis months or longer, title was to revert to tbe <em>grantor. </em>If title is now conveyed, as directed by the majority of tbe court, tbe interest of tbe Coal Company, not joined as a party defendant, will be affected. Such original grantor is manifestly a necessary and indispensable <em>party </em>to these proceedings. Not to so join tbe grantor Coal Company is a flagrant procedural error: <em>Hartley v.

Parol evidence may not be admitted to alter and vary the written terms of a deed. The <em>habendum </em>clause of the deed provides that <em>it, </em>viz.: the <em>grantee, </em>the Salvation Army, is to maintain and conduct, on the conveyed premises, “a Forbes Road Church and Sunday School”. It also is part of the deed that if such services by the <em>grantee </em>are discontinued for a period of six months or longer title to the land is to revert to grantor. As pertinently noted in the dissent: “The deed does not say that in the case the <em>Forbes Road Union Church and Sunday School </em>does not operate a church and Sunday school, the lot shall revert, but that in case the <em>Grantee </em>— Salvation Army— shall not operate a church and Sunday school, the lot of ground shall revert.”</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[263,1212,1148,810]]]'>While there is no proof of <em>oral </em>promise by the grantee to convey to the incorporated church, such testimony, even if existent, would have been inadmissible. Oral testimony which sought to alter or vary the terms of the deed was improperly admitted. The leading case of <em>Gianni v. R. Russell &amp; Co., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/281/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="281 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1086994" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0320-01">281 Pa. 320</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.%20791" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="126 A. 791">126 A. 791</a>, established the doctrine that in the absence of fraud or mistake, where the parties have deliberately put their engagements in writing, the law declares the writing to be not only the best, but the only, evidence of their agreement.
