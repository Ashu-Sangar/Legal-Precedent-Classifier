    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[151,589,1152,988]]]'>The School Board also contends (1) that since plaintiff’s work had not been certified by the Superintendent as being satisfactory in accordance with the School Code, she could not attain the status of a “professional employe”; and (2) that she was entitled to the status of “professional employe” at the end of her second year, if ever, and since she made no claim to such status for more than two years she is barred by laches. The plaintiff contends that by failing to rate her work unsatisfactory during the course of her employment, the Superintendent waived his right to so rate her now. Therefore, she prayed (1) that the defendant Superintendent be commanded to rate her work satisfactory; (2) that the School Board be required to tender her a written contract as provided for “professional employes”; (3) that she be assigned regular teaching duties; and (4) that she be reimbursed for loss of salary.</p>

Miss Leyshon was employed by defendant School Board as “A regular professional employe” (teacher) prior to 1949. Neither the complaint nor the record is clear as to why she was absent thereafter, or whether her services were terminated by death or resignation or suspension or removal, or whether she was absent for legal cause authorized and approved by the Board of School Directors. An averment and proof of <em>such facts </em>would be indispensable if the case were to be . decided on its merits. The reason is obvious from the Code which delineates in letail the difference between a substitute <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>teacher and a temporary professional (employe) teacher.</p>

If school teachers could, years after they might have been entitled to a higher rating as a teacher or years after another teacher had been employed in their place, successfully claim the status of a temporary professional employe or of a professional employe, it would create budgetary and debt difficulties for school districts which would certainly be contrary to the public interest.</p>
