Martin, at his home in Lancaster County, three times during the early part of 1952. The evidence is meagre and does not disclose at whose instance these visits were made. During these visits to Martin’s home, Martin, who was 77 years of age, endorsed and delivered to Mason the following securities: 40 shares of Consumers Power Company, 20 shares of Radio Corporation of America, 12 shares of Central Illinois Light Company, 420 shares of Allied Chemical Company, Inc., 600 shares of Utah-Idaho Sugar Company, 100 shares Xropp Forge Company. Defendant was never registered as a dealer or a salesman for any registered deal-' er with the Pennsylvania Securities Commission. Defendant gave Martin in return for his securities <em>leases </em>on 200 acres of land in San Miguel County, New Mexico. The original lease covering the New Mexico lands showed that the <em>anmial rental </em>for 3,760 acres amounted to <em>-10† an acre. </em>The securities turned over by Martin had a market value (calculated at the time of their delivery) of $5,744. and all but two of these were listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The disparity in value is obviously tremendous. The defendant told Mr. <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>Martin that he needed the money for the purpose of investing in the Tri-State Petroleum Co., Inc., an oil venture.</p>

Martin”. He relies chiefly on the following answers given by Martin on cross-examination: “Q. And you made an even trade for that stock? A. Yes. Q. And there was no force or inducement used to get you to do it? You did it willingly and cheerfully? A. I did it, myself. . . . Q. And you are perfectly satisfied with the whole 3 transactions? A. Yes.” To say that Martin was not induced to part with his securities because he was not forced or coerced into delivering his stock to Mason or because he did it willingly puts too restricted a meaning on the word “induce”. Webster’s New International Dictionary (2nd ed.) defines “induce” as: “To lead on; to influence; to prevail on; to move by persuasion or influence . . .; to bring on or about; to effect; cause.”</p>

The law was designed and is sufficiently broad to protect inexperienced or gullible persons from the machinations and inducements of unregistered salesmen who attempt to persuade such persons-to sell or dispose of valuable securities for a small amount of cash or for securities which are worthless or of relatively little value.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a>

Remove inducement from current life, and the ■rivers of commerce would shrink, the reservoirs of investment would stagnate, the wheels of industry would rust. In every conference, convention and consultation someone is trying to induce someone else to do something, and so long as the inducement speaks with the lips of honesty and appears on the table of forthright dealing, there can be no wrong.
