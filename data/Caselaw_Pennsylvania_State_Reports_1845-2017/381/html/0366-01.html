We there said, at pages 538, 542 and 543: “By section 322 of The General County Law [16 PS §312] . . . the retirement allowance was fixed in terms of dollars and not purchasing power. There is nothing in the provisions governing the county’s retirement system to justify a retirement allowance based on earned compensation adjusted to a ‘cost of living’ index or other standard related to the buying power of money . . . The constitutional inhibition against legislative augmentation of municipal pensions or retirement allowances after an employe has been retired is the same as it is with respect to the original granting of a pension or retirement allowance . . . The plight of retired municipal employees because of the inadequacy of their retirement allowances in relation to the increased cost of living, particularly in the past few years, is regrettable to say <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>the least. But, <em>sympathy for their distress affords no justification for ignoring established constitutional restraints. </em>If legislative inroads upon retirement funds by way of gratuitous disbursements therefrom were to be tolerated, it would not be long before retirement systems in general would be imperiled, if not destroyed, to the detriment not only of the retired employees intended to be benefited by the unconstitutionally increased retirement allowances but also of the current contributors to retirement funds who are still in the service of the municipality . . . <em>The wry arbitrariness of the amendatory Act here under consideration precludes any thought that it was enacted in an exercise of the legislature’s power to ‘render intact the actuarial soundness of the system so as to strengthen its fibers’ . . . </em>Retirement Board v.

The same problems still exist as were pointed to in <em>Koehnlein v. Allegheny County Employees’ Retirement System, </em>supra.

This upon the following quotation from the opinion in that case, at page 311: “The plaintiff is also entitled to such amounts as may be due him by the amending Acts of 1951, P. L. 1091 and 1952, P.

This being so, the statement depended upon cannot be used as authority in the instant case — where the matter is specifically raised. The <em>Hickey </em>case turned solely on the question whether or not the plaintiff’s pension rights had become vested and whether, if vested, they could be altered or destroyed thereafter by legislative enactment. We did not intend in any way, in the <em>Hickey </em>case, to deviate from the policy and rules laid down in the <em>Koehnlein </em>case. Further in the <em>Hickey </em>case, we declared at pages 309, 310: <em>“The Legislature may strengthen the actuarial fibers but it cannot break the bonds of contractual obligations. The permissible changes, amendments and alterations provided for by the Legislature can apply only to conditions in the future, and never to the past. </em>According to the cardinal principle of justice and fair dealings between government and man, . . . the parties shall know prior to entering into a business relationship the conditions which shall govern that relationship . . .

The object of retirement with pay is to obtain the very best services of which an employe is capable by banishing from his mind worries as to his economic future. Through contributions made by the employe and appropriation made by the State, the employe is assured that when his most productive services have passed, he will have an income which will take care of his living needs and he will not need to blanch before the prospect of helplessness if sickness stands unbidden at the door or calamity looks in at the window.

It was assumed during all the time that the employes made their contributions that upon retirement they would receive a pension reasonably adequate to meet elemental living needs. However, after the employes had been retired, the American dollar, because of the extraordinary ever-increasing high cost of living, so diminished in value that the pensioners found themselves receiving an amount quite insufficient to discharge those obligations which could have been conveniently met had there been no change in the purchasing power of the amounts drawn to them in the periodical retirement check. It would be as idle as spilt-milk grieving to point out that $10 today cannot purchase what it could purchase five, ten and twenty years ago. The dollar bill of today, in point of purchasing power, has shrunken to the size of a cigar coupon in comparison to what it looked like in 1935. The legislature, like everybody else in the Commonwealth, has realized this state of reality and, in conscientious fulfillment of obligations owing to the retired public employes, it enacted in 1953 three laws (Acts 355, 239 and 252) which assured to retired city employes, firemen and policemen of the City of Pittsburgh, upon payment of $200 each, an annuity whose inherent value would measure up to the purchasing power of the dollar-pension<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> promised the employes when they entered into contractual relationship with the <em>State.</em>

The Constitution is always with us and it is our duty to place every disputed statute over the map of its delegated powers and inhibitions to see whether the statute fits into the geographical contours to which the subject assigns it.

It is not disputed that the purpose of the retirement system is to assure the retired employe a reasonable living during his retirement period. Nor can it be disputed that the shortened dollar of today cannot reach the standard of living which the law intended for the pensioner. With this established discrepancy, therefore, between the purpose of retirement and what has actually occurred, it is inescapable that an obligation devolves upon the employer to fill the breach of the <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>resulting deficiency and to mend the impaired contract solemnly entered into. If the State had originally promised to settle upon its retired employes certain grants of land and then the land had become useless because of volcanic eruption, earthquake or tidal wave, it could not be urged that the government would not have an obligation to grant other usable land to those employes. If the State had agreed to pay its retired employes with the fruit of trees that later became sterile, it could not be said that the State could plead payment by pointing to the desolate orchard of empty and withered limbs.</p>

But retirement pay which does not sustain one in retirement is a misnomer. When one speaks of bread, one does not envisage merely a crumb or a slice, but enough to keep body and soul together. The retirement payments of today, on the basis of a 1935 money standard, cannot hold the soul within an inadequately fed body. There thus devolves upon the government in this situation an obligation which it cannot morally shunt aside.</p>

On the contrary, it is of paramount importance. In any country worthy of the respect of mankind, legal responsibility is but the executive agent of moral indebtedness. This Court has often decided cases on the basis of natural justice where a literal adherence to unyielding syllables spelled out words not synonymous with honesty in fair dealings between man and man and man and government. In the case of <em>Harbold v. Reading, </em><a href="/pa/355/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="355 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="468950" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0253-01">355 Pa. 253</a>, the ques<a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>tion arose as to whether this Court should give authority to a statute (Act of May 26, 1943, P. L. 660) which imposed on the City of Reading a liability for the payment of bonds which expressly declared that no liability existed. It was argued in that case that the Act of 1943 was unconstitutional because it offended against the same section of the Constitution which is involved here, the specific, pertinent prohibition reading: “No bill shall be passed giving any extra compensation to any . . . contractor after services shall have been rendered or contract made.” This Court, however, speaking through Mr. Justice Stern (now Chief Justice), recognized the moral obligation devolving upon the City of Reading and, in decisive language, declared: <em>“Notwithstanding the constitutional provisions above quoted, </em>it is well established in our own State, as well as generally elsewhere, that a claim <em>supported by such a moral obligation and founded in equity and justice, even though not legally enforceable, </em>may be recognized by the legislature and made collectible either from the State itself or any of its political divisions; the legislature may compel municipalities to adopt and discharge such obligations and to exercise the power of taxation for that purpose.” Applying the reasoning in that case to the question before us here, is it to be said that an obligation to a government’s own employes is of less binding force than a city’s obligations to a contractor? In that same <em>Harbold </em>case, Chief Justice Stern cites thirteen instances where this Court and the Superior Court approved of payments which were prohibited by constitutional or statutory provisions but which were imbedded in the solid rock of honest and moral obligation.</p>

Said Justice Mitchell: “Does the law prohibit the city from recognizing the moral obligation arising from these circumstances? We do not find anything that compels us to so hold. A moral obligation in law is defined as one ‘which cannot be enforced by action but which is binding on the party who incurs it, in conscience and according to natural justice,’ and again, a ‘duty which would be enforceable by law, were it not for some positive rule, which, with a view to general benefit, exempts the party in that particular instance from legal liability . . .’ 15 Am. &amp; Eng.

In the case at hand the State owes at the very least an honest, straightforward appreciation toward the policeman who patrols his beat in the storm, heat and cold for 20 years, facing dangers which lurk behind the curtain of night and within the dark caverns of crime; it owes equal gratitude to the fireman who for 20 years responds to alarms which take him into burning buildings and under falling masonry and broken brick; it is likewise beholden to the City employe who for the same number of years faithfully discharges every requirement of his duties. And if certain governmental instrumentalities, through legislative authority, contract to pay the employe, fireman or policeman, so many silver dollars, they do not honestly discharge their obligations by paying the pensioner an equivalent number of half dollars or quarters.</p>

The Majority Opinion seems to proceed on the theory that constitutional provisions are iron-ribbed compartments built into a reinforced steel tabernacle. The history of the constitutional convention and the decisions of this Court rendered since 1874 would indicate, on the contrary, that the various provisions in the Constitution are not metallic cubicles; rather they represent vast areas of moral principles which permit such cultivation as will produce provender, protection, and preservation for the people, restricted only by very specific prohibitions clearly and unequivocally expressed in 1874. It seems obvious to me that the prohibition in Article III, Section 11 was never intended to prohibit the Legislature from discharging a moral obligation to the servants of the State. The target of the prohibition was political favoritism. It was designed to prohibit the enrichment of individuals by rewarding them from the public treasury. The fact that the limitation is worded in the singular number, rather than in the plural, adds particular emphasis to this interpretation. In 1952 in the case of <em>Francis v. Neville </em>Township, <a href="/pa/372/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="372 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="1238017" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0077-01">372 Pa. 77</a>, this Court declared unconstitutional a township ordinance which sought to pay a pension to <em>one </em>certain retired township employe. Interpreting various provisions of the Constitution, including Article III, Section 11, we said: “Knowing the evils inherent in individual power and authority, the framers of all written democratic constitutions aim at prohibiting grants, monetary and otherwise, to <em>single persons. </em>Unbridled financial chaos would result if municipal bodies <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>were permitted to monetarily reward <em>specific individuals, </em>no matter how praiseworthy their services and how profound their devotion to the welfare of the particular township, hoard or city.”</p>

In the <em>Koehnlein </em>case this Court had under consideration the Act 'of January 14, 1952, P.

The three statutes before us, on the contrary, specifically provide that the pensioner must pay into the retirement fund the additional sum of $200 before he can be eligible for increased retirement benefits.

The defendants and intervenors do not contend that the contractual relation between the pensioners and the pension funds involved came into being with the contribution of $200. The contractual relation began when the pensioner <em>first </em>entered the retirement plan. The contract did not begin after the pensioner had left public service; it was in existence while he was in the service and it continued to be valid and binding while enjoying some of the benefits he had contracted to receive.

But it is not the province of the Court to inquire into the nature of the consideration which the Legislature deems adequate to support a contract which it authorizes, any more than it is the duty of this Court to probe into the make-up of a legislative budget. In the case of <em>Haldeman v.

This Court, however, said that even one payment was sufficient to “entitle a member to retirement pay,” explaining: “This is in effect an acknowledgment by the legislature of <em>prior service, </em>and a recognition by it that long and faithful public employment should be compensated, emphasizing the purpose and scope of the provisions for retirement pay or delayed compensation.”</p>

Furthermore, the <em>Thomson </em>case does not now represent the latest law on the subject in Wisconsin.
