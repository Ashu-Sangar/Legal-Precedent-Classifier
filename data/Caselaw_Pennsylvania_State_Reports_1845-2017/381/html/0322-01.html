The share was claimed in that estate (1) by Neil’s widow, and (2) by testator’s wife. The Court held that the trustee did not acquire an absolute estate in the corpus, and that the widow of the life tenant had a vested interest in the balance of the corpus remaining in the trust at the death of the last beneficiary which, however, could not be determined until the latter’s death. The Court said (pages 153-154) : “The general rule is that if payment to a beneficiary is left to the absolute discretion of the trustee, the ownership of the fund is not in the beneficiary; this is so because the fund was not given to him; he could receive only what the trustee should think fit to give. As Neil’s mother was vested with absolute discretion, Neil, in his lifetime, could not have compelled her to make any payment to him so long as she acted in good faith. Neil’s widow, who can only claim through her husband, is therefore not entitled to share.</p>
