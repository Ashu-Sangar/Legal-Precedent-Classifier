The appellant, Roy W. Kerry, had also leased all the coal under four hundred acres of land owned by the Shidemantles lying immediately north of and adjoining the eight acres owned by Kerry in fee. The Shidemantle property fronted on both sides of the old highway and was also underlaid with two veins of coal. Under the terms of the coal lease Kerry had the right to remove all of the coal upon compliance with certain conditions including the payment to the Shidemantles of a twenty cent per ton royalty for the coal removed. The right of way of the old highway was forty feet in width. This highway was widened to a width of one hundred and twenty feet.</p>

The provision reads: “All parties in interest shall have the same right of appeal from decisions, orders and decrees of the State Mining Commission to the Superior and Supreme Courts, as now or hereafter provided for appeals from the decisions, orders and decrees of courts of common pleas: Provided, That in case of an appeal from an award by the commission <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>of compensation for damages resulting from an appropriation of property under the provisions of this act the appeal shall, in case any party is entitled to demand a jury trial under section eight of Article sixteen of the Constitution of this Commonwealth, be to the courts of the .proper county thereof.” . It is to be noted that appeals to the court of common pleas are <em>only </em>where a party is entitled to a jury trial <em>under Section 8, Article 16, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, </em>which reads: <em>“Municipal and other corporations and individuals invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use </em>shall make just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed by the construction or enlargement of their works, highways or improvements, which compensation shall be paid or secured before such taking, injury or destruction. The General Assembly is hereby prohibited from depriving any person of an appeal from any preliminary assessment of damages against any such corporations or individuals made by viewers or otherwise; and the amount of such damages in all cases of appeal shall on .the demand of either party be determined by a jury according to the course of the common law.” (Emphasis supplied) The constitutional provision clearly states that it only applies <em>to municipal and other corporations and individuals. </em>It does not apply to the <em>Commonwealth </em>where it is the condemning party: <em>State Highway No. 72, </em><a href="/pa/265/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="265 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="1051903" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0369-01">265 Pa. 369</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.%20820" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="108 A. 820">108 A. 820</a>; <em>Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Bridge, </em><a href="/pa/308/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="308 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1140260" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0487-01">308 Pa. 487</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.%20309" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="162 A. 309">162 A. 309</a>.</p>
