Boyle as the straw holder of the title, entered into a Avritten agreement Avith Edith D. Tobin <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>for the sale to her of the properties nos. 6-8-10 E. Lancaster Avenue, for the price of $110,550 of which $5,-000 was to be paid in cash upon the execution of the agreement; the buyer was to take title subject to a mortgage of $65,000 to be created by the sellers before settlement and the balance of the purchase money, $40,-550 was to be paid in cash at the time of settlement. On May 16 sellers placed a mortgage of $60,000 on the properties and settlement with the purchaser was made on August 1. It is admitted that Edith Tobin purchased the premises with knowledge of the existence of the lease and the terms of the option contained therein. Meanwhile, on July 24, counsel for the purchaser wrote to the lessee that his client, Edith Tobin, was to take title to the premises on August 1st, and that, beginning with that date, all rents were to be payable to him. Wallach, on July 28, replied to this letter calling attention to the option which he had in his lease and stating that he was consulting his lawyer as to what action he could take to protect his rights. On October 24 the Wallach Company filed a complaint in equity praying that the deed to Edith Tobin for the premises No. 6 E. Lancaster Avenue, be cancelled and that the premises be conveyed to it at such price as the court should deem fair and equitable. In its adjudication the court apparently agreed with all of plaintiff’s contentions and held that defendants had violated plaintiff’s rights under its option; nevertheless it dismissed the bill, apparently on the theory that notwithstanding the sale to Edith Tobin plaintiff’s option still remained valid and was unaffected by the conveyance to her of the three properties. From this decree plaintiff took the present appeal.</p>

The question arises whether this was an independent offer of Barski himself, or one made on behalf of Edith Tobin, the subsequent purchaser. If the latter, the notice was inaccurate because, as appears from the terms of the written agreement with Edith Tobin, the price was not $105,000 but $110,550, and, instead of being wholly for cash, the sale was to be subject to a mortgage of nearly two-thirds the purchase price. If, on the other hand, the offer was that of Barski and not of Edith Tobin any offer from the latter which ultimately resulted in a sale and conveyance to her was never communicated to the lessee at all, nor, indeed, was there any evidence that she had ever made any offer of $52,500 for the property No. 6. In either event, the meaning of the statement in the letter that the “sale price” on No. 6 East Lancaster Avenue would be $52,500 cash was ambiguous, if not indeed wholly unintelligible. Did it mean that an offer in that amount had been received or that $52,500 was the price which the lessors were asking for the property and for which they were willing to sell it? Did it mean, more specifically, that Barski, or Edith Tobin as the case might be, had made an unconditional offer to purchase the one property No. 6 for $52,500 entirely independent of a unified sale of the three properties for the announced total of $105,000? Or was the amount thus stated a mere arbitrary allocation by the lessors to the property No. 6 of exactly one-half the price of the three properties? To make confusion worse confounded this same agent testified that there was an offer of $52,500 from one Lloyd Sullivan, but it is not pretended that any notice of <em>that </em>alleged offer was given to lessee in reply to the latter’s inquiry of February 1st. And of course, as Wallach properly advised the agents, the lessee was not obliged to meet an <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>offer for the purchase of the <em>three </em>properties; <em>(Atlantic Refining Co. v.

They did not sell No. 6 to BarsM or to Edith Tobin or to Lloyd Sullivan, or to anyone else, for $52,500 or for any other price, but sold the three properties as an entirety for the sum of $110,550. It ought to be too clear for discussion that, where there exists an option right such as here given to the lessee, if the lessor should receive an offer, submit it to the lessee, and the latter decline to act upon it, <em>but then the lessor himself does not accept the offer thus submitted to the lessee, </em>the lessee’s rights would remain wholly unimpaired, and the lessor would be obliged to give the lessee the same opportunity to buy should he decide to sell the property at any time during the remainder of the term of the lease. To hold otherwise would be to construe the option as meaning that the lessee had the right to meet one and only one offer of purchase received by the lessor (in the present instance even before the ten year term began) and, even if that offer were rejected by the lessor, the latter could accept any subsequent offer received by him free and clear of any further obligation to the lessee; this would render the lessee’s option right, which was obviously intended to continue throughout the term, wholly ineffective and practically useless. It was said in <em>R. F. Robinson Co. v. Drew, </em><a href="/nh/83/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="83 N.H. 459" data-case-ids="2351275" data-case-paths="/nh/83/0459-01">83 N.H. 459</a>, 464, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%2067" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="144 A. 67">144 A. 67</a>, 70, that “The lessor’s offer at a price the lessee declined to pay did not discharge him from obligation to offer when he decided to sell at a lower price. The lessee’s <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>‘preference as a purchaser’ continued during the term unless the property was sold at a .price the lessee would not pay. Decision to sell at the reduced price was within the tenor and scope of the option, and the lessee’s right to buy thereat was given as much as the right to buy at the higher price. The option did not mean that its obligation should be discharged upon the rejection of a single offer. A contrary view, if it would not be promotive of bad faith, would largely destroy the evident purpose the option sought to accomplish.” See, to the same effect, <em>Anderson v. Stewart, </em><a href="/neb/149/0660-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="149 Neb. 660" data-case-ids="5179369" data-case-paths="/neb/149/0660-01">149 Neb. 660</a>, 668, <a href="/neb/149/0660-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="149 Neb. 660" data-case-ids="5179369" data-case-paths="/neb/149/0660-01">32 N.W. 2d 140</a>, 144, 145; <em>Atlantic Refining Co. v.
