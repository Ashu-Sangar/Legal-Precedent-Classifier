The Third National Bank of Scranton, Pa., was the corporate trustee in both trusts. The individual co-trustees are Frank A. English, Ralph J. Lisman, Joseph Rocereto and C. H. Murden who are successors to Mario Peruzzi, the originally named co-trustee, after his death. The trustees are named as defendants. A brother, Frank A. Obici, and his children are the plaintiffs.</p>

The settlor, Amedeo Obici, was to receive the income therefrom for life and upon his decease such income was to be distributed as set forth in a schedule attached to the deed. Among the named beneficiaries were the plaintiffs, with their respective interests specified. On or about April 19, 1946, the settlor executed an Amendment to the trust together with other documents whereby 650 shares of the 1785 shares of the corporate stock trust res were transferred from the “Friends and Relatives Trust” to the “Charitable Trust”. The effect of such Amendment was to eliminate from the trust the named plaintiffs as beneficiaries upon the death of settlor. The settlor died May 21, 1947.</p>

Settlor also directed that his will be changed, bequeathing $1,000 to each of the plaintiffs. On April 18, 1946, Mr. McNickle went to Scranton to Mr. Maekie’s office and had him prepare the papers. On April 19, Mr. McNickle took the documents to settlor at the home of Mario Peruzzi, in Wilkes-Barre, where settlor executed them in the presence of Mr. McNickle. No one signed as an attesting witness. According to Mr. McNickle’s testimony, accepted as credible by the Chancellor, the <em>will </em>was dated April 20, 1946. The reason assigned by Mr. McNickle for the difference in dates of the questioned trust Amendment and the will was that April 19, 1948 was Good Friday and also because Mr. McNickle desired to have the changes in the trust agreement antedate the will “so that there would be no legal question as to the incorporation by reference in the will of the terms of the existing trust”.</p>

After his death, there came to light a paper known as an Amendment to the trust (reputedly signed April 19, 1945) wherein all benefits theretofore payable to Frank Obici and his children were wiped out. Frank Obici and his children protested this Amendment, claimed that it was a forged document and filed a Complaint in Equity seeking to restore unimpaired the original provisions of the Trust of January 13, 1945.</p>

The record reveals that Amedeo Obici was a man of sturdy character, straightforward in his dealings, devoted to his brother with strong bonds of affection and family love, and generous to him and his family. This Avarmth of feeling for them was evident throughout the lives of all the plaintiffs and continued unabatedly eAren after the date on which he supposedly struck them from the sphere of his munificent bounty.'

He always greeted her affectionately and with a kiss. He lavished gifts on her (among others a diamond necklace), and at the time of her wedding he paid for the Avedding celebration which took place in his home. When confined to the hospital at the birth of her child, he sent her flowers. (This after the purported Amendment.) When the child was to be christened, Susan postponed the christening date because of the following letter she received from Mr. Obici who was at the time in Cali<a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>forma: “Please wait because it not only will be an honor but ... it will make me very happy if you waited until I return from California. Why? Because I christened you when you were a little baby, I stood up at your wedding, and now I want' the honor to christen your baby.” It could only be a person of the most brutal instincts (which no one ever ascribed to Amedeo) who could stand up by his grandniece at her baptism while planning to exclude her from the sunshine of the tremendous wealth which he could not take with him. There is absolutely nothing in the record which would rationalize Amedeo’s repulsion of Susan and her baby to whom he was devoted in every way that one can show affectionate devotion. Up to the date of his death he continued to speak of his intention to take care of Susan. She testified: “Well, one day he looked very good, and I said, 'Uncle, you look wonderful today. I’m so happy.’ 'Yes,’ he says, 'that’s what you think, bur your uncle is going to die,’ and then he turned to me, 'Don’t you worry, don’t forget what I told you in 1944.’ He said, 'You are well taken care of, you and your family.

In the absence of evidence that Amedeo completely lost his senses, there is a certain evidentiary obligation on the part of the defendants to show how and why Amedeo could do something so diametrically opposed to what is natural and normal.

That the owner of a six million dollar peanut business would be angry because the son of his brother would sell a few peanuts is to me inconceivable.

I would draw the inference, based upon the granitic foundation that Amedeo Obici was a reasoning and honest man, that he would not strike down the son of his own father and mother with whom he had never quarreled as he stood on the brink of eternity where he was to meet that same father and <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>mother. Odd and peculiar as at times seem the ways of the world, irrationalization has not so seized the human race that rivulets of anger control glaciers of thought and flea bites destroy intellect.

Vol. IV, sec. 1302 (clause 3), says: ‘The testimony of the attesting witnesses is of course <em>not conclusive in favor </em>of execution even when all agree and when no personal impeachment is attempted . . .

He said: “In order to find such a fact [the forgery] the Chancellor would have to hold (1) that McNickle is a liar; (2) that McNiclde is a forger, or (3) that Mackie, Attorney, is a forger.” The Chancellor was not required to make any such finding. It was not incumbent upon him to announce who <em>was </em>the forger. It was sufficient for him to find, as we think the plaintiffs conclusively established, — under all the circumstances, plus the expert testimony of Haring, — that Amedeo Obici did not and could not have signed the revocation in question.</p>

This witness testified that although the Amendment was actually signed on April 19th he dated it April 20th so that it would not conflict with a will which was dated April 20th. He admitted under cross examination that what he did in this regard was “untrue and incorrect”: “Q. And you were afraid that if the trust arrangement or if one of the documents didn’t show a different date <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>from the other, that is the will showed a different date than the trust agreement, that there might be some question of the legality of the Plaintiffs’ Exhibit No. 74, the modification of the trust agreement, is that correct? A. That’s right. Q.

But who supported the expert witnesses? The Chancellor says McNickle. Strange as this sounds, here are the Chancellor’s words: “The credibility of McNickle as a witness was bolstered up by the testimony of the expert and other opinion witnesses and in turn the credibility of their testimony was supported by the direct evidence of McNickle.” Thus we have McNickle as the strong man in the act holding up the expert witnesses and they in turn holding up Me-<a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>Nickle!
