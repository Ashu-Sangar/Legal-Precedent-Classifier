The proponents are Mara Cieslak and her husband, John Cieslak. The sister-contestant and also proponent, John Cieslak, died during this litigation and their personal representatives have been substituted. The value of the estate is estimated at $40,000. The jury trial was held in the Orphans’ Court, authorized by the Orphans’ Court Act of August 10, 1951, P. L. 1163, sec. 746, 20 PS 2080.746. The trial was conducted by President Judge Boyle with care and acumen. It required six days to try. The printed record constitutes over 775 pages and exhibits.</p>

She understood little English — “just a word here and there”. Witnesses testified as to her • inability to read, write and understand the English language. Apparently she could sign her name. Decedent lived alone in a rented apartment. It appeared that decedent and her sister, the contestant, remained on friendly terms. Proponents, the Cieslaks, were undertakers. It was testified that at or prior to 1943 Charles C. Cieslak, a brother of proponent, John Cieslak, had been in the undertaking business and had conducted the funeral of decedent’s husband. While the questioned wills described proponents as “life long friends” the record is <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>silent as to the length or exact nature of such friendship.</p>

The first is an unexecuted carbon copy of a will dated “-day of July, 1943”. The original of this will, which is missing and not therefore produced, was prepared by a reputable Pittsburgh attorney, and was stated to have been executed by decedent. Ordinarily such a document would, possess no evidential value. However, contestant alleges that the language in this copy of will, except for a bequest of $100 to a friend and changes of residuary beneficiaries, is similar to that in the three questioned alleged wills. It is to be observed that had the execution of the 1943 will been established, decedent’s funeral would have been directed to be conducted by <em>Charles </em>C. Cieslak (brother of a proponent) at $1,000 expense and in the manner described. The residue would have passed one-half to contestant (decedent’s sister) and the remaining one-lialf to the sister’s three children. A trust company was named as executor.</p>

The residue of the estate is devised and bequeathed to proponents who are named executors. The alleged wills may be indicated as follows: Paper No. 1 (exhibit C) is dated December 2, 1948, and is <em>not witnessed. </em>The validity of this instrument is <em>not in issue. </em>No proof of execution has been made. Proponents have not offered it for probate. Paper No. 2, in dispositive terms, is identical with preceding paper, exhibit C. It is dated December 7, 1948, purported to be signed by decedent and witnessed by Adam Belajac and George J. Kochka. It was probated July 12, 1949. Both witnesses swore that they “. . . were present and did see and hear [decedent] . . . sign, seal, publish and declare the same as and for her last Will and Testament. . . .” Proponent, Mara Cieslak, testified that at the purported execution of the paper, one of the witnesses, George Kochka, did not see the decedent or Adam Belajac, the other witness, sign the instrument; and further, there is no testimony that decedent did or could have seen the witnesses sign so that her direction might be implied.

John Cieslak, the other proponent (husband of Mara Cieslak), petitioned the Orphans’ Court to open the probate of the No. 2 will, above referred to, so that No. 3, the later will, dated May 31, 1949 (identical in dispositive terms with No. 1 and No. 2 wills), and purported to be signed by decedent and witnessed by Kathryn Spangler and Wil<a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>liam Wiemert, could be probated. While these two witnesses testified that they saw decedent sign the will in their presence and in the presence of each other, there is testimony in the record that the witness was unable to describe the person whose will she had witnessed. There was also testimony that, at the date of this paper, decedent was ill at her home and hence could not have been at the proponents’ funeral establishment where, it was testified, the paper had been executed. Furthermore, a duly qualified handwriting expert testified that the purported signature of decedent on this paper is a forgery. It was testified that the decedent’s purported signature had been drawn or traced from or over the signature appearing on No. 1 will (neither probated nor offered for probate).</p>

Mara Cieslak testified that the first will was signed by decedent at proponents’ funeral home, but it was not witnessed and proponent did not know who wrote it. Proponent testified that she told decedent that this will was invalid because it was unwitnessed. There is testimony that proponent, Mara Cieslak, went alone to a public stenographer and had her prepare the No. 2 will (which was probated) and which was executed as recited. Proponent testified that <em>decedent </em>believed wills No. 1 and ■No. 2 had been lost and that decedent came to her with No. 3 will which was executed as narrated..</p>

Proponents’ testimony and that of their witnesses concerning the preparation and execution of the three wills is far from convincing and is clearly a matter for determination by a jury. President Judge Boyle's charge of sixty printed pages, and his clear and comprehensive opinion of twenty-two printed pages, unanimously adopted by the court below, are so complete that we need not further elaborate upon the facts.</p>

The first reason is, in effect, that the <em>No. 3 will </em>of May 31, 1949, should be admitted to probate since the jury found the decedent possessed testamentary capacity. But this finding of the jury did not overcome the testimony that decedent was absent on the date and at the place when the will was alleged to have been executed. Even more important. is the handwriting expert’s testimony that- the signature of decedent to the will is a forgery.</p>

As pointed out in the court’s opinion such confidential relationship was established because when decedent wished to purchase a home she accepted Mara Cieslak’s advice, who twice took decedent to a real estate broker’s office and procured an attorney for her, handled her money at times and acted as her agent in proposed real estate transactions; decedent also frequently left papers in her possession. That a confidential relationship did exist is amply sustained by the testimony.</p>
