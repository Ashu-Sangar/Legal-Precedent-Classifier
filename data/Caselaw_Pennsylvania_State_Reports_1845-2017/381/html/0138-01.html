Blecher, alleged surviving spouse and appellee, were married in a religious ceremonial service on March 31, 1927. Both had been married before. Each had children by their respective spouses. After marriage they <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>cohabitated as man and wife until just previous to 1938, when they separated. Appellee went to live with a daughter who resided a number of miles distant from appellee’s home. The parties were divorced on April 29, 1938. No children were born of this marriage, or of the later alleged common law marriage. The parties did not encounter each other from the date of the divorce in April, 1938, until they met at a picnic in July, 1938. Appellee testified that decedent invited her to inspect his new automobile and to take a ride. She accepted the invitation. During the ride, appellee testified, decedent stated that he was sorry that he had ever started the divorce and said <em>“You are my wife; I am your husband and we are going to live together the same as toe did before”. </em>She testified that she said in reply: <em>“You are my husband and I am your wife”.</em>

    <p id="b198-5" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[238,1223,1149,925]]]'>From July, 1938, decedent called on appellee “about every Saturday afternoon” and remained until Sunday afternoon. In November, 1938, decedent started to build a new home which was completed in November, 1939. Appellee testified that when the house was finished decedent said to her: “You are my wife and I am your husband, and we will live as man and wife” and that appellee replied: “You are my husband and I am your wife”. Following this conversation appellee moved all her household furniture into the new home. Thereafter the parties lived together as husband and wife from November, 1939, until decedent’s death in June of 1951. There was considerable evidence of cohabitation and reputation. Judge Kreisher, an able and experienced judge, reviewed the testimony in a thorough and analytical opinion of forty printed pages. He accepted as credible appellee’s testimony.</p>

They then separated and were divorced. Prom July, 1938, until June, 1951, when decedent died, they cohabitated as man and wife, or for a period of thirteen years following the alleged common law marriage. The findings of fact are based chiefly on the Judge’s acceptance, as credible, of the testimony of appellee that <em>per verba de praesenti </em>the parties entered into a marriage contract. There was ample evidence of cohabitation and reputation following the marriage.</p>

While not approving such marriages, but believing the testimony of appellee and her witnesses, the learned Judge quoted from 1 Freedman, Law of Marriage and Divorce in Pennsylvania 96, sec. 50 (1939) : <em>“Courts cannot, out of disapproval of such [common law] marriages, legislate agcdnst them by a harsh refusal to recognize their existence, </em>.. .”</p>

But by stipulation it is agreed that the sole question is whether or not appellee is the widow of decedent. The record discloses that the balance for distribution shown by the account is $6,689.88. Since the widow’s share of the intestate estate is one third plus the family exemption the case properly comes within the jurisdiction of this Court. Appellants should have secured a certificate from the Judge of the amount involved. The, foregoing procedural error being harmless, in the circumstances of this case, we have concluded tó act upon the'merits and not delay the case for the purpose of correction.</p>
