Moyer tivo checks totaling $7,000 for the purchase of certain real estate. Mr. Moyer, Avho at the time Avas County Treasurer of Berks County, did not use the checks for the purpose intended by Brubaker but deposited them in his account as County Treasurer. When Moyer’s term as Treasurer expired in January, 1952, a settlement of his accounts shoAved them to be in balance.</p>

The County brought in as additional defendants the estate of the deceased Moyer and the Fireman’s Fund Indemnity Company (surety on Moyer’s public official bond). At the ensuing trial the jury returned a verdict in Brubaker’s favor in the sum of $7,823.90, and a verdict in the same sum in favor of the County against Moyer’s estate and the bonding company, as additional defendants. Both defendants moved for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v. The motions were refused by the court below and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b218-4" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[243,1068,1152,651]]]'>Looking at this entire transaction through the eyes of abstract justice, one can come to no conclusion other than that Brubaker is entitled to his $7,000. Moyer had no right to turn the money over to the County and the County had no ethical or moral right to keep it once it was ascertained that the money in no way belonged to the County. Coming to this conclusion of natural justice, it would be shockingly incongruous if the law were to stamp on the money a title of County ownership simply because, through some adroit maneuvering on the part of the Treasurer, the money had fallen into the County’s coffers.</p>

IV, 56 PS §135) states that: “The title of a person who negotiates an instrument is defective, within, the meaning of this act, when he obtained the instrument or any signature thereto by fraud, duress or force, and fear, or other-unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration, or when he negotiates it in breach of faith or under such circumstances as amount to a fraud.” Since Moyer’s title to the two checks was defective in that he negotiated them in breach of faith or under circumstances <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>which amounted to fraud, the defendant County had the burden of showing under Section 59 of Negotiable Instruments Law, supra, 56 US §139, that it had acquired title as holder in due course. It thus was obligated to show that it had mot the requirements of a holder in due course by demonstrating, inter alia (Section 52 of Negotiable Instruments Law, supra; 56 PS §132) that it had given value for the checks. The County failed to produce such proof, advancing only the supposition that Moyer might have owed the County $7,000 before he deposited the checks and that, therefore, the County came into possession of the checks through value received. The County entertained also the supposition that Moyer might have extracted $7,000 from the safe, leaving there in its place the two checks. But the bridge of legal proof cannot be built oil the phantom piers of suppositions. There was no evidence of any kind to give form and substance to these suppositions. Even if it had been shown that the Treasurer might have on other occasions cashed checks in the manner hinted at, this would not prove that he had done the same with these particular checks.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Illustration No. 5, under Sec. 128, of Restatement, Restitution, is particularly apropos here: “5. A is the beneficiary of a trust of share certificates. B is the trustee.

This Court held that the plaintiff could not be afforded relief as against the City. To have held otherwise would have meant discarding all safeguards set up to protect municipalities with regard to debts sought to be contracted in their behalf. In that case the plaintiff bank could have guarded itself against loss by first inquiring as to the authority of the City Treasurer to contract the indebtedness there involved in behalf of the municipality. In the case at bar, however, the plaintiff never dealt with Moyer as County Treasurer, and thus we do not have the question of policy which was present in the New Castle case.</p>

The defendants submit that this testimony offended against the Dead Man’s Rule (Act of May 23, 1887, P.L. 158, Sec. 5, cl. (e); 28 PS §322). But here the plaintiff’s suit was not directed against anyone representing the interests of the decedent. The fact that the County brought Moyer’s widow on the record, as the executrix of his estate, could not erect a barrier against the plaintiff’s rights in proving his case against the County. The Act of April 10, 1929, P.L. 479, which permits the joining of additional defendants, does not affect the competency of witnesses. In the case of <em>McCaulif et al. v. Griffith, </em><a href="/pa-super/110/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="110 Pa. Super. 522" data-case-ids="969782" data-case-paths="/pa-super/110/0522-01">110 Pa. Superior Ct. 522</a>, the plaintiff sued the defendant Griffith for injuries resulting from a collision with the defendant’s vehicle operated by one Raymond H. Logan who died before the trial. Griffith brought in as additional defendant the estate of the deceased Logan. Upon a verdict being returned in favor of the plaintiff, Griffith appealed, urging error in the Trial Court’s having permitted the plaintiff to testify regarding the accident, when the driver was not living at the time. The Superior Court rejected this contention and said: “The only way in which plaintiff’s competency could be affected by the Apt of 1929, would be on the theory that the joinder of Logan at the instance of defendant made him a party defendant in so far as the original suit brought by plaintiff was concerned, so that he would be in the same position as if originally sued jointly <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>with his employer the other defendant. There is nothing in the Act of 1929, however, to justify such conclusion. In Vinnacombe v. Philadelphia and American Stores Company, <a href="/pa/297/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="297 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="1118180" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0564-01">297 Pa. 564</a>, the court, in discussing the Act of 1929, said by Mr. Justice Simpson (page 569) : Nothing in the act shows the slightest intention to affect plaintiffs in such suits. .</p>

It, however, as indicated by its title was To regulate procedure’ and not in any way to affect the competency of witnesses.” It is obvious from the above that since the plaintiff here was a competent witness prior to the County’s having brought in the widow of Moyer on the record, he perforce remained a competent witness thereafter.</p>

If the plaintiff had accidentally left his wallet on the <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>County Treasurer’s desk and the Treasurer had dropped it into the County till, it could not be maintained with any semblance of law and justice that the County became the legal possessor of it.

One of the requisites of a holder in due course is that he took the instrument “for value” (Section 52 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, 56 PS §132) and, because of Moyer’s defective title to the checks (Section 55, 56 PS §135), the county had the burden of proving that it acquired the instruments as holder in due course (Section 59, 56 PS §139). Yet, the county failed to prove with specificity that it had given “value” for the checks and, consequently, failed to sustain its burden.</p>
    <p id="b223-9" data-blocks='[["BL_223.10",223,[171,2074,1148,265]],["BL_224.1",224,[255,339,1148,379]]]'>No one questions the fact of Moyer’s embezzlement or breach of trust.

Thus, if Moyer’s default as treasurer existed at the time he deposited the Brubaker checks or if he merely cashed them by exchanging them for current cash in the drawer of the treasurer’s office, the county would have given “value” for the checks, as “value” is defined by the Negotiable Instruments Law (Section 25, 56 PS §62).</p>

That such could have been the actual circumstance attending Moyer’s deposit of the checks is by no means mere conjecture. And, while it would have been ridiculous for Moyer to breach his duty to Brubaker in order to make a present of the proceeds to the county, it is neither fanciful nor unrealistic to suppose that Moyer may have built up his county treasurer’s account Avith the deposit therein of the checks in order that he might <em>thereafter </em>extract the equivalent thereof from current county receipts.</p>

He received from plaintiff two cheeks, one, a treasurer’s check of the Farmers Trust Company of Lebanon in the sum of $5,000 payable to the order of plaintiff and endorsed by him, and the other a cashier’s check of the First National Bank of Schaefferstown in the sum of $2,000 likewise payable to the order of plaintiff and endorsed by him. Each of these checks was further, endorsed “For deposit only to the credit of Samuel N. Moyer, County Treasurer” and deposited by him to the credit of the County of Berks, General Account, Samuel N. Moyer, County Treasurer, on November 26, 1951, and December 17, 1951, respectively. Moyer’s term as Treasurer expired very shortly thereafter, namely, on January 7, 1952, and he thereupon turned over to his successor the exact amount which the county was entitled to receive from him; in other words, <em>his books were in balance. It is that fact which destroys the right of plaintiff to recover in this action. </em>And while he naturally is entitled to sympathy for his loss it must be remembered that that loss was due to the embezzlement of his own agent to whom -he had entrusted the money for the purchase of some real estate and that the .County of Berks was a wholly innocent party in that it received from Moyer not a penny more than that to which it was entitled.</p>

Section 52 provides that a holder in due course is one who took the instrument “in good faith and for value,” and “at the time it was negotiated to him he had no notice of any infirmity in the instru<a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>ment or defect in the title of the person negotiating it.” The County of Berks had no such notice of infirmity or defect, it being an elementary principle of law that knowledge on the part of an agent under such circumstances is not binding upon his principal: Restatement, Agency, §282, especially illustration 13. Moreover, the County gave value. As already stated Moyer’s books were in balance and there are only two possible explanations to account for that fact — either he merely cashed the checks and took the equivalent amount of money from the funds in his possession as Treasurer, or, being in default at the time and therefore indebted to the County, he deposited the checks in his Treasurer’s account to make good the deficiency, in which case the County acquired a good title to the checks because section 25 of the Negotiable Instruments Law provides that an antecedent or pre-existing debt constitutes value. It is immaterial which of these occurrences took place because in either event the result is the same. The majority opinion chooses to characterize this as “supposition” and not “legal proof,” but I- cannot conceive of any more reliable proof than that which rests on an impregnable mathematical basis. It is true, as a mere matter of theory, that Moyer’s deposit of the checks might have constituted at the time an overpayment, that he was not <em>then </em>in debt to the County but defaulted- <em>later </em>in the same amount. It would, however, be so ridiculous to imagine that he committed a criminal act merely in order to present the money he embezzled to the County as a pure gift that to give legal countenance to such a theory would be— to say the least — wholly unrealistic. I repeat, therefore, that the controlling fact in this case is that, when Moyer left office, the assets were intact and his books in balance and that consequently the County of Berks did give value for these checks and became a holder <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>of them in due course under the terms of the Negotiable Instruments Law.</p>
