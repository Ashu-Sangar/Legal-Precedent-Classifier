Plis brother, William, 4% years old, was riding on the handlebars. He intended to turn left and go east on 9th Street. When he was approximately 130 feet north of the corner he looked across the open lot on his left and saw defendant’s truck, which was about to make a left turn from Summit Avenue and go west on 9th Street. At that point the truck Avas approximately 260 feet away from him. As Patrick neared 9th Street he saiv a tar spot in the road and turned his bicycle from the right side of Pennsylvania Avenue to a foot or two to the left of center. When he was about 60 feet north of 9th Street he saw the truck on 9th Street at about the same distance as he was from the corner of 9th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. When he saw the truck Avas apparently not going to stop he tried to put on his brakes, but the brakes Avould not work. The bicycle and the truck collided; William Avas-killed and Patrick was seriously injured.</p>

While the distance an automobile travels after an accident may or may not, depending on the circumstances, indicate negligence, the facts and circumstances present in the instant case justified the jury in finding that defendant’s truck was not under proper control and that the defendant by the exercise of proper care could have avoided the collision.

Justice Linn, speaking for the Court, observed that “While the speculative difficulties always present in arriving at proper compensation in suits for the benefit of deceased minors’ estates are not to be solved by mere comparison with other cases, we may refer to the recent case of Liguori v. Phila., <a href="/pa/351/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="351 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="462689" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0494-01">351 Pa. 494</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20563" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="41 A.2d 563">41 A. 2d 563</a> (1945) in which the verdict of $12,500 was sustained, and in which it appeared that the plaintiff lived for seven months and suffered severely.” In the <em>Liguori </em>case, although decedent was somewhat older than the deceased minor in the present case, the situation was not much different than here. In the <em>Hankins </em>case, a verdict of $30,-000 was reduced to $15,000 by this Court. There the decedent was nine years old, a healthy boy and at the head of his class in school. Comparing the facts in William Pries’ case with those in the cases above referred to, the conclusion that the verdict in favor of the administratrix of this estate for loss of earning power was excessive cannot be avoided. A majority of this Court are convinced that that part of the verdict should be reduced to $18,000.00.</p>

On the basis of a 4% increment over the years, the present worth of the total amount, less maintenance, would be approximately $31,000. Therefore, it would appear to me that the sum of $24,204.50 for loss of earning power, less maintenance, would not be excessive.</p>
