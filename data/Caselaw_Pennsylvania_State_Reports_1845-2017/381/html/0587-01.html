On or about January 1, 1943 Miller and his wife sold to plaintiffs a one-half interest in their business, which was described as that of “buying, selling and dealing in cinders and cinder products.” The purchase price was $20,000. Pursuant to this written agreement plaintiffs and Miller and his wife entered into a written partnership agreement dated April 1, 1943, in which Miller agreed not to engage in a similar business within 300 miles of the City of Chester for a period of ten years.</p>

Any one of the three forms of cinder can be formed in a boiler furnace or a blast furnace and any form of cinder can be changed into any other form. Coal cinder and slag cinder differ only quantitatively and not qualitatively in their chemical constituents because the percentage of elements in coal and in iron vary in nature and, further, because there is a larger percentage of combustible matter in the coal cinders, since it is not subjected to as high temperature as iron ore in the blast furnace, and finally, the iron oxide is higher in the cinder taken from a fuel furnace than from a blast furnace because in the blast furnace operation, greater care is taken to extract the iron. Mr. Johnson further testified that the terms “cinder” and “slag” are used interchangeably and are virtually synonymous.</p>
    <p id="b649-4" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[188,1506,1150,433]]]'>Plaintiffs’ expert was corroborated, as the Chancellors further found, by the definition in Webster’s International Dictionary of the terms “cinders” and “slag”. While Webster gives six definitions of the word “cinder” the first definition is, “1. The slag from a metal furnace; dross; scoria.” The third definition is, “. . . the residue of anything burnt, esp. the small particles of clinker left by burning soft coal.”</p>

Later on in that year Miller asked Foulkes’ permission to go into the slag business. Foulke replied, “Hessey, that is still the cinder business. . . . you sold out fair and square and this is part of the cinder business.” Miller replied, “. . . there is no law can stop me from making a living . . .” Miller thereupon went into the slag business and held himself out as “The Original H.

As the Court below aptly said: “. . . In the present case the Chancellors have found as a fact:</p>
    <p id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.5",654,[255,508,1149,322]]]'>‘30. Again in the year 1948, defendant, H. Hessey Miller, attempted to gain permission from the plaintiff, Kirk Foulke, to deal in slag, and when plaintiff informed him that that was part of the cinder business, the defendant, H. Hessey Miller, said that there was no law to stop him from making a living.’</p>
    <p id="b654-5" data-blocks='[["BL_654.6",654,[256,844,1148,372]]]'>and there was competent credible evidence to support such finding. This shows that the defendant did not interpret the contract to give him the right to deal in slag; otherwise he would not need to ask the plaintiff for permission to do so. It was only after this request was refused that he asserted his right to deal in slag.”</p>
    <p id="b654-6" data-blocks='[["BL_654.7",654,[256,1230,1148,200]]]'>There was competent and adequate evidence if believed to support ail of the Chancellors’ findings of fact and we agree with its interpretation of the contracts and with its conclusions of law.</p>
    <p id="b654-7" data-blocks='[["BL_654.8",654,[256,1452,1146,99]]]'>Decree affirmed. The costs shall be paid by appellant, H. Hessey Miller.</p>

      <p id="b648-8" data-blocks='[["BL_648.9",648,[254,2159,1147,170]]]'> While cinder slag had been used in the manufacture of building blocks as early as 1930, it was not as popular nor as widely used for that purpose as coal cinder because of the cheapness and availability of coal cinder.</p>
