    <p id="b321-5" data-blocks='[["BL_321.8",321,[215,543,1151,663]]]'>The Borough of Bidley Park in Delaware County enacted a zoning ordinance on October 12, 1948, which provided a comprehensive plan of zoning for the entire borough. Approximately four years later, William Jacobs, the plaintiff, purchased a number of contiguous unimproved lots in the borough for development purposes. All of the lots so purchased were situated in a district zoned by the ordinance as R-l Residential. The minimum building standards prescribed for an R-l Residential District were single-family dwellings, one to a lot, the lots having a minimum width of forty feet each.</p>
    <p id="b321-6" data-blocks='[["BL_321.9",321,[214,1219,1151,826]]]'>Desiring to build semi-detached or other type two-family houses on his lots, Jacobs petitioned the borough council for an amendment of the zoning ordinance to the end that his property would be reclassified as R-2 Residential. Twin or other type two-family houses were permitted by the ordinance in an R-2 Residential District. The council refused Jacobs’ petition. Thereupon, he file his complaint in equity in the instant suit against the burgess, the members of council and the secretary of council of Ridley Park, averring that the property of which he was the owner, was zoned discriminatorily when. compared with the zoning of other designatéd properties: lying to the rear of his property. ' In other' words, the plaintiff’s property was. on the one side of the R-l Residential 'Zone:</p>

The defendants answered to the merits. Following a hearing of the case, the chancellor entered a decree <em>nisi </em>which, upon the dismissal of exceptions thereto, was made final by the court en banc. The decree sustained the plaintiff’s bill, declared the ordinance unconstitutional, invalid and of no effect as it applied to the property owned by the plaintiff and restrained the defendants from enforcing the provisions of the ordinance, or its amendments, against the plaintiff’s land insofar as it imposed the restrictions of an R-l Residential classification upon his property. The matter is here on the defendants’ appeal from the final decree.</p>

The bill of complaint must be dismissed. Equity is without jurisdiction of the matter. The borough’s zoning ordinance was enacted pursuant to authority legislatively conferred on boroughs, originally, by the Act of June 29, 1923, P. L. 957, later supplemented and added to The General Borough Act of 1927, P. L. 519, as Article XXXIII by Section 93 of The Borough Code of 1947,' P. L; 1621, 1833, 53 PS §15211.1 et seq. The constitutionality of zoning statutes has long since been recognized in this State: see <em>Taylor v. Moore, </em><a href="/pa/303/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="303 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="1130077" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0469-01">303 Pa. 469</a>, 472, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20799" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="154 A. 799">154 A. 799</a>.

In the instant case, however, the plaintiff’s application with respect to his requested use of his property was never taken to the board of adjustment. He applied directly to the borough council for an amendment re-zoning his property, which the council refused to do. It is plain enough that the procedure statutorily prescribed for testing the validity of substantive provisions of a zoning ordinance or the method of its administration is through application to the board of adjustment by one aggrieved by the decision of a borough administrative officer in respect thereof and, thereafter, by appeal to the court of common pleas if the decision of the board of adjustment is likewise adverse.</p>

Moore, </em>supra, the plaintiff sought a permit from the zoning inspector for a gasoline station in a district zoned residential. The inspector refused a permit. The plaintiff appealed to the board of adjustment with like result. Instead of pursuing further the statutorily prescribed procedure (i.e., an appeal to the common pleas), the plaintiff sought by mandamus to compel issuance of a permit. The defendant moved to quash the writ on the ground that the plaintiff should have appealed to the court of common pleas from the action of the board of adjustment. <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>The plaintiff countered that he could not use the appeal provisions of the zoning ordinance while, at the same time, attacking its provisions as confiscatory. We rejected that contention, however, and noted that the borough’s authority to enact a zoning ordinance and the validity of the procedure for appeal in respect thereof were unquestionable; and that, since the Act of 1806 required pursuit of the statutory remedies, the plaintiff could hot be barred on his appeal to the court of common pleas from pressing his contention of confiscation. By way of analogy, we pointed out that “In assessment of properties, the legislature has provided a special remedy for property owners aggrieved by the acts of the board of revision. In all such cases we have held that the specific remedy must be pursued, though, through unfairness, oppression, or unreasonableness, confiscation may be the question . . . .” It was further observed that “In all cases which we have been able to examine, except one, questions bearing on the constitutionality or validity of a Zoning Act or ordinance have come to us or the Superior Court through the remedy provided in the act of assembly governing zoning [citing cases].

When attention was called to the apparent oversight at the argument of this appeal, counsel cited an article entitled Equity Jurisdiction in Zoning Cases (50 Dickinson Law Review 23) by Judge Toal who had heard and disposed of the instant case and whose article, in turn, made reference to <em>Lukens v. Ridley Township Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/367/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="367 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="1228419" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0608-01">367 Pa. 608</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="80 A.2d 765">80 A. 2d 765</a>. There is nothing in the <em>Lukens </em>case holding or intended to hold that equity has jurisdiction to relieve against the restrictions of a zoning ordinance which has been enacted pursuant to an empowering Act of Assembly. The question was not there involved. True, it was said in the <em>Lukens </em>case that “A petition to change and reclassify approximately <em>16 acres </em>. . . appears, because of the large acreage involved, to be an application for re-zoning and not for a variance, and if so, the application should be made to the Township Commissioners and not to the Board of Adjustment.” But different rules do not obtain for relieving against oppressive zoning restrictions according to differences in the relative sizes of affected properties. All properties within the same zoned district are subject to the same zoning regulations. If, however, a property owner desires to test the constitutionality or validity otherwise of zoning regulations, application to the Board of Adjustment, in the first instance, for relief, followed by an appeal <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>to the common pleas from the Board’s denial of relief, is the means for raising legal questions for judicial determination. Nothing was said in the <em>Lukens </em>case from which it could even be inferred that if the local legislative body refuses to re-zone, when so requested, the applicant can then invoke equity’s jurisdiction and there have the ordinance amended, if not actually nullified. Indeed, the opinion quoted approvingly from <em>Taylor v. Moore, </em>supra, to the effect that “where a remedy or method of procedure is provided or a duty enjoined by any act of assembly, the directions of such act shall be strictly pursued, and we have held that such remedy or procedure is exclusive.”</p>

Zoning Board, </em>367 Pa., supra, in the majority opinion is, in my judgment, both unnecessary and regrettable. In the <em>Lukens </em>case, which was decided by a unanimous Court, petitioners <em>bypassed </em>the permit official and petitioned the Board of Adjustment to grant (a) a variance for several lots, each containing less than two acres, and (b) a variance for a 16 acre tract without averring “unnecessary hardship”. The Board ruled it had no jurisdiction of such a petition for a variance and refused to consider <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>it. We sustained the Board. Two points were involved in the <em>Lukens </em>ease, (1) one dealing with lots of less than two acres, and (2) the other dealing with a tract of land of 16 acres. With respect to proposition (1), we held that the Board of Adjustment had the power and jurisdiction to consider — -but only <em>on appeal </em>— a petition for a variance if the petition averred “unnecessary hardship”; but had no jurisdiction over the petition actually presented since it did not comply with the statutory requirements and the Board’s power being statutory, the remedy and method of procedure which was specifically provided by the Act must he followed. We likewise agreed with the Board of Adjustment that (2) it did not have the power or jurisdiction to grant an application for a variance with respect to the 16 acre tract if the reclassification sought was, because of the large tract involved, really an application for a re-zoning or for a re-zoning under the guise of a variance. As to this latter point, we said, (I repeat) : “The Board of Adjustment was likewise correct in holding that <em>a re-zoning and a variance are fundamentally different; </em>and that it has jurisdiction only when the petition is for a variance and <em>not where it is for a re-zoning under the guise of a variance. </em>The legislature expressly' vested the power to zone in the Board of Township Commissioners . . . and did <em>not ‘empower a board of adjustment to set at naught the zoning statute </em>and ordinance under the guise of a variance’ : Devereux Foundation, Inc. Zoning Case, <a href="/pa/351/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="351 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="462762" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0478-01">351 Pa. 478</a>, 485, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20744" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="41 A.2d 744">41 A. 2d 744</a>. . . . A petition to change and reclassify approximately <em>16 acres </em>in Tract No. 2 appears, because of the large acreage involved, to be an application for re-zoning and not for a variance, and if so, the application should be made to the Township Commissioners and not to the Board of Adjustment.” This was a correct and accurate statement of the law <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>and was supported by a <em>unanimous </em>Court. A variance and a re-zoning are fundamentally different. The Board of Adjustment has no power to declare an ordinance unconstitutional and it cannot re-zone, even under the guise of a variance; the power to re-zone lies in the Board of Commissioners or whatever the legislative body is called, and whether the application is for a re-zoning or for a variance will at times depend upon the size of the property. For example, if the area zoned El consisted of 20 acres, a petition for a variance by the owner of 16 acres or 19 acres or for %ths or % of the area zoned could not be granted by the Board of Adjustment because it would clearly be a petition to re-zone under the guise of a variance. To hold otherwise would enable the Board of Adjustment, in the words of the <em>Devereux Foundation </em>and the <em>Lulcens </em>cases “to set at naught the zoning statute and the ordinance under the guise of a variance”.</p>
