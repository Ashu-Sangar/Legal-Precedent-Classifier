Curry and his wife Josephine, the plaintiffs, instituted an action in trespass against Frank <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>A. Napolitano, defendant, for injuries received by wife-plaintiff in an automobile accident due to tbe alleged negligence of defendant. Irving W. Coleman, Esq., is counsel for Standard Accident Insurance Company of Detroit, Michigan, defendant’s insurance carrier. Tbe action was commenced January 14, 1953, and defendant was served by tbe sheriff on January 23, 1953. Defendant did not notify tbe insurance carrier of tbe suit until February 12, 1953. On February 17, 1953, plaintiffs took judgment against defendant for want of an appearance and answer. Tbe judgment is in no monetary amount since the claim is for unliquidated damages and was entered for want of an appearance.</p>
    <p id="b96-4" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[225,1064,1152,921]]]'>Mr. Coleman, being unaware of tbe entry of tbe judgment, on February 21, 1953, entered an appearance for defendant and on March 13, 1953, issued a praecipe to join Lehigh Valley Transit Company as an additional defendant. On April 20, 1953, Mr. Coleman, having discovered that judgment bad been entered, petitioned tbe court to open tbe judgment averring a meritorious defense and that defendant bad first notified bis insurance carrier of tbe suit on February 12, 1953. On that day the defendant delivered tbe complaint to tbe insurance agent who immediately mailed it to tbe central office in Philadelphia, but it was not received by tbe addressee until February 16, 1953. Tbe following day, February 17th, counsel received the complaint and on February 21, 1953, the appearance above referred to was entered. Mr: Coleman is now unable to locate the defendant. .</p>

    <p id="b97-4" data-blocks='[["BL_97.5",97,[152,690,1147,434]]]'>Counsel for defendant frankly concedes in his paper book: “It is hornbook law in this Commonwealth that a Court in opening a default judgment, to permit the Defendant to interpose a defense, has the power to impose terms and conditions upon which the judgment will be opened. The imposition of terms and conditions are within the discretion of the Trial Court but such discretion may not be abused.”</p>
    <p id="b97-5" data-blocks='[["BL_97.6",97,[154,1135,1144,147]]]'>The sole question is whether or not the court below abused its discretion in <em>prescribing the stated condition.</em>

He states it is obvious that the petition to open is interposed solely for the benefit of the insurance carrier. <em>Defendant </em>held the complaint for almost twenty days before he turned it over to his insurance agent and, consequently, is not entitled to consideration. <em>Counsel, however, not only entered an appearance for a client who has disappeared, but has brought in an additional defendant. </em>The application of counsel to now withdraw as attorney for defendant, because of his inability to locate him, places the plaintiffs in an unfortunate position. As stated by the learned trial Judge: “In our opinion it would be inequitable to open the judgment at the behest of and for the benefit of the insurance carrier and then, when that is accomplished and they are let into a defense, to have them withdraw and compel plaintiffs to prove their case against an absent defendant, who is not entitled to our sympathy and mercy. <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>Furthermore, defendant hag complicated matters by adding another defendant for plaintiffs to meet. That plaintiffs have sued this additional defendant independently does not simplify the situation created by defendant.</p>
    <p id="b98-4" data-blocks='[["BL_98.5",98,[269,621,1145,317]]]'>“In other words, we are willing to let defense counsel defend if his client wants to defend; we are not willing to let him defend if he is unwilling to do so. He may not say in one breath that he represents the wronged insurance carrier and in the next that he represents a refractory individual defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b98-5" data-blocks='[["BL_98.6",98,[264,952,1149,708]]]'>The condition prescribed, under the circumstances of this case, appears just and equitable.

While, of course, an insurer may waive its defense of non-cooperation of the insured, it is not voluntary when done by direction of the court. The insurance carrier still retains, in that event, its defense as garnishee when it proves the fact of non-cooperation of defendant — in this case, the alleged disappearance: <em>Cameron v. </em>Berger, <a href="/pa/336/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="336 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="1195568" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0229-01">336 Pa. 229</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20A.2d%20293" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 A.2d 293">7 A. 2d 293</a>.

This liability is not now before us, but is not increased by the present decision.
