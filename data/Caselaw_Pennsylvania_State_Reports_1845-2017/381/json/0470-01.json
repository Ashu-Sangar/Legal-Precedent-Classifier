        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Bell,\nDefendants ask for judgment non obstante veredicto and for a new trial because the verdict in the survival action was excessive.\nOn May 20, 1950, about 11 o\u2019clock A.M., Patrick Fries, 9 years of age, was riding a bicycle south on Pennsylvania Avenue in Prospect Park, Delaware County, which intersected at right angles with 9th Street, but thereafter came to a dead end. Plis brother, William, 4% years old, was riding on the handlebars. He intended to turn left and go east on 9th Street. When he was approximately 130 feet north of the corner he looked across the open lot on his left and saw defendant\u2019s truck, which was about to make a left turn from Summit Avenue and go west on 9th Street. At that point the truck Avas approximately 260 feet away from him. As Patrick neared 9th Street he saiv a tar spot in the road and turned his bicycle from the right side of Pennsylvania Avenue to a foot or two to the left of center. When he was about 60 feet north of 9th Street he saw the truck on 9th Street at about the same distance as he was from the corner of 9th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. When he saw the truck Avas apparently not going to stop he tried to put on his brakes, but the brakes Avould not work. The bicycle and the truck collided; William Avas-killed and Patrick was seriously injured.\nThe speed of the bicycle and the truck and the exact position of the collision are unknown, but the evidence disclosed (a) Patrick woke up lying on Pennsylvania Avenue about even Avith the north curb of 9th Street; (b) his bicycle was on the sideAvalk of the northeast corner with its front wheel smashed; and (c) the truck stopped on 9th Street a couple of feet out from the north curb and 50 feet west of Pennsylvania xivenue.\nThe law is clearly settled; the difficulty arises in close cases such as this of applying the principles to the facts. Plaintiff must prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that defendant was guilty of negligence and that defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the accident. Plaintiff must also make out a case free from contributory negligence and the mere fact that a collision took place is not evidence or proof of negligence: Brusis v. Henkels, 376 Pa. 226, 102 A. 2d 146; Finnin v. Neubert, 378 Pa. 40, 105 A. 2d 77; Lewis v. Quinn, 376 Pa. 109, 101 A. 2d 382; Ebersole v. Beistline, 368 Pa. 12, 82 A. 2d 11.\nIt is not necessary to prove the accident by eye witnesses, but where circumstantial evidence is relied upon to prove negligence the evidence must be such as to enable the jury to conclude \u2014 not by conjecture or guess but \u2014 as a reasonable and legitimate inference that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant. In order to do so the evidence must clearly and sufficiently describe or picture the happening of the accident in such a manner that the only reasonable inference and conclusion from the facts and circumstances which were proved, is that defendant was negligent: Ebersole v. Beistline, 368 Pa., supra; Finnin v. Neubert, 378 Pa., supra.\nConsidering the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to plaintiff, as we must sur a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto \u2014 Finnin v. Neubert, 378 Pa., supra \u2014 the jury could reasonably and' legitimately have\u2019concluded that defendant\u2019s truck driver, looking across an open lot with no traffic on either street,'could have seen plaintiff\u2019s bicycle some 200 feet away, and' when'' the truck neared the corner of 9th' Street and'Pennsylvania Avenue the driver could; have' seen' that the' bicycle was probably not going to stop. \u201d........ ...\nWhere an automobile driver sees a child who is in a place of danger or has reasonable grounds to apprehend that the child may run or may ride his bicycle into the path of the automobile, a higher degree of care is required than under ordinary circumstances, and in such a case it is his duty to exercise such a reasonable degree of care as the circumstances require. Cf. Robb v. Miller, 372 Pa. 505, 94 A. 2d 734; Chapple v. Sellers, 365 Pa. 503, 76 A. 2d 172; Silberstein v. Showell, Fryer & Co. (No. 1), 267 Pa. 298, 109 A. 701; Van Buren v. Eberhard, 377 Pa. 22, 104 A. 2d 98.\nIn the instant case the jury could properly have found (1) that defendant\u2019s driver had ample time not only to see the boy but to realize that he was likely to ride his bicycle into the path of the truck, and (2) that the driver had sufficient time to stop his car if he had exercised the reasonable care and control which were necessary under the circumstances. While the distance an automobile travels after an accident may or may not, depending on the circumstances, indicate negligence, the facts and circumstances present in the instant case justified the jury in finding that defendant\u2019s truck was not under proper control and that the defendant by the exercise of proper care could have avoided the collision. The lower Court therefore correctly refused defendants\u2019 motion for judgment non obstante veredicto.\nWith respect to the question of a new trial, we note that the jury made a number of specific findings of fact.\nThe jury gave a verdict to Patrick\u2019s parents in the amount of $3,205.00: \u2014 $500.00 for Patrick\u2019s earnings to age 21, less his keep, reduced to ptes\u00e9nt worth; and expenses: hospital bill $355.25, doctor $350.00, and future operations and care $2,000.00.\nThe jury gave to Patrick\u2019s guardian for pain and suffering, past and future, $3,000.00. The femur of Patrick\u2019s leg was fractured] he was in the hospital on three occasions, the first time for approximately two weeks, the second time, one week and the third time four or five days; his leg was in a cast for six months; thereafter he continued to use crutches for another six months. He had a scar over his eye two inches long and an eight inch scar from the middle of the leg to the knee. He had a two inch shortening of one leg, so that he cannot play sports as he did before the accident. While he did not have any pain at the time of the trial he had to have a future operation. We believe that $3,000.00 for pain and suffering was certainly not excessive.\nHowever, we are concerned with the verdict of $25,-000.00 awarded to Kathleen Fries, Administratrix of the Estate of William Martin Fries, the four year old boy who was killed:\n\u201c1. As to William Martin Fries, deceased:\nTo Kathleen Fries, Administratrix,\na. Earnings to age 21, less William\u2019s keep, reduced to its present worth (under the\nDeath Act) $ 500.00\nb. Funeral bill of $295.50 (under the Death Act) 295.50\nc. Loss of William\u2019s earning power after age 21, less his maintenance, reduced to its present worth- (under Surviv-\nal Act) ' ' \u2019 24,204.50\n' Total of a, b, & c $25,000.00\u201d\nAlthough this was the correct test, se\u00e9: Murray v. P.T.C., 359 Pa. 69, 58 A. 2d 323, loss of earning power is a subject which is off times difficult of ascertainment. In Hankins v. Mack, 364 Pa. 417, 72 A. 2d 268, this Court had occasion to consider the difficulties inherent in such an evaluation. Justice Linn, speaking for the Court, observed that \u201cWhile the speculative difficulties always present in arriving at proper compensation in suits for the benefit of deceased minors\u2019 estates are not to be solved by mere comparison with other cases, we may refer to the recent case of Liguori v. Phila., 351 Pa. 494, 41 A. 2d 563 (1945) in which the verdict of $12,500 was sustained, and in which it appeared that the plaintiff lived for seven months and suffered severely.\u201d In the Liguori case, although decedent was somewhat older than the deceased minor in the present case, the situation was not much different than here. In the Hankins case, a verdict of $30,-000 was reduced to $15,000 by this Court. There the decedent was nine years old, a healthy boy and at the head of his class in school. Comparing the facts in William Pries\u2019 case with those in the cases above referred to, the conclusion that the verdict in favor of the administratrix of this estate for loss of earning power was excessive cannot be avoided. A majority of this Court are convinced that that part of the verdict should be reduced to $18,000.00.\nThis Court has the power under Section 2 of the Act of May 20, 1891, P. L. 101, 12 PS \u00a71164, to reverse or open or vacate a judgment- and \u201cto make such order as it deems proper and just\u201d: Downes v. Hodin, 377 Pa. 208, 104 A. 2d 495; Falk & Co. v. South Texas Cotton Oil Co., 368 Pa. 199, 82 A. 2d 27.\nThe judgment entered on the verdict of the jury awarding to Kathleen Pries, Administratrix of the Estate of William Martin Pries, deceased, the sum of $24,204.50 for . \u201closs of William\u2019s earning power after age 21, less Ms maintenance reduced to its present worth (under Survival Act)\u201d is opened and is hereby reduced to $18,000.00; in all other respects the verdict is confirmed. Judgment is here entered on the verdict as thus modified.",

I dissent, however, from the Majority decision to reduce to $18,000 the verdict of $25,000 awarded to the Administratrix of the estate of William Martin Fries, deceased.\nThe Carlisle Tables of Mortality give to a child of 5 years of age a life expectancy of 51 years. Thus, at the age of 21, William Fries could have looked forward to 30 years of remunerative employment. Assuming an income of $80 per week (the amount earned by his father) and $45 a week for maintenance, he would thus have, beyond his maintenance, the amount of $35 per week to save, invest or spend as he saw fit. On the basis of a 4% increment over the years, the present worth of the total amount, less maintenance, would be approximately $31,000. Therefore, it would appear to me that the sum of $24,204.50 for loss of earning power, less maintenance, would not be excessive.",
