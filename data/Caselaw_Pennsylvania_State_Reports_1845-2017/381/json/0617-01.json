His present petition states that there are six questions involved, \u2014 \u25a0 Whether he was entitled to have had an investigation made of the charges? Whether he had been entitled to a postponement of his trial in order to have a certain witness present? Whether a certain article shown to the jury was inadmissible as evidence? Whether he was improperly convicted on the testimony of two interested witnesses? Whether the charge of the trial judge reviewed the evidence unfairly? Whether the Commonwealth had improperly excluded evidence from the court and jury?\nAt the hearing before the court below the petitioner offered no testimony in regard to these matters. But, in any event, they obviously represent only alleged trial errors which, at best, are not the subject of relief in a habeas corpus proceeding. A writ of habeas corpus cannot be made the substitute for an appeal.\nOrder affirmed.",
