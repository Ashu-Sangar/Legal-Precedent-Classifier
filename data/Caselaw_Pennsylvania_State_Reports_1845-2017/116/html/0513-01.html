In the first of these cases, Marsli, who was at that time engaged in manufacturing agricultural implements, assigned as collateral security to the East Lewisburg Lumber Co., the proceeds of future sales of ¡said implements during the then current year, and it was held that, although the proceeds of sale assigned had no actual existence and rested in expectancy only, the assignment was valid. It will be noticed, however, that the thing assigned was individuated, and was the fruit of an employment existing ■at the time of the assignment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.6",548,[303,1158,1191,1337]],["BL_549.1",549,[159,401,1192,824]]]'>In Ruple v. Bindley, Ruple was under contract to put up •the stairs in a building in process of erection by Bindley, and .not having the means to fulfill his contract, one Lewis agreed to advance’ the same. To secure Lewis, Ruple gave him an ¡order on Bindley for $104, the amount advanced by Lewis, to be paid out of his wages when the stairs were finished. This was held to be a valid assignment of the $104. But here again the thing assigned was individuated, and was, besides, the fruit of an employment under contract at the time the order was given. No argument is needed to show that these cases fall very far short of sustaining'the broad position the defendant is compelled to assume in the case at bar. Of' greater force and more directly in point is Mulhall v. Quinn, <a href="/mass/67/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Gray 105" data-case-ids="1974009" data-case-paths="/mass/67/0105-01">1 Gray 105</a>, cited and recognized in East Lewisburg Lumber Co. v. Marsh, <em><a href="/pa/91/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="91 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="488041" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0096-01">supra.</a> </em>In this case there was an assignment of all claims and demands which the assignor had or might have against the city of Boston for money due or to become due for services rendered to the city, and the assignment was accompanied by an irrevocable power of attorney authorizing the assignee to draw the money assigned. Notice of the assignment was given to the city, but the city did not accept or undertake to pay the assignee. At the time of the assignment the assignee was not employed by the city or under any contract for such employment, but he had been employed prior thereto and became so subsequently. The contest was between the assignee and the plaintiff in a trustee attachment for the <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>benefit of all creditors. “Under these circumstances,” says Shaw, C. J., “the court are of opinion that beyond the earnings due at the time of the assignment there was no valid assignment which can be set up to defeat the trustee attachment, and that the earnings of the assignor between the assignment and the attachment did not vest in the assignee. The future earnings constitute a mere possibility, coupled with no interest. There was no subsisting engagement under which wages were to be earned, and it depended altogether upon a future engagement whether anything would ever become due. None of the cases go so far as to hold that the mere possibility of being again employed by the city, and of earning wages under that employment at a future time, is capable of being assigned. A power of attorney, although irrevocable in terms, does not amount to an assignment, when no assignable interest exists at the time.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b549-5" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[158,1232,1188,817]]]'>Still more to the point is the language used in Jermyn v. Moffit, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20402" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="75 Pa. 402">75 Penn. St. 402</a>, where Mercuk, J., says: “We, however, are clearly of the opinion that an assignment, like the present, which professes to transfer a debt to arise for wages not yet earned, against any person by whom the assignor may thereafter be employed, although followed by a subsequent notice of the assignment to such an employee, is insufficient without acceptance to make a valid transfer of the debt against the employer.” In Ruple v. Bindley, <em>supra, </em>Trunkey, J., says after quoting this same language, that, “the soundness of this principle is unquestioned.” In this connection it is only necessary to call attention to the fact that the jury in the case at bar do not find that the defendant accepted the order given by the plaintiff in favor of Mrs. McDermott, and in the absence of such finding the legal inference is that the order was not accepted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b549-6" data-blocks='[["BL_549.6",549,[160,2057,1185,406]],["BL_550.1",550,[270,394,1183,460]]]'>But aside from these authorities, and aside from the question of acceptance, we think all assignments such as the one in controversy here, should be declared void as being against the principles of public policy. The present assignment is by a day laborer, in consideration of groceries and provisions furnished him and his family, and it covers all wages, past and future, due and to become due, to the assignor from any person, firm or corporation, whatever, so long as the assignee’s <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>claim remains unpaid. True, in the present case, the assignee’s claim amounts to but $32.62, but the principle would be the same if the claim were ten or a hundred times that sum. Nor does the fact that the assignment was in consideration of groceries and provisions furnished the family of the assignor give the transaction special character. A money consideration would, in contemplation of law, be just as effectual. Nor, if the transaction be fair, need the price paid be a full equivalent for the wages assigned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[262,860,1188,1220]]]'>Should the law be declared to be that such an assignment is valid, it is not difficult to see that it would open the door to improvidence and profusion on the part of the assignor, and in the end to utter and hopeless poverty. Take the case of any wage earner, or salary earner, or any one who is compelled to work for a living, for in either case the principle is the same. He conceives himself to be in want of money, whether for necessaries or luxuries makes no difference. He finds that he can raise the coveted money by assigning his future earnings to become due from any and every source. No purchaser offers for his wages in any existing employment, for he may quit that employment at any time and thus render worthless his assignees’ security. He therefore, under the pressure of his supposed wants, pledges his whole money-earning power for a price. Presently the money or provisions, <em>oi </em>what not, thus acquired are all gone. They may have been recklessly squandered ; they may have been doled out only for the very necessaries of life, during a period of sickness or other misfortune ; it’s all the same. He is not only penniless, but he has incurred a debt which it may require months and even years to work off. Turn where he will, go where he will, his creditors may follow him and sweep away every dollar of his earnings until his debt is paid. In the meantime his children are clamoring for bread.</p>

In addition to all this, the danger to society from such a condition of things would be both grave and alarming. It is true <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>generally, as argued by tbe learned counsel for defendant, that persons <em>sui juris </em>may make their own contracts, but the rule has its exceptions.
