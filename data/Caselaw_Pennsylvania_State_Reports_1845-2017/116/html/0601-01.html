I went down and he sent me home with it; my father sent me home. When I came back Sarah Boyer said that I did not explain the matter properly. I replied that I had. I then said, “T will take the money and put it in bank.” Sarah Boyer then said, “ You might lose it in bank.” She then further said that John Landis had once asked her for money, and he would take money at any time. I then wrote a note and laid it with the money. • That is the note. Landis did not pass along that way. I worked out every, day. I had to come home every evening. Then on Friday evening I came home again and said to Sarah Boyer, “ Now to-morrow I will take this money to bank.” Then she said, “No, to-morrow morning you take this money down again, and now you explain it to them right.” Q. Did you go down with the money ? A. Yes, sir; and then I called her and him again.

Tell us specifically what- you told them when you came down with the money that second time ? A. I told mother if they would not take it they would never get a cent, and that Mrs. Boyer had so told me to tell her, to say so to Mrs. Heydt. Mrs. Heydt then said, “We will take it. I have never got <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>anything yet.” I further said to Mr. Heydt, “You shall sign a note for the interest if Mrs. Boyer needs the interest.” The principal should never be paid back again. That day there was no note signed. About three or four weeks afterward I came home, and then Mrs. Boyer said, “Now your father signed a note for it.” I then replied, “ There was none prepared for him.” I asked her for the note and she showed it to me. Q. Was this the note she showed you? (Note in suit shown witness.) A. She showed me that note. I said, “ This is wrong. I will go down immediately.” I said, “ I will go down immediately and tell him that this is wrong.” Then Mrs. Boyer said, “ No, don’t.” I said that this would make a trouble, and she said, “ You stay here.” She said, “ If you do that he will bring the money back.” It remained that way. In 1881 he sent the interest up with me. , Then we got at each other again.. Mrs. Boyer then said when I brought this interest, that I should not bring her any interest, if she wanted interest she would ask for it. In 1882 she sent the interest with me again, and then she scolded and said I should not take the interest along with me; if she wanted it she would ask for it. So it remained until some time in July. In July she threw it up to me that she had presented my mother with $850, that they could live big now, they could eat it up. I then said there must be an end of it, and I went down to father and told him to get the money ready ; to-morrow morning I would bring the note down and take the money; I did not want this thing thrown up to me any longer. I went down next morning, brought the money back and laid it down on the table to her, and the interest also, and then I said, Now I want my note.” She then said, “ Now you put the money just where you got it; more they will never get.” Some time after that, in August, I left.</p>

This is the case that is presented upon the part of the plaintiffs, and if there were no further evidence the plaintiffs would be entitled to a verdict for the $850, with interest from the first of April, 1882, to the present time. The defendant, however, alleges that the $850 was not a loan, but was a gift upon the part of Sarah Boyer to her daughter, Mrs. David Heydt, as (using the German expression) “ Arbshoft ” —an advancement. Now, an advancement is a gift by a parent to a child in contemplation of the share of the latter in the estate after the decease of the former, and it is a gift that is not revocable. When it is once given, it is given, and the gift is absolute. Now, what evidence is there in the cause from which the jury may find that this $850 was a gift, and not a loan ? The only witness who testifies as to the handing over and receipt of that money, is John Heydt, a son of the defendant. He says:.....That is the testimony in regard to the passing over of this money. The jury will have to determine from this testimony as to whether there was, at the time when this money was passed over, an intention upon the part of Sarah Boyer to give this money to Mrs. Heydt or not. If it was then it would be an advancement. If she passed it over to her as part of her “arbshoft” on account of her-inheritance, gave it to her never to be returned again, then it was an advancement: The evidence must satisfy the jury with some positiveness that this was a gift upon the part of Sarah. Boyer to her daughter. There is some other testimony that was submitted by some of the other sons of David Heydt. Jacob Heydt says, speaking of his grandmother: “ She said, ‘ What your father and your mother had from me is all they will get from me.’ ” Peter Heydt, another son, was called and he talks about his mother having gone down into the cellar, the cellar door having fallen, and of something that occurred between the daughter and her mother. Then what was said was to the father. “ She said to father that if she had not helped him he would have come to nothing. He then said that what he had from her he could pay back, and went and got half of the amount, and said he would get the rest in two hour’s. Then grandmother said, ‘ David, I gave you this for arbshoft.’ ” Even if the jury take that declara<a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>tion as it is, it would not of itself be sufficient to convert tbe sum given into an advancement. Tbe advancement, if it was an advancement, must have been received, at the time when the money was passed over, as an advancement, and must bave been so intended by Mrs. Sarah Boyer at that time; and, if it was a debt before, this subsequent declaration of hers would not convert that debt into an advancement. It is claimed upon the part of the plaintiffs that although this is an acknowl'edgment by Sarah Boyer that this money was given as arbshoft, (that is as an advancement) yet the fact that David Heydt offered to return it shows- that it was not recognized by him as such. Oliver Heydt was also examined. He says that he and his father were out and they stopped and talked with the old lady and “ She asked my lather what he did with the money. He said, ‘ The half. I have at the house and the rest I can get you in two hours,’ and she then said, ‘ David, you need not pay it back in your lifetime. I gave it to Betsie as arbshoft. You can only pay me the interest when I want it.’ ” This is all the evidence that I remember that bears upon this question. [As I said before, the jury must inquire, first, How was this money handed over? How was it received? Was it received as an advancement, or was it received as a loan? If it was received as a loan, then these subsequent declarations, made by the old lady, do not convert that loan into an advancement, and the verdict would have to be in favor of the plantiffs. But if the jury find from the evidence of John Heydt that it was an advancement, these other declarations, which were sworn to by these other witnesses, if the jury believe them, are entitled to be considered. That is about all I propose to say to you on this subject. Here is the note, the evidence that it was a debt. Was it a loan at the time, or was it a gift ? If it was a loan, then the plaintiffs would be entitled to a verdict, with interest from the first of April, 1882, to the present time. If it was an advancement, a gift by Sarah Boyer to her daughter, then your verdict will be in favor of the defendant.]5</p>

    <p id="b641-7" data-blocks='[["BL_641.9",641,[155,1895,1186,617]]]'>The instrument in suit is an absolute obligation of the defendant, to pay $850 to Sarah Boyer at one year after date with interest at five per cent. Sarah Boyer was the defendant’s mother-in-law. Interest was paid on the single bill for two years; once he offered to pay'the whole amount of the debt to Mrs. Boyer, and, at another time, he sent the amount in money by his son to pay it off. In the court below, the defendant was permitted to prove by the declarations of Mrs. Boyer that the money was given to the defendant’s wife as an advancement and was never intended to be repaid, except that the interest was to be paid whenever Mrs. Boyer desired and demanded it. Thus the whole character of the obligation</p>
    <p id="b642-3" data-blocks='[["BL_642.3",642,[680,369,358,35]],["BL_642.4",642,[267,429,1181,96]]]'>
      <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>Opinion of the Court, was allowed to be changed radically, by parol proof of declarations of the obligee.</p>
    <p id="b642-4" data-blocks='[["BL_642.5",642,[263,533,1189,1959]]]'>If these declarations had been made at the time the instrument was executed, they would have been brought within the decisions which hold that an apparent loan may be converted into an advancement, by proof of what was said and done at the time of the transaction. But there were no such acts or declarations given in evidence in this case. No proof whatever was introduced of what was said or took place when the single bill was signed. It was, however, affirmatively proved by the defendant’s chief witness, who brought the money from Mrs. Boyer and' left it with Mrs. Heydt, that the instrument was not signed then, and that, although he wrote the paper, he was not present when it was signed. It was not until three or four weeks after the money was left with Mrs. Heydt, that she told her son the note was signed, and that was the only means he had of knowing that it had been signed at all. It will be seen at once that if this absolute obligation is to be deprived of every particle of its obligatory force by means of parol testimony as to its meaning, it must be done in the entire absence of any proof whatever of what occurred at the time of its execution. There is no room for any allegation of fraud, mistake, imposition, or any breach of faith in using it. We are not aware of any decision of this, or any other court, which has permitted a solemn- contract in writing to be destroyed by parol proof of a different meaning in such circumstances as these. Our own cases are very numerous and very familiar in which we have refused to allow it. It seems, however, to be supposed that because it is a question of advancement a more lax doctrine is applicable, and that the parol proof may be given, no matter when the facts or declarations transpired. But we do not so understand the authorities. In Merkel’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/89/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="89 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1063259" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0340-01">89 Penn. St. 340</a>, we said: “ Advancement is a question of intent. That intent must be proven to have existed at the time of the transaction and by the contemporary acts and declarations of the parties. Verbal declarations of a parent that money for which he held a note or bond against a child was intended as an advancement, are insufficient to establish it as such. They must be shown to be a part of the <em>res </em>gestee, and accompany the acts done.”</p>
    <p id="b643-3" data-blocks='[["BL_643.4",643,[159,409,1188,1082]]]'>
      <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>The difficulty with the present case is that there is no proof of “ contemporary acts or declarations.” We do.not and cannot know what was said or done when the obligation in this case was signed. A previous purpose to give the money as an advancement may have been changed. The legal inference is that it was changed, because the obligation when executed is absolute, and that paper is the final expression of the intent of the parties. Against this final expression of the mutual intent of the parties, there is absolutely no testimony such as we can allow to prevail. For there being no evidence as to what was done or said when the obligation was executed, the subsequent declarations are incompetent. It is only when they comorm to acts and declarations which were contemporaneous, that they are admissible: Merkel’s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>Of just such proof we said in Rearick’s Exrs. v. Rearick, <a href="/pa/15/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="15 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="408782" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0066-01">15 Penn. St. 66</a>: “As to The subsequent declarations of the testator, it has already been intimated their competency is altogether dependent on the efficacy of the first conversations, as instruments of proof. The former are receivable only as corroborative of the latter and these being excluded there remains nothing upon which those can be supported.”</p>
    <p id="b643-4" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[160,1500,1187,924]]]'>So far as the subsequent acts are concerned the case is entirely against the defendant upon his own testimony. He paid interest on the bond for two years and offered to pay the principal on two different occasions, thus recognizing the obligation as a debt and not as an advancement. But the question here is, as to the efficacy of the parol proof to change the character of the contract; and we are clearly of opinion it was not sufficient without a radical departure from the entire current of our decisions. We are not willing to take such a step. Our constant experience warns us of the danger of transgressing the limits we have defined for the admission of parol testimony to change or destroy written instruments. We prefer to abide in the course indicated in all our recent decisions, believing it to be the path of safety and of wisdom. We are of opinion that the parol proof admitted in this case was incompetent and should have been rejected, and that the jury should have been instructed to return a verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>
