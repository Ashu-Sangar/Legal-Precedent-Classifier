This rule is recognized in Lewis’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Leg.%20Int.%20336" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 Leg. Int. 336">42 Leg. Int. 336</a>, and Spang v.

To give to Helena and her children $2,000 ás a substitute for one sixth of the whole estate, and to increase the shares of the rest to fifths cannot be allowed on so strict a construction as is contended for.. After so carefully disposing of his whole estate, we are loth to conclude that he intended to die intestate as to one sixth of his estate, and leave unsettled the question as to whom the same should be distributed, and under the rule of law we feel bound to conclude that the codicil can be made to have full effect upon Helena’s portion alone. It seems very fair to apply the language of the codicil to Helena’s life estate, and to no other part of the item D.

    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[282,473,1187,401]]]'>It has been decided in Reichard’s Appeal, No. 361, of this term, that so much of item D., paragraph eight, of the will under consideration, as relates to the provision therein made for testator’s daughter Helena, was revoked by the second codicil without in any manner interfering with tire residue of that item creating a trust in favor of such of her children as may be living at the time of her decease and'the issue of any deceased child or children, etc.</p>
    <p id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.6",278,[283,887,1185,654]]]'>According to express terms of the will, the net annual income of the trust is payable to the children only from and after the decease of their mother. Indeed, it is not payable sooner for the further reason that the beneficiaries of the trust cannot be ascertained until that event occurs. The children now living may not survive their mother, and in that contingency they will never become beneficiaries. Their interest is therefore contingent and not vested, and the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court was right in so holding. As to the income from the one sixth, accruing during the lifetime of Mrs. Swoyer, her father died intestate, and hence it is distributable among his heirs under the intestate law. The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>
