On the 1st April, 1886, this suit was brought to recover two years royalty with the interest thereon.

The subject of sale, it is true, is the exclusive right to mine the iron ore, but for that right the lessors were to be compensated according to the number of tons of “ clean and merchantable iron ore ” mined; the lessees undertaking to mine fifteen hundred tons annually, “ or in default thereof ” to pay $525 royalty. And how could the lessees be <em>in default </em>in mining fifteen hundred tons annually, if there was no ore to mine? <em>We </em>are not to construe the contract to require the lessees to perform an impossible thing. The $525 is not a penaltj1-, it is the price of the ore. The grant was of the ore in place, and, if the subject matter of the contract fail, the price is not payable. If there was no ore to mine, there could be no royalty to pay. As well might the vender of meat which proved to be putrid, or of a cargo of corn which had no existence, enforce collection from his vendee. We think the manifest meaning or intention of the parties, as exhibited by the terms of the contract, was that fifteen hundred tons “ of clean and merchantable iron ore ” were to be mined in each year, if that quality and quantity of ore were there found, and that the contract by necessary implication must be so construed.</p>

In that case, Scott granted to the company “ the exclusive right to dig and take away the iron ore in a certain tract of land, the company covenanting to pay at the rate of fifty cents per ton of ore mined,” etc.; and, further, that for any period of three years, after the first year, the rent, in the aggregate, should not be less than $10,000 whether ore to that extent was mined or not. At the end of four years, Scott brought suit and recovered a judgment for $10,000, rent accrued in the three preceding years, and, at the expiration of three years more, brought a second suit to recover $10,000, the alleged minimum rent for that term, and it was held competent for the company to prove, by way of defence, that the ore contained in the leased premises was insufficient in quantity to produce the amount of rent or royalty claimed by the plaintiff.</p>

R., 4 Ch. Div. 448, the lease was of a vein or seam of coal, with the overlying and underlying beds of clay, under a farm called Llwyndu, at £100 per annum “on a certain or dead rent,” and royalties of 9d. per ton for the coal, and 4d. for the clay, the coal being necessary for working the clay with advantage. It was held that it was in consideration of the dead rent reserved the lessees obtained license to enter and search for the vein, and that the lessors were therefore entitled to an order for the payment of the dead rent.</p>

(W., H. &amp; G.) 647, the covenant was to pay £40 for every statute acre of coal which should be found within certain premises, and, until the said price or consideration should be fully paid, to pay £40 per annum whether the whole of an acre of the said coal should in any such year be gotten or not. The sole question, under the pleadings, was whether the finding of the coal was a condition precedent to the plaintiff recovering the annual sum of £40; and it was decided that it was not, as the defendant was the proper party to find and "ascertain the quantity of the <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>coal. In Jervis v. Thompson, 1 Exch. (H. &amp; N.) 195, the lessees entered into the covenant knowing the exact state of the mine, and, with that in view, covenanted positively and absolutely to get the quantity of 2000 tons of salt in every year, or pay for the deficiency at the end of it, and therefore, whether they could be got easily or with difficulty, or even whether they existed at all, was held to be immaterial in the case of an absolute and unqualified covenant.</p>

Thompson, 13 M. &amp; W. 486, the plain intentions of the parties, as manifested on the face of the contract, was that the rent stipulated should be paid whether there was coal or not; there was an express provision in the alternative to pay the rent.
