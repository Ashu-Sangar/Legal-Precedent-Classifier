L. 283, which was passed for the purpose of carrying into effect the 8th section of article XVI. of the Constitution, gives an appeal to either party “ in all cases of damages assessed against any municipal or other corporations, or individuals invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use, for property taken, injured or destroyed by the construction or enlargement of their works, highways, or improvements.” Judge Edwell has held in a carefully considered opinion that the foregoing section does not apply to proceedings for the opening of township roads, and has assigned two reasons for his conclusion: first, because a county is not a municipal or other corporation within the meaning of the Constitution and the act under consideration ; second, because it is not invested with the privilege of taking' private property for public use for highways: Freeze <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>v. Col. Co., 6 W. N. 145. The arguments adduced by the learned judge to sustain these propositions cannot be easily answered, nevertheless the current of opinion seems to bé in the direction of a more liberal construction of the statute than his first proposition would permit. Being a remedial statute it is entitled to such construction; at all events, the following conclusions would seem to be warranted by the later decisions: First, an appeal' lies where, in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, land is taken for the use of a municipal corporation, notwithstanding the proceedings for its appropriation were neither instituted by its authority nor under its control: Bachler’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/90/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="90 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="1065594" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0207-01">90 Penn. St. 207</a>; Robinson v. S. Chester, 2 Ch. Co. R. 441; <em>In re </em>Frankford, etc., Turnpike, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Leg.%20Int.%2046" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="42 Leg. Int. 46">42 Leg. Int. 46</a>; and see Hendricks’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/103/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="103 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="449165" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0358-01">103 Penn. St. 358</a>. Second, the fact, that in such a case the damages are assessed .against a county, and that a county is not, strictly speaking, .a municipal corporation, is not in itself conclusive against the right of appeal: Bachler’s Appeal, <em><a href="/pa/103/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="103 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="449165" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0358-01">supra.</a> </em>If the case turned upon that point we would also be inclined to hold that, wherever a county is invested with the privilege, and in the exercise thereof takes private property for public use, the act applies: Brower v. Chester County, 1 Pa. C. C. R. 1. But assuming, as is declared in Bachler’s Appeal, <em><a href="/pa/103/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="103 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="449165" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0358-01">supra,</a> </em>that Section 8, article XYI. of the Constitution secures an appeal and a trial by jury for damages, wherever private property is taken by a municipal corporation for public use, and the act of June 13,1874, furnishes the remedy thus secured to owners, where the sufficient provision for trial by jury already existed; ” and still it does not follow that an appeal lies in the present case. If the act contemplates a county at all, it is as a body corporate and not as a geographical division of the state. But as a body corporate a county is not in any sense of the terms “ invested with the privilege- of taking private property for public use ” for highways. It cannot institute nor defeat the proceedings for that purpose; it cannot open the road after it has been decreed; and after it is opened it has neither ownership in nor control over it. In this respect its power differs materially from that of a borough or city. How, then, can it be said that the damages assessed against the county are for property taken, injured or destroyed by the construction of its <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>highway? And if this cannot be said, the subject matter of the appeal comes neither within the letter nor spirit of the act. For, assuming that the act was intended to give an appeal and trial by jury to every person who has a constitutional right to claim compensation for property taken for public use, it must be remembered that the appellant does not come within that class. The six per cent, allowance for roads embraced in all the original grants from the proprietaries and the commonwealth makes his claim for compensation a matter of grace on the part of the legislature, and not of constitutional right: McClenachan v. Curwen, <a href="/binn/6/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 Binn. 509" data-case-ids="1795153" data-case-paths="/binn/6/0509-01">6 Binn. 509</a>; Plank Road Co. v.

We cannot better sum up the case than in the forcible language of Judge Elwell: “From the commencement of proceedings to lay out a public road to its being finally confirmed and opened for use, and from'thence through all time, a county has nothing whatever to do with it, except to pay damages and expenses in compliance with a general law of the state. The taking is by the state by right of eminent domain, in the manner provided by its laws, through the agency of the judiciary. It has always been the policy of the state to make provisions for necessary highways for all its citizens; and to that'end, in grants of its lands there was added six per cent, for roads, and the courts of the state were clothed with authority to appoint viewers and to establish roads. This may be done without the consent or even against the protest of the county officials. They are invested with no power, authority, or privilege pertaining to the matter: ” Freeze v. Columbia Co., 6 W. N. 45.</p>
