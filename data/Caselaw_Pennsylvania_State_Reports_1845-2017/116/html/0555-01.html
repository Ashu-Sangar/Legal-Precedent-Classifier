The supplementary charter of 1864 is a definite, specific grant of powers and privileges to a private corporation — a private statute. The act of May 14, 1874, P. L. 158, which <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>it is claimed repeals a portion of this private act, is a general statute purporting to regulate the whole question of exemption from taxation under the constitution of 1874. It is a principle in the construction of statutes that a general act is never to be construed as repealing a particular one by implication; <em>“generalia speeialibus non </em>derogant: Max. Int. Stat., 157; Brown v. Commissioners, <a href="/pa/21/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="21 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="411527" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0037-01">21 Penn.

Nor can it be said that it is only by a construction necessarily creating a repeal of all prior exempting laws, that due effect can be given to the provisions of the act of 1874; for the constitution, leaving exempted cases as they were before the act of 1874, had in contemplation merely those cases where no exemption already existed. Its purpose was simply to exempt, and not in effect to impose taxation where none then existed: Coatesville Gas Co. v. Chester County, <a href="/pa/97/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="97 Pa. 476" data-case-ids="444804" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0476-01">97 Penn. St. 476</a>.</p>

Unless the power to do so was derived from the constitutional amendment of 1857, it was impossible for the legislature to revoke or repeal an existing exemption without violation of the inhibition as to the obligation of contracts. That amendment provided power in the legislature to alter, revoke and annul any charter of incorporation, whenever in their opinion “it may be injurious to the citizens of the commonwealth; in such manner, however, that no injustice shall be done to the corporators.” Now, the constitution of 1874 providing that “institutions of purely public charity” may have unlimited exemption, how can it be inferred from a general act like that of 1874, that the legislature considered the exemption of this particular and most excellent charity to be “ injurious to the citizens of the commonwealth?”</p>
    <p id="b593-6" data-blocks='[["BL_593.6",593,[125,1977,1186,509]]]'>3. The court below, holding that Article ix., § 1, of the present constitution operates as a repeal of the previously existing exemption, is not in accord with this court. The provisions of the constitution do not execute themselves, but were simply mandatory to the legislature to enact laws to carry them into effect: Hays v.

The word “endowments ” seems to have here no precise or technical meaning.

It is alleged there is such a law and we are referred to the eleventh section of an act approved March 80, 1864, entitled, a supplement to an act to incorporate the Wagner Free Institute of Science, approved the ninth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five. The portion of the section in question which it is claimed exempts this property from taxation, is in these words: “That the cabinet collections and lot of ground on which it is erected belonging to the said institution, with any gifts, bequests or endowments, so long as the same shall be used for free lectures, shall be exempt from taxation.” The cabinet collection and lot of ground on which it is erected are no part of the premises as to which the present question arises. The fifth section of the original charter of 1855, exempted the cabinet collection and lot of ground on which it is erected, but nothing more, and it is now claimed that the exemption demanded is conferred by the words “ gifts, bequests or endowments,” contained in the eleventh section of the supplemental act of 1864. All of the property in question in the present case was conveyed by several deeds by William Wagner and wife in 1864 and 1873 to the appellant, and hence was not owned by the appellant at the time of the passage of the original charter or the supplement.</p>

It certainlyls not a “ bequest,” as the title was derived by deed and not by will Nor can we regard it as a “ gift,” within the manifest meaning of the act. Gifts, in their ordinary legal sense, are donations of chattels, and the same meaning attaches to them in the common popular sense also. A gratuitous conveyance of the title to a piece of real estate is in a very large sense a gift, but it is not so designated in the popular, or in the legal thought or expression, and we would not feel at liberty to <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>depart from the ordinary meaning of the word in construing a statute exempting property from taxation. Nor is the word “endowment,” any more apt to describe such property as. this. Endowment is defined by Worcester as “ property or pecuniary means bestowed as a permanent fund; as the endowments of a college, a hospital or a library.” It is certainly understood in common acceptation as a fund yielding income for the support of an institution. In its collocation in the act in question we think it very clear that the legislative intent was to indicate “ gifts, bequests or endowments ” belonging to the appellant, in connection with the cabinet collection and lot of ground on which it is erected, and for the maintenance of free lectures therein. In the sixth section of the same act the word “ endowments” is certaintly used in such a connection. The corporation is there authorized to accept a deed “ and to hold the premises and property therein mentioned, including all endowments at any time to be made to the said corporation,” etc. And in the fifth section all three of the words, “ endowment, gift or bequest,” are manifestly used in this sense. The words ■of this section are: “ Should these buildings described in this ¡section not be erected in the lifetime of the party of the first part by him and under his direction, the board of trustees, as in their opinion the funds which shall from time to time be at their disposal, will warrant such an expenditure, or by endowment, gift or bequest made for the above purpose, shall proceed to erect the laboratory,” etc. Here “ funds ” which may be derived by endowment, gift or bequest, are authorized to be used for the construction of buildings. We cannot doubt that this was the sense in which the legislature used these words, and that being so we do not feel that we can enlarge this legislative meaning beyond its proper scope. We are, therefore, of opinion that the real estate in question is not exempt from taxation, and this view renders unnecessary the discussion of the other questions considered in the paper books and arguments of counsel.</p>
