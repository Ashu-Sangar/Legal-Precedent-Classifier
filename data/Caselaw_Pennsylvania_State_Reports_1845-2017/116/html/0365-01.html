Rothers employed Adam Kommiskey as a laborer at the rate of two dollars and twelve cents per day or shift. When the contract was ended Rothers went to the paymaster’s office and drew from the company the money due him less his store account. Kommiskey had worked for a miner who had a contract with the same company prior to March, 1885, and had <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>been paid by the company by direction of the miner out of the earnings of the miner’s contract.

It seems that the plaintiff went to work for the defendant in March, 1885, that he worked eight shifts, as they are called-, at #2.12 per shift, loaded 48 ears, and that although he has frequently demanded Ms pay from the defendant for this work, he has not yet received it. It seems also, from the testimony of the plaintiff, that he had worked for the company for about a year, and that previous to tMs particular work he had been paid for his labor <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>in the mines by Mr. Lance, who acted as paymaster and who kept a store there, where the accounts were also kept.

    <p class="summary" id="b399-3" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[159,722,1189,821]]]'>[This case raises a question of some importance in this mining region, which has not been definitely settled, so far as I know, by any decision of the Supreme Court. The question is one of law, and therefore it is the duty of the court to give the jury definite instructions in regard to their views of it. Hence, we say to you, that while it is true that a party is only liable to a contractor for the price of a contract piece of work, and is not responsible to other men employed under the contractor as sub-workmen, nevertheless, in a country devoted to mining, and where the custom is for miners to employ their laborers, and where also it is the custom that the company or operator shall settle not only with the miner but also with the laborer, that in such a case the custom makes the law, and the company or the employer may be liable to the laborer for his earnings, although they have made a contract with the miner to do a certain amount of work in the mines at a certain price.</p>

He states, furthermore, that the mining has been done at that mine through the medium of laborers and miners, as is generally the case in this region. He also states that it has not been the custom at this mine for the miner to draw his laborer’s pay. This is qualified to some extent by his cross-examination, but the fact remains that it has not been the custom at this mine, heretofore, for the miner to draw the laborer’s pay, without some order or direction to the contrary by the laborer-; and we say to you that, in our opinion, the law is this: That where a coal company emploj^s or contracts with a miner, and the miner employs the laborer, and keeps his time, and returns it to the employer; and where, furthermore, it has been the custom of the employer to pay the laborer according to this return, that in case any change <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>of practice is made at that particular mine in this regard, it is the duty of the company or employer to notify the laborer of that change, or else the company or employer will still be liable to pay the laborer for his work. Therefore we say to you that, in our judgment, in this particular case, it having been shown that for some months previous to the time in question, this laborer had been paid by the ■ company upon returns of time made by the miner, and that the company had given no notice to him of any change in their practice in this regard, if you are satisfied that his claim is not denied, is correctly stated as to the amount of work done, and the price, then having received no notice of this change of practice, he would be entitled to your verdict against this company for the amount remaining due him for his services. We state this distinctly as our opinion, so that it may be fully understood, and we be corrected in our law if we are reviewed by a higher tribunal, to which this case will probably be taken.</p>

Kommiskey was hired by Bothers as a laborer to assist him in the work, at the rate of $2.12 per shift. <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>He does not pretend to have been in the direct service of the company; he admits that he was employed by Rothers, and having entered into contractual relations with Rothers for the work, no promise would ordinarily be implied on the part of the company to pay the price.</p>

The “turning in” of the laborers’ time by the miner was in legal effect an order on the company to pay the amount; and the company, recognizing this form of settlement between the miner and his men, paid the men as if they had been in the company’s service.</p>

If the company had adopted and followed a general rule or regulation to this effect, upon which laborers relied for payment of the price of their labor, it would, perhaps, be bound at least to the extent of the balance in its hands without any formal acceptance of liability; but that obligation could only exist when the laborers’ time had in fact been turned in before the miners’ account had been fully drawn.</p>
