The witness, Solomon Wilde, is not made competent by that act, and therefore the question is one to be determined under the law as it stood prior to that statute. He was not a party to the suit, and Elizabeth Psotta, the decedent, was not an assignor of the thing or contract in action, as the sheriff’s deed vested the title in the executors of her estate. Is he excluded from being a witness on the ground of interest or policy of law by reason of his being the warrantor of the title of the premises sold by him to Isaiah S. Barbour? Prior to the act of 1869, after the execution of the release by or through him to Barbour, his grantee, he would have no interest in the result and would have been clearly competent; and the act has not rendered any witness incompetent who was not so before its passage.</p>

As the release of the lien of the mortgage by Browning to Wilde, dated 13th July, 1874, had not been recorded, the defendants, in order to establish notice to Elizabeth Psotta of the execution and delivery at the time the mortgage was assigned to her, produced as a witness, Solomon Wilde, by whom the premises had been conveyed to Barbour, and offered to prove by him, as follows: “ That the said C. A. Max Wiehle, one of the executors and plaintiffs in said suit and now present in court, was, during the lifetime of Elizabeth Psotta, now deceased, her <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>agent or attorney, and was, in point of fact, such agent or attorney, on or about the eighth day of July, 1878, when the assignment of said mortgage was made to her by Joseph Wilde; and that the witness then notified the said C. A. Max Wiehle, the then attorney or agent of said Elizabeth Psotta, deceased, of the execution of the said release of a portion of the premises described in the writ of ejectment from Edward Browning to Solomon Wilde, dated the thirteenth day of July, 1874; and that the defendant, the said Isaiah S. Barbour, was the owner of that portion by deed from him, the said Solomon Wilde, dated January 1, 1874, and recorded on December <em>16, </em>1874, in Deed Book F. T. W., No. 171, page 247.” Objection having been made, the offer was overruled, and this action of the courtis the error assigned.</p>
    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[169,1135,1192,718]]]'>When Wilde delivered the deed of January, 1874, to Barbour, the mortgage was an actual incumbrance upon the property, for which Wilde was responsible on the covenant implied in the deed. The release was not executed until 13th July, following; it was a release to Wilde, had been delivered to him, and he had passed it into the possession of Barbour; but for the genuineness, efficiency and validity of that release, Wilde was responsible to Barbour. It was the only protection he had against his covenant. He was therefore interested in the suit; andas the suit involved the right of Elizabeth Psotta, with which she was invested in her lifetime, and was by the executors of her last will, <em>qua </em>executors, he was plainly within the proviso of the act of 1869, and incompetent to testify as to any matter occurring in her lifetime.</p>
    <p id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.6",347,[166,1861,1191,459]]]'>If Barbour had formally released Wilde from liability on his covenant, before or at the time he was called to testify, he might perhaps have been competent for the purpose for which he was offered; but this was not done, and, in this respect, the case differs from Warren v. Steer, <a href="/pa/112/0634-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="112 Pa. 634" data-case-ids="546522" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0634-01">112 Penn. St. 634</a>. In that case, the witness, Henry Davis, was released from all responsibility on his covenant before he was called, and as he was not a party to the suit and was divested of all interest in the result, he was held to be competent.</p>

It did not contain any offer to show that Wiehle was the agent or attorney of Elizabeth Psotta in the transfer of the mortgage, or that he gained the information while engaged in the matter of his employment; and this, by all the cases, is essential to bind the principal: Bracken v.
