On December 19, 1882, upon a transcript from the justice’s docket, judgment was entered in the Court of Common Pleas. On September 10, 1885, a certificate from the justice of the issuance of an execution and its return “ <em>nulla bona </em>” was filed and an execution against the husband was issued to the sheriff and by him returned “ <em>nulla bona." </em>Then, upon an alias fi. fa. against both defendants, the real estate of the wife was levied upon and condemned and a <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued to sell the same. Thereupon Mary Ann Xander, the wife, filed her petition, setting out (1) That at the time the goods were purchased, suit brought and judgment entered, she was a married woman, the wife, of Dallas Xander, who has since died leaving no real estate; (2), That the debts on which the judgment was obtained had not been contracted by herself nor by any one authorized by her; (3), That the articles in the account were not necessaries for the support of herself and family, nor for the improvement and on the credit of her separate estate; (4), That the judgment did not show that said debts were contracted by her or by her authority, nor that the same were necessaries, etc., nor that the articles were furnished upon her separate credit; praying that her name be stricken from the record of said judgment, and for' a rule to open.

It does not appear that such necessaries were furnished upon the wife’s separate credit.

We held the case of Balliet v. Andrews and wife, No. 93, January Term, 1882, that we had the power, and made the rule to strike off the judgment absolute. Other Courts had held differently, but did what was substantially equivalent by staying execution indefinitely: Buffington v. Hay, 1 Pears. 90. Since the Act of 1885, P. L. 160, it has been held that under the Act the Court has power to strike <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>off such judgment: Collins v. Brower, C. P., No. 2, Phila., 1 Pa. C. C. R. 261; Campbell v. Evler, C. P., Dauphin County, Idem 394. If we were in error in ruling as we did in Balliet v. Andrews, we think now, since the Act of 1885, there can be no question as to our power to strike off the judgment. We do not however propose to do so, but will simply make an order staying execution against the wife. From such order a writ of error lies to the Supreme Court: Patterson v.

    <p id="b77-10" data-blocks='[["BL_77.11",77,[130,1724,1188,344]]]'>It has been repeatedly decided that both the pleadings and the evidence must show a case of the wife’s liability under the statute. The record must set out a debt contracted by the wife and that it was incurred for articles necessary for the support of her family. But it is not requisite that the evidence adduced to establish the claim shall be entered on the record.</p>
    <p id="b77-11" data-blocks='[["BL_77.12",77,[131,2083,1189,356]],["BL_78.1",78,[271,373,1188,602]]]'>The transcript of the justice sets forth that the plaintiff claimed “ $226.99 book account for necessaries furnished to the wife and at her request and direction, for the use of herself and family, and for the improvement of her separate estate.” This claim was admitted by the husband; and the wife admitted it, except that she denied having bought the necessaries herself. Upon the evidence judgment was rendered against <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>both. The claim is set out substantially in the words of the statute — fox necessaries furnished to the wife, at her request, for the use of herself and family. If it be that some of the goods were for improvement of her estate, and that the record is defective for such claim, the judgment is not void. In that case, if aggrieved, the wife’s remedy was by appeal. Where a good cause of action is set out against the husband and wife, and judgment is rendered for a larger sum than the wife is liable for, it will not be summarily struck off, or its collection enjoined. A case may arise where the wife would be entitled to equitable relief, but no facts appear for such relief in favor of the defendant.</p>

But no case was cited on the part of the defendant where it was ruled that it is necessary to insert the words “ on the wife’s separate credit” in the pleadings, and we are advised of no such decision.

Clark, the declaration showed that the action was founded on an alleged joint contract of the husband and wife, and therefore it was held that the wife was not liable. In speaking of what is essential, it was remarked, “ The pleadings must set out a debt contracted by the wife, and that it was incurred for articles necessary for the support of the family of the husband and wife.” Sawtelle’s Appeal was from a decree of the Orphans’ Court, and no question of pleading existed; but it was enunciated that “ The Act enables the wife to bind her separate estate for necessaries obtained for herself and family, but the very essence of the liability is that they are furnished at her request and on her credit.” Nor was there any question whether the claim was properly set out in the pleadings in Hoff v. Koerper, where it was ruled that the testimony “ was clearly insufficient to sustain the essential aver<a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>ments of the declaration that the alleged indebtedness was contracted by the wife and incurred for articles necessary for the support and maintenance of the family.”</p>
