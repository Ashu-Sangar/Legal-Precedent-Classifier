Duraind was the owner in fee of a lot of ground and messuage, situate at the northeast corner of Twelfth street and Sheaf’s alley, in the city of Philadelphia. In the <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>early part of August, 1879, she called upon Henry McMiller, Esq., a member of the bar, who for a number of years had been her counsel, and requested him to draw a deed for the above mentioned premises, conveying the same to Louisa Duraind, in trust for her six children, they being the children of James Duraind, a deceased brother of the said Marie F. Duraind, and in said deed reserving to the said Marie F. Duraind the “legal right to collect the rents, issues and profits of the said property for her own use during life, and at her decease the said property to be held for said children by said trustee during minority, and when they arrive at full age the fee simple to vest in them absolutely as tenants in common.” Mr. McMiller, in pursuance of the instructions so given him, prepared the deed, and upon the eighth day of August, 1879, handed it to the said Marie F. Duraind, who, upon the same day, went before a notary and acknowledged the deed. The consideration named in the deed was the sum of §10,500, but there was no allegation on the part of the plaintiff that the consideration had been paid, and the receipt upon the deed was unsigned. Mr. McMiller also testified under objection, that the grantor stated to him that her object in making the deed was that, in case of her death, “ she wished all of her property to go to the children of her deceased brother James;” and, further, “that Josephine Duraind, her sister, had treated her badly, and she was determined that she should have none of her property if she died prior to Josephine.” After the grantor acknowledged the deed, she retained possession of it until the time of her death, which occurred on the thirty-first day of January, 1884, whilst on her return to Philadelphia from the South where she had been sojourning. The “ deed ” was found in her trunk at the Pennsylvania Railroad station at Broad and Market streets, Philadelphia. It is admitted by counsel for plaintiff that there was no actual manual delivery of the deed for the premises. Louisa Duraind, the trustee, and her children were, at the time of the acknowledgment of the deed, residing in the city of San Francisco, California, and have since continued to reside there, and it does not appear from the testimony that any of the parties interested in the deed had any knowledge of its existence until after the decease of the said Marie F. <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>Duraind, tbe grantor, when it was found in her trunk as before mentioned. It appears from the testimony that, at the time the deed in question was prepared by Mr. McMiller, another deed was drawn by him between the same parties and upon the same trusts, and in pursuance of instructions from the said Marie F. Duraind; this last mentioned deed was for a property at Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, and was executed and acknowledged by the grantor before the same notary, on the same day and in the same maimer as the deed in question. This deed also appears to have been retained in the possession of the grantor, and was found in her trunk when it was opened as before mentioned. This deed, when found, was torn in half, and in this 'mutilated condition was produced before me. It was further shown by the testimony that, after the execution and acknowledgment of the deed above mentioned for the property at Jenkintown by the said Marie F. Duraind, she sold and conveyed the said property, in her own right as her own property, and received the consideration therefor, and the proceeds of said sale are now deposited in her own name in a savings institution in Philadelphia.</p>

The testimony of the notary, before -whom the acknowledgment was taken, was that the grantor came before him and simply acknowledged the deed, and there was no evidence to show that the grantor had at any time parted with the custody and possession of the deed. The fact that the grantor sold the Jenkintown property, after having made and acknowledged the deed for the same to the plaintiff, shows very conclusively that the grantor did not intend the acknowledgment of the deed in question to operate as a delivery.</p>

Critchfield, <a href="/pa/24/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="24 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="9503355" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0100-01">24 Penn. St. 100</a>. In that case a father executed a deed for land to his son, but retained the deed in his possession until his death. The son had no knowledge of the deed, which had not been' recorded until it was found among his father’s papers. Notwithstanding evidence that the father had said to a stranger that he had given the land to his son, that he would keep the title during his life, but that the son would get the land after his death, it was held that the intention of the grantor that the deed should be delivered after his death was insufficient, and no title passed. It was urged upon the argument of the case before us that, as the grantor had reserved an interest, she had a motive for retaining the deed, and that its retention by her was not inconsistent with the belief that she regarded <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>it as a completed instrument, and Scrugham v. Wood, <a href="/wend/15/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="15 Wend. 575" data-case-ids="2018795" data-case-paths="/wend/15/0575-01">15 Wend. 575</a>, and Louverbye v.

Ch. 240</a>, were cited in support of this view. The facts in Serugham v. Wood are very similar to those of the case under consideration except that the deed was acknowledged by the trustee and recorded. A father in that case conveyed his property in trust for the benefit of his children, he to possess and enjoy the premises during life to enable him to apply the proceeds, to their support and education. The deed was signed by the grantor and the trustees, acknowledged by all the parties, recorded and after his death found among his papers. It was held to be valid. In Louverbye v. Arden, it was held by the Court that “a voluntary settlement fairly made is always binding in equity upon the grantor unless there be clear and decisive proof that he never parted or intended to part with the possession of the deed, and, if he retain it, there must be other circumstances besides the mere fact of his retaining it to show that it was not intended to be absolute.” In this case the fact of the conveyance had been, at the time it was made, communicated to all the parties in interest, and the deed delivered to the trustee. It afterwards came into the possession of the grantor, and the attempt was to defeat the deed by proof of a subsequent condition. In Garnons v. Knight, 5 B. &amp; C. 671, a leading case upon the subject, in which there is a full discussion of the authorities referred to in the preceding cases, a conveyance was made by an attorney to secure an indebtedness to his client for money misapplied. The misapplication of the money and a promise to secure him were communicated to the grantee. The deed was handed by the grantor to his sister to hold for the grantee. Upon the trial the distinct question was whether the delivery to the third party was a good delivery, and the jury were instructed that, if the delivery was a parting with the possession and the power and control over the deed for the benefit of the grantee in order that it might be delivered to him in the grantor's lifetime or after his death, the delivery was good ; but, if delivered for safe-keeping for the grantor, to be subject to his future control and disposition, it was not a good delivery. On this instruction the jury found the delivery good, and, upon the argument of a motion for a new trial, the correctness <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>of the instruction, as well us the sufficiency of the evidence to justify such a finding, was raised.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b130-4" data-blocks='[["BL_130.5",130,[272,497,1183,869]]]'>The Court held the instruction to be correct, and that the evidence justified the finding of the jury. The further question was considered, “whether where a deed is duly signed and sealed, and formally delivered with apt words of delivery, but is retained by the party executing it, that retention will obstruct the operation of the deed;” and it was said, “where an instrument is formally sealed and delivered, and there is nothing to qualify the delivery except the keeping of the deed in the hands of the executing party, and nothing to show that he did not intend it to operate immediately, it is a valid and effectual deed ; delivery to the party who is to take under it, or to any other person for his use, is not essential.” In all of the cases cited in support of this opinion, Broughton v. Broughton, 1 Atk. 625; Clavering v. Clavering, 2 Vern. 473; Naldred v. Gilham, 1 P. Wms. 578, and Lloyd v. Barnett, 8 C. &amp; P. 124, there had either been an actual delivery to a third party, or a formal delivery of the deed.</p>

The signing and acknowledgment of a deed cannot be said to have this effect. They are preparatory to a conveyance, and indicate only an intention. This intention, where the act is voluntary, the grantor is always free to change until the decidiiig and determining act is performed. In the case before us, the grantor did change her mind as to •one of the properties, having destroyed the deed and conveyed ■it to another party for a valuable consideration; and, as to the <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>remaining property, there is only evidence by the deed, and by her language to her attorney, that she at one time contemplated a conveyance to the complainants, but the fact remains that she never carried this intention into effect. If the deed in this case is imperfect by reason of a want of delivery, the complainants cannot obtain relief in a court of equity. Equity will not aid an imperfect voluntary conveyance,- even when by accident the deed was not delivered: Clavering v. Clavering, 2 Vern. 473. No imperfect conveyance, which is also merely voluntary, will be aided or enforced in equity: Bispham’s Equity, 101, and cases there cited.—</p>

Critchfield, <a href="/pa/24/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="24 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="9503355" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0100-01">24 Penn. St. 100</a>, is distinguished. In that ease the decision is entirely based upon the disputed facts as found by the jury, which negative the idea or intention of delivery on the part of the grantor. The deed had a paper around it on which was marked, “ Will ”; there was testimony that the father exercised rights of ownership over the farm and called it his till his death ; he had said he would keep the title during his life, and that Jesse would get it after his death; the jury found as a fact that there was intention not to deliver. All the facts in the present case show not only the solemn declaration of delivery, but constitute uncontradicted evidence of intention of delivery, which, under the decisions, is constructive delivery; and the mere retention of the deed is not inconsistent therewith.</p>
