The defendant’s contention is, first, that the money is not subject to seizure in any form of legal procedure; and, second, that if it is liable to be taken in execution for the defendant’s debts in any form, it is not subject to seizure on an attachment-execution. The answer of the garnishee is to the same effect, and the questions for con<a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>sideration here are raised upon a rule against the garnishee on his answer and upon a demurrer to the defendant’s plea.</p>

Section 4747 of the Revised Statutes of the United States provides as follows: “ No sum of money due, or to become due, to any pensioner, shall be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure, by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, whether the same remains with the pension office, or any officer or agent thereof, but shall inure wholly to the benefit of such pensioner.” The money which is exempted from legal seizure, under this section, it will be observed is particularly designated; it is “ any sum of money due or to become due to any pensioner.” This refers, of course, to money due or becoming due from the pension department; it is not pretended that the language of the statute can have any wider application than this. The further provision is, that such money shall not be liable to levy or seizure, under any process in law or equity, “ whether it remains with the pension office, or any officer or agent thereof.” It is very plain that the $800 in the hands of Tillinghast is not “ money due or to' become due ” from the pension department; nor is it money which “ remains in the pension office, or in the hands of any officer or agent thereof.” It is money which sometime previous to the attachment had been paid to, the pensioner, and which when paid to him “ inured wholly to his benefit ” ; it was his money, he could dispose of it as he pleased. The exemption provided by the statute, upon any fair and reasonable construction, will only protect the fund whilst in course of transmission to the pensioner ; after that, it is liable to seizure as other money. Some analogy was intended, we think, to the rule of law which prevails as to the fees and salaries of public officers, which as long as thejr maintain their distinctive character have always been held not liable to be taken by creditors under any form of process, by levy, sale, attachment, or sequestration: Davis v.

Chief Justice Petees, of the Supreme Judicial Court, in passing upon this point, says: “ The question is, whether this provision furnishes any protection to, or exemption of, the money, after it comes into the pensioner’s hands. A careful examination inclines us to the conclusion that it does not.

Stocks in incorporated companies held by him, it is true, were made liable to seizure and sale under the act of 29th March, 1819. With this exception, however, the general pro<a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>vision of the law was as stated. By the 22 section of the act of 1836, however, it is provided, that in addition to stocks owned by the defendant in any body corporate, “ deposits of money, belonging to him, in any bank or with any person or body corporate or politic, and debts due to him shall be liable, like other goods and chattels, subject to all lawful claims, etc.”; and, by the 23 section, “ goods or chattels pawned or pledged by the defendant, as security for any debt or liability, or which have been demised, or in any manner delivered or bailed for a term,” are declared to be “ liable to <em>sale </em>upon execution, as aforesaid, subject nevertheless,” etc. The 35th section of the same act provides, however, that in the case of a debt due to the defendant, or of a deposit of money made by him, or of goods and chattels pawned, pledged or demised, as aforesaid, the same may be attached and levied, in satisfaction of the judgment, in the manner allowed in the case of a foreign attachment; in which case, the writ shall contain a clause of <em>scire facias </em>to the garnishee, etc. See Wray v. Tammany, <a href="/pa/13/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="13 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="964982" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0394-01">13 Penn. St. 394</a>; Gochenaur v.

N. 503.</p>

Penrose, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20Pa.%20239" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="36 Pa. 239">36 Penn. St. 239</a>, prescribes that the manner of levying and seizing all such credits and choses in action shall be like that allowed in foreign attachment.</p>

      <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>It may be conceded, perhaps, that if the money which Rozelle deposited with Tillinghast had been in the view of the sheriff, and within his power, he might upon a <em>fieri facias </em>have taken of it to the amount of his writ; but the money it must be conceded was a deposit with Tillinghast, and even if liable to levy upon a <em>fi. fa. </em>it was also liable to an attachment in execution in his hands. In disposing of the rule and the demurrer, we must of course assume the truth of the facts which the defendant and the garnishee have set forth in the plea and answer respectively, but we are not bound to accept their legal conclusions. A deposit, properly so called, is a naked bailment, and exists where one of the contracting parties gives something to the other to keep, who is to do so gratuitously and obliges himself to return it <em>in individuo </em>when he shall be requested. When one deposits money with another for safe keeping, the latter to return, not the specific money, but an equal sum, the transaction is also called a deposit, but it is an irregular deposit: Bouv. 511. Now, the transaction between Rozelle and Tillinghast was undoubtedly a deposit of money, plain and simple ; the money was left with Tillinghast for safe keeping, to be returned, not in money of like amount, but “in the identical money deposited,” and it is of no consequence that the garnishee in his answer, and the defendant in his plea, deny that it was a deposit, as by the admitted facts it was plainly nothing else.</p>
