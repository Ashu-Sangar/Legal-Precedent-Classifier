      <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>The court, W. W. Schuyler, P. J., charged the jury as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b650-4" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[267,499,1186,1180]]]'>This, is an issue to try the validity of three papers purporting to be respectively the last will and testament and the codicils thereto of the late Andrew Herster, deceased. Mr. Herster died May 27, 1882, leaving behind him a large estate in farms, houses, and lots, personal property and money, estimated to be worth $200 000. He also left to survive him four sons and two daughters, all of whom at the time of their father’s death were well advanced in years, having families of their own. So far as the evidence discloses, these children, with perhaps one exception, were respectable and well behaved members of the community in which they lived, and still are such. By his will and codicils Mr. Herster, instead of dividing his.estate equally among his children, gives almost the entire bulk of it to one of his sons, Andrew Jackson Herster; the portions given to the other children, with the exception of Henry, amounting to scarcely more than a pittance. There is something in human nature that rebels against this species of favoritism, and no doubt when the will and the codicils were read in your presence you experienced as I did, a feeling not unlike indignation. The children thus virtually disinherited were as near to the testator as their more fortunate brother. They, like him, were bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, and they were all alike the natural objects of his bounty.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.6",650,[272,1686,1182,768]],["BL_651.1",651,[168,410,1186,1746]]]'>But whilst the law is in this way, gross inequality in wills has always been a fruitful source of litigation, and where the stake is as large as in the present case, it is not at all strange that the validity of the will should be challenged. Accordingly we find that two out of four of the less fortunate of Mr. Herster’s children that survive, one of the five being dead, are here contending that the three papers purporting to be the last will and codicils of Mr. Herster are not what they purport to be. Of course, Jackson Herster, who, in addition to receiving the bulk of the estate, is appointed one of the executors of the will, denies this. James W. Lynn, Esq., Jackson’s co-executor, also denies it. To be more specific, William Henry Herster and Eliza Reich, the two children just referred to as contestants against the will and codicils, and who are the plaintiffs here, affirm that the alleged will and codicils, or one of them, <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>were made and executed by reason of undue influence, fraud or misrepresentation. Jackson Herster and Mr. Lynn, the defendants here, deny this, and in this way is raised the issue now being tried. In more simple form, the issue is whether the will and codicils in controversy were procured to be made by undue influence; the' terms fraud and misrepresentation as here used, signifying merely the means by which the alleged undue influence was acquired and exercised, for undue influence may be either- through threats or fraud: Thompson v. Kyner, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20Pa.%20379" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="65 Pa. 379">65 Penn. St. 379</a>. Now, undue influence is defined to be “ any improper or wrongful constraint, machination or urgency of persuasion, whereby the will of a1 person is overpowered and -he is induced to do or forbear an act which he would not do or would do if left to act freely: ” Abbott’s Law Dictionary. “ That is undue influence,” says Strong, J., in Eckert v. Flowry, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%2051" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="43 Pa. 51">43 Penn. St. 51</a>, “ which amounts to constraint, which substitutes the will of another for that of the testator. It may be either through -threats or fraud, but however exercised it must, in order to avoid a will, destroy the free agency of the testatrix at the time when the instrument is made......Unless, therefore, there was some evidence tending legitimately to prove that fraud had been practiced upon the testatrix at the time, or that some misrepresentation had been made, or that some moral or physical coercion had been employed, such as to destroy her free agency, the court erred in submitting to the jury the question whether undue influence had been exerted......Undoubtedly if the mind of the testratrix was weak -it required less influence to control her will than it would have required to control the will of one whose mind was in full vigor. But neither moral or physical constraint is to be inferred from mental weakness alone. That undue influence, which suffices to destroy an alleged will, is distinct from weakness, and has no necessary connection with it.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b651-8" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[169,2174,1182,201]]]'>But though there is no necessary connection between undue influence and weakness of mind they are usually found hand in hand, and hence it is always competent to inquire into the state of mind of the person alleged to have been influenced.</p>

Long, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20Pa.%2077" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="82 Pa. 77">82 Penn. St. 77</a>, “ no right of the citizen is more valued than the power <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>to dispose of his property by will. No right is more solemnly assured to him by law. Nor does it depend in any sense upon the judicious exercise of it. It rarely happens that a man bequeaths his estate to the entire satisfaction of either his family or friends. In many instances his testamentary disposition of property seems harsh, if not unjust; the result, perhaps, of prejudice, as to some of the testator’s kindred, or undue partiality as to the others. But these are matters about which we have no concern. The law wisely secures equity of distribution where a man dies intestate. But the very object of a will is to produce inequality, and to provide for the wants of the testator’s family, to protect those who are helpless, to reward those who have been affectionate, and to punish those who have been disobedient. It is doubtless true that narrow prejudice sometimes interferes with the wisdom of such arrangements. Tliis is due to the imperfections of human nature. It must be remembered that in this country a man’s prejudices are a part of his liberty. He has a right to them; he may be unjust to his children or relatives. He is entitled to the control of his property while living, and by will to direct its usé after his death, subject only to such restrictions as are imposed by law. Where a man has sufficient memory and understanding to make a will, and such instrument is not the result of undue influence, but is the uncontrolled act of his own mind, it is not to be set aside in Pennsylvania without sufficient evidence nor upon any sentimental notions of equality.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b652-5" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[245,1800,1184,705]]]'>To establish the charge of undue influence two points must be sustained : First, the fact that the influence was exercised, and next that it was effectual in producing the alleged result. Under the last branch it is competent “ to show that the testator was of that peculiar mental structure, was possessed of those intrinsic or accidental qualities, was subject to such passion or prejudice, of such perverse or feeble will, or so mentally infirm in any respect as to render it probable that the efforts used were successful in producing in the will offered the combined result. The purpose of the evidence in this direction is to establish that liability of the testator to be easily affected by fraud or undue influence, which constitutes the necessary counterpart of the other facts to be proved ”: Sheiler v.

      <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>You will now understand why it is that so much evidence has been introduced as to the state of Mr. Herster’s mind, for it must be remembered that the issue now being tried is not whether the testator possessed a sufficient memory and understanding to make a will. Not at all. The plaintiffs concede that he had a sound and disposing mind when the three papers in controversy were executed, but their allegation is that his mind vvas so weakened by disease and old age as to make him an easy prey to the alleged machinations of his son Jackson and Jackson’s wife. But even if you should be satisfied from the weight of the evidence that this was the condition of the testator’s mind, that, as has been seen, would not be enough to warrant a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The duty would still rest on the plaintiffs to show that the weakness, such as it was, had been unduly influenced, and the will and codicils in controversy were the result of the undue influence thus exercised.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b653-5" data-blocks='[["BL_653.5",653,[156,1305,1186,966]]]'>It is not pretended that any direct influence was brought to bear upon the testator in the very act of executing the will and codicils. The undisputed evidence is that the testator was alone with his counsel when he gave instructions for the preparation of the papers. The undisputed evidence also is that he came alone to the office of Mr. Lynn on three several occasions, when the will and codicils were signed, and that he there signed the papers in the presence of respectable witnesses, who are in no way implicated in the charge of undue influence here now made. . To all outward appearance, therefore, the signing of the will and codicils was the free and voluntary act of the testator. Plaintiffs complain, however, that appearances in this case are deceitful, as they often are. Their allegation is that when these papers were executed the testator’s mind was not free, but that it was fettered and controlled by cruel and unjust prejudice engendered’against his other children by Jackson Herster and his wife through misrepresentation derogatory to the character and conduct of these other children.</p>

Long, <a href="/pa/82/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="82 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1047992" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0072-01">82 Penn. St. 72</a>, it is held to be the duty of the court to determine the sufficiency of evidence of testamentary capacity, and the same is true of undue influence, and that it is error to submit the question to the jury unless it be sufficient. On the contrary it is equally error to withdraw from the jury evidence that is sufficient, so that the judge who presides at the trial of issues like the present is between two fires, and no judge who has once, in an important case like the present, occupied such a position, is likely to be at all anxious to repeat the experience. But unpleasant and sometimes difficult as is the duty thus imposed, it must be met.</p>

Crime almost invariably hides itself, and crimes of this nature are usually only to be detected by circumstantial evidence. Where the person is an inmate of the family of those who unduly influence him, while the effect of that undue influence might be clearly seen, it would be most difficult, we might almost say it would be impossible, to obtain direct proof of the exercise of artifice and fraud in procuring a will to be made.

The issue was granted by the Orphans’ Court, after a full hearing upon the matters of fact alleged against the will, and a contest upon the sufficiency of the facts in evidence to justify the granting of an issue. It must be assumed that in granting the issue the learned court was of opinion that there was evidence enough to carry the case to a jury, and to require a verdict to determine upon the disputed matter of fact in question. When the issue thus granted was tried in the Common Pleas the learned judge who tried the cause, who was not the same judge who granted the issue, was of opinion that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant a verdict against the will, and he withdrew the case from the jury by a binding instruction to return a verdict in favor of the will.</p>

Its disposition'properly rests with the jury alone. Even if the trial judge should feel that were he sitting as a juror he could not regard the evidence as sufficient to induce him to find a verdict against the will, that is not enough to justify him in taking the case entirely from the jury. He must be prepared to go further than that, before he can deprive the jury of its proper control of the dispute. This court has indicated in a number of decisions a rule by which to determine the granting of an issue, and it is equally applicable in determining whether a cause of this kind ought to be withdrawn from the jury. It is thus expressed in a recent case: “ If the testimony is such that after a fair and impartial trial resulting in a verdict against the proponents of the alleged will, the trial judge, after a careful review of all the testimony would feel constrained to set aside the verdict as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, it cannot be said that a dispute within <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>the meaning of the act has arisen. On the other hand, if the state of the evidence is such that the judge would not feel constrained to set aside the verdict, the dispute should be considered substantial and an issue to determine it should be directed. This simple and only safe test is supported alike by reason and authority: ” Knauss and Seip’s App., <a href="/pa/114/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="114 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="549988" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0010-01">114 Penn. St. 10</a>. Having this principle in mind we have given to the testimony on this record a most patient and careful examination and study, and, after doing so we do not feel able to say that, had we been sitting as trial judges and a verdict been rendered against the will and codicils in question, we should have felt constrained to set aside the verdict. That being so, it is necessary to reverse the judgment of the court below in order that the cause may be heard and decided by a jury on its merits.</p>

It is perhaps well to say that undue influence may be exercised secretly as well as openly, and this is especially possible where a confidential relation exists between the principal devisee and the testator and they dwell together in the same house. In such cases' it is not eas3r to make out an allegation of undue influence by proof which is direct or positive, nor is it necessary to do so. The effects of its exertion may be very visible, but as these may also be consistent with a perfectly free will, much caution must be exercised by the jury in considering such an aspect of the case. Rash conclusions must not be drawn simply because of a large disproportion of the estate being given to one to tbe exclusion of others; and the evidence of the exertion of undue influence must be of a satisfactory and convincing character, whether it be direct or circumstantial. With these reflections we dismiss this part of the case, and sustain the first, second, third, fourth and. eighteenth assignments of error.</p>
