His entire bill was $159,25, upon which he had received $20. The plaintiff then rested, when the defendant moved for a compulsory nonsuit, on the ground that the plaintiff’s claim and proof did not come under the exceptions of the statute of 1848, and he could not recover, the defendant having been a married woman at the time Avhen the alleged contract was made. This motion was allowed and nonsuit entered, and subsequently a motion to take off the nonsuit was overruled. The plaintiff then took this writ, specifying as error the entry of the judgment of nonsuit and the refusal to set that judgment aside.</p>

It is in due form, setting forth substantially that Mrs. Knabb, one of the defendants, being sole owner in her own right of an improved farm on which was a growing crop, employed plaintiff to harvest, house and market the same for her: that the services thus contracted for were fully performed, at her request, in and about the management of her separate estate, and that the same were “ necessary for the preservation, enjoyment, use <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>and profit of the said separate estate by the said Sarah Knabb,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b64-4" data-blocks='[["BL_64.5",64,[248,504,1188,925]]]'>The fact that Mrs. Knabb was a <em>feme </em>covert, at the time of making the alleged contract, was conceded; and the only issues of fact were raised by the pleas of <em>non assumpsit, </em>payment with leave, etc. Evidence tending to sustain every material averment in the narr was introduced, but the learned judge nonsuited the plaintiff and subsequently refused to take off the judgment, assigning as a reason therefor, that “ a married woman is not liable at common law upon her contracts; and, as no statute, according to the construction given to our Married Woman’s Act, covers the ease of this plaintiff, it must be decided that he cannot recover, although his claim is one that it seems ought in good conscience to be paid.” It thus appears that the nonsuit was sustained on the broad ground that, a married woman, owning in her own right an improved farm, is incapable of binding her separate estate by a contract for services necessarily required and rendered in harvesting, housing and marketing, for her benefit, the growing crop on said farm. As a legal proposition this cannot be sustained.</p>

While perhaps the precise question now presented has never been distinctly ruled, the underlying principle has been so conclusively settled that it is of easy application to the undisputed facts of this case. In Lippincott v. Hopkins, <a href="/pa/57/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="57 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1010392" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0328-01">57 Penn. St. 328</a>, and Lippincott v.

As was said in the latter case <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>such liability is the necessary result of the rights of the wife and the disabilities of the husband; that the right to own, use and enjoy her separate real estate would be comparatively valueless without the power to take care of and preserve it from ruin, and hence the rights of property conferred necessarily imply a power to repair. Again in Germania Savings Bank’s Appeal, 95 Idem 329, it was held that a married woman’s power to contract for necessary improvements as well as repairs to her real estate is inseparably incident to her right to acquire and hold the same to her own separate use.</p>
