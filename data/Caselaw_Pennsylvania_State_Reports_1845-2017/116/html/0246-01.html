We remark, in the first place, that this act does not expressly repeal the provision of the charter, and in the second place, that it does not declare that the tax shall be levied in addition to other corporation taxes. In the absence of such expression of intention does a repeal by necessary implication arise?.....Implied repeals are not favored and are never allowed except in cases of strong repugnancy or irreconcilable inconsistency. Especially is this true where the prior act is local and special and the latter act is general; see Brown v.

L. 35, and if so, must that tax also be- kept within the two per cent, limit ? Section 3 of article 15 of the constitution provides that “ every city shall create a sinking fund, which shall be inviolably pledged for the payment of its funded debt.” This provision of the constitution is mandatory, and applies as well to funded debts then in existence as to such debts- thereafter to be created. The act of April 20, 1874, the Municipal Indebtedness Act,P. L. 65, carried it out only in part, for that provided for indebtedness thereafter to be incurred or refunded, but not to other funded debt then in existence. This led, as we think, to the insertion of the first clause of section 11 in the act relating to cities, May 23, 1874. The tax there referred to is authorized “in addition to the other taxes of said corporation,” and is to continue only until payment'of the bonds and funded debt be provided for. Possibly, if there were any such debt of the city not fully provided for, the council might levy this three mill sinking fund tax in addition to the taxes authorized to be levied under the charter. But it was admitted on the argument that all the funded debt existing at the date of the adoption of the constitution has been since that time paid or refunded. We must presume that the city is annually levying a sufficient tax under the act of April 20, 1874, P. L. 65, to provide for the payment of the interest and the liquidation of the principal at maturity. If so, the constitutional mandate has 'been carried out, and, to adopt the language of the 11th <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>section of the Wallace act, payment of all the bonds and funded debt of the city has been fully provided for, and hence there is no longer any necessity or authority for levying this particular tax, in addition to the tax which the city is bound to levy under the act of April 20, 1874, P. L. 65, the Municipal Indebtedness act. We may remark, however, that in our opinion the latter act contemplates a tax specially laid for the purpose of paying the interest and principal of the funded debt, and not an annual appropriation out of the general revenues. Hence, the tax mentioned in the bill as levied for that special purpose is not illegal, but the taxes for ordinary purposes must be correspondingly reduced.</p>

    <p id="b282-7" data-blocks='[["BL_282.8",282,[253,1686,1190,660]]]'>1. We do not dispute the proposition that prior to 1874 the right of the city of Wilkes-Barre under its charter to levy tax was limited to two per cent, on the valuation. But section 8, article 15 of the constitution and the act of April 20, 1874, P., L. 65, imposed upon the city a new duty and a new burden and gave it a new power. Then the city became bound to levy a special tax equal to eight per cent, of the indebtedness, whether it were a new debt just incurred or an old debt renewed. The grant of power to assess and collect a tax for a particular purpose, is a repeal <em>pro tanto </em>of all prior statutory restrictions of the power of taxation: Com. <em>ex rel. </em>v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20497" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="34 Pa. 497">34 Penn. St. 497</a> ; Amey v.

Our conclusion is based (1) on the express language of the Sinking Fund act, that the tax shall be in addition to all other taxes; (2) on the requirement that the tax is to be levied and collected “ annually,” and not “ forthwith,” as in the other act; (3) on the proposition that payment of a debt is not <em>fully provided for </em>until the money is in hand to pay it; (4) on the proposition that said act, which applies only to cities, was not a mere reiteration of the requirements of the former act relating to the indebtedness of all municipalities, but made additional requirements and gave additional powers.</p>

The act then, instead of conferring power, not authorized by the charter, limited the power, already conferred, in many ways. It limited the amount of indebtedness the city could create, it compelled the issue of bonds every time the indebtedness was increased, it compelled the levying of an annual tax to produce a sinking fund out of which to pay the interest and principal of said bonds.</p>

L. 234, except that it fixes the minimum tax at one fourth of a mill instead of one mill, which was the previous limitation.

This provision applies as well to funded debts then in existence as to such debts as may thereafter be created. The act of April 20,1874, provided only in part for the enforcement of the constitutional mandate, in that it embraced only indebtedness thereafter to be incurred, or refunded, and not <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>for previously existing funded debts. From this the learned judge was led to think that the first clause of section 11 of the act of May 23, 1874, was passed to meet what he supposed to be an omission in the preceding act, and that the three mill tax therein authorized to be levied, “in addition to the other taxes of said corporation,” was to continue only until such precedent indebtedness was provided for. But we cannot adopt this method of reasoning, because it seems to us to be faulty in at least two particulars.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[234,886,1186,1592]]]'>(1) There is nothing in the act itself which indicates that the legislature intended to limit it to pre-existing debts. The expressed purpose is to create a sinking fund “ for the gradual extinguishment of the bonds and funded debt of the respective cities of this commonwealth,” and the additional levy and collection were to be made annually, “ until payment of the bonds and funded debt be fully provided for.” But what is there in this which limits this provision to the bonds and funded debts of- municipalities outstanding at the adoption of the constitution? On the other hand, this same section provides : “ That the councils of any city of the first class, the debt of which exceeds seven per centum upon the assessed value of taxable property therein, shall be and they are hereby authorized to increase the said debt one per centum upon such valuation.” To meet the indebtedness thus incurred, the city is required to provide for an assessed tax sufficient to pay the interest, and also the principal, of “ said loan ” within thirty years. When, therefore, by the same section which creates the sinking fund, subsequent indebtedness is provided for, we may well conclude that the legislature intended that this fund should include such indebtedness as well as that which preceded it. Again, as the act under consideration has no necessary connection with the precedent act of April 20th, we cannot see why it must be construed with it; certainly, the former might be repealed without affecting the latter in the least. But suppose such necessity exists, why should we not adopt the conclusion that the 11th section of the more recent act was intended to supply what was omitted in the former; that is, the means for the creation of a sinking fund? This, we are inclined to think, would be a better interpretation than that proposed by the court below.</p>

It is true it has been refunded, bat refunding is not payment. We must presume, says the court below, “ That the city is annually levying a sufficient tax, under the act of Assembly of the 20th of April, 1874, to provide for the payment of the interest, and the liquidation of the principal at maturity.” But this presumption is rebutted by the fact that the city has made no such provision, except by the levy of the three mill tax which the court has enjoined. On the learned judge’s own reasoning, therefore, we convict him of error, for here is a pre-existing debt, the liquidation of which is unprovided for, and for which liquidation the sinking fund act, as he contends, was specially provided.</p>
