That brother testified in chief that the money was his sister’s; that Martin objected to receiving $500 thereof, but on being informed that she authorized it to be handed to him as a loan to the firm, he accepted it. On cross-examination, however, he testified that he did not stipulate1 for any rate of interest on the money, nor was there any agreement to return it; that he did not know of the existence of the firm before he gave Martin <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>Brock tbe money. He further swore that he did not know whose money it was, that his father drew the check for $2,000 and handed it to him, and that he never saw Max Brock, the other partner, in regard to this money.</p>

There was no evidence to charge the firm with this money even if Martin did receive it as a loan. The whole evidence pretty clearly indicates that the money was handed to him as a wedding present to him and his bride. Their subsequent divorce produced disappointed expectations.
