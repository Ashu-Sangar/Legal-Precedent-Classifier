    <p class="summary" id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[168,569,1183,505]]]'>1. The 3d section of the act of April 21, 1856, P. L. 477, as amended by the act of February 23, 1858, P. L. 45, provides as follows: “ It shall be the duty of.....all collectors of any taxes whatsoever, to make return to the county commissioners of any exonerations claimed by them, on or before the first day of February in each year; and it shall not be lawful for the r,aid county commissioners to grant any exonerations after that time, nor for the county treasurer to sell any lands which shall have been returned and taxes exonerated after the said time.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b233-8" data-blocks='[["BL_233.6",233,[162,1090,1189,1343]]]'>Sales of lands for unpaid taxes are the creatures of our statutes, having been unknown to the common law and, therefore, they must be made in pursuance of and in conformity with the provisions of said statutes in order to pass title to the purchaser. Your referee cannot find that the Act of April 21, 1856, had ever been repealed, at least prior to the time these taxes were returned and exonerated. Neither can he believe, as urged by counsel for plaintiff, that the provision therein forbidding the exoneration of taxes returned by the collector after February 1st, following the year of their assessment, and forbidding the sale by the treasurer of any land for taxes then returned and exonerated, is merely directory and may be obeyed or disobeyed at the pleasure of said officers; or that the failure on the part of the officers to comply with these provisions is a mere irregularity which will not vitiate the sale. On the contrary, he holds that said provisions are mandatory on the officers and their observance is a condition precedent of their right to sell the said land; and if they sell any land not thus returned, the sale is void and the purchaser takes no title. The reasons which influenced the legislature to pass the act of 1856, were obviously to insure the prompt collection of the taxes and thus obtain a speedy and certain revenue to defray the public expenses, and, perhaps also to protect purchasers of real estate from loss from taxes which might remain trnpaid for years and would otherwise be secret liens on the property.</p>

L. 98, and of June 12, 1878, P. L. 195; but an examination of those acts has satisfied the referee that they do not repeal or in ány way affect the said act of 1856, but are entirely consistént with its provisions. They merely extended the life of the warrants of the tax collectors when they had not availed themselves of the opportunity to return their unpaid taxes and be exonerated therefrom under the provisions of said act of 1856, and thus had become personally liable for the whole amount of the duplicates. These acts of assembly were intended only to extend the warrants of these collectors and thus give them an opportunity to reimburse themselves from the personal property of the delinquent tax-payer by distress or otherwise.</p>

The only authority of the commissioners to certify lands to the treasurer for sale for unpaid taxes is the return of the tax collector. Your referee i's of the opinion that the commissioners are bound by the said return, and have no authority whatever to- include in their certificate to the treasurer any lands whatever which are not returned delinquent by the collector. The tax sale is a proceeding against the property which is delinquent and not against the person of the tax-payer.</p>

He is right in determining that the only property which can be sold away from Mm is that which is returned delinquent by the tax collector. He should not be surprised two years later by the information that the commissioners, relying on hearsay evidence, entirely outside of the record, have concluded that an entirely different property was intended to be returned delinquent, and have certified the same to the treasurer for sale, saving possibly the right of amendment if made in proper time.
