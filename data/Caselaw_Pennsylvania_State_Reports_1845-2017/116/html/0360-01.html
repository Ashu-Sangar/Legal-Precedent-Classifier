Upon certain writs of <em>fi. </em>fa., one to No. 6 February Term 1884, issued upon a judgment against Peter Baldy in favor of Wm. J. Baldy, trustee, the premises subject to said mechanics’ lien were sold, $2,500 of the proceeds paid into court and an auditor appointed to make distribution. On the hearing before the auditor the right of Nicholas Hofer to receive prior payment upon bis mechanics’ lien was contested by R. G. Neal, trustee for Martha Clark, a judgment creditor; and, discrepancies arising between the testimony of Mr. Hofer and of witnesses on the. part of R. C. Neal, Mr. Hofer demanded an issue to determine the facts bj’’ jury trial, to avoid which the contestant filed an agreement that the testimony of Mr. Hofer already taken by the auditor on the hearing “ should be considered as tlie facts of the case by the auditor and the court relating to bis mechanics’ lien filed.”</p>

It was not continuous nor in the ordinary progress of the work upon the building, as was that of January, preparing and delivering shelving which was delayed, without his fault, and put in place in April.

It is agreed that Hofer’s testimony shall be taken as the facts.</p>
    <p id="b395-7" data-blocks='[["BL_395.8",395,[161,1656,1179,294]]]'>The learned auditor had no difficulty in finding that the work done in April was continuous with that done before, for the conclusive reason that the building was unfinished, and it was understood that he was to finish it. That two months had intervened since he did the work in January was no matter.</p>
    <p id="b395-8" data-blocks='[["BL_395.9",395,[160,1968,1184,505]],["BL_396.1",396,[263,409,1180,446]]]'>When the shelving was put in, the building was pronounced finished, except the ventilators. These were so material that the building could not be used until they were supplied, and it was understood that Hofer would put them in as soon as needed in the fall. He did, within six months from the doing of the work in April, and completed the building within the time designated by the owner. There was no contract to do the entire work; had there been, no doubt would arise whether the claim was filed in time. The auditor finds that Hofer was employed by the day. That employment continued, not every <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>consecutive day, but every day the employer ordered until the employee completed the building. For such cases as this the act of April 14, 1855 was enacted: P. L. 238. “ That act applies to items for work done or materials furnished continuously to the same building, and was intended to link together the items of an account for work or materials where there was no contract for the whole, or no order which would embrace the whole within a single undertaking: ” Dillen v.

    <p id="b396-5" data-blocks='[["BL_396.5",396,[261,874,1181,767]]]'>When materials are furnished and work done in the erection of a building, as ordered by the owner or contractor from time to time in the ordinary progress of the work, the act of 1855 gives to them a unity as if furnished under a contract or order for the whole. In any other sense there cannot be a continuity of items without a contract for the whole ; for there must always be an interval of time between the procuring of the articles, and so there is between different items for work, done from time to time, as ordered: Singerly v. Doerr, <a href="/pa/62/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="62 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1017273" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0009-01">62 Penn. St. 9</a>. The question, usually, is not so much respecting the length of the interval, as whether the work was ordered and done in its ordinary progress from beginning to completion, as conducted by the employer, with an understanding that the employment should continue, though such understanding is not binding as a contract.</p>
    <p id="b396-6" data-blocks='[["BL_396.6",396,[259,1649,1179,188]]]'>Upon the facts in this case it is a reasonable inference that both parties contemplated that Hofer would finish the greenhouse, and as he did all the work from the beginning, it was continuous in the sense of the statute.</p>
