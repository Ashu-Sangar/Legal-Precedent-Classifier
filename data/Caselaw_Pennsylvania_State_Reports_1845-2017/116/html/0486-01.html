The electors intended to vote concerning a water tax only, and voted written or printed tickets having on the outside the words, “ Water Tax,” and on the inside, “For a Water Tax,” or “Against a Water Tax.” The election was returned in favor of a water-tax, and the defendants proceeded to lay and collect a special <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>tax for water purposes only. It was claimed, that the levy and collection of said tax was illegal, as unauthorized by the said act of 1875, under the provisions of which the electors must vote for and the defendants must levy and collect a tax subject to use for gas or water, and that the amendatory act of 1876 was unconstitutional.</p>

But if the claim of the plaintiffs is correct, the voters if they would have the one must also have the other, because the act provides that the money so raised and collected shall be expended for such fire plugs, hydrants, etc., as may be required to supply such boroughs with a sufficient supply of water for the extinguishment of fires, cleaning streets, and with gas for properly lighting and illuminating the streets.</p>
