The plaintiff covenanted to convey the premises by such deeds of conveyance as counsel learned in the law should advise to the purchasers. This, on its face was a lawful contract. But it is said by the plaintiff to have been an illegal and void contract, because of the method resorted to by the purchasers to make partition of the premises amongst each other. But it is an illegal contract only in case the plaintiff was himself a party to the illegal understanding and agreement to divide the land by lottery. If this were not a part of the original understanding with the plaintiff, he is free from complicity in the unlawful transaction which followed, and to him it could not matter how the purchasers divided their property. All he was bound to regard was the payment of the purchase money, and the execution of the conveyances as required by the purchasers, and they could have enforced against him, and he against them, the terms of the original contract. But if the plaintiff originated the scheme <em>of </em>the lottery, or was cognizant of it and a promoter of it at the date of the written contract, then the latter was a mere device to evade the law, which could not have been enforced on either side. [B ut I regard the contract in question between the plaintiff and defendant in this suit as standing independent of the original contract of October 25, 1875. Lot No. 42 was not drawn by the defendant in the lottery. He drew another number; and whether the transaction which resulted in the drawing, were legal or illegal, the defendant could not, under it, have made any demand for the conveyance to him of the land in question. Neither could the plaintiff have compelled <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>him to accept or pay for it. If the defendant has any claim to the possession of lot No. 42 it arises upon a new and' independent contract, outside of the original transaction.]8 He derived no title or interest from Martin Kulp, who drew the lot and is said to have surrendered his claim to it to the defendant. What right or title he has rests solely upon what took place between the plaintiff and the defendant concerning it; and here is the vital and most material point in this controversy. Did a parol contract take place between the plaintiff and defendant concerning it? Did the plaintiff agree that the defendant should have the lot, Kulp being out of the way? Was the price agreed upon? Was possession given in pursuance of this contract, to the defendant ? Did the defendant make valuable improvements upon the premises with the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff ? Was any part of the purchase money paid, if so how much ? These are all material points for the consideration of the jury. There has been much discussion about the lottery, which was, in the light the court views this matter, unimportant. For it is not through or by force of the lottery that the defendant can claim the rightful possession of the premises; for the lottery assigned the premises to another person; and it is only by force of the new agreement made with the plaintiff that the defendant can maintain his right of possession to the lot in question. Now the claim set up by the defendant is founded upon a verbiil contract, called in law language a contract by parol; and there is a statute against the transfer of title to lands otherwise than by writing. It is a wise statute, intended to prevent the frauds likely to be practiced, a,nd the perjuries likely to be committed to the confusion of titles, if sales of land could be effected by verbal transfers. But, to prevent injustice, certain exceptions have been sanctioned by courts, and estates in land may sometimes be acquired even by parol; as for example, where the possession has been given under a contract; and the purchase money, or a considerable part of it, has been paid ; or valuable improvements made upon the premises with the knowledge and consent of the seller, so that it would be unjust and inequitable to rescind the contract and give back the land to the seller. Whether or not such a state of facts exists in this case, is the main matter for your consideration. [If there <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>were a verbal contract between the plaintiff and defendant that he should have the lot in question upon paying a certain fixed mice, Kulp being out of the way, and if in pursuance of this arrangement the defendant were allowed by the plaintiff to take possession of the premises, and with the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff, to make valuable improvements thereupon, which could not adequately be compensated for in damages ; so that it would be inequitable under those circumstances to allow the seller to take back the property ; if you so find it, it is a parol contract which may be sustained, notwithstanding the statute upon the subject; and if you find these facts to exist in this case, under these instructions, the defendant would be entitled to retain possession of the lot.] 9 Sometimes, in order to do exact justice between the parties, juries may render a conditional verdict, and after I have answered the points which have been presented to me on both sides to charge upon, I will further call your attention to this subject.</p>

The court instruct you, if you find that there was a parol contract that the defendant should have lot 42 instead of the lot he drew,- and it was the understanding that the $50 should be considered as part of the purchase money, then, though it was originally paid without <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>reference to any particular lot, it may be counted as a payment upon the lot in question, the plaintiff having consented, if you so find, to such an appropriation.] 10 And you will find from the facts what additional purchase money was paid by the defendant upon the lot.

In case you find that there was a tender of the balance of purchase money by the defendant to the plaintiff at any time, and the amount tendered constituted the whole balance that was due, then, although you might calculate interest upon it from the time it became due up to that date, you would not calculate interest beyond the date of the tender. The court leave the facts entirely with the. jury; but in order that the jury, in a certain event, may not be embarrassed, the court have moulded a verdict, in case you should come to the conclusion that a conditional verdict in this case is required under the instructions which have been given to you, and the facts as you shall find them.....- You can mould the verdict as you please.

The jury have found by their verdict that the defendant did obtain possession of the land in question by the express assent of the plaintiff. How do the statutes affect his title? The doctrine of Seidenbender v. Charles, 4 S. &amp; R. 151, interpreting the act of February 17, 1762, 1 Sm. L. 246, is that whatever has been done and executed in pursuance of a lottery will be left by the court as it is found. . Even under § 52 of the act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 396, the wrong-doer cannot take advantage of his own wrong: Balliett’s Case, 1 Leg. Chron. 198.</p>

Godshalk’s claim to the lot described in the writ had its origin in the lottery contract of the 25th of October, 1875, and was, of course, void under the act of March 31, 1860. Martin Kulp had drawn at the lottery lot No. 42, the one in controversy, and the defendant No. 38. They agreed to exchange and to this arrangement, it is said, the plaintiff assented. It is further alleged that the deed for this lot was duly executed and delivered in escrow to the Schwenksville Bank. That the deed was executed by the plaintiff, along with others, is admitted, but that it was delivered, even in escrow, is denied. John C. Boorse, who drew the deeds, and had them executed, says he delivered them to the plaintiff, and that he did not understand that it was part of the contract, that they should be deposited in the bank for delivery, whilst Allebaeh testifies that he left them at the bank for his own convenience, and afterwards took them to his own house. All this, however, matters but little, for at best, this deed not having been in fact delivered, could not have been used except as proof of <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>the terms and conditions of the parol sale, and without other proof could not, of itself, avoid the statute: Hart v. Carroll, <a href="/pa/85/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="85 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="440531" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0508-01">85 Penn. St. 508</a>. Furthermore, this deed, with the others, was executed in pursuance of the lottery agreement, upon which the defendant’s title, whether to lot No. 88 or No. 42, depended, so that it was altogether worthless for any purpose. Moreover, the payment of the fifty dollars purchase money was, as G-odshalk confesses, paid on the lottery contract of October 25, 1875, and is in consequence out of the ease. Again: as to the improvements which the defendant alleged he put on the lot in pursuance of the parol sale, these can have no effect to redeem the case from the statute; for, except the fence, they were removed before or about the time of the bringing of this ejectment suit. It is thus manifest that the defendant’s oral contract has not the shadow of foundation on which to stand. As to the plaintiff, were he attempting to enforce the 25th of October contract, he, in like manner, could have no standing in court; for it would be allowable to prove that this contract was executed for an unlawful purpose, hence his defeat would be inevitable: Bredin’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/92/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="92 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="491030" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0241-01">92 Penn. St. 241</a>. But he is attempting nothing of the kind; his suit is ejectment, and he stands upon an untainted legal title which cannot be affected by the collateral illegal con-, tract, any more than by the unexecuted paro-l contract. By .all rules, therefore, the plaintiff should have had the verdict, and so the court ought to have instructed the jury. As what we have said sustains the plaintiff’s first assignment of error, we need not notice the others.</p>
