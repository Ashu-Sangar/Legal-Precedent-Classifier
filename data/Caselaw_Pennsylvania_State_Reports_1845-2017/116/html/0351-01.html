Reed, May 23, 1883, in mortgage book 3, page 182. Appellant’s mortgage dated May 25, 1883, was recorded the following day in mortgage book 2, page 661, but not with the lease. The body of the mortgage, however, contains this reference to the lease: “ Being the same land and leasehold conveyed to the said John H. Welsh by James S. Sterrett by deed dated March 8, 1877, and recorded iu deed book 58, page 232, by reference to which the origin of said leasehold and chain of title thereto will fully and at large appear.” The auditor, <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>considering this reference to the lease a sufficient compliance with the requirement of the act of 1876, awarded the residue of the fund to appellant; but, on exception to his ruling, the court held it was not, and recommitted the report with instructions to award the residue to W. W. Johnson, whose mortgage was recorded two months later, but contained a <em>verbatim </em>recital of the lease. The residue of the fund was accordingly decreed to Johnson the appellee; and this forms the subject of complaint in several of the specifications of error.</p>
    <p id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.5",391,[161,868,1184,658]]]'>It will be observed that the recital in appellant’s mortgage contains no reference to the recording of the lease. It is merely a reference to the deed of 1877, by which Welsh acquired title to the leasehold premises. The lease itself was not recorded in 1877, nor for more than six years thereafter. The act of'1876, as we have seen, declares, “ if the lease shall have been recorded in the deed books of the proper county before the execution of the mortgage, or shall then be recorded at the time of recording the mortgage, such recording shall be deemed a sufficient compliance with the act with reference to recording such lease: <em>Provided ahvays, </em>that full and distinct reference be made in said mortgage to the book and page where the said lease is recorded.”</p>
    <p id="b391-6" data-blocks='[["BL_391.6",391,[161,1543,1183,253]]]'>It is quite clear that the recital relied on by appellant utterly fails to meet the requirements of the act, and hence the court rightly held that appellant’s mortgage, although recorded prior to that of appellee, was not a lien on the leasehold premises.</p>
    <p id="b391-7" data-blocks='[["BL_391.7",391,[161,1801,1183,398]]]'>Leasehold mortgages are wholly dependent on the acts above quoted for their validity as liens, and unless there is at least a substantial compliance with their requirements, the mortgagee acquires no right as a lien creditor. The failure of appellant to either record the lease with his mortgage, or to cause full and distinct reference to be made therein to the book and page where the lease was then recorded, is fatal to his claim on the fund.</p>
    <p id="b391-8" data-blocks='[["BL_391.8",391,[209,2214,827,46]]]'>The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b391-9" data-blocks='[["BL_391.9",391,[428,2265,915,97]]]'>Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of appellant.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b391-10" data-blocks='[["BL_391.10",391,[207,2423,742,35]]]'>Mr. Chief Justice Mercur dissents.</p>
