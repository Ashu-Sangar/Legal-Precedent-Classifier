Penrose, J., ruled: That the gift was to be sustained as a general power of appointment conferred upon the executor. The will created no trust with regard to the residue, nor was there anything to indicate an intention that the objects selected should be of a charitable character. The power given was “ full and unlimited.” It was to “ appropriate or dispose ” of the residue to such persons, objects or institutions as the executor should name. The gifts to the persons, objects or institutions thus selected were direct; and when the selection was made, they would take precisely as if the testator had himself made the selection, and their names had been set forth in the will.3 “As, however, the distribution of the estate is now to be made, it is necessary that the persons, objects or institutions to be selected by the executor should be named at once. This will be done in the schedule of distribution hereinafter directed.” Thereupon a distribution was made of the said balance of $31,060.98, “which balance the executor.....appropriates and disposes of as <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>follows, to wit: John George Ulmer, $81,060.98 (subject-to such further rises as he may hereafter by his last will and testament appoint).”3</p>

It gives to the executor “full and unlimited power and authority to appropriate or dispose ” of it “ to such objects, persons or institutions as in his discretion shall be best and proper,” as testator has “ full confidence in his judgment, ability and integrity.” Thus it is shown that the executor has unlimited power to “appropriate ” it according to his discretion. As, then, his authority is not restricted to a power of disposal, but at his option he may <em>appropriate </em>the same or the proceeds arising from a sale thereof to such persons as he thinks proper, ■the learned judge arrived at a correct conclusion.</p>
