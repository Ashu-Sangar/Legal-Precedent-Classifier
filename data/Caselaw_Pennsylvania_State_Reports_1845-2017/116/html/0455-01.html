The suit was discontinued and a short summons issued, when, at the return day thereof, the said Serfass again appeared for the said defendant and demanded that the short summons be quashed because said defendant was a resident of Easton, in said county, and produced a witness who, with himself, testified to this fact.

An inspection of the receipt revealed to Mr. Hess the fact that the ink line across the words “ Received payment” had been erased, and he charged respondent with having made the erasure. Respondent at first denied the charge, but subsequently admitted it, claiming that the erasure was made as a joke. It is now an admitted fact that respondent did make the erasure.</p>

This is important, if true. But is it true? In the first place, we start out with the familiar maxim, that all things are presumed against a despoiler. In the next place the probabilities are against this theory. Respondent would have us believe that when he offered the receipt in evidence the ink line across the words “ Received payment ” was still there, but that it escaped his notice, and he so swears.

But' all doubt on this feature of the case is removed by the testimony of Mr. Fackenthall, Crawford’s attorney at the trial. Mr. Fackenthall testifies that he was familiar with the dual character of the receipts issued by the recorder, and that when the receipt in question was offered in evidence he examined it, for the express purpose of seeing whether it was a receipt for the money, or only for the paper. The absence of a line across the words “ Received payment ” would indicate the former, and its presence would indicate the latter. 'As a result of this examination Mr. Fackenthall says that he is able to testify positively, and does so testify, that at the time the receipt was offered in evidence there was no such line there.</p>

Even the respondent in one part of his testimony speaks of him as being “ kind of docile.” Be that as it may, it was manifest during the whole of Mr. Hilburn’s examination that he had but a very vague idea of what he was testifying about, and at one point in his examination he became completely dazed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[139,1600,1186,718]]]'>But taking his testimony at its best it amounts to no more than that at <em>some </em>time respondent showed him a paper either the same as, or <em>similar </em>to, the receipt in question, with a black line through the words “ Received payment,” which line respondent erased in Mr. Hilburn’s presence, saying as he did so, that it was for the purpose of having some fun with Sam. Yohe, the deputy recorder. When questioned in his examination in chief as to the time when this took place Mr. Hilburn replied, “ I am not sure excepting what I got from Mr. Serfass; <em>beyond that I know </em>nothing.” Considering the uncertainty as to time, and the ease with which a feeble old man like Mr. Hilburn, having no interest in the matter, could be imposed upon by a false paper, we attach no importance whatever to his testimony.</p>

It is in conflict, on too many material points, with the testimony of too many witnesses of undoubted integrity, to possess any value. The coolness with which respondent denounced the sworn statements of such men as Mr. Fackenthall, Mr. Hess, Mr. Sandt, Esquire Kolb, Mr. Yohe and others, as false, was one of the features of this investigation. “ I said in my haste, all men are liars,” exclaims the Psalmist.

These are, first, that respondent, in a suit in which he was the plaintiff, offered the receipt in evidence as the basis of a claim for money paid by himself, whereas it was not a receipt for money paid, but only for a paper; and second, that respondent deliberately altered this receipt, so as to make it a receipt for money paid.</p>

This is bad enough, but it is not the worst.
