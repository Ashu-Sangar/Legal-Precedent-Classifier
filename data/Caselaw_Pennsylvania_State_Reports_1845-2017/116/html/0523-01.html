    <p id="b556-7" data-blocks='[["BL_556.7",556,[232,933,1183,1383]]]'>1. By express language, the act is made to apply to all cases where the authorities of any borough <em>have changed </em>or may hereafter change the grade of any street. It was intended to be retrospective as well as prospective. It has been given a retrospective effect by all the lower courts that so far have passed upon it: Fegley v. Borough, 1 Lehigh V. R. 49; Beck v. Borough, Idem 325; s. c. <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pa.%20C.%20511" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Pa. C. 511">2 Pa. C. C. 511</a>; Croft v. Borough, 1 Del. Co. R. 8. There can be no doubt of the right of the legislature to pass statutes which reach back to and change or modify the effect of prior transactions, provided no objection exists other than their retrospective character: Grim v.

In granting the municipal charter, the legislature did not make a contract such as was contemplated by the constitution, which could not be modified by subsequent legislation : Cooley Const. Lim. 334. Even, however, if the act did impair the obligation of contracts, it is clearly competent for the commonwealth to pass a retrospective law impairing her own right: Davis v. Dawes, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 401" data-case-ids="1856445" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0401-01">4 W. &amp; S. 401</a>. When, as here, a moral obligation exists on the part of the government or its subordinate agents to relieve its citizens, sufficient to support a promise if the same state of things existed between individuals, the legislature has the right to recognize the obligation and direct its discharge: Lycoming v.
