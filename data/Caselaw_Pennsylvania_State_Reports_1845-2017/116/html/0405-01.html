    <p class="summary" id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[258,529,1192,1231]]]'>It will be seen from this statement of the facts that the sole question is whether ejectment will lie to enforce the delivery of the articles recited in the bond and conveyance. If it will, judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the -lands described in the writ to be released upon the payment of $377.48. If ejectment will not lie, judgment to be entered for the defendant. It will have been observed from the language of the conveyance already recited that it is not made upon the condition that the grantee shall perform the acts and deliver the articles specially enumerated in the contract. The legal title passed from Jacob Krebs, the vendor, to Wm. Krebs, his vendee, even though he did not pay at the time the consideration contracted for, but covenanted and agreed to pay it <em>in futuro. </em>It is not like the case of Bear v. Whisler, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%20144" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 W. 144">7 W. 144</a>, where the estate was granted upon condition, nor Westhoff v.

St. 235</a>, where the estate was upon condition. In these, and in kindred cases as well, it has been held that ejectment will lie to enforce a .condition contained in a deed, but in the case at hand, there is neither a condition nor a reservation in the conveyance. The words, proviso, <em>ita </em>quod, <em>sub conditione, </em>or their equivalent, is necessary to create a condition in a deed, and they are wanting, and for that reason ejectment will not lie.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b440-5" data-blocks='[["BL_440.6",440,[266,1769,1185,510]]]'>At most, the conveyance and bond or agreements constitute a covenant or contract on the part of Wm.
