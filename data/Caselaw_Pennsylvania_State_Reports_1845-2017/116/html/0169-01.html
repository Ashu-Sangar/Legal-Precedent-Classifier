Though the Master does not so state, it is to be presumed that he founds his conclusion dismissing the bill upon the application of the statute of limitations, holding that since the plaintiff’s action was not begun until July 16, 1884, it was barred by the statute. He does not refer to the statute of limitations either in his reasoning or his finding. Neither does he report when he finds that the plaintiff’s right of action accrued. It may be presumed, however, that he adopted the view of defendants’ counsel upon this subject, which was that the right accrued when the plaintiff parted with his money in purchasing the property. There is nothing in the Master’s report itself, however, to indicate what his conclusions were upon this subject. He does not indeed state that branch of the contention at all, or in the most remote manner present the question as to whether the plaintiff’s right of action accrued when he purchased the property, or when demand was made upon him for the payment of the mortgage, or when suit was brought to enforce payment, or when judgment was entered on the verdict, or when final judgment was rendered by the Supreme Court, or when as a result of all these things the sheriff sold the property and the plaintiff was dispossessed. While all these questions are of importance in determining the plaintiff’s right in this proceeding, especially in the Master’s view of the legal aspect of Mr. Binney’s act, yet they are not touched upon in the report. The Master merely finds that Mr. Binney’s <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>act was a mistake and not a fraud, and that therefore the plaintiff’s bill should be dismissed......</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[263,513,1184,1080]]]'>We may as well, first, dispose of one proposition contended for by defendants’ counsel, and apparently subscribed to by the Master. It was urged that fraud could not be imputed to Mr. Binney’s act unless he was shown to have been guilty of an actual fraudulent intent, and that in the absence of direct proof of <em>malafides, </em>whatever else his act was, it was not actual fraud. There is, however, such a thing as legal fraud, to which the law, without proof of fraudulent intent, gives the full legal consequences of actual fraud. We were referred to a dictum of Bramwell, L. J., in Weir v. Bell, L. R. 3 Ex. D. 238, in which he repudiates the term “ legal fraud,” and says that he can conceive of no fraud not actual fraud, and that to his mind the words “ legal fraud ” have no more meaning than legal heat or legal cold, legal light or legal shade. It is sufficient in reply to this sweeping criticism of the learned lord justice to say that the term “ legal fraud ” is used and recognized in every text-book upon equity and every treatise upon fraud that is found in our libraries, and that so far as Pennsylvania and other states are concerned, our reports abound with cases in which acts innocent of moral guilt have been held to be legal fraud, and treated in the same manner as actual fraud.</p>

It was an action to recover damages for the wrongful satisfaction of a judgment by the defendant, who set up the bar of the statute of limitations, and the court held that his act was a fraud, that until its discovery by the plaintiff tolled the statute. Judge Sterrett, in the opinion of the court, says: “ All the presumptions are against his innocence in the transaction and every just inference points to it as an actual fraud. But even if he was not actuated by any improper motive, the act would nevertheless be fraudulent in its result. An act innocent in the intention may be so injurious in its consequences that the law declares it to be a fraud......But the mantle of charity, broad as it is, will not cover such a transaction as that disclosed by this record. .....As the case stands upon the evidence, his act was a positive fraud on the rights of his assignees, for which he should be compelled to respond in damages, unless he is successfully shielded by the statute of limitations.” The court then hold that, being a fraud, the statute did not begin to run against the plaintiff until he discovered the fraud. It is to be noted that in that case there was no proof of fraudulent motive upon the part of the defendant in entering the satisfaction.</p>

None of these cases, however, are at all applicable to the present contention, for they were all actions on the case for deceit, the gist of which action is the bad faith of the defendant. Deceit is only one form or species of actual fraud. There can be no deceit without an intent to deceive, and. all that was decided in the cases cited by the Master was that in an action for deceit the intentmustbe proved. This was what Judge Gibson meant in Bokee v. Walker when he said: “This is an action on the case for deceit, but a constructive deceit is a new thing under the sun. There can be no constructive <em>dolus malus.” Of </em>course there cannot. It would be an abuse of language to say there could. That Judge Gibson, however, decided no more than that the <em>dolus </em>must be proved in actions for deceit is apparent from every line of his argument as well as from his citing with approval Lord Hardwicke’s division of fraud into four classes, only one of which is actual fraud.</p>

Hooper, 3 Atk. 278, “hath never laid down any general rule beyond which it will not go, lest some other means for avoiding the equity of the court should be found out.

There can be no dispute upon the evidence as to what he did. He wrongfully and illegally wrote upon the margin of a public record satisfaction of a mortgage which he did not own or represent, in which he had no interest, as to which he had no rights to protect, and no duties to perform. So far as the evidence goes, his act was voluntary and gratuitous, as well as unlawful. He knew he had no right to satisfy the mortgage ; he must have known ; it was his duty to know; he had the means of knowing. He was a man of more than ordinary intelligence. Had he desired to do so, it was within his power <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>by the exercise of the commonest intelligence to have ascertained that he was committing a wrong. The page upon which he wrote, had he read but a few lines of it, was. notice and warning to him that he was doing that which he had no right to do. Why did he not exercise common intelligence ? Why did he not read the open page before him ? Is a court of equity obliged to ask these questions, or shall it assume that he did what it was his duty to do, and acted in spite of knowledge ? ■ Or the other alternative — that, having the means of knowledge in himself and before his face at the time he acted, he closed his eyes and sealed his mind to the means of knowing, and did the wrong in reckless ignorance ? Either inference is equally fatal to the innocence of Mr. Binney’s act. 'One who closes his eyes and will not know is quite as culpable as one who, knowing, acts in defiance of his knowledge.</p>

It finds that he voluntarily did an unlawful and wrongful act, which he knew he had no right to do, and in the doing of which he was in the ■discharge of no other lawful and proper duty. His duty with reference to the mortgage he assumed to satisfy was only that incumbent upon every other person, in the world except the ■owner — the duty-to let it alone and not tamper with it. Is not such an act as his, under this evidence, both in fact and law a fraud? . Is it necessary before a court of equity can pronounce such .an act a fraud that it shall know the conscience and motives of the man at the time he did it ? Must the innocent party injured by that act show more than merely the act — all that by reason of its secrecy he can show, and all that has been shown by either side in' this case — or must he be asked to do the impossible thing of laying open the mind and conscience of the wrong-doer?</p>

By reason of Mr. 'Binney’s wrongful entry of satisfaction,. Morris Brown, this plaintiff, was deceived into believing' that.he was purchasing an unincumbered property, and on the strength of that reasonable belief parted with his money. Subsequently Mr. Binney’s unlawful act was discovered and the plaintiff was evicted from his home, his title was <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>destroyed, and his property was entirely lost to him. We have thus before us a voluntary, unlawful and wrongful act on the one hand, and on the other an innocent plaintiff deceived and seriously injured by that act. Surely if there ever was á case in which a court of equity, to prevent a manifest injustice, and to relieve against the injurious consequences of an illegal and wrongful act, should pronounce that act a fraud, this is the case. There is nothing in the evidence to give any other color to it than that of fraud. All that has been argued to show that Mr. Binney’s act was an innocent mistake is mérely assumption, and is based upon the well-known character of that gentleman for probity. But, as we have before said, that assumption is not a fact of which the court in this proceeding can take judicial notice. We do not by this judgment impeach his general rectitude. We only decide that when he wrongfully and unlawfully entered satisfaction of the mortgage in this case, he did an act which was a fraud upon any subsequent purchaser, who was deceived thereby into parting with his money. His act in so doing was a false and continuing representation of ownership as to any one who might be thereafter misled thereby. It was therefore a fraud, and the statute of limitations would not operate to protect it until its discovery by the party alleging it as the foundation of his right of action, and, the Master erred in not so finding. ■ 1</p>

There is neither evidence of actual fraud, nor are the circumstances attending the transaction such as to involve legal fraud. Horace Binney, Jr., together with the recorder, made a mistake for which he might have been held liable had suit been brought against him within the statutory period; but he was chargeable with nothiug but a mistake. Of this the face of the docket itself is indubitable evidence for it indicates precisely what mortgage he intended to satisfy, and from what there appears, no careful person ought to have been misled by the entry thereon made by way of satisfaction. The very first question that an inspection of the record gives rise to is: how comes it that Horace Binney, as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Wm. J. Bell, undertakes to satisfy a mortgage of which Joseph Swift is the mortgagee ? The answer is found on the same margin of the book on which the satisfaction is written: “ Asst. T. H. 20, 355. A. D. B. 12, 471.” That is to say: turn to the mortgage books as indicated, and you will there find the assignments which give Horace Binney, Jr., the power to satisfy this mortgage. But turning to. these books, as, if we are interested, we ought to do, we at once discover that a mistake has been made ; that the mortgage intended, the one Binney had power to satisfy, is to be found on page 544 of the mortgage book, and not that on page 543, and that, in fact, he could not satisfy the latter because he had no power so to do: Brown v. Henry, <a href="/pa/106/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="106 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="455576" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0262-01">106 Penn. St. 262</a>. The mistake being thus apparent, •made apparent by the transaction itself, there is no room to <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>infer fraud either actual or constructive ; hence the plaintiff’s only remedy was an action on the case, a remedy long since barred by the statute of limitations: Owen v. The Savings Fund, <a href="/pa/97/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="97 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="444814" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0047-01">97 Penn. St. 47</a>.</p>
