Accountants base their claims for these credits on the second clause'of testator’s will, which is as follows, viz.: “ In the second place I direct and will that my children shall live together and occupy together my homestead including the entire Seventh street property for the period of fifteen years after my death at least, and as much longer as meets with the approval of the majority of my children ; a majority of my children in the meantime shall have the right to partition or sell the whole or any portion of the <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>homestead property.

    <p class="summary" id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[156,563,1183,724]]]'>Viewing this clause of the will by itself we fail to perceive anything to warrant the construction contended for by the accountants. The subject of the clause is the homestead property, and standing alone this part of the will does not intimate that testator had any other property real or personal. The testator “ directed and willed ” that his children should live together and occupy together his homestead. Did he intend that his children should live together in idleness, to sit down and eat up the property his industry had gathered together? From the above clause alone we cannot draw such a conclusion. In it we see only a direction that his children should live together, without any provision for their maintenance, further than a grant of a right to occupy the homestead property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b455-6" data-blocks='[["BL_455.6",455,[156,1296,1183,354]]]'>The clause of this will next to the last is, we think, in direct conflict with accountants’ interpretation of that above quoted. The clause referred to is as follows, viz.: “ In the next place I will and direct that my personal estate, after the payment of all my debts, shall be divided among my heirs, share and share alike, and my real estate after the expiration of the time herein named for the occupancy of the homestead by my children.”</p>

Moreover, with the exceptions particularly set forth in other parts of the will, it is clear from this clause that the main intent of the testator was an equal division of his property among his children; but if the household in the homestead was to be maintained out of testator’s estate, no division could be had, for it was in the power of a majority of the children to continue that household for the period of fifteen years at least after testator’s death, and as much longer as they might see fit. In other words, the majority could consume not only their own share of the estate but also the shares of all the <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>others, who either from choice or necessity should not form a part of the homestead household. We think the will is so free from ambiguity on the point in question that it is not necessary to consider the evidence taken as to the surroundings of the testator when it was made.] 1</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b456-5" data-blocks='[["BL_456.5",456,[278,660,1184,868]]]'>It is contended that even though the .accountants erred in their construction of the will, that the other beneficiaries are estopped from objecting to the credits for the household expenses. The evidence, however, does not disclose facts essential to an estoppel. The accountants occupied the homestead with their families. One of the other children of testator was not a member of testator’s family at the time of his death, nor an inmate of the household afterwards. The other children left shortly after testator’s death. It does not appear that any of the children of testator induced accountants to expend any of the sums for which credit is claimed or that they had any knowledge until this account was filed that the accountants were maintaining the homestead household out of funds of their father’s estate. [In view of the evidence therefore and of the will itself we conclude that the credits referred to in the first exception were properly stricken out of the executor’s account.] 1</p>

[The payments made to distributees, which ought here to be considered, are such only as were made from money received by legatees other than the executors, for they should not have taken any part of their shares out of the estate while debts remained unpaid.] 3 The learned auditor, we think, was overstriet in beginning the calculation of interest on February 5, 1876. The executors could reasonably be indulged after that time long enough to enable them to prepare and file their account. We have accordingly commenced the calculation of interest on April 11, 1876. While it is considered that the executors <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>must be charged with interest on yearly balances, because those balances should have been applied on the indebtedness of the estate, and because there was undue delay in filing their account after all indebtedness had been paid, yet, in view of the fact that this is not a final but only a partial account, we are of the opinion that the calculation should be made only up to the date of filing the account. The presumption is that accountants are not chargeable with interest after that date and during the pendency of proceedings on exceptions: Hoopes v. Brinton, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%2073" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 W. 73">8 W. 73</a>; McElhenny’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/46/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="46 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="420648" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0350-01">46 Penn. St. 350</a> ; Dietterick v. Heft, 5 Idem 94. True, this presumption may be overcome by circumstances, as in Yundt’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/13/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="13 Pa. 575" data-case-ids="964907" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0575-01">13 Penn.

St. 151</a>. But as the determination of it depends largely upon facts concerning which no evidence has been adduced, no decision is here made as to whether the executors ought to be charged with interest on the moneys in their hands as shown by this account, since the date it was filed, but that question is left to be determined when a further or final account shall have been filed. Other exceptions to the auditor’s report were filed by the accountants, but have been withdrawn; we will therefore proceed to the consideration of the exceptions to their report, filed on behalf of the legatees......</p>

    <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.7",460,[280,1141,1180,291]]]'>Upon a careful examination of this case, we are of opinion that the conclusions of the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court are correct, and we deem it unnecessary to consider at length the several- assignments of error, as in so doing we would but reiterate the views so well expressed in the opinion filed.</p>
    <p id="b460-7" data-blocks='[["BL_460.8",460,[274,1452,1188,1024]],["BL_461.1",461,[128,400,1189,823]]]'>The learned court was certainly right in refusing to allow the accountants a credit for the living expenses of the testator’s family, after his death, under the second clause of his will. “ I direct and will,” says the testator, “ that my children shall live together,'and occupy together my homestead, including the entire Seventh street property, for the period of fifteen years after my death at least, and as much longer as meets with the approval of a majority of my children.” This provision of the will is certainly plain ; there is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the language of the testator, which calls for explanation, nor is there in the context any repugnancy which requires construction, to reconcile even a seeming inconsistency. The testator’s plainly expressed wish is, that his children should not be separated by his death, but that they might “ live together and occupy together ” the old homestead. He doubtless desired that, as long as a majority of his children was satisfied, the family relation might, for the benefit of his unmarried children, be maintained after his death as before ; but there is not the slightest suggestion by the testator that the family was not to be self-supporting. The continuance of <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>the family relation in the joint occupancy of the homestead was one thing, and the expenses incident to the support of the family quite another. If the testator had really intended that the entire living expenses of a family of eight persons should be supplied out of his estate for fifteen years or more, it is most remarkable that he did not say so ; it is scarcely probable that he would leave a matter of that importance to mere inference. Indeed, if the testator had so intended, we might reasonably expect to find some portion of his estate set apart as the source of these supplies. No such provision is made however; on the contrary, he provides that after his debts are paid his personal estate shall at once be divided among his heirs, share and share alike ; and his real estate, which is not shown to be sufficiently productive for the purpose suggested, to be equally divided, after the expiration of the time named for the occupancy of the homestead by his children.</p>
    <p id="b461-5" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[130,1231,1189,762]]]'>The manifest and main design of the testator was, with certain exceptions, particularly designated, to effect an equal distribution of his estate among his children; and that distribution, as far as the personal estate is concerned, was to be immediate, or as soon as the claims of his creditors could be satisfied. The theory of the will advanced by the appellants is clearly inconsistent with the obvious purpose of the testator. If the majority of the heirs might maintain themselves out of the funds of the estate for fifteen years, or as much longer as they should themselves see fit, an equal distribution of the estate is made impossible; for, as the learned judge of the court below well said, they could consume not only their own shares, but also the shares of the others, who either from choice or necessity should not form a part of the homestead household.</p>
    <p id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.6",461,[130,2009,1189,454]],["BL_462.1",462,[288,401,1184,457]]]'>It is admitted that John W. Walker and Thomas M. Walker, the executors, have been in the possession of the testator’s real estate since his death, and that with the exception of the Seventh street property they are chargeable with the rents and profits received therefrom; but, as by the terms of the will, the real estate was neither given into their charge nor converted into personalty, the rents and profits, and also the taxes, insurance and repairs, were improperly embraced in the account. These items were therefore rightly excluded from the <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>account by the court. It is plain, that the testator' did not contemplate that the executors would be chargeable with the payment of the taxes, repairs, etc. They were not authorized to receive the rents or profits of the real estate, and the entire personalty was to be distributed as soon as the debts were paid; hence they would have no funds in hand with which to discharge these incidental charges upon the realty during the fifteen years or more of the occupancy of the homestead by the testator’s family.</p>
    <p id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[287,866,1190,814]]]'>As the realty as well as the personalty was to be equally divided among the testator’s children, and the' creditors have all been paid, it would be just and fair enough perhaps, if the parties were willing, to allow the rents and profits received, and the taxes, insurance and repairs expended, to be adjusted in the account; but it was contended, on the part of the appellees, that the accountants had not in fact charged themselves with all the rents which they had actually received, and as the accountants were not legally bound to charge themselves, with any of these rents, it was, of course, futile and useless to enter into a contest of the account respecting the rents alleged to have been omitted. The only practicable method of procedure, therefore, was to turn the parties over to a forum which had proper jurisdiction of the subject matter in dispute, and in which their respective rights might be ascertained and properly adjudicated.</p>
