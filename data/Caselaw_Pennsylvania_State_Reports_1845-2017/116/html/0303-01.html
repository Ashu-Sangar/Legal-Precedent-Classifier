The manner of the eviction was as follows : The owner of the adjoining premises, intending to erect a house on that lot, caused the party or eastern wall of the first story of the main building and the said wall of the first and second stories of the back building of the house mentioned in the lease, to be condemned by the person or persons entitled to determine such questions under the laws of Pennsylvania, and the same were adjudged to be insufficient for the purpose of a party wall, and' the said adjoining owner was authorized to remove the same. Pursuant thereto, on or before the 27th day of April, the said adjoining owner did remove the said walls, and thereby left the rooms of the house described in the lease open and exposed to be entered into at pleasure, and so •open to wind and rain as to render it impossible to use the house as a dwelling; and displaced and cut the pipes for water and gas and the flues for heating the house, so that the same could not be used as a dwelling-house. Thereupon the defendant removed from the dwelling after notifying the plaintiff and he failed to protect him in the enjoyment of the premises, paying rent up to the time when the house became uninhabitable.</p>

The defendant in his affidavit set up for defence that before the rent became due the party wall was condemned under the Act of 20th May, 1857, as insufficient for the support of a building proposed to be erected by the owner of the adjoining lot; that the adjoining owner, under the authority of law, removed the wall and proceeded to the erection of a new one, and that the effect of this was to render the demised premises unfit for use as a dwelling; that the defendant paid the rent until the house became uninhabitable and was obliged to and actually did remove therefrom.

    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[142,675,1190,1643]]]'>We do not think this view of the case can be sustained. The right of the adjoining owner to maintain the party wall in such form as to support the building he proposed to erect, was not in any proper sense a defect in the plaintiff’s title. The right arises out of a provision of the law, to which all owners of real property in the city of Philadelphia are subject, and in reference to which all conveyances of land, whether in fee or for years, must be supposed to have been made and accepted. Titles to real estate are everywhere held subject to such constitutional and legal conditions affecting the enjoyment thereof, as shall from time to time be established; all are subject to the commonwealth’s right of eminent domain and to such statutory and other police regulations as affect the safety, health and good order of society; one tract of land, from its mere location with respect to another, may owe it a servitude, and one man must so use his property as not unnecessarily to injure another. These are not defects in title; they are simply the legal conditions which affect the owner’s enjoyment of his own property. If the conveyance in this case, ihstead of a lease for years, had been in fee, with the usual covenants for title and enjoyment, it would certainly not be pretended that the existence of the party wall, or its removal, would have constituted such a breach as would have sustained an action. The title, for anything that appears, was perfect under the law, and the possession was in accordance with the title. If the party wall may be called an encumbrance at all, it is an encumbrance in the same sense as a public road, of which, as it affects the physical condition of the property, the purchaser must take notice. Such an encumbrance would not be within the meaning of the ordinary covenant of title or of quiet enjoyment: Memmert v. McKeen, <a href="/pa/112/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="112 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="546828" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0315-01">112 Penn. St. 315</a>.</p>

Jayne, <a href="/pa/23/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="23 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="974024" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0034-01">23 Penn. St. 34</a>, is no invasion of the absolute right of property; it prescribes simply a rule for the con<a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>venient, economical, and safe enjoyment of property by the <em>owner; </em>and with reference to which, all conveyances must be supposed to have been made. It must therefore be assumed, that this contract of lease was made with reference to such a possible contingency as did in fact occur. The lessee might have protected himself by a special contract, but he did not, and therefore cannot complain. The act of the adjoining owner was a lawful act, performed in a lawful and proper manner, and the lessor took no part in the performance of it, indeed, was wholly powerless to prevent it. The loss of the rent must fall either on the lessor or the lessee and as the latter is under a voluntary, express and absolute promise to pay the rent, he ought to perform his agreement, when the lessor is in no default whatever.</p>
