There is no allegation that the ,commissioners at the time this accident happened had not maintained the bridge as it had been there before, and as it had been ordained from the beginning; but the allegation of the plaintiff is, that the bridge was insufficient, and the complaint is that the bridge was insufficient because it was too narrow, and because there was not a sidewalk there of adequate width, and because there was not a proper guard or protection between the wagon road and the sidewalk for foot passengers. If it were not for the act of Assembly', to which reference has been made, the court would say to you that the plaintiff had not made out a case, nor had shown that the county was negligent inasmuch as want or repair has not been shown. In 1870 the legislature of this state enacted that the commissioners of Lehigh county were <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>authorized to erect foot sidewalks adjoining the stone bridge across the Jordan in Allentown — this bridge. The plaintiff took the position that this act of Assembly compelled the commissioners to build the sidewalk, and that because they did not do it the county was to be held liable in that the commissioners were negligent. The defendant took the ground that it was left discretionary with the commissioners to exercise their own judgment, whether the sidewalk was necessary or not, and that it was not for this court nor for you jurors to say whether it was necessary or not; that the law lodged that discretion with the commissioners. The court rule against both parties as respects these several positions. The view the court entertain and instruct you to follow on this point, is this: That it was not the absolute duty of the commissioners, after the passage of the act of 1870, to build a sidewalk or sidewalks, but they had the authority and the privilege and the power to do so, and that if the bridge as it was then, and as it was in 1888, was insufficient so as reasonably to accommodate the ordinary travel, and the building of the sidewalk thus became necessary in order to accommodate the public travel, then you may say that negligence has been shown.....</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.5",154,[259,1517,1185,604]]]'>The county, it seems, maintained this bridge up to 1883 as it had been for many years. They had the authority .to build a sidewalk. You are to consider that and you are to consider the travel, which it is shown there was in 1883 at this bridge in question. Also the uses to which it was ordinarily put. Then you are to ask yourselves the question whether it has been shown that the county should before 1883 have built this sidewalk, and whether the omission to do so was negligence. If it is not shown that the county was negligent in leaving the bridge in the condition it was, then the plaintiff has no case, although she may have been hurt. In that event you will then return a verdict for the defendant.</p>

In other words, there may be places in remote districts of the county, or in small towns, or in streets in large towns, where it could not be reasonably required that guards should be put up along a bridge or between the sidewalk and the wagon road. At many places it could not be said that it was reasonably necessary that there should be any footwalk at all, separate from the wagon road, while at other places where the travel was great and other circumstances concurred, it might be said there ought to have been a footwalk, and that the travel was such that there ought to be some guard or protection between the footwalk and the wagon road.

It must certainly be conceded that the county of Lehigh is not now to be convicted of negligence, because the commissioners, in the exercise of a proper discretion, failed to anticipate the growth of the city, or, in the exercise of that discretion, have failed to determine the necessity for a new bridge or for such additions or improvements as may be supposed to be necessary to meet the demands of a greatly increased trav el upon it. Nor can it be said that the commissioners should have anticipated that horses would become frightened and unmanageable on the wagon road, and would break away from control on the bridge and that injuries ¿night thereby be inflicted on the foot passengers. It is unreasonable to suppose that such a condition of things should have been foreseen as the result of their failure and neglect to erect a rail or barrier above the curb. As well, indeed with much more propriety, might we hold the city of Philadelphia bound to erect barriers on either side of Chestnut street, to protect the people who from day to day throng the sidewalks of that street. Runaway horses are liable to come upon the pavement in all streets, and the authorities are not bound to guard against this mere possibility.</p>

By this statute it is enacted: “ That the commissioners of Lehigh county are hereby authorized to erect foot sidewalks, adjoining the stone bridge crossing Jordan creek at the Hamilton street crossing, in the city of Allentown, county of Lehigh, Pennsylvania, at the cost and expense of the county.”</p>

If the provision is held to be imperative, it must be upon some rule of construction which will impart to the words an interpretation beyond their usual and ordinary signification. The <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>comity commissioners were by the express terms of the act simply “authorized,” not required, to erect foot sidewalks adjoining the stone bridge at the cost and expense of the county. No time was indicated within which the work was to be performed, nor is ‘the manner or method of the performance in any way prescribed, or any particular fund in the immediate control of the state appropriated to the purpose. The matter is left wholly to the judgment and discretion of the county commissioners, who, as the representatives of the people and of the public in the administration of the affairs of the county, might be supposed to have especial facilities for knowing, not only when the public interests required, but when the county was prepared, to undertake the proposed improvement; and the legislative intent doubtless was, that the powers conferred would be exercised at such time and in such manner as the public interests would require and the ability of the county would permit, and of this the commissioners were to judge.</p>

The general rule in such cases is thus stated in Carr v. Northern Liberties, <a href="/pa/35/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="35 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="990496" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0324-01">35 Penn. St. 324</a>: “ Where any person has a right to demand the exercise of a public function, and there is an officer or set of officers authorized to exercise that function, there the right and the authority give rise to the duty; but when the right depends upon the grant of authority, and that authority is essentially discretionary, no legal duty is imposed.” Therefore it was held that an action would not lie against a municipal corporation invested with the power to construct sewers for neglecting to construct a proper system of drainage, in consequence of which a citizen’s store was overflowed and his goods damaged. “We do not admit,” said Chief Justice Lowkib, “that the grant of authority to the corporation to construct sewers amounts to an imposition of a duty to do it.” To the same effect is Grant v. City of Erie, 69 Idem 420.</p>

City of Chicago, <a href="/ill/20/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="20 Ill. 445" data-case-ids="2595813" data-case-paths="/ill/20/0445-01">20 Ill. 445</a>, is directly in point. The city of Chicago, among other powers, had express authority to remove all obstructions in the harbor, but it was held, that if the city had never undertaken to exer<a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>cise the power, it was not liable to a party who had sustained damage from a sunken hulk remaining there. If, however, says Catón, J., the city had entered upon the work of removing the hulk, and in doing so had carelessly left it in an exposed-condition, by reason of which the navigator’s vessel was injured, it would be liable for such negligence. So, too, we apprehend if the county of Lehigh had actually undertaken the erection of the footwallc outside of the bridge, it would have been liable for injuries from the negligent performance of the work. But as the work was never undertaken, no such question arises. *</p>
    <p id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[154,976,1187,608]]]'>The learned court instructed the jurors that, apart from the special statute of 1870, no negligence of the county was shown, and that under the statute it was not the absolute duty of the county to build the footwalks on the outside of the bridge; yet notwithstanding this, that inasmuch as the commissioners had the authority to do so, if they (the jurors) believed the bridge was insufficient reasonably to accommodate the travel and in their judgment the sidewalks were necessary for the public accommodation, they might find the county guilty of negligence. This was simply substituting the discretion of jury for that of the commissioners, and in the light of the authorities we have cited was clear error.</p>
