The plaintiff was a locomotive engineer in the employ of the defendants, and ran a freight train, No. 71, between Philadelphia and South Bethlehem, on the North Penn, branch of said railroad. On the morning of February 10, 1881, his engine was struck and demolished by a passenger Express, known as No. 8, in which collision he received serious and permanent injuries for which he subsequently brought this suit.</p>

M. and ran on schedule time to Perkasie, where the conductor was ordered to meet and pass No. 8 at Rockhill, which is not a station, but a telegraph office and siding for passing trains. On nearing Rockhill, the engineer and conductor of No. 71 observed the signal board turned in their favor as a signal to enter the siding ; and as the engine slacked its speed, the conductor alighted and inquired of the operator “how No. 8 was,” and was informed that No. 8 had left Quakertown four minutes before. The conductor then ordered the brakeman to flag No. 8, but before the brakeman had walked three car-lengths forward, No. 8 came down the track at a high rate of speed and struck No. 71 as it was entering the switch.

    <p id="b664-5" data-blocks='[["BL_664.5",664,[241,475,1192,1541]]]'>The duty which the law requires shall be performed by á railroad company differs materially in the case of passengers from that of employees. With passengers the company contracts that it will carry them to their destination without exposing them to danger by the acts either of themselves or their employees. With employees there is no such rule. All known dangers that are incident to the employment are undertaken at the risk of the employee. As a general rule the employee cannot recover for an injury sustained by him in the course of his employment not received directly from the employer himself. There are exceptions to this rule; first, where the injury is the result of improper machinery, tools or appliances furnished the employee by his employer; and second,, where the injuries result from the incompetency of a fellow servant employed by the master who knew of his ineompetency at the time of his employment, or, by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence could have discovered it. There are other exceptions to the rule besides these general exceptions, growing out of the peculiar character of the business in and about which the employee is employed. Thus, in a railroad company which employs men in the running of trains, it is the duty of the company to furnish them with rules and regulations for the running of trains which are ordinarily safe. They must furnish them also with time tables for the running of trains, which will enable them to perform the duties incident to their employment with ordinary safety. In case of delays, or of trains running on special time, or on a special schedule, it is the duty of the company to direct the trains by such orders as will conduct them to their destination avoiding ordinary and known dangers and risks.</p>

[It is the duty of the company to arrange and promulgate the general timé table of the railroad and where there is a variation from the general time table for special purposes, it is the act of the company and it is obliged to promulgate it. It is the duty of the railroad company to see and know that its general time table is brought to the knowledge of its servants who are to square their actions to it. It is just as much its duty to do so with reference to a variation from it, which is but a special time table. Whomsoever the company uses to bring such time tables or variations from its regular time tables to the notice of its servants, does so in the company’s place and stead, inasmuch as it is the company’s duty to see it done and done effectually. The act, therefore, of the person delegated to do that which it is the company’s duty to do, is the act of the company itself, and if the person so delegated performs the duty carelessly and negligently it is the negligence of the company.] 3</p>

It is at times necessary to do so, and the necessity is so frequent that it falls within the class of occurrences that a railroad servant is bound to accept in the course of his employment. All that is required of the company is due care and diligence in giving notice of the change, and in running the train upon the changed time. If, after the company has made the change, they make use of the usual appliances for promulgating notice of the change, they have done all the law requires of them. If through the fault or neglect of a telegraph operator, conductor or other employee, the orders of the company do not reach those for whom they are intended and injury results, that is not the negligence of the company. The duty of the company was performed when they took the usual methods through its delegated agent to promulgate the order to those whom it affected, and if, through the negligence of those whose duty it was simply to act as the messengers of the company in conveying the orders of the company to those for whom they are intended, the orders were not delivered, or were not understood, that is the negligence of the fellow servant for which the company would not be liable.

Pie afterwards testified in his subsequent examination, in correction of that portion of his testimony, saying that it was not until after he had telegraphed to Rockhill and Perkasie, that he tried to reach No. 8 with orders to stop at Rockhill and there to pass No. 71.

If that was sufficient, if that was all that was required of him to do according to the evidence of the usual methods of running trains upon single track railroads, then John J. Sellers was not guilty of any negligence in the sending of that dispatch to Rockhill and not sending it to the station above. If, however, you believe, from the testimony of the witnesses who were upon the stand that the sending of the message to Rockhill above was not the full performance of what was required under the circumstances, and in running trains upon a single track road, then you will have to inquire further and determine whether John J.

In this connection you will remember that Mr. Bertolette testifies that he saw all the agents along the railroad at one time and instructed them in regard to their duty. What he says specifically in regard to any instructions given by him to Roth, the operator at Rockhill, concerning his duty upon an occasion such as this, about flagging an approaching train by going up the track I do not remember. You will recall his testimony and if you find that Bertolette ever gave such instruction as that to Roth, the agent in charge of Rock-hill station, and Roth, on that morning did not obey it, then it was the negligence of the agent at Rockhill that occasioned the injury.</p>

Sellers was the negligence of the company. As I said to you at the beginning of my charge, it is a railroad company’s duty to promulgate any orders in regard to any variation of time in the running of trains.]4 Train No. 8 was not on time; it had left Bethlehem, I think, 30 minutes late. The other train at Perkasie was also late. I do not recollect the testimony exactly, but I think that one of the witnesses testified that they came to Perkasie late. Another of the witnesses, Magargle, says that he does not remember whether they were late in running in to Perkasie or not, but that they were late in leaving Perkasie. They received specific orders from John J. Sellers to go on. It was his duty that morning to direct the running of the trains. It was not in the power of the men on train No. 71 to know the whereabouts of train No. 8.</p>

Seifert, the plaintiff, was the engineer of No. -71 freight train, and was injured by No. 8 passenger train colliding with it just as it was entering the switch at Rockhill to allow No. 8 to pass. Roth, the station-agent, had been ordered by wire to “ stop and hold No. 8 Express at Rockhill until <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>No. 71 local freight arrives.” When he received the order he proceeded to flag No. 8 with the red signal. This was all he was required to do by the rules of the company in obedience to the telegram. This fully appears by the testimony of Mr. Sellers, the train-dispatcher, who sent the telegram, and who was called as a witness by the defendant company. We mmt look elsewhere for a solution of this difficulty.</p>

In the absence of special orders, No. 71 would, under the rules of the company, have taken the siding at Perkasie and have waited until No. 8 passed. The accident was the direct result of the order from the office in Philadelphia to the conductor and engineer of 71, which was as follows: “you will meet and pass No. 8 Express- at Rockhill.” It remains to be seen whether the ■defendant company is responsible to the plaintiff below for the injuries he received in consequence of this order.</p>

    <p id="b676-7" data-blocks='[["BL_676.7",676,[265,1352,1188,1121]]]'>No. 71, local freight train, with the plaintiff below on board 'as engineer, left Philadelphia at 3:30 A. M. for South Bethlehem, and arrived at Perkasie, two miles and a half south of Rockhill. This portion of the road at that time had but a single track. When No. 71 arrived at Perkasie it was behind time, and it was the duty of the conductor to do one of two things, viz.: either to take the long siding at Sellersville, or wire to Philadelphia for orders. He chose the latter course. He went into the office at Perkasie, called up the Philadelphia office by telegraph, and asked for orders for No. 71. The Perkasie operator was asked by Philadelphia how soon No. 71 would be ready to leave, and the answer was wired back, “ in a few minutes.” Then at 8 :55 A. M. the operator at Philadelphia sent the following telegram to the agent at Rockhill: ■“Agent Rockhill: Stop and hold No. 8 Express at Rockhill until No. .71 local arrives there.” Signed “ W. Bertolette.” Bertolette was the train-dispatcher at Philadelphia, and had full authority to start out and control the trains even to the suspension of the regular schedules. The telegram was signed by Sellers, his assistant, for Bertolette; but that is immaterial. Sellers had the same power as Bertolette, in the absence of the latter.</p>

      <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>No. 71 was going North. No. 8 Express passenger train should have left South Bethlehem at 8:30 A. m. It was-delayed for connections and did not leave until about 9. It was behind time as before observed, and having the right of way ran at a high rate of speed. It does not appear that any attempt was made to notify No. 8 of the whereabouts of No. 71, until the order to start the lattter. train had been given. Then an attempt was made to intercept it by calling up the operators along the line above Rockhill, but it met with no response. It was alleged the wires were not working above Rockhill, and there was a dense fog along the line between that place and Bethlehem but none in Philadelphia. No. 8 having the right of way and no warning of danger, kept on at a speed of from 30 to 35 miles an hour, until it reached Rock-hill. The fog prevented the danger signal there from being seen, and No. 8 struck No. 71 just as the latter was entering the switch. When No. 71 arrived at Rockhill, the engineer and conductor thereof observed the signal board at the telegraph office turned in their favor as a signal to enter the siding. As the engine slacked its speed the conductor jumped off and inquired of the operator “'how No.- 8 was?” He was. informed that it had left Quakertown four minutes ago. The distance between the two places was only two or three miles. The conductor then told his brakeman to go and flag No. 8. It was too late. Before the brakeman could proceed any distance the collision occurred.</p>

The train-dispatcher in Philadelphia doubtless expected that No. 71 would be safe on the siding at Rockhill before No. 8 should arrive there. And so it would, had it started at once upon receiving its order. It will be remembered that before issuing the order to 71, the dispatcher asked how soon it would be ready to start. The reply was “in a few minutes.” With the knowledge that 71 could not start immediately, the order was given to proceed. No time was limited. In point of fact, No. 71 did not move for about twenty minutes. The delay was in part caused by the pulling out of a drawhead. No. 71 did not ask for fresh orders before starting, nor was it bound to; it had told the dispatcher it would be ready to start in a few minutes, <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>and. it did so.

    <p id="b678-5" data-blocks='[["BL_678.5",678,[266,508,1181,446]]]'>Just here is tbe pincb of the case. If Bertolette had ordered No. 71 to proceed in five minutes, or if not ready by that time, to take the siding, there would have been no collision. B ut he left the whole matter indefinite, depending upon what the conductor of 71 might regard as a “few minutes,” when a delay of a single minute might involve life or death. In every view which we can take of this case we regard this order as an act of negligence and the proximate cause of the collision.</p>

That rule rests upon the sound principle that each one who enters upon the service of another takes on himself all the ordinary risks of the employment in which, he engages, and that the negligent acts of his fellow workmen in the general course of his employment are within the ordinary risks: Lehigh Valley Coal Co. v. Jones, <a href="/pa/86/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="86 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1056627" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0432-01">86 Penn. St. 432</a>. To constitute fellow-servants the employees need not be at the same time engaged in the same particular work. It is sufficient if they are in the employment of the same master, engaged in the same common work and performing duties and services for the same general purpose. The rule is the same, although the one injured may be inferior in grade, and is subject to the direction and control of the superior whose act caused the injury, provided they are both co-operating to effect the same common object: Keystone Bridge Company v. Newberry, <a href="/pa/96/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="96 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="494591" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0246-01">96 Penn. St. 246</a>. Thus, we have repeatedly held that a “ mining boss,” under the act of March 3, 1870, is a fellow workman with the miners, and that the mine owners are not responsible for his negli<a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>gence: Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co. v.

This, however, is in part owing to the fact that the duty of appointing a mining boss is imposed upon the mine owners by the act of assembly,- hence the responsibility of the latter would seem to cease when they had exercised due care in the selection of that person. Be that as it may, it is well settled that mere difference in rank or grade does not change the rule.</p>

Thus, the master owes to every employee, the duty of providing a reasonably safe place in which to work, and reasonably safe instruments, tools and machiney with which to work. This is a direct, personal and absolute obligation; and, while the master may delegate these duties to an agent, such agent stands in the place of his principal and the latter is responsible for the acts of such agent. And where the master or superior places the entire charge of his business, or a distinct branch of it, in the hands of an agent or subordinate, exercising no discretion or oversight of his own, the master is held liable for the negligence of such agent or subordinate: Mullan v.

It is equally clear that it was its duty to frame and promulgate such rules and schedules for the moving of its trains, as would afford reasonable safety to the operatives who were engaged in moving them. This is a direct, positive duty which the company owed its employees, and for the failure to perform which it would be responsible to any person injured as a consequence thereof, whether such person be a passenger or an employee. It would be a monstrous doctrine to hold that a railroad company could frame such schedules as would inevitably or even probably result in collisions and loss of life. This is a personal, positive duty; and, while a corporation is compelled to act through agents, yet the agents in performing duties of this character stand in the place of and represent the principal.

He could send a train out on schedule time or he could hold it back. He could change the schedule time or make new 'schedules as the exigency of the case required. He could send a train out without schedule, and direct its movements from his office in Philadelphia. When he issued an order the train was bound to move as he directed. The engineer and conductor had but one duty and that was, obedience. In Slater v. Jewett, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20N.Y.%2061" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="84 N.Y. 61">84 N.

They are in the same common employment, and are laboring together to the same end, under orders from superior authority.
