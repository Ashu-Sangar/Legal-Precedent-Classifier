On September 11, 1883, an account of the executors of said will was filed, showing a balance due the estate which was referred to Mr. Joseph Kalbfus, as an auditor to make distribution. At the hearing before the auditor, Miss Stumpf appeared by attorneys and claimed support and maintenance for the said child, under the agreement above quoted.

      <em>First. </em>That the agreement proven was a valid contract, having been entered into in consideration of the settlement of the suit for breach of promise to marry, as well as the case charging fornication and bastardy, and it secured a maintenance for the child, and was not therefore the simple settlement, or stifling of a criminal prosecution; that it was also continuing and bound the executors of the decedent, although they were not expressly bound by its terms.</p>

      <em>Second. </em>That, as the agreement specified no definite time during which the support was to continue or the amount of money to be advanced for that purpose, and as a parent would be liable for the support and maintenance of a child during its minority, and as in this agreement the mother was to be protected and relieved from such liability for support, the intent and purpose of the agreement were to cover at least one year of the minority of the child, or until its death, should it die before reaching the age of twenty-one. years; also, that the terms, “ and to see that it is well taken care of,” meant and were intended to secure such a reasonable support according to the means of Dr. Flentje, as his habits of life would suggest. “ Your auditor, considering the evidence as produced and his own experience, the fact that, as this child grows older it will in all probability by its own labor be enabled to- supply its increasing <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>needs, finds that the sum of three thousand dollars should be retained in the hands of these executors, from the interest or principal of which the fixed sum of two hundred dollars shall be paid annually for the maintenance and support of said child until it arrives at the age of twenty-one years, or until its death, should it die before that time.”</p>

The contract created no such relation. Nowhere does it say that Dr. Flentje is to be a vicarious parent. He does not stipulate for any control. But suppose this contract did create that relation; does it follow that the obligation of support would cease at the death of the parent? Not if an inheritable estate were'left.

The child was born in Germany, and under our bastardy laws Dr. Flentje was not liable for its support. Had he been liable, his liability extended only over seven years, and his death before that time would have released both himself and any sureties in a bastardy bond given upon conviction in the Quarter Sessions: City v. Haslitt, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Phila.%20138" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 Phila. 138">14 Phila., 138</a>; and it must be presumed that the settlement was made and the agreement drawn in view of the fact that Dr. Flentje was not legally liable, if liable at all, beyond seven years or his lifetime if he died sooner, and was to be treated as a personal contract not binding upon his executors.</p>

    <p id="b70-9" data-blocks='[["BL_70.10",70,[236,1613,1187,868]],["BL_71.1",71,[181,424,1188,303]]]'>The general rule is that, to the extent of the assets that come to their hands, the personal representatives of a decedent are responsible on all his contracts, whether named therein or not, and whether the breach occurs in his lifetime or after-wards : Add. on Con. 2nd Am. ed. 1059; 1 Pars. Con. 131; 2 Chit. Con. 11 Am. ed. 1406; 3 Wms. on Exrs. 6 Am. ed. 1825. To this general rule, however, there are several exceptions, mostly cases in the performance of which personal skill or taste is required. Where an executory contract is of a strictly personal nature, such as a contract “with an author for a specified work, the death of the writer before his book is completed absolutely determines the contract, unless what remains to be done — as, for example, the preparing of an index, etc. — can certainly be done to the same purpose by another.” The obvious reason of this is that neither of the contracting parties ever contemplated that the work contracted for should be written by any other than the author himself. For like <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>reason, contracts by physicians to cure a patient of a particular disease, contracts by teachers and masters to instruct their pupils or apprentices, promises of marriage, etc., are exceptions to the general rule: Pars.

There is nothing, either in the contract itself, or in the subject matter thereof, or in the relation of the contracting parties, to indicate that the testator’s undertaking was intended to be strictly personal. On the contrary, everything connected with it points to a continuing contract, binding on his executors so far as not performed by him in his lifetime.</p>

In consideration of which, Dr. Flentje, the testator, agreed to pay all the record costs incurred in both cases, — “ to relieve the said Adelaide from any cost or expense in the support and maintenance of said child, and to see that it was well taken care of,' and further to pay to said Adelaide thirty dollars in cash, in full settlement and satisfaction of all claims and matters between them.”</p>

It was claimed by appellant that in order to carry out testator’s part of the agreement, according to its true in<a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>tent and meaning, a portion of his estate, sufficient for the-purpose, should be set apart and the interest accruing therefrom applied to the support and maintenance of the child. The learned auditor being of opinion that the position thus-assumed was correct, reported in favor of setting apart $3,000 to be invested under the direction of the Court, and the interest accruing therefrom, from time to time, applied to the support and maintenance of the child until it attains its majority,, or during its life in case it should die before attaining the age-of twenty-one years. To this it was objected by the appelleesthat the agreement was strictly personal to the testator and not binding on his executors, and also that it was void, because the consideration, in part^at least, was illegal, and because it is too uncertain and indefinite as to the time the child was to be supported. The learned judge of the Common Pleas rightly held that the contract was not void for either of the reasons above stated; but he did hold, as we think erroneously, that it ceased to be operative upon the death of the testator. Speaking of the obligation assumed by the-testator, he says in his opinion sustaining exceptions to the auditor’s report: “ I take it he assumed the duties of a parent by his contract; and whether the obligation was to continue during the whole period of the child’s infancy, if the testator so long lived, is not now material to determine, because the testator having died, his duty and obligation of support, like that of a parent of a legitimate child, ceased at Iris-death. So long as he lived the contract was binding on'him in his relations of parent, created by the contract. If the child had been the legitimate issue of the testator, he could have disinherited it.”</p>

Bearing in mind that as mother of the illegitimate child appellant was bound to support and maintain it whether testator died during his minority or not, his agreement is, “ to relieve her from airy costs or expense in the support and maintenance of said child and to see that it is well taken care of.” There is nothing in the agreement to limit the operation of this covenant to the lifetime of testator. On the contraiy, the circumstances which led to its execution all go to show that <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>its purpose was to indemnify appellant and save her harmless from all costs and expenses incident to the support and maintenance of her.illegitimate offspring; and the language employed cannot be fairly construed to mean anything else. The agreement created a contract relation between appellant and the testator altogether different from the legal relation that exists between parent and child. For reasons hereinbefore suggested, we think the contract was a continuing one, binding on the executors so far as not performed by testator in his lifetime; and hence the conclusions of the learned auditor are substantially correct. The several specifications of error are therefore sustained.</p>
