Then by another clause he has the privilege of staying another five years. What, then is the extreme length of his term and option ? If the first term was for one year, with the privilege of another five years, he has had that. If the lease was not for one year, but for five years, with the privilege of five years more, he has been prematurely warned out. Because of ambiguity in the lease I have admitted testimony to explain it. Jones says he hired the place for five years, and would not have taken it unless for five years, with the privilege of five years more. If you find that the term was for one year, with the privilege of five years, you will find for the plaintiff.

It is true that such rulings have been made in England, but there are other and more numerous decisions the other way.

Chawton, 1 Q. B. 247. How much influence the benevolent object to be attained had in the result we do not know. However, the judgment was followed in Doe dem. Chadborn v. Green, 9 Q.

On the other hand, it was held that a tenancy from year to year may be determined by either party at the end of the first or any subsequent year, unless the parties use expressions showing that they contemplated a tenancy for two years at least: Doe dem.
