The Act contains no express provision as to costs in proceedings under section 2, and it is only by inference that it is sought to extend it to the payment of costs. The Court will not impute to the legislature an intent to make the county liable for costs where it is not so expressed in the Act: York County v.

But it is claimed the plaintiff in error may recover by virtue of the Act of 11th May, 1874. This Act was plainly intended not to create a new liability on the part of the county, but to alter the time when the county should pay in cases of felony where, by the Act of March 31, 1860, the county was previously liable: York County v.

All the offences triable under the act of 1861 are <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>indictable ; and, when such offences are tried oh indictment, in case of conviction of the decendant and his legal discharge without payment of costs, the county shall pay the costs of prosecution. The offences remain the same; the result of conviction is the same except the statutory limit as to place of imprisonment and the exemption of the county from payment of the bills of costs when the conviction is before a justice of the peace. A change of tribunal and a lawful conviction without the formality of indictment, the sentence to have like force and effect as if the proceeding were in the Court of Quarter Sessions, do not relieve the county from liability for costs imposed where a convicted party shall have been discharged according to law, without payment of costs. The statute making the county liable is not repealed by implication. Although conviction may be without indictment, the statute, in so providing, makes no change in the law relating to the offences and procedure other than is expressed.</p>
    <p id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[239,1294,1181,392]]]'>The defendant’s bill is not payable by the county, and the fees for his subpoena are included in his bill. This is recognized in section 63 of the act of 1860, relating to criminal procedure, and in section 1 of the act of 1873. The defendant- insists that it is not liable for the costs of the subpoena, thirty cents, which was given to the party who was charged with the larceny; and that sum must be deducted from the claim.</p>
    <p id="b86-6" data-blocks='[["BL_86.6",86,[503,1708,916,189]]]'>Judgment reversed, and judgment is now entered for the plaintiff for four and thirty-five hundredths dollars ($4.35), with costs, on the case stated.</p>
