All the evidence submitted to your auditor except the declaration or statement of Mr. Henderson to his son William was before the Supreme Court in another proceeding: Franklin’s App., 18 W. N. 245. There the court held that Mrs. Henderson was guilty of a wrongful" conversion of the trust fund, and held her estate liable in the sum of $8,000 damages. Also that “there is nothing in the case showing that she committed the tort by coercion of her husband.” Assuming therefore that Mrs. Henderson had this $3,000 at the time she converted the trust securities, is there sufficient evidence in the statement of Mr. Henderson, two days before he died, to his son, to show that he ever received this money and owed it to his wife?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b540-6" data-blocks='[["BL_540.6",540,[259,1394,1186,967]]]'>Before Mr. Nauman as executor can recover this claim, he must prove his right as a creditor with as much certainty and clearness as the wife of Mr. Henderson would have to prove her right as a creditor against her deceased husband’s estate, if living. Mr. Nauman as executor is her representative. The principal evidence here is a verbal statement or admission made by Mr. Henderson only two or three days before he died. 1 Greenl. Ev. § 200, says: “Such admissions should be received with great caution. The evidence, consisting as it does in mere repetition of oral statements, is subject to much imperfection and mistake; the party himself either being misinformed or not having clearly expressed his own meaning, or the witness having misunderstood him. It frequently happens that the witness by unintentionally altering a few of the expressions really used, gives an effect to the statement completely at variance with what the party really did say. But where the admission is deliberately made and precisely identified, the evidence it affords is often of the most satisfactory nature.”</p>

Mr. Henderson said it was in the safe. It was not there. There is no evidence that any such' note ever was made. The verbal admission before us is insufficient to justify the inference. If the note had been found, we might have known what the note was given for, when, and all about it. The note not being found where Mr. Henderson says it was, shows conclusively that he was mistaken in the most material part of his admission or statement. To ascertain the full effect of a verbal admission, the whole, that is, every part of that admission, must be considered together. One part may be favorable and another part unfavorable, and both parts in direct contradiction. of each other. There is no evidence to show what money Mr. Henderson ever borrowed from his wife, if he ever borrowed any at all. Though Mr. Henderson was unfortunate in business, he was always respected as an intelligent and good citizen, one who was familiar with customs and manner of doing business.</p>

    <p id="b543-5" data-blocks='[["BL_543.6",543,[167,456,1188,513]]]'>On August 5, 1881, Amos S. Henderson and Anne E. Henderson gave to the executor of the will of Anne Franklin, deceased, an acknowledgment that certain Treasury Notes to the amount of three thousand dollars had been changed, and that they had in their hands the sum of three thousand dollars, the interest thereof to be retained by said Anne during her life, and at her death the principal to be returned to the executor. That paper is silent as to when or by whom the Treasury Notes had been changed or converted, but it bound Amos S. Henderson for return or payment of the money.</p>
    <p id="b543-6" data-blocks='[["BL_543.7",543,[163,975,1187,565]]]'>Henderson was a banker, doing a large business, and the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court says, “ his creditors were legion; some two thousand aud one hundred presented their claims to the auditor for payment.” He died January 13, 1885, and his wife died in June following. She left no estate save that derived from insurance on the life of her husband. There is not a tittle of evidence that Mrs. Henderson was engaged in business, or in any way spent or lost money. The reasonable inference from the facts already mentioned is that she put the money into the care of her husband to be paid when required for distribution by the executor.</p>
    <p id="b543-7" data-blocks='[["BL_543.8",543,[158,1549,1189,613]]]'>Two or three days before Henderson died he told his son to bring from the bank three thousand dollars to pay a note he had given to his wife; but the son, not finding the note, did not take the money to his father as he had been requested. There is no other evidence that such note had been given to Mrs. Henderson. Treating the son’s testimony by itself “ the auditor was constrained to find the fact that the relation of debtor and creditor did not exist between Mr. Henderson and his wife in reference to this claim.” And if it was proper to so treat it, his finding would not be reversed, for facts found by an auditor and approved by the court below will not be disturbed except for manifest error.</p>

This is so reasonable that in the appellees’ argument it is said: “Further, Amos S. Henderson, at the time this conversation occurred with his son, was in the last hours of his life, after having passed through a long and <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>enfeebling illness. In bis debility he may have transiently-recollected something of his relations to these trust funds, and. vaguely recalled the receipt of August 5,1881, as a note given to Mrs. Henderson.” It may well be that he was mistaken as to the giving of a note, but not as to his obligation to pay the money, as evidenced by the receipt. In his last illness he desired to pay the money to his wife, the same he had obligated himself to pay at her death. It was money owing to the estate of Anne Franklin, deceased, and if he suffered it to be collected from his wife, or from her estate, Ms contract was broken. Almost his last wish was to protect her from annoyance by paying the money.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[247,1026,1191,1390]]]'>This court held in Franklin’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20W.N.C.%20245" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="18 W.N.C. 245">18 W. N. C. 245</a>, that Mrs. Henderson was liable because of her wrongful conversion of the Treasury Notes placed in her hands in trust. There was nothing to show that her husband was a party to the tort, nor was there question as to his liability to anybody. The receipt was pertinent evidence in that case touching the alleged conversion. The auditor remarks that all the testimony, except what Mr. Henderson said to his son, was before the Supreme Court, where it was held that Mrs. Henderson was guilty of conversion of the trust fund ; and he therefore considers whether there is “ sufficient evidence in the statement of Mr. Henderson, two days before he died, to his son, to show that he ever received this money and owed it to his wife.” This was a grave mistake. It mattered not in the disposition of Franklin’s Appeal whether Henderson had borrowed the money from his wife, or whether Mrs. Henderson had retained it in her own custody. Had all the evidence, properly or improperly, been before the court in the hearing of that case, all pertinent evidence must be considered in this. Upon the whole of the evidence pertinent to the inquiry whether Henderson received the money and owed it to his wife, the question must be answered. It is plain that the auditor’s finding was based on a fragment. He also put stress upon her conversion of the trust securities as inconsistent with a loan of the money to her husband. But after conversion there was nothing in the way of a loan to him more than to another person.</p>
