        "text": "Opinion,\nMr. Justice Sterrett :\nAfter providing for the payment of his debts, funeral expenses, etc., the testator directs his executors to convert all his property, real and personal, into money \u201cand divide the same among my children and legal heirs in such proportions so that if all notes I hold against them or any' of them my children .and heirs, and all moneys advanced to them or any of. them, my said children and heirs, that their shares or dividend of each amounts to the same, share and share alike.\u201d\nWhile the language thus employed by the testator to define his scheme of distribution, is not as well chosen as it might have been, it is very evident his intention was to effectuate substantial equality among all his children by taking into consideration not merely the residue that might be in the hands of his executors for distribution, but also the notes held by him against some of his children, and the amount each child had received, in testator\u2019s lifetime, in money or its equivalent. Notes, evidently those referred to in the clause above quoted, were found among testator\u2019s papers; and as to them there was no difficulty. The learned judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court added their face value to the adjusted balance in hands of the executors. The same course should have been pursued in regard to the money and personal property received by each of the chil.\u25a0dren, during their father\u2019s lifetime, and intended by him to be on account of their respective shares or portions of his estate. The court however came to the conclusion that the \u201c Family Book,\u201d containing detailed statements of personal property, including household and kitchen furniture, farming implements, stock, provisions, etc., with the value of each article attached, and some items of cash received by each of the children, was an ordinary book of accounts, creating the relation of debtor and creditor between each of them, respectively, and their .father; and, inasmuch as the claims were all barred by the statute \u00f3f limitations, they must be wholly disregarded in making distribution. In this we think there was error. The \u201c Family Book,\u201d containing statements above referred to in \u25a0 testator\u2019s handwriting, was found among his papers, and appears to contain internal evidence of intention on his part, that the memoranda therein contained should be ultimately used in making a just and equitable distribution of his estate among the children, and not as a book of accounts containing charges against each as an ordinary debtor.\nWith few exceptions, the entries in the book are without date. Under the name of each child the entries commence with, \u201c Catechism 18 cts.,\u201d \u201c Testament $1,\u201d followed by various other articles, to each of which is appended a cash value. At the beginning of the book is the following memorandum in testator\u2019s handwriting and signed by him, viz.: \u201c The contents of this book is what each one has received for outfit who have worked until they attained their majority. John, who was away three years before his majority, therefore shall be charged one hundred dollars for the three years. For that which is charged in the book no interest shall be reckoned, except what is more than nine hundred dollars, there they shall be reckoned.\u201d In the body of the book, under the beading \u201cJohn Leiby, his outfit,\u201d appears this entry: \u201c gone three years before his majority, $100.\u201d It is claimed that this memorandum was made not for the purpose of collecting the sum named from John, but with the view of ultimately treating it as an advancement and thus in connection with the \"notes, other entries, etc., in the Family Book, equalizing the respective shares or portions of the children. The general features of the book undoubtedly favor this contention.\nAgain, under the head of \u201c Isaac his things for outfit,\u201d is this memorandum: \u201c In money paid to Isaac out of the large book brought forward $186.17.\u201d In testator\u2019s \u201c large book \u201d or ledger, that sum appears as balance due by Isaac on settlement of certain business transactions between him and his father, and underneath, these words: \u201c This is written in the little book against Isaac for inheritance.\u201d These entries evidently mean that the cash balance on the ledger at that time against Isaac, was transferred to the family book for the purpose of recording it there as part of the amount advanced to him, as cash or its equivalent, and to be accounted for thereafter as an advancement. Without referring to other features of the family book indicative of its purpose, we are satisfied it was kept by the testator, not as an ordinary account book containing charges against his children as his debtors, but as a memorandum of personal property, etc., received by each of them by way of advancement, and to be accounted for as such in final settlement and distribution of his. estate.\nFrom the language employed by testator in the clause of his will above quoted where he speaks of money advanced to his children, notes held by him, etc.,\"we would naturally expect to find, among his private papers, not only the notes to which he refers, but also some statement or memorandum evidencing the several amounts referred to and intended to be taken into consideration, as advancements, in carrying out his scheme of distribution. As to the notes, there is of course no question; and, in view of all the circumstances, we think it is sufficiently clear that the family book was intended to show the several amounts to which he refers as having been received by his children in the nature of advancements, either in money or property at the cash value affixed thereto. We are therefore of opinion that the book should be resorted to for that purpose. If it is found to contain any entries that are manifest errors or mistakes they should be corrected. The respective entries under date of April 1, 1880, purporting to be footings of each account to that date, appear to be unintelligible, and should be disregarded unless explained to the satisfaction of the court below.\nDecree reversed and record remitted to the Orphans\u2019 Court, with instructions to proceed in accordance with the foregoing opinion.

These sums subsequently the testator entered in said book in his own handwriting, and in the examples above they are shown by the entries of date April 1, 1880.\nThe testator, at his death, also held notes made by certain ones of his children, which notes were not under seal, and, as evidences of indebtedness, would have been barred by the statute of limitations.\nJacob U. Leiby, Isaac U. Leiby and David G. Mengel, the executors of said will, on April 24,1885, settled their account, to which exceptions were filed by the appellant and others. The account and exceptions coming on for adjudication, a contention arose whether the book before mentioned was a book containing a record of advancements, or a book of accounts of indebtedness charged against testator\u2019s children, and as such barred by the statute of limitations.\nOn the hearing, evidence was introduced in proof of the family book and of the manner in which it was kept; that about four months before his death he told a witness \u201c he would 'leave a writing back when he was not here any more, so that all the heirs could see what each one had got, and then it would not give any dispute; \u201d that to another witness he said \u201c that he wanted to keep his children alike so that there would be no difference between them, not even a cent.\u201d\nThe court, Hiram H. Schwartz, P. J., upon the contention referred to, held:\nIt is contended that the amount charged against the children in a certain book must be deducted from their respective shares by and under the will.......\nThe accounts against the several children begin usually with the item of eighteen cents for a catechism or items of house furniture or mechanical tools. It may thus be inferred that these charges were made against these children either in their youth, when they were struggling for an education, or at their first approach to manhood, when they entered upon real life and required furniture and tools in their pursuit of it.\nThere is nothing contained in the book or expressed in his declarations that these charges should be advancements; and were this estate an intestate\u2019s estate, they would be debts and as such not proven under the plea of the statute of limitations. There is not a single fact or circumstance in the case that even tends to show that the parent intended them as advancements at the time the property or money was received or alleged to have been received by the children. Such intentions must exist at the time the property or money is advanced.\nThere is no proof that the charges were made when the property or money was received or alleged to have been received by the children. Declarations made by the parent at the time or subsequent to the time when the charge is made in the absence of the children and not communicated to them are not sufficient: Millers Appeal, 40 Penn. St. 57.\nIn Haverstock v. Sarbach, 1 W. & S. 390, it is said, \u201cLoose declarations of- a parent, that he intended an existing debt should be an advancement not substantiated by writing, not made to the children, nor assented to by them, nor accompanied by an act, are not sufficient to destroy a debt secured by a legal instrument in full force, and change rt into a gift, by way of advancement, whether offered by the Son to defeat the recovery of the debt or by the representatives of the father against the son to defeat his claim for a distributive share.\u201d In Yundt\u2019s Appeal, 13 Penn. St. 575, it is held that \u201cdeclarations of a parent made after debts have been contracted, of an intention to treat them as advancements are not admissible to produce that effect where the declarations are not communicated to the child nor accompanied by an act to obliterate the obligations as debts.\u201d In Merkel\u2019s Appeal, 89 Penn. St. 340, this doctrine is re-affirmed and the cases maintaining it, approved. There is no allegation that the declarations of the decedent of his intentions to charge what the children had received as advancements (if any such declarations were made) were communicated to any of the children or that any of them has assented to such a charge being made. The book, call it by any name you please, does not substaniate such an intention. The testator\u2019s conduct and acts create a contrary presumption.\nAt about the time he desires to make a will, he takes his papers and hands them to Mr. Men gel, with the request to make a calculation: what calculation of what matter, and by what process has not transpired. The calculation was certainly progressive; and whether the calculator adopted the rule of arithmetical or geometrical progression and whether progression was by increase or decrease, he certainly employed no insignificant number as common difference, quotient or multiplier. But be that as it may, as a result and in pursuance of this calculation the decedent made the following entries in his book, viz.: [Entries made April 1, 1880, and subsequently, reviewed.]\nHow these results were obtained can only be imagined. We presume interest forms in most instances a great part of the items \u201c reckoned \u201d as appears by the following statement of the amounts actually contained in the book and charged against the children respectively and the amounts \u201creckoned.\u201d...... Certainly no one will contend that if there were no will that the charges in the book, the declarations of the decedent or his conduct and acts relative thereto or all of them together, would .make or change these charges in the book or the notes he held against Ephraim, Helena, and Lucy Ann at the time of his death into advancements.\nIn the next place, does the will turn or change these book charges and notes or either of them into advancements? Was this the testator\u2019s intention ? This intention must be gathered from the four corners of the will. The will directs that after the payment of the funeral expenses, his just debts and one hundred dollars to the one who took care of and provided for him, when he was himself unable to do so, \u201c all his estate should be divided among his children and legal heirs in such portions so that, if all the notes he held against them or any of them his said children or their heirs and all moneys advance to them and said children and heirs that their shares or dividend of each amount to the same.\u201d\nThe entries in the book have all the appearance of book accqunts, intended to show the indebtedness of the children. They have no mark identifying them as advancements. They are for interest on money received by the children. They are for rent. These accounts are changed from time to time. New balances struck and in every way treated as\u2019 accounts showing an indebtedness by the children. The book was kept in such a way that it is now unintelligible to any one. The debit and credit sides seem to have been kept on the same side, and the whole added together; for instance, in the account of Isaac U. Leiby, there is an item, as follows, \u201c1869 meat deducted from reckoning $6.08,\u201d and added to the account, instead of subtracted. This is only one instance; there are many of a simil\u00e1r character.\nSome of the children deny the correctness of the accounts. Of course we have no power to pass upon that question. Our duty is to determine what the testator intended to give to each of his children.\nIt must be conceded that the amount charged in the book against the children cannot be deducted from their respective shares, unless they are advancements made to them. For by the directions of the will, money advanced alone shall be deducted. Look at the accounts as we may, they involve the idea of obligations or future liability. The fact of charging amounts giving credit either in part or in whole of such amounts, and striking new balances from time to time involves the relation of debtor and creditor, and precludes all idea of advancement: Yundt\u2019s Appeal, 13 Penn. St. 575.\nIf the will directed that certain amounts should be deducted from the respective shares of the children, or that the amount charged in his book (describing it) should be so deducted, then the way would be clear. But the will does not refer to the book, but directs that his estate shall be divided among his children and heirs in such portions, that with the notes he held against them or any of them and their heirs, and all moneys advanced to them or any of them and their heirs, their shares shall be equal.\nThe charges in the book are not advancements of money to the children and are not mentioned or referred to in the will, and therefore cannot be considered a \u2022 part of the decedent\u2019s estate and deducted from their shares. The notes are mentioned in the will. They are thus referred to in it, viz.: \u201c The notes I hold against them or any of them and heirs, etc.\u201d The intention of the testator no doubt was that all notes against the children by him held should form a part of his estate, and that they should be deducted from the shares of those against whom they were held.\nThat a testator has power to convert an obligation into an advancement, or to direct that the amount of a note against a child should form a part of the assets for distribution and. be deducted from its share, there is no doubt: Watson v. Watson, 6 W. 254; Wright\u2019s Appeal, 89 Penn. St. 67; Wright\u2019s Appeal, 93 Id. 82; Hutchinson\u2019s Appeal, 47 Id. 84; Porter\u2019s Appeal, 94 Id. 332.\nAnd a testator has such power, whether the notes are valid or not.......\nInterest, where notes are thus charged by a testator in his will against his children, is not chargeable, unless there be a clear expression of such intention: Porter\u2019s Appeal above cited, Green v. Howell, 6 W. & S. 203; Hutchinson\u2019s Appeal, 47 Penn. St. 84. The two notes against Ephraim, the one for $524, and the other $180, are therefore deducted from his share; the note against Helena U. for $100 from her share, and the note against Lucy Ann Goldstraw for $714 from her share.\nTo this finding of the court and the distribution based thereon, in so far as it refused to consider the book as evidencing advancements, Louisa Men gel and others filed exceptions \u2022which were overruled and a decree made accordingly, whereupon the exceptants took this appeal.\nMr. Adam H. Schmehl (Mr. Adam B. JRieser with him) for the appellants :\n1. An examination of the book itself will satisfy the court that it is a book of advancements, and that advancements were the intention of the decedent when he charged the various items therein contained. \u201c The contents of this book is what each one has received for outfit who have worked until they attained their majority.\u201d An exception is made in the case of John, who is charged |100 for his three years absence.\nThe reckoning' of interest on \u201c what is more than f 900 dollars,\u201d affirms the theory of equality. The courts, however, have decided that interest is payable when there is a clear expression that interest shall be paid: Fickes v. Wireman, 2 W. 314; Porter\u2019s App., 94 Penn. St. 336.\nAdvancement is a question of intention and a debt may be converted by a decedent into an advancement: Kirby\u2019s App., 109 Penn. St. 41; Wentz v. Dehaven, 1 S. & R. 312; Mast\u2019s App., 40 Penn. St. 24; Yundt\u2019s App., 13 Idem 575; Miller\u2019s App., 40 Idem 62; Thompson\u2019s App., 42 Idem 345.\nTo determine whether the charges were intended as advancements must appear from the book and the intention gathered from the book, and the surrounding circumstances are to be considered: Yundt\u2019s App., supra; Weaver\u2019s App., 63 Penn. St. 311; Weatherhead v. Field, 26 Vt. 665; Fellows v. Little, 46 N. H. 27; Hollister v. Atmore, 5 Jones Eq. 373; Brown v. Brown, 16 Vt. 204; Buckley v. Noble, 2 Pick. 340; Hall v. Davis, 3 Idem 450; Ashley\u2019s App., 4 Idem 21; Miller\u2019s App., supra ; Oller v. Bonebrake, 65 Penn. St. 338.\nThe declarations of the decedent were not offered to show that the testator had treated debts as advancements, but as evidence of the existence of his family book and of his original intention: Yundt\u2019s App., supra; Merkel\u2019s App., 89 Penn. St. 343; Knabb\u2019s Est., 2 Wood. 386 ; Hengst\u2019s Est., 6 W. 86.\n2. It was the intention of the testator, and so provided in his will, that the said book should be included in the distribution of his estate as a part thereof, so that the shares of each should be the same.\nThough there is no technical advancements case of testacy,, yet a testator may provide the same equality and equity in his will, which is accomplished by the technical advancement in case of intestacy : Schneider\u2019s App., 16 Penn. St. 411. All the circumstances of the testator, his family, property, should be considered-: Postlethwaite\u2019s App., 68 Penn. St. 478; Follweiler\u2019s App., 102 Idem 681. All mere technical rules of construction must give way to the plainly expressed intention : Porter\u2019s App., .94 Penn. St. 332; Reck\u2019s App., 78 Idem 432 , Still v. Spear, 45 Idem 168; Wright\u2019s App., 89 Idem 67; Watson v. Watson, 6 W. 254; Thompson\u2019s App., 42 Penn. St. 356 ; Wagner\u2019s App., 38 Idem 122; Wheelen\u2019s App., 70 Idem 410;. Green v. Howell, 6 W. & S. 203; Hutchinson\u2019s App., 47 Penn.. St. 84; Bird\u2019s Est., 2 Pars. 168; Schneider\u2019s App., supra.\nMr. J. H. Marx (Mr. John F. Smith with him), for the appellees.\n1. The question submitted to the court below was a question of fact, and the decision will not be reversed except where the mistakes of the court were very flagrant: Ake\u2019s App., 21 Penn. St. 320; Roddy\u2019s App., 99 Idem 10; Gibson\u2019s App., 25 Idem 191; McConnell\u2019s App., 97 Idem 31; Rowling\u2019s Est., 37 Leg. Int. 133; Riddle\u2019s Est., 19 Penn. St. 431.\n2. The doctrine of advancements is applicable in its full extent and bearing only to cases of intestacy. When a man dies testate, whether what was given to a child is to be treated as an absolute gift, debt or advancement, is to be determined from the intention expressed in the will and extrinsic matters and testimony: Watson v. Watson, 6 W. 254; Wright\u2019s App., 89 Penn. St. 67 ; and the testator fails to connect the book with the will, by any reference therein to it.\n3. An advancement, tQ be treated as such, must appear to be a gift in anticipation of the child\u2019s share, a giving, and charge with such intent. We submit that the charges of interest accrued on notes and obligations and charges of interest forgiven are not for money advanced. Being a debt at the time the liability accrued, it is beyond the power of the testator to change it into advancements by any declaration contained in a book or, made orally: Levering v. Rittenhouse, 4 Wh. 130; Yundt\u2019s App., 13 Penn. St. 575; Miller\u2019s App., 40 Idem 57; Merkel\u2019s App., 89 Idem 340."
