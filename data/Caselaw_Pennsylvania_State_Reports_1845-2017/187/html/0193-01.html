L. 166, entitled “ An act regulating the employment of foreign born, unnaturalized male persons,” etc., was adjudged unconstitutional, because it offends against the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, and also section 1 of article 9 of our own constitution. If the court was right in declaring the act unconstitutional on either ground, it necessarily follows that there was no error in awarding the injunction against the defendants, and the decree should be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b218-6" data-blocks='[["BL_218.8",218,[267,1034,1177,299]]]'>The act in question clearly belongs to a vicious species of class legislation which too often finds its way into our statute books, and we have no doubt as to its unconstitutionality on both grounds indicated by the learned president of the court below.

Rep. 555</a>, the learned circuit judge, after citing authorities directly in point, said: “ The tax is of an unusual character, and is directed against and confined to a particular class of persons. Evidently the act is intended to hinder the employment of foreign born, unnaturalized persons over twenty-one years of age. The act is hostile to and discriminates against such persons. It interposes to -the pursuit by them of their lawful avocations, obstacles to which others in like circumstances are not subjected. It imposes upon these persons burdens which are not laid upon others in the same calling and condition. The tax is an arbitrary deduction from the daily wages of a particular class of persons. The equal protection of the laws declared by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution secures to each person within the jurisdiction of a state exemption from any burdens or charges other than such as are equally laid upon all others under like circumstances: Railroad Tax Cases, <a href="/f/13/0722-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="13 F. 722" data-case-ids="3747345" data-case-paths="/f/13/0722-01">13 Fed.

It is idle to suggest that tlie case in hand is one of proper legislative classification.

In the last cited case Mr. Justice Brewer said: “ It is apparent that the mere fact of classification is not sufficient to relieve a statute from the equality clause of the fourteenth amendment, and that in all cases it must appear not only that a classification has been made, but also that it is one based upoti some reasonable grounds — some difference which bears a just and proper relation to the attempted classification — and is not a mere arbitrary selection.”</p>

It is very apparent from the act itself that the pretended classification of the subjects of taxation is arbitrary and illegal; but, in addition to that, it directly and intentionally discriminates against members of the same class, and creates an inequality among them.</p>
