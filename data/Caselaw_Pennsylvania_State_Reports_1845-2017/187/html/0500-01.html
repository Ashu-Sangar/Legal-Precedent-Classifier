The said tract of land is especially adapted for residences, and it was understood between the plaintiff and the Yon Storch heirs that the tract was to be made into a town plot and that the provision as to mine fixtures was inserted in the deed for the purpose of keeping the surface free from such improvements. The tract was surveyed and plotted into lots, blocks and streets. Plaintiff sold lots from time to time, among them, lots 2 and 4 on Ferdinand street, and lots 1,- 8 and 5 on Church street, the contracts of sale prohibiting any opening upon the' surface for the purpose of mining or transporting coal. The two lots on Ferdinand street and the three lots on Church street were sold to certain individuals, who subsequently sold them to the defendant company, who thereupon proceeded to open a shaft upon the surface of these lots, to the great and irreparable injury of the plaintiff’s land. The contemplated mining improvements on the lots enumerated, by reason of their unsightly appearance, the noises incident to their operation, and the noxious gases arising therefrom, -will make the locality unhealthy, and will destroy the value of the tract for building lots, and for residences. Plaintiff prays for an injunction to restrain the defendant from erecting the said mining fixtures and from digging said shaft, and it asks for such other relief as equity may decree.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b525-3" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[207,416,1165,94]]]'>1. The plaintiff and defendant are corporations organized under the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[210,520,1166,814]]]'>2. On December 18,1892, the plaintiff, by deed from the heirs of Ferdinand Yon Storch, became the owner of a tract of land located in the Second ward of the city of Scranton, and containing about 100 acres, which tract of land the plaintiff subsequently plotted into lots, blocks and streets, grading the streets and making other improvements. Many of these lots were sold to various individuals who thereon erected dwelling houses. The plot was recorded in the proper office of the couuty. The deed was recorded August 29, 1892. Lots 2 and 4 on Ferdinand street were sold by contract, September 10, 1892, to Oscar S. Mains and Henry Chappel. Lots 1, 3 and 5 on Church street, were sold November 10,1892, to William H. Roe, trustee. The title to these five lots, by subsequent conveyances, vested in the defendant, lots 2 and 4 by deed direct from the plaintiff, and lots 1, 3 and 5, by deed from the plaintiff to William II. Roe, trustee, and from Roe to the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.6",525,[211,1344,1167,444]]]'>3. In the year 1893, the Yon Storch heirs, the grantors in the plaintiff’s deed, conveyed the coal under the surface of said tract of land to J. H. Rittenliouse, and he subsequently by lease and assignment of deed conveyed the coal to the defendant. The defendant, by means of the several conveyances mentioned, became the owner of the coal under the 100 acre tract of land, and of the surface of lots 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, a part of said tract, thus uniting in the defendant the ownership of the surface of said lots and of the coal underneath the same.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.7",525,[213,1805,1170,553]],["BL_526.1",526,[240,321,1174,184]]]'>4. After acquiring the title to the surface of said lots, the defendant proceeded to sink a shaft thereon, to the depth of about 500 feet. This shaft is not used to hoist coal and rock to the surface, excepting the material incident to the excavation, but to hoist the coal from the bottom to an upper vein. The coal is taken through this vein to the foot of tire slope, whence it is hoisted to the surface and into the defendant’s breaker. Over the shaft complained of there is erected a wooden structure, about fifty feet high, called a “ tower,” in the top of which there are two shifting wheels, geared with hoisting apparatus. Nearby are placed two boilers and temporary engines, afterwards <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>replaced with a pair of first-motion engines. There is also a blacksmith shop on the ground. Connected with the machinery is an appliance for signaling from the bottom to the top of the shaft.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[242,524,1171,249]]]'>5. The said structure, fixtures, machinery and appliances are the usual and ordinary kind used in the anthracite coal regions for like purposes, and the appearance of the fixtures and the noise occasioned by the operation of the machinery are not unusual in the business of anthracite coal mining.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[238,781,1176,710]]]'>6. In the neighborhood of the shaft in question, a few dwelling houses have been erected, some of them since the excavation of the shaft was begun, and the people occupying these houses, as well as people occupying houses nearby, not on the plaintiff’s tract, are annoyed by the noise occasioned by the operation of the machinery, the noise of the exhaust of steam, the dust coming from the shaft, and the unsightliness of the superstructure over the shaft; but these inconveniences and discomforts are the necessary and ordinary results of the business of mining coal. There is no evidence from which I can find that the shaft and fixtures complained of are a nuisance in themselves. Neither is there any evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant in its selection of machinery or in its 'operation of its works.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[244,1498,1169,596]]]'>T.

The deed dated August 18 was duly recorded August 29, 1892. After describing the property by adjoining owners, etc., it contains this clause: “Excepting and reserving to the parties of the first part, their heirs and assigns all the coal and minerals beneath the surface of said land and belonging thereto, with the sole right and privilege to mine and remove the same by any subterranean process incident to the business of mining ....

They conclusively show that the shaft, fixtures, machinery and appliances complained of were put upon the said five lots by the defendant company, after it acquired title to said lots, and were used by it in manifest disregard and violation of the express terms of the above-quoted proviso. Among other things the learned trial judge found that persons who purchased and improved lots in plaintiff company’s plan, and occupied the dwellings erected thereon, as well as others, were “ annoyed by the noise occasioned by the operation of the machinery, the noise of the exhaust of steam, the dust coming from the shaft, and the unsightliness of the superstructure over the shaft,” etc. But, notwithstanding the clearly established facts in support of the material averments of the bill, he held that plaintiff company was not entitled to any measure of relief. His reasons for so holding are given in his second conclusion of law as follows: “ The defendant beixxg the owner of all the coal under, and of the surface of lots 1, 2, 8, 4 and 5 aforesaid, the proviso connected with the coal reservation relating to the opening of shafts or establishing mine fixtures upon the surface of the land, as set forth in the deed of the Voxx Storch heirs, and recited in the contracts axxd deeds in evidexxce, is xxot binding upoxx the defendarxt, and ixnposes upoxx it no obligatioxx to other lot owners, nor to the plaintiff. . . .

The proviso was evidently intended to operate as a restriction in the nature of a covenant running with the land, prohibiting the grantors, their heirs and assigns from opening any “mine or air shaft,” or establishing any mining fixtures on the surface of any part of the land conveyed to the plaintiff company. It is true, there are no express words of covenant in the proviso, but it is well settled that neither express words of covenant nor any particular technical words, nor any special form of words is necessary to charge a party with covenant: 1 Roll.

In the second place, it is equally clear that it was their further intention and agreement that in the exercise of the mining rights and privileges thus excepted and reserved, the grantors, their heirs and assigns, owners of the coal and minerals, would not intentionally open any mine or air shaft or establish any mining fixtures on the surface of the land; and as expressive of that mutual agreement the proviso was added, and, in effect, the grantors thereby covenanted for themselves their heirs and assigns that neither they nor either of them would “ intentionally” open any “mine or air shaft” or establish “any mining fixtures ” on the surface of the land. The restriction thus placed on the mining rights and privileges was as permanent and enduring as the rights themselves. It was evidently im <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>posed, not for the benefit of the five lots which the defendant company afterwards purchased, nor for the benefit of any particular part of the surface, but for the benefit of the entire tract, and the owners of each and every lot therein. If the defendant company, instead of purchasing the five lots only, had acquired title to all the lots into which the 100 acre tract was subdivided, and thus united in itself the title to the entire surface and the coal underneath the same, together with the mining rights pertaining thereto, there would be some force in the learned judge’s legal conclusion that “ when the owner of the coal became also the owner of the surface the effect of the proviso was destroyed.” It was never intended by the parties that the purchase of a few of the surface lots by the owner of the coal and minerals should in any manner impair the force and effect of the proviso, much less “ destroy ” the same.</p>
