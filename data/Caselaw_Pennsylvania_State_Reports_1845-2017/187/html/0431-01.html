Over twenty-one years before the date of the agreement the owner of the land in question owned the adjoining lot to the west, and built thereon twin houses. The middle of tbe party wall of these houses was six inches west of the middle line of the two lots. The owner sold the eastern lot, which subsequently became vested in plaintiff. The deed tendered by him to defendant for the eastern lot conformed to the agreement. The defendant contended that the fair intendment of the agreement was that it should include one half the party wall, and denied that plaintiff’s deed to the eastern lot carried his title further than the middle line between two lots. Held, (1) that plaintiff had a good and marketable title to the middle of the party wall, and that the deed tendered was sufficient to convey the same to defendant.</p>

In April, 1874, John W. Everman became the owner in fee of these contiguous houses and lots by purchase at sheriff’s sale. In the sheriff’s deed, the premises are described separately as “ two unfinished two-story messuages and lots of ground, with Mansard roofs, situate on the south side of Locust street, at the respective distances of one hundred and fifty and one hundred and seventy-five feet east of Thirty-ninth street, each being twenty-five feet front on Locust street, and in depth one hundred and seventy-five feet to Irving street.”</p>

    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[280,529,1174,965]]]'>The division or party wall between the two houses was finished and completed in April, 1874, and remains now as it was then. The center of said wall was and is, of course, the dividing line between the two houses. In other words, the eastern half of said wall belonged to and formed part of the house or messuage erected on the eastern lot, and the western half, in like manner, formed part of the house erected on the western lot. The division or party wall was and continues to be practically an artificial monument on the gronnd, the center of which, longitudinally, is virtually the westerly line of the one property and the easterly line of the other; so, that when Everyman conveyed the eastern house and lot to Thompson, the latter thereby acquired title to that line as the westerly line of his purchase. In like manner when Howell afterwards purchased the western house and lot he acquired exclusive title to nothing east of that line, but only to the adjoining house and lot west of said line. This necessarily follows from a proper application of the well-established rule that monuments on the ground must prevail over measurements.</p>

Knott, <a href="/pa/128/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="128 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="567071" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0528-01">128 Pa. 528</a>, this Court said it was “ a permanent monument which fixed the location of the south line, and the north line was just twenty-two feet from [the middle of the party wall] and parallel with it.” In Lodge v. Barnett, <a href="/pa/46/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="46 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="420630" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0477-01">46 Pa. 477</a>, Mr. Chief Justice Agnew said: “ The courses and distances in a deed always give way to the boundaries found on the ground, or supplied by proof of their former existence, when the marks or monuments are gone. So the return of a survey, even though official, must give way to the location on the ground, while the patent, the final grant of the state, may be corrected by the return of survey, and if it also differs, both may be rectified by the work on the ground. ... If titles were to depend upon the fluctuations of the compass, or errors of the chain or rod pole, upon measurements of angles or of distances, instead of the lines, monuments and marks upon the ground, it would open the door to a flood of litigation.” Nothing is better settled <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>than the law of this state on this subject, and our books are full of cases illustrating its application to the varying facts of each.</p>
    <p id="b461-4" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[180,487,1167,1175]]]'>In his first conclusion of law the learned trial judge found that, “ By the agreement of sale of May 20, 1896, the plaintiff undertook to convey to the defendant a house, No. 3816, Locust street. The fair intendment of the agreement is that it should include one half of the party wall in the west side of the premises.” Thus far ho was undoubtedly correct; but, when he proceeded to ignore the fact that the party wall is a monument on the ground, and gave controlling effect to the line as shown by the survey alone, he was just as clearly wrong, and the result was that his first conclusion of law, as a whole, is clearly erroneous. Substantially, the same error underlies the second conclusion of law. Oil the contrary, he should have held that the owner and builder of the twin houses designed to be occupied as separate dwellings, having located and constructed the dividing wall between them as he did, must be held to have intended the same for a party wall, and the center line thereof extended longitudinally from street to street, to be the dividing line between the two properties; and that the first vendee of Everman, the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale, acquired a title in fee to one half of said wall and the house and lot east of said line. In principle, at least, this would have been in harmony with the decision of this Court in Western Nat. Bank’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/102/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="102 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="502686" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0171-01">102 Pa. 171</a>, 182.</p>

Put when the twin houses were being erected he owned both lots, and the houses happened to be so located that the center line of the party wall appears to be a few inches west of the line between the two lots, as shown by the survey. By the sheriff’s sale in 1874, both lots, with the buildings thereon erected, passed concurrently to Everman, who, while thus invested with the title to both houses and lots, conveyed the eastern property to William Thompson by a deed which, properly construed, conveyed the whole of the eastern house and lot, located east of the center line of said party wall, <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>extended from street to street. By that conveyance said line was adopted as the dividing line between the two lots and the improvements thereon, in lieu of a line located solely by the distance and angles shown on the survey; and, so far as appears, that adopted line has continued to be the true and correct dividing line between said properties ever since.</p>
    <p id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[264,650,1174,762]]]'>The deed that was tendered to the defendant substantially conforms in tenor and effect to the other conveyances in the chain of title from the sheriff to Everman, and from the latter, through the mesne conveyances, to the plaintiff, and is quite sufficient to convey in fee to the defendant the whole of the eastern “messuage” or house from the ivestern boundary thereof, at the center line of the party wall, and the land upon which said house stands, together with the residue of the lot on the easterly side of said center line extended northerly to Locust street and southerly to Irving street. In other words, the deed is quite sufficient to vest in the defendant a good and marketable title to said eastern house and lot known as No. 8816, Locust street; being the same property that was conveyed by Everman to Thompson, and lying east of the center of said party wall, extended aforesaid.</p>
    <p id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[264,1421,1172,341]]]'>Without further elaboration, it follows from what has been said that the judgment of the court below cannot be affirmed. It is accordingly reversed, and judgment is.now entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for $8,989.98, the amount found by the court below, with interest from June 19, 1896, upon the payment of which the plaintiff shall deliver to the defendant the deed tendered to the latter.</p>
