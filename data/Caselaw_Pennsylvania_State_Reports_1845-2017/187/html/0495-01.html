There is no evidence in this case to show that the plaintiff Avas guilty of any fraud upon Martin Scanlon at tbe time the note was given, or that the note was given to the plaintiff under <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>duress, and therefore the presumption is that the note was given to the plaintiff voluntarily; and the burden is upon the defendant to show that it has since been paid, or that the obligation has been canceled in some way, and for a good consideration; and unless the defendant has convinced you that the note has been so paid or canceled your verdict must be for the plaintiff. <em>Answer: </em>There is no evidence in this case to show that the plaintiff was guilty of any fraud upon Martin Scanlon at the time the note was given, or that the note was given to the plaintiff under duress, and therefore the presumption is that the note was given to the plaintiff voluntarily. That much of the point I can affirm. It correctly states the law applicable to the case. The point then goes on: “ And the burden is upon the defendant to show that it has since been paid or that the obligation has been canceled in some way and for a good consideration ; and unless the defendant has convinced you that the note has been so paid or canceled your verdict must be for the plaintiff.” This is very nearly correct. I would, however, desire to correct it in this way: I should say the burden is upon the defendant to show that the note has since been paid or that the obi igation has been canceled or satisfied in some way, or if given for some undisclosed purpose, that purpose has been fulfilled; and, unless the defendant has convinced you that the note has been so paid or canceled or satisfied, or the purpose for which it is given fulfilled, your verdict must be for the plaintiff. I answer the point in that way, with that correction. [5]</p>

The defense which is interposed in this case is based lafgely upon admissions, alleged to have been made by the plaintiff to Margaret Scanlon, the defendant, and the rule of law is that such evidence should be received with great caution and scrutiny, as such evidence is the most dangerous that can be admitted in a court of justice, and the most liable to abuse. <em>Answer: </em>The fourth point I will divide up, as I did the second: The defense, which is interposed in this case, is based largely upon admissions alleged to have been made by the plaintiff to Margaret Scanlon, the defendant, and the rule of law is that such evidence should be received with great caution and scrutiny. There is no doubt about that. The evidence here on which the defendant relies is alleged admissions, something by which it is claimed, as we would say, that the plaintiff gave <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>himself away, something by which he admitted that this note was not a valid obligation. Evidence of that character, alleged admissions, undoubtedly is, as stated in this point, to be received with great caution and scrutiny, and so far I affirm the point. The point goes on: “It is to be received with great caution and scrutiny, as such evidence is the most dangerous that can be admitted in a court of justice and the most liable to abuse.” I do not think that I can characterize admissions in this way as the most dangerous that can be admitted in a court of justice and the most liable to abuse. I do feel,-however, warranted in saying to you, as asked in the first part of the point, that you are to receive these alleged admissions with great caution and to accept them only after close scrutiny with regard to their truth.

It is clearly apparent that the transactions between the parties were not the ordinary dealings of borrower and lender, and it is equally manifest that the witnesses on neither side were telling the entire truth.”</p>
    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.8",521,[159,1411,1163,961]],["BL_522.1",522,[271,353,1176,598]]]'>On the second trial, the record of which is now here for review, the defendant testified more fully as to declarations by the plaintiff to the effect that there was no money consideration for the note, that he did not intend to try to collect any money on it, and that he repeatedly promised to give it to her. Her testimony as to these declarations was corroborated by other witnesses. Other facts and circumstances, — not necessary to be detailed here, — gave further weight to her testimony. The ease was clearly one for the jury. There was no error in refusing to strike out the defendant’s testimony as to plaintiff’s declarations ; nor is there any ground for plaintiff’s contention that binding instructions should have been given in his favor. Such instructions would have been plain error. It necessarily follows that the portions of the charge embraced in the second and third specifications are not erroneous. The complaint is not that the trial judge presented plaintiff’s case inadequately or gave undue prominence to the defendant’s theory, but that the defense was permitted to go to the jury in any form. In commenting on the testimony as to plaintiff’s declarations, the <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>learned trial judge, after presenting defendant’s theory, was careful to state that there was “ a possible construction to be given to this testimony that would still be favorable to a recovery by the plaintiff,” namely, that the declarations might have been made, “ for the purpose of endeavoring to dispel the evident worry that Mrs. Scanlon was in.” That was going quite as far in presenting a view favorable to the plaintiff as the latter could reasonably expect. The plaintiff’s complaints (if any he has) ought to be against the jury, and not the court. In saying this, however, we do not mean to intimate that the jury reached an improper conclusion. On the contrary, we think it was correct.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[272,969,1177,505]]]'>The objection to plaintiff’s second point is that it wholly ignores defendant’s theory of the case and the evidence in support of it. The defense did not allege payment or cancelation, but contended that the note had been given for some undisclosed purpose, and that the purpose, whatever it was, had been fulfilled. The trial judge was therefore right in embodying in his answer the remark that plaintiff could recover unless the defendant showed one of the defenses to the note presented in the point, or “ that the purpose for which it was given had been fulfilled.” Plaintiff’s last point was properly qualified.</p>
