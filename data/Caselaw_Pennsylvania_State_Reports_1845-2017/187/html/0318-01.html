It was rebuilt in 1868, and by authority of the legislature (see act of February 19, 1868), the location was slightly changed, the bridge company being empowered to rebuild at any place within one half mile of the location of the old bridge. In point of fact the new bridge was built north of the cite of the old bridge, 196 feet at one end and 444 feet at the other end. By the same act the bridge company was authorized to construct for railroad purposes as well as for travel by wagons and otherwise, and the bridge has ever since been used for such purposes. <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>All the property and franchises at the site of the old bridge were saved to it by the said act, and it still owns and occupies its toll house and other property at the Lewisburg shore end of the old bridge.</p>

A proper classification of bridges is not objectionable. It may be conceded that there would be no offense in making a class to include all bridges spanning county line streams and which are owned and maintained by corporations, etc., and which have been destroyed and'abandoned, and to provide for their rebuilding in the manner prescribed. But the act goes much further. It operates upon certain bridges of this class to the exclusion of all others. They are to be bridges used exclusively for vehicles and foot purposes. A bridge having in addition to the carriage and footway, a street railway, a towing path or a steam road upon it, is left out. [Bridges which have been destroyed and not rebuilt are unprovided for. It is only where the same has been “rebuilt by said corporation or private persons, or by public subscriptions on another site,” that the act takes hold. Where there has been a rebuilding of the old bridge a short distance further up or down the stream, a second structure must be built at the public expense. Where the bridge has been destroyed or abandoned and not rebuilt, the traveling public may swim.] [1] In the language of Mr. Justice Paxson, in Commonwealth v. Patton, <a href="/pa/88/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="88 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="1061212" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0258-01">88 Pa. 258</a>: “This is classification run mad,” and [the method in the madness was to provide for a free bridge over the West Branch of the Susquehanna at Lewisburg, by legislation that would not be applicable anywhere else in the commonwealth. It is not probable that there can be found elsewhere in the commonwealth á situation that would meet all the conditions of this extraordinary act of assembly.] [2] To provide for the reconstruction of a bridge already rebuilt to the exclusion of all cases where there has been no rebuilding is, it seems to us, a very peculiar kind of legislation. We cannot see any reason in it, nor do we think there is any, except as above intimated. It is certainly not general legislation: Commonwealth v.

It was claimed that inasmuch as there had been no abandonment of the bridge in question, the same having been rebuilt as directed by the act of 1868, this case did not come within the provisions of the act of 1897. It will be seen, however, by a close examination of that act that it was not an abandoned bridge that the legislature attempted to provide for. A rebuilt bridge cannot be said to have been abandoned. If constitutional, the act would be applicable to bridges which have been destroyed and rebuilt upon another site, or, in other words, to a change in location.</p>

So also bridges over them are almost necessarily fixed as to location, by the centers of population and travel. They form a distinct class, because not exclusively a bridge of either county, and there are, matters of exact site, style, material, expense, etc., as to which the two counties may not be in harmony. This basis of classification, therefore, is not only competent, but obviously proper.</p>

Practically all bridges are built on the line of a public highway <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>or on a site deemed necessary to the traveling public. And as all bridges have owners, those only are excluded which are not owned by corporations or private persons, but already by the public. There is a very plain difference between authorizing county commissioners to take for the public what is now the property of others, and interfering with what is already public property.</p>

    <p id="b346-6" data-blocks='[["BL_346.5",346,[270,908,1181,1272]]]'>In the fifth condition we probably have the real purpose and motive of the act. The county commissioners are authorized “ to take charge of and rebuild and reconstruct ” bridges destroyed by ice, flood or otherwise (as e. g. by fire) or bridges abandoned by their owners and rebuilt on another site. It is argued by appellees that the word “ or ” before abandoned should read “ and,” but we see no necessity for so doing. The intent of the act is quite plain. Where the public has had the use of a bridge at a certain place, and has been deprived of it, either by destruction or abandonment of the bridge, and the re-' building on a different site, the commissioners are authorized to restore the former public use, by taking the site of the destroyed or abandoned bridge and rebuilding or reconstructing thereon. The phrase “ rebuilt .... on another site ” is not strictly accurate, for a new bridge in a new place cannot strictly be'said to be the old one rebuilt. But the meaning is clear, and “replaced by” or any equivalent phrase would express it correctly. Such a construction is no more strained than the substitution of “ and ” for “ or.” If the flood of 1865 had not destroyed the bridge of the Lewisburg Bridge Company, but had weakened it so as to be unsafe for travel, and the company had abandoned it and rebuilt, i. e., replaced it by a new one in a different location (as it was authorized to do by the act of 1868), the inconvenience contemplated by the act of 1897 would have been present and the remedy applicable. *</p>

Nor was any proof made to that effect as matter of fact in the court below. We are un<a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>able therefore to say that this act is special or local as to this bridge, within the prohibition of the constitution.</p>
    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[194,432,1164,607]]]'>Nor must the act fail by reason of defective title. The title is somewhat long, and very fairly descriptive of the purpose and contents of the act. It is called an act “ authorizing county commissioners .... to rebuild bridges on sites owned by corporations or by private persons .... and providing for the cost of reconstructing the same.” Every one is bound to know that public officers cannot be authorized to take possession of bridge sites or any other private property without compensation, and the words quoted from the title arc ample to give notice to both owners of the sites of destroyed or abandoned bridges and county commissioners, and to put them upon inquiry as to the body of the act. That is all that the title is required to do.</p>

The answer of the commissioners raises a question of fact which has not been disposed of. They deny that the bridge destroyed in 1865 has been abandoned, and aver that it has been rebuilt upon the original site. On this point the opinion of the court below says, “ the location was slightly changed .... the new bridge was built north of the site of the old bridge one hundred and ninety-six feet at one end, and four hundred and forty-four feet at the other end.” It may be admitted that this was presumably a new site, but not necessarily so. xl slight variation would not make it new. If in the line of the same highway, or accommodating the same public travel in substantially the same place, it may be on the same site within the meaning of the act, though the piers or the approaches are different, and the bridge at a different angle with the stream. The flood which destroyed the bridge may have so altered the banks or the channel of the river as to necessitate some variation in the location. The judge calls the change slight. Whether or not it was sufficient to be called the use of a new site may depend largely on the physical features of the neighborhood, or on changes in the location of population and travel. It is a question of fact which the respondents have put in issue and which must be specifically ascertained and disposed of.</p>

Is the act mandatory? In form it is permissive only, and, though a legislative conferring of authority is sometimes equivalent to a command to exercise it, yet it is not always so. The commissioners are “authorized ” and if they “neglect or refuse to act ” ten citizens may petition “ the court of common pleas of the counties where located,” who thereupon “may issue a mandamus.” The commissioners clearly are compellable to act on the subject, but if they have acted and their judgment is against rebuilding, is it within their discretion? Is their discretion reviewable and subject to be superseded by that of the court, or is the act mandatory on both at the option of the ten citizens ? Again the petition must be to the common pleas of the “ counties,” and no authority is expressly given, even if it could be, to either court to issue its mandamus to the commissioners of the other county. Each court must necessarily act in its own county, and if there is a discretion it is clear that both must concur before either can enforce a mandamus. These questions (and perhaps others will arise) we suggest without expressing any opinion upon them, because they lie in the pathway of the case, though they were not raised in the court below, and have not been argued here.</p>
