The evidence tended to sliow that the buggy struck an obstruction in the road, and was precipitated with tlie occupants and horse over an embankment. The roadbed at tlie point of the accident was about eleven feet wide, and on the side of the embankment was not provided with guard rails. The road had been constructed many years before, and bad always been without guard rails at the point where the accident occurred. The plaintiff was a resident of tlie neighborhood and was well acquainted with the road. There was evidence that plaintiff bad stated after tlie accident that it was caused by tlie stumbling of his horse.</p>

Whether the ordinary horse, such as is commonly used, will sometimes stumble I leave it to you to say.

Therefore, in that event, if the ■township was at fault in not putting a barrier there, and the plaintiff was free from contributory negligence, in other respects he would be entitled to recover, because, in that event, the stumbling could no more, in my judgment, .be said to be the proximate and efficient cause of the accident and injury, than could the shying of a horse if upon the highway, or the fact of the traveler being crowded off by other vehicles, be said to be the proximate cause of the accident and injury.] [2]</p>

If, as a prudent man, notwithstanding the condition of the road, he believed it could be safely traversed with reasonable safety,— if that is the conclusion that a prudent man, under the circumstances, would have come to, — then, notwithstanding the danger, he had a right to undertake the passage. If the danger was so great and apparent that a reasonable man, in the exercise of common and ordinary prudence, ought not to have undertaken its passage, then he ought not to have gone that wajr, if he knew of another way around, and he was guilty of contributory negligence and ought not to recover.].

Several witnesses have sworn to these declarations. The plaintiff not only denies he ever made the declarations imputed to him but asserts that it is not a fact that the horse stumbled. When I say denies and asserts I mean he did so from the witness stand. You will first determine whether he made these declarations. Secondly, if he did make them, whether they were true, because, even though he made them, if they were not true, you are not to decide the case against him because he asserted what was not the fact, but you are to decide the case from what you find from all the evidence the fact was. Declarations against a party’s interest are to be construed most strongly against him.
