The net rental value of the property is $125 per year. The mortgage, which was a lien against this property at the time of the conveyance from the plaintiff corporation to the defendant corporation, February 13, 1889, was paid by the defendant corporation about July 12, 1894. The organization of the plaintiff corporation has been kept up since the contract of August 24, 1889, the same as before, and is still in existence, doing business; a portion of its membership remaining the same as before the execution of said contract by virtue of policies issued previous thereto. A majority of the persons who were members of the plaintiff corporation at the time of the execution of the contract of August 24,1888, had been transferred to and voluntarily became members of the defendant corporation prior to the execution of the deed of the land in suit by the president and secretary of plaintiff corporation to defendant corporation on February 13, 1889.</p>

It appears that some business arrangement existed but its terms were not offered in evidence by either party. Mr. L. A. Tyler, who was at one time president of the defendant corporation, and is now president of the plaintiff corporation testified that “ The Maryland Branch itself was of The Temperance Mutual Benefit Association of Pennsylvania, and it only existed by virtue of The Temperance Mutual Benefit Association of Pennsylvania.” It appears that their business relations were of such a character that the plaintiff corporation issued its certificates of membership to certain policy holders of defendant corporation “entitling them to all the right and privileges granted by its charter, constitution, by-laws, rules and usages, and subject to all assessments made upon its members.” At the time of the execution of the contract of August 24,1888, the plaintiff had a member<a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>ship of several hundred, about twenty-five of whom were minors. Nearly all of these members upon notice of the execution of this contract applied for and obtained membership in the defendant corporation under its terms, or allowed their membership to lapse. The exact number who applied for and obtained membership in defendant corporation does not appear in evidence. Neither does the number who allowed their policies to lapse. A few who were members refused to be transferred, and have retained their membership in the plaintiff corporation to the present time. In 1887, or about that time, the defendant corporation made an arrangement with the Home Mutual Life Association of Pennsylvania under which they were to accept the risks and carry out the stipulations of certain certificates issued by said Home Mutual Life Association and its members. The plaintiff corporation issued to the holders of these certificates so transferred to defendant corporation a certificate of membership in plaintiff corporation. The defendant corporation has paid to all of its membership which were transferred as hereinbefore set forth from the Home Mutual Life Association ot from the plaintiff corporation upon policies which have matured, or to the beneficiaries mentioned in said policies, the amounts it had obligated itself to pay under the terms of said policies, amounting in the aggregate to nearly $45,000 (but there was no evidence given of any specific amount paid to policy holders to whom the plaintiff corporation had primarily issued policies and which were transferred to defendant corporation under agreement of August 24, 1888).</p>

The transfer of the real estate in suit was to be made as soon as a majority of the members of the plaintiff corporation were transferred to defendant corporation “ provided all just debts and claims against said Temperance Mutual Benefit Association are paid or provided for.” This proviso is peculiar in that it does not indicate who were to pay or provide for these debts of the plaintiff corporation, and nowhere in this nontract of August 24, 1888, is there any express agreement <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>that defendant corporation is to pay the debts of plaintiff, nor is there any evidence that it ever has paid any of them.</p>

There is no evidence to show that members of plaintiff corporation transferred to defendant corporation under this agreement of August 24,1888, were admitted into membership of the defendant corporation upon any different or more favorable terms than all of the other members of defendant corporation,, or that they obtained any superior rights or privileges by reason of their having belonged to plaintiff corporation.</p>

The specific policies given in evidence as-having been paid were not primary obligations of plaintiff corporation ; they were either original undertakings of the defendant corporation or of the Home Mutual Life Association.

It was held in Oil Creek, etc., R. R. v. Pennsylvania Trans.

The reason for this rests upon the equitable principle that the corporation should not be permitted to receive all the benefits of its illegal contract, and then set up its own illegal act to escape paying for such benefits. In the case at bar there is no evidence of any valuable consideration having passed from the defendant corporation, or having been received by plaintiff corporation, either in execution of the contract of August 24,1888, or of the deed of February 13, 1889, of the land in dispute. There is no evidence that a majority of the members of plaintiff corporation received any valuable consideration by the issuing to them of certificates of membership or policies in defendant corporation. <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>If the issuing of these policies to members of the plaintiff corporation had been the passing of some valuable thing from the defendant corporation to these members of the plaintiff corporation, it would not have been the giving of a valuable consideration to the plaintiff corporation itself, but only to certain of its individual members.</p>

They had no power to destroy it, to give away its funds, or to deprive it of any of its means to accomplish the full purpose for which it was chartered.” Conceding that the issuing of the policies by defendant corporation to a majority of the members was a valuable consideration to those members (the only consideration of this deed being the issuing of these policies), this was in effect dividing among certain of the members of the plaintiff corporation nearly if not quite all of the property of the corporation.

    <p id="b69-5" data-blocks='[["BL_69.7",69,[226,736,1177,1223]]]'>The finding of the learned judge that the consideration for the conveyance of the property in question did not pass to the plaintiff as a corporation, but to such of its members as dissolved their connection with it and became members of the corporation defendant, is fully warranted by the testimony, and it is conclusive of the controversy which has arisen. Both corporations are mutual life insurance associations. The plaintiff had acquired property by the accumulation of receipts for1 admission to membership, from annual dues and from assessments of the members. This property was a trust fund for the security of the certificate holders. It was within the power of the directors to sell this property for the purposes of the corporation and to use the money received in carrying on its affairs. They could not, however, close up the affairs of the corporation or transfer its property for the benefit of a portion of its members. This was in effect what they attempted to do. The agreement upon which the conveyance is based provides for the transfer of “the franchises, organization, property and control ” of one corporation to the other. It was an attempt to merge one corporation into another without legislative authority and without any previous action of the members. That this could not be done is too clear to admit of doubt: Lauman v. Lebanon Valley R. R.
