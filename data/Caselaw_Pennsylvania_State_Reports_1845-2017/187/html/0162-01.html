The first appeal is from the order of the orphans’ court setting aside the confirmation of tbe joint partial account of Nicholas Washburn and William Merrifield, executors of the will of Calvin Washburn, and permitting the executor of William Merrifield to file a separate aecouut, and from the order dismissing the exceptions filed thereto. The proceeding was by petition and rule, but it was in substance a bill of review. The joint partial account was filed in October, 1876, and showed a balance of cash and uncollected assets in the possession of the executors. Before the confirmation of the account, one of the executors, William Merrifield, was stricken with paralysis, and he died in April, 1877. He had not taken an active part in the settlement of the estate, and had never had actual possession of any of the assets thereof. The surviving executor, from the time letters testamentary were granted until his death in 1887, had entire charge of the estate, and was reputed to be financially responsible. No steps were taken until August, 1894, to hold the estate of William Merrifield responsible for a devastavit by his co-executor. The power <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>of tlie court to allow a review is beyond doubt: Young’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/99/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="99 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="446069" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0074-01">99 Pa. 74</a>; Johnson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/114/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="114 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="550039" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0132-01">114 Pa. 132</a>; Wilson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/115/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="115 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="551811" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0095-01">115 Pa. 95</a>. Under the testimony offered there was no error in dismissing the exceptions to the separate account which it permitted to be filed.</p>
    <p id="b187-3" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[175,623,1173,1070]]]'>The questions raised by the second appeal are whether the legacies to the appellants were charges on the real estate devised by the testator to his son Nicholas Washburn, and, if so, whether they were discharged by the sheriff’s sale of the land, after the death of the devisee, under a judgment which had been obtained against him. The appellants are the daughter and granddaughter of the testator. He directed his executors to invest $5,000 in mortgages on real estate, and pay the income to his daughter for life, or at her option to invest this amount in real estate and secure to her the income thereof. At her death the principal sum invested or the real estate bought was to go to his granddaughter, to whom he also gave a legacy of $1,000, payable immediately after his death. The remainder of his estate, real and personal, after the payment and securing of all legacies, went to his son Nicholas, one of his executors. Two and a half years after Nicholas went into possession of the real estate which passed to him under the residuary clause of the will, it was sold by the sheriff under a judgment obtained against him. The learned judge of the orphans’ court held that the legacies mentioned were charged upon the land, and that their liens had been divested by the sheriff’s sale.</p>

That for the daughter is to be invested in bond and mortgage on real estate or in the purchase of real estate; that to the granddaughter is to be paid immediately.
