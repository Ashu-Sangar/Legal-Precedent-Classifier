On January 1, 1891, tbe three formed a partnership, under the name of J. F. Bailey &amp; Sons. Tbe sons contributed no capital, and they received no salaries from tbe firm, but were entitled to profits, as follows: Frank E., thirty per cent; Harry H,, twenty per cent; their father’s share being tbe remaining fifty per cent. Tbe new firm continued in business until March 11, <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>1893, when the firm and the three members, as individuals, assigned the firm and their individual estates to Omar J.

Bailey, except two shares; of these two shares, one certificate of one share stood in the name of H. JE. Bailey, and the other in the name of Frank E. Bailey. These two shares Mr. J. F. Bailey and Mr. H. H. Bailey both testified were not in reality the property of Messrs. H. H. Bailey and Frank E. Bailey, but belonged to Mr. J. F. Bailey, and that they were placed in the names of H. H. Bailey and Frank E. Bailey to enable them to act as directors. The books of the Provident Life and Trust Company were also produced to show the registration of this stock in the above names. The sixty shares of the stock of the Reading Rolling Mill Company, Mr. Kinsley, the assignee, testified that at the time they came into his possession also stood in the name of Mr. J. F. Bailey. The fifteen bonds of the Bloomington City Railway Company, were pledged as the property of J. F. Bailey, and came into the assignee’s possession after the payment of the debt to the Provident Life and Trust Company, for which they were collateral, had been paid.</p>

F. Bailey &amp; Sons, and distributable as firm assets. For this they pointed to entries of these securities in the books of J. F. Bailey &amp; Sons, where they appear under the head of Security Account, and to strengthen this contention Mr. J. F. Bailey was examined by the counsel for the firm creditors as if on cross-examination, and Mr. Graham, Mr. Houston, Mr. Ballard and others were called to show that, after the assignment of J. F. Bailey &amp; Sons, Mr. J. F. Bailey had repeatedly spoken of the securities in question as firm assets and sought to apply them as such in a scheme of reorganization of the firm of Cofrode &amp; Saylor, Limited, the Reading Rolling Mill and the firm of J. F. Bailey &amp; Sons. The auditor finds from the evidence that Mr. Bailey did do this, but inasmuch as such words were spoken and such actions taken by Mr. J. F. Bailey after the assignment, such words and actions can have no effect upon the rights of the creditors which had before that time attached.</p>

Mr. J. F. Bailey in his testimony, however, discriminated between what he regarded as his individual property and what he had considered firm property at the formation of the partnership. He spoke of contributing ten thousand dollars ($10,000), although the auditor finds no trace of this contribution in the books at the time indicated, viz: January 1, 1891.

It is conceded that if Josiah F. Bailey was the sole owner of the stocks and bonds when he and his sons assigned their individual and firm assets, his individual creditors were primarily entitled to the proceeds arising from the sale of them. “ Where there are partnership and separate creditors and partnership and separate assets, and the firm is insolvent, each class has priority upon its respective estate: ” Assigned Estate of Jamison &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/163/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="163 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="859082" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0143-01">163 Pa. 143</a>.</p>

Bailey &amp; Sons was formed in January, 1891, and terminated in March, 1893, by an assignment for creditors. The agreement which created it was not in writing and the terms of it were ascertainable only by appeal to the recollection of the parties. The sons contributed nothing to the capital of it aside from their services. It is undisputed that whatever capital the partnership had during its existence was contributed by Josiah F. Bailey or acquired in the conduct of its business. He testifies that his cash contribution to it was $10,000, and that the only assets it had at any time from its organization to its collapse consisted of cash on hand and book accounts. This testimony is certainly and clearly opposed to the contention that the stocks and bonds in question are firm assets. It does not appear that his copartners claimed at any time an interest in the property designated in the as<a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>signee’s account as his individual assets, or that it was considered by them as firm property. It was certainly never formally transferred to the firm, and there is no evidence before us of a declaration or statement by any member of it, prior to the assignment, from which an inference of joint ownership can be fairly drawn. On the contrary the copartners agree and testify that Josiah F. Bailey was the sole owner of the property designated in the assignee’s account, as above stated, and that the firm never had any interest whatever in it. The stocks were registered in his name and the bonds were pledged as his property. These are circumstances in accord with his claim of individual ownership and with his own testimony and that of his copartners.</p>
    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[291,1022,1173,1322]]]'>The entry of the stocks and bonds on the books of the firm under the head of “ security account ” and the evidence of declarations of Josiah F. Bailey after the assignment, in which it is claimed he recognized them as firm assets, constitute the main reliance of the appellant in its contention that the firm creditors are primarily entitled to the fund created by a sale of them. It was undoubtedly the duty of the auditor to carefully consider these matters in connection with the testimony of Kinsley and of Josiah F. Bailey in explanation of them, and that he did so plainly appears by his report. The declarations referred to, having been made after the assignment, were admissible as evidence only for the purpose of affecting the credibility of Josiah F. Bailey as a witness and the weight to be given to his testimony. While it may be conceded that the matters on which the appellant’s contention is based may admit of a construction which would authorize inferences opposed to the finding complained of, it is by no means clear that such inferences should prevail against the direct and positive testimony that the stocks and bonds were not firm assets. It was the province of the auditor to duly consider and pass upon all the evidence relevant to the questions before him and, having due regard to the credibility of the witnesses and their interests in the issue, to find from such evidence to whom the stocks and bonds belonged at the time of the assignment. That he conscientiously discharged his duty in the premises, and that his finding was fully authorized by the evidence we have no doubt.</p>
