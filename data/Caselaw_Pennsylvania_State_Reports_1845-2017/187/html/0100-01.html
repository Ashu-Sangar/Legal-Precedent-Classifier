Defendants employed me to take charge of that property, to have it surveyed and subdivided into lots; to have plats made and printed; to advertise lots in their Bryn Mawr subdivision for sale by publishing advertisements in newspapers, by sending out printed maps and circulars, by furnishing free railroad tickets to such persons as might wish to go out to examine the land, and in other ways calculated to get their property on the market. My employment also included having streets curbed and graded, and having sidewalks laid and the property improved and fitted for the inspection of purchasers, and the general care and management of that property and their interests here.

They were in fact, as to the enterprise in which they were engaged, partners, and were sued as such.
