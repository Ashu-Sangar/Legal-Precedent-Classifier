It was agreed between the parties that the process should be reduced to writing and sealed and deposited in a bank, the paper to be opened only on the happening of certain contingencies; and that the inventor should occupy, without the presence of other parties, the place where the secret process was to be carried on, and that in case of default in payment of royalties the secret process and all the chemicals, machinery and apparatus used in the process should revert to the inventor. The corporation became embarrassed, defaulted in the payment of royalties, and went into the hands of a receiver. The inventor refused to permit the receiver to have access to or possession of a portion of the company’s building where the secret process was worked until he could remove his property therefrom, on the ground that if access were given the secret process would be revealed. The court directed that an attachment should issue against the inventor unless he gave up possession of the entire building to the receiver. In the order the court further directed that the receiver should not permit any one to examine the property connected with the secret process, and that he should not disclose any information which he himself might obtain in reference to the process. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the decree was erroneous inasmuch as it gave no adequate protection to the owner of the secret process; .(2) that the owner of the process was entitled to a reasonable time, not less than thirty days, within which to remove his property from the building.</p>

To that end, a brief reference to some of the provisions of the contract is necessary. By the modified contract of October 12, 1896, the appellant, Charles J. Reed, undertook to assign to the defendant company two patents, one for an improvement-in storage batteries, the other for an improvement in storage battery electrodes, together with all other patents and processes-thereafter invented or discovered by him.

On the contrary, deponent alleges that upon June 4, 1897, he voluntarily turned over to the receiver all the books and papers of the Reed Electric Company which were in his possession, and delivered to the receiver the keys and combination of the company’s safe; that he voluntarily gave to the receiver access to the company’s building, with the exception of certain secret chambers therein, which contain deponent’s private property, and informed the receiver that there was in said chambers and scattered generally throughout the building, certain property used in working a certain secret process for making electric storage batteries and storage battery <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>plates which belonged absolutely to deponent (under section sixth of the above recited agreement) which property, on notice to the receiver, it was deponent’s intention to remove; that when this was done, deponent would surrender possession of the building to the receiver. Thereupon the receiver warned the deponent not to remove any of said property from the buildings, and demanded that deponent should then and there deliver to him the keys to the building and the possession of its contents.</p>

That any one who obtains an entrance to said building could, if they so desired, .... readily open and obtain entrance to the chambers where said apparatus now is, and discover the secret process by which said batteries are made, to the irreparable damage of deponent. That once said secret process is discovered by any one else, they could operate the same in secret and produce batteries similar to those produced by deponent, who would be powerless to prevent them from doing so.”</p>

The title to the properly involved in this contention depends on mixed questions of law and facts, some of which facts were disputed and remain undetermined. It would therefore be improper for us, at this stage of the case, to enter upon the discussion of disputed questions of fact, with the view of determining them. That should be done by the court below in the regular and orderly way. It is sufficient to say that appellant’s rights appear to be guarded by carefully drawn and elaborate provisions in the agreement of the parties from which we have quoted. While the court appears to have recognized appellant’s right to some protection under the terms of the agreement, its decree requiring that he “shall forthwith deliver to ” the receiver full and exclusive possession of the factory building, etc., is not only inadequate, but it practically ignores his right to anything like substantial protection. He claimed that access to the building would give access to the chambers where the secret process was operated, and that this would lead to the discovery of the process. This claim is fully recognized in the fourth paragraph of the agreement, is not successfully controverted, and should have been protected by the decree. It is wholly insufficient that the receiver, and he alone, should be required not to disclose the secret which the immediate possession of the entire building would divulge. He was not even entitled to know what it was. The very least measure of protection to which appellant was entitled was the privilege of removing within a reasonable time, not less than thirty days, under his own supervision, such articles, machinery, etc., as he had a right to remove therefrom. In view of the peculiar nature of the property and explicit terms of the agreement, he was entitled to retain possession long enough to so remove his property.</p>
