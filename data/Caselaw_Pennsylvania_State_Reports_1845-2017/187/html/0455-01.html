The changes made in the old building, which are claimed to have converted it into anew structure, were as follows: The second and third stories of the back building were taken down and the back wall of it was removed ; the location of the east wall of it was not changed, but the west wall,1 in accordance with the plan devised for the enlargement of the building, was located on the west line of the lot. The building as enlarged was twenty feet high, of the width of thirty feet, and of the depth of sixty feet. The only change in the main building aside from some alterations in the interior was the extension of it to the building line on Oxford street. <em>Held, </em>that a lien would not lie on the building under the act of 1836.</p>

It is conceded that if the alterations and repairs upon it constitute a new structure he is entitled to judgment for the amount of his claim. The defendants, however, contend that his claim is not enforceable against the building because it represents work done and materials used in altering and repairing an old building, and not in the erection and construction of a new one. The claims grounded upon the erection and construction of a building must be filed under the act of 1836, and the claims based on alterations and repairs must be filed under the act of May 18,1887, and in strict conformity with its provisions. In the case in hand the claim is filed against a building described as a “ three-story brick building, consisting of front building of Pompeian brick, <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>fronting Oxford street thirty-six feet six inches, and extending in depth twelve feet; main building three-story brick, thirty-six feet six inches in width and about thirty-six feet in depth, and gymnasium building two-story brick, thirty feet in width, and about sixty feet in depth.” The building described in the plaintiff’s claim is an enlargement of an old building which consisted of the main building referred to therein, and a three-story building in the rear of it, twenty feet in width and thirty feet in depth. The changes made in the old building which are claimed to have converted it into a new structure, were as follows: The second and third stories of the back building were taken down and the back wall of it was removed; the location of the east wall of it was not changed, but the west wall, in accordance with the plan devised for the enlargement of the building, was located on the west lino of the lot. The building as enlarged is twenty feet high, of the width of thirty feet, and of the depth of sixty feet.

The same may be said of the enlargement of the back building. The evidence descriptive of the changes made in the old building, being uncontradicted, casts upon the trial judge the duty of determining whether the structure against which the claim was filed was an altered or a new one: Armstrong v. Ware, <a href="/pa/20/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="20 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="972381" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0519-01">supra,</a> Norris’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/30/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="30 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="415572" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0122-01">30 Pa. 122</a>, and Patterson v. Frazier, supra. He held that the building as altered and enlarged was not a new structure, and that the claim filed against it was not a lien upon it within the act of 1836. He accordingly directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendants. In his conclusion respecting the building and in his direction to the jury we concur. The plaintiff was not entitled to a lien on the building under the act of 1836, and he made no effort to obtain one under the statutes which authorize liens for alterations, additions and repairs.</p>
