These rulings were sustained, as it appeared from uncontradicted testimony that the child was not on the street with the permission of her parents at the time she was injured, but that she had escaped from her home, notwithstanding the exercise of some degree of care by them. It was not claimed that the child when injured was doing what she had been permitted to do habitually, and proof of acts of negligence on the part of the parents which were disconnected with the accident and in no manner contributed to it was held to have been properly rejected.
