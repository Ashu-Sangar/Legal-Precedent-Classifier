Griffith in January, 1890, was the separate property of Gwennie Griffith, the wife; and we may therefore adopt the language of Justice Green, delivering the opinion of the Court, in Wormley’s Estate, <a href="/pa/137/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="137 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="821472" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0101-01">137 Pa. 101</a>, at p. 108: “ All the evidence in the case established this fact, and there was not a particle of contradictory proof. The rule of law applicable in such a case is that the mere fact of the reception of the wife’s money by her husband, makes him her debtor, and it requires no affimative proof by the wife that he received it as a loan, and not as a gift. On the contrary, if it is alleged afterwards, whether by tbe husband’s heirs or by his creditors, that tbe money was received as a gift, and not as a loan, the burden is upon those wlio make sucli allegation to prove it.” Many cases sustaining this proposition are cited by tbe learned justice, and there is no room for controversy on this point. The auditor erred, therefore, in deciding that tbe $3,500 were received as a gift, and not as a loan by E. R. Griffith from his wife.</p>

But this is a presumption only which may be rebutted by evidence; precisely as may be the presumption that the principal was received as a loan and notasagift. Tbe principle is thus stated by Justice McCollum in Ilauer’s Estate, <a href="/pa/140/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="140 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="972594" data-case-paths="/pa/140/0420-01">140 Pa. 420</a>: “ It is well settled that a husband who receives any portion of the principal of his wife’s separate estate, becomes, in the absence of an agreement controlling his reception of it, her debtor for tlie amount so received, but he is not, as a general rule, chargeable with interest upon it. It lies on him to show tbe agreement which relieves him from tbe payment of the principal and on her to show the agreement which entitles ber to interest, but the agreement, in either case, may be implied from tbe circumstances attending the transaction.” It is said in McGlinsey’s Appeal, 14 S. &amp; R. 64, by TiLGHMAN, C. J.: “ It is a general principle, that where tbe wife permits her husband to receive the profits of her separate estate, and particularly, where they live together, and the expenses of <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>housekeeping are paid by him, the presumption is that it was the intention of the wife to make a gift of the profits to the husband. And there is great reason for this presumption, because the husband being in the receipt of this money may be induced to live at a greater expense than he would otherwise have done, whereby the comforts of the wife, as well as his own, are increased. To call him to account, therefore, after the lapse of a number of years, might be ruinous, and would certainly be unjust. . . . The presumption in favor of the husband is, of course, like all other presumptions, liable to be rebutted by facts which take off its force.” In Mellinger v. Bausman, <a href="/pa/45/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="45 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="9503749" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0522-01">45 Pa. 522</a>, Justice Stuong, delivering the opinion of the Court, says, speaking of money received by a husband from his wife: “ If the money was hers, she was entitled to its use, and therefore to its interest. McGlinsey’s Appeal, 14 S. &amp; R. 64, was decided while the common law remained unchanged, and when the rights of a wife were secured by no such statute as Ave now have. And the circumstances of that case were peculiar. No doubt if a wife permits a husband to use her personal estate for the benefit of the family, without any agreement on his part to pay interest, he is generally not liable for it. But he may agree to pay interest, or the circumstances proved may show an intention to create the ordinary relation of debtor and creditor.” In Kittel’s Estate, <a href="/pa/156/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="156 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="844944" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0445-01">156 Pa. 445</a>, it is said by Mr. Justice Dean, delivering the opinion of the Court: “ From the earliest times, both in this state and in England, before the enactment of any statute for the protection of the estates of married women, the rule in equity has been that the wife shall not charge her husband as debtor for arrears of income of her separate estate, in the absence of an agreement, express or implied, oh his part to pay. The reason for the rule is to relieve from the necessity for accounts which in the ordinary conduct of domestic affairs would be so difficult of determination. Hence, in settlements between husband and wife, in the absence of proof to the contrary, equity presumes that interest money on the wife’s separate estate which has been received by the husband has been expended by him with her consent for the support of herself and family. The rule is directly the reverse of this as to the principal. Neither the statute of 1848 nor that of 1887 has worked any change in this particular.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b333-3" data-blocks='[["BL_333.3",333,[188,351,1181,1837]]]'>
      <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>The auditor has not made any finding on the subject, but we have found from the uncontradicted evidence that the indebtedness secured by the mortgage for $3,500 against Gwennie Griffith's separate estate is still unpaid, and the interest for six years, amounting to nearly $1,300, has been paid by E. R. Griffith out of the money received by him for rents of her separate estate. There is no direct evidence that he agreed to pay interest on the $3,500, but there is the testimony of both the husband and the wife that he agreed to account for the rents. Waiving, however, for the present, the question of direct evidence, we consider simply the circumstances of the case. The wife mortgaged her separate estate to raise the $3,500. The debt thus contracted bears interest, which, according to the evidence, has been paid out of the income of the wife’s estate. And if it had not been paid at all, the lien against her estate would have been increased by the amount of the interest. We think these circumstances rebut the presumption that the husband was not to be charged with interest; or, to speak more accurately, prevent the presumption from arising. To decide otherwise would amount to saying that where a wife raises money on mortgage of her separate estate, and lends it to her husband, we must presume that she intends to pay the interest on the debt' thus created, without charging him with it, and thus in the course of years allow the principal to be absorbed, as it inevitably would be at the end of a certain number of years. From another point of view, the transaction might be treated as one in which the relation of principal and surety is established between the husband and the wife. The money raised on a mortgage of her separate estate, in which her husband joins, is received by him. He thus becomes in equity the principal debtor and she stands in the position of a surety. If then she, the surety, is called on to pay the annual interest, we are unable to see how the conclusion can be avoided that the principal debtor, her husband, becomes liable to her for this interest, or, which is the same thing, for the interest of the money received by him from her.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[187,2198,1170,196]],["BL_334.1",334,[260,350,1176,1270]]]'>The reason, as stated in the cases, why the husband is not liable for interest or for income of the wife’s separate estate received by him, is'because it is presumed that it is expended by the husband for the benefit of the family, and that the wife <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>thus partakes in this benefit. In the present case, if the interest on the mortgage debt for the $3,500 was paid out of the rents which accrued from the wife’s separate property, the rents could not have been expended in maintaining the family, and the presumption that this was the case would seem to be absolutely excluded. We do not see, therefore, how the conclusion can be avoided that E. R. Griffith is liable to his wife for the amount of interest paid during the six years, either as interest on the $3,500 mortgage debt, or as so much money received by him from the income of her separate estate to be accounted for by him. Both the husband and the wife testify that the rents were received by him finder a distinct agreement between them that he should receive the rents as her agent and manage her estate for her, pay out of the rents received all necessary expenses and account to her for the balance. This testimony is not contradicted by any evidence in the case, and the fact that he used the larger part of the amount received for the benefit of her separate estate tends to corroborate this testimony; and we should have no hesitation in finding from the evidence and the circumstances that there was such an agreement. The auditor declined to credit their testimony on this point, stating as his reason for so doing “ that the same is not sufficiently proved to the mind of the auditor to the degree of certainty required in like cases, and for the added reason that no statement was ever made, furnished or demanded by the wife or husband.”</p>

As was said by the Court in Meckley’s Appeal, supra : “If the parties had no fraudulent purpose or intent, then the judgment was not collusive, and the powers of the auditor over the judgment were at an end.

The Court said in Bedell’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/87/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="87 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="1057809" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0510-01">87 Pa. 510</a>: “ When the ■ report is upon facts directly found upon the evidence, we have frequently said we ought not to set it aside except for reasons which would induce a court to set aside a verdict.” The auditor has not found the facts directly, but only inferentially, and the inferences drawn by him are affected by a manifest mistake as to the law. And if a jury on the evidence returned by. the auditor had returned a verdict in favor of the Charles L. Plawley trustee judgment we would not hesitate to set it aside.' We have said nothing as to the claim that there was an agreement by the husband to pay rent for the wife’s house, in which they both lived for some years, but we think it unnecessary. - Enough has been shown to establish the validity of the $4,000 judgment, and the question of the validity of the $2,000 judgment entered in Lackawanna county, is not before us. The auditor found without evidence that it is collectible. Whether this be so or not, we do not know; nothing is claimed on it here and it is not a lien on the fund for distribution.</p>

In addition to that, the auditor appears to base his findings largely upon the assumption that the testimony of the defendant and his wife “ was so tainted with bias and interest as to make it incompetent.” This assumption wholly ignores the fact that the testimony thus discredited by the auditor is strongly corroborated by other evidence, including the circumstances of the case.</p>
