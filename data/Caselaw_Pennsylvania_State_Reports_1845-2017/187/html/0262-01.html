In 1894, the decedent, Jesse Kohler, confessed two judgments to his wife, aggregating over $12,000. The amount realized at the sheriff’s sale was $8,530.20. The appellant, the Hanover Saving Fund Society, a junior judgment creditor, alleged that the judgments confessed to Mrs. Kohler were fraudulent. The auditor, J. R. Strawbridge, Esq., found as a fact that Mrs. Kohler had a separate estate derived from her father and from other sources amounting in the aggregate to over $9,000, all of which she had loaned to her husband. He further found that there was no fraud, and he awarded the whole balance of the fund to Mrs. Kohler.</p>

In addition to the convincing evidence furnished by the production of the original notes given by the husband to his wife, at a time when there was no occasion to contemplate fraud, she has shown fully the sources from which she was entitled to receive considerable amounts of money, and supports it by her oath of actual receipts, in addition to showing positively receipts of very considerable sums from other sources, sufficient to sustain her claim as found by the auditor. There is also an entire absence of anything looking like fraudulent devices to create or secure her claim. That there was error in the calculation of the amount of her judgments may be true, but this does not fully appear. If it was not fraudulent it would not invalidate her claims or postpone them, in so far as they were honest.</p>
