In the early days of my practice here it was customary, after a jury had been out a night or two and reported that they could not agree, to discharge them. One of the first cases I tried was a contest in reference to a collision of steamboats, down on the Mississippi river. We took over a week in the trial of the canse, and it was the second trial. There had been a previous trial when tbe court discharged the jury, and that- somehow or other got into the jury box on this second trial, and one man on that jury, as I learned after the verdict, had hung the jury with the idea that the court would discharge tbe jury. They came in twice and asked me to discharge them. I refused to do so, and told them they must agree upon a verdict. They finally agreed upon a verdict, a right verdict, and one that stood, in place of subjecting tbe parties to another trial.</blockquote>

There is no conscience in tbe case; it is not a question of conscience at all; it is simply a question of judgment.

Shall I discharge you? Can we get a more intelligent jury to settle this case ? It is the duty of every juror to consider this case. No juror has a right just to take a stubborn stand and say he will not agree; that is wrong. It is the duty of every juror calmly, deliberately, to consider the case; calmly and deliberately to consider the views and opinions of his fellows, the other members of the jury; and I repeat it, no juror has a right just stubbornly to say, ‘ I won’t agree to a verdict.’ A juror that takes that position violates his oath as a juror; he is guilty of a great wrong. You know gentlemen, it has sometimes been suggested that jurors are set up, or that there is one man or so on a jury that will never agree; and intimations have been made sometimes, I have no doubt unjustly, but the talk often is, that some juror has been set up or that he expects some benefits if he will hang out and prevent a verdict. These imputations are often, perhaps always, unjust; but they subject jurors to such a suspicion. A juror that behaves improperly in the jury room, if he does anything that is an offense against the criminal law of the state, may be indicted in the quarter sessions. I, as a judge, if I ever believed from the evidence that a juror took a stubborn stand in the jury room, would not listen to argument, would not concede anything, but just of a stubborn disposition, took his stand in the jury room, would say that he never again should be a juror in Allegheny county if I could prevent; that he was unfit to be a juror, and his name ought to be posted in the commissioners ’ office as a warning to him and others against a stubborn fit in the jury room.</blockquote>

Now, I say that sometimes the minority on a jury must yield their judgment in order to get a verdict. I, after a verdict is received and entered, will hear anything that a juror will say here in court, immediately afterwards, in the way of expressing his doubt in the case, or his unwillingness to yield, and consider that, on a motion for a new trial.

That a juror may doubt the correctness of his own conscientious conclusion, and may, by discussion and reflection be conscientiously impelled to adopt an opposite one, is not questioned; but this language admits of no such interpretation; nor, taking what precedes and follows it, was such interpretation intended. Some truths are not the subject of demonstration, because self-evident; and the error •of some opinions is so obvious, that ratiocination helps but little to confirm our immediate dissent on the mere statement of them.</p>

For practical purposes, in the administration of justice, we need not consult the volumes written on the subject by moral scientists ; every man of ordinary intelligence understands, in whatever other words he may express it, that conscience is that moral sense, which dictates to him right and wrong. True, this sense differs in degree in individual members of society; but no reasonable being, whether controlled by it or not in his conduct, is wholly destitute of it. Greatly enlightened it is in some, by reason of superior education; quickened in others, because of settled religious belief in future accountability; dulled in others, by vicious habits, but never altogether absent in any. Every statute enacted by a legislature, every decision pronounced by a court, every verdict of a jury, is professedly based on a moral sense, prescribing what is right and prohibiting what is wrong. The statement of the learned judge assumed, that among the jurors there was no difference of opinion which had its source in the operations of conscience. He says: “ It is simply a difference <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>in judgment, and no question of conscience whatever in the case.” But judgment is only the result or conclusion of conscience, after the latter has performed its office in the different steps leading up to the conclusion; and this conclusion then, is the very truth to him who has arrived at it by conscientious perception and reasoning. Conscience impels the juror to disregard personal sympathy with or personal hostility to either party; in weighing the evidence or passing on the credibility of witnesses it compels him to discard social, racial, religious and political prejudices. Every step in his deliberations on the testimony should be prompted by this mural sense; nor should conclusion, judgment or verdict, for they are in this instance the same thing, follow, until after the exercise of conscience on the questions which precede it. True, the conscience of a particular individual may be too tender, or too dull, to at once correctly apprehend the right and wrong in a particular case; there may be flaws in his reasoning, which to him are imperceptible, and hence the conclusion may not be the right one; but this conclusion is to be changed and an opposite one adopted, only by conscientious reweighing of evidence by discussion and reflection upon it. He cannot adopt another at the mere behest of his fellows or on the order of a judge, for his oath enjoins that he, the juror, shall “ a true verdict render on the evidence,” and not some other render one for him. And if he assent to one which is not to him the truth, which to him is a lie, merely because it accords with the opinion of his fellow jurors, why may he not render a verdict at request of counsel or other interested person ? Once eliminate conscience, which should dictate to him the truth from the evidence, under the law as announced by the judge, what of value is left to the verdict ? In such case, in an issue like unto this, he could disregard altogether the duties of his high office. We have heard persons competent as jurors give it as their individual judgment, that no will, not obtained by actual duress, should be set aside; have heard others express the opinion that no will should stand which did not direct equal distribution among children. But the learned judge, very properly in his general charge, as if to meet just such individual judgment or perhaps whim, instructs the jury thus: “ But a jury has no right to set aside a will, simply because they may think the distribution unjust to <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>some of the children.” Why ? Because it is the law, and is so declared by the court whose duty it is to declare it, and the law which the juror has sworn to obey. And there is nothing to constrain him to obey, nor to restrain Mm in the exercise of his individual judgment, except his conscience, which dictates to him that, in the performance of his duty as a juror, it is right to obey the law as it is written and wrong to violate it. If his verdict is not to be his conscientious conclusion from the evidence according to law, then, he may as well solace himself with one which accords with his interests, his prejudices or his whims, as the embarrassed brewer wished to do, who sat as a juror in the noted case of The King v. The Bishops, and complained: “ If I say not guilty, I shall brew no more for the King, and if I say guilty I shall brew no more for anybody else.” This was an endeavor to render a verdict according to the juror’s judgment as to his personal interest, with which conscience had nothing to do.</p>

We are of opinion that this complaint is also well founded. The character of the jury is established by the learned judge himself. He says : “ I don’t know that I ever saw or tried a case where I had a more intelligent jury than I have before me now'.” To these twelve men, as intelligent as any that ever had in twenty-three years been before him, he says, in substance, there is no conscience in the case, it is simply a question of judgment. As the jury must take the law from the court, they doubtless accepted the rule thus laid down, which at once relieved them from answerability to conscience for the truth of their verdict. They were then told that if they did not agree it was not improbable that the public would suspect some of them of corruption, and, while he thought such a suspicion groundless, he intimated a disagreement might be due to self-will or stubbornness, a proper penalty for which offense would De the disgrace of exclusion from the jury wheel, and the posting of their unfitness in a public office. Having pointed the <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>way to a verdict from which they need not be deterred by present or future stings of conscience, having suggested the disquietude of mind they must necessarily suffer from the unjust suspicion of the public, and the disgrace they ought to suffer from the court’s suspicion of stubbornness, he then threatens the twelve, seven or eight of whom, according to their own statement, are old men, already suffering because deprived of rest, with extreme physical discomfort, thus : “ Gentlemen, I can’t think of discharging you; even if you have to remain there for weeks in the jury room.” But, as if even this might not induce some of them to yield their convictions, he goes a step further, and places before them what a distinguished author calls “the illusions of hope.” He says: “ I, after a verdict is received and entered, will hear anything that a juror will say here in court immediately afterwards in the way of expressing his doubt in the case, or his unwillingness to yield, and consider that on a motion for a new trial.” When we consider how prone human nature is to shirk grave responsibilities, how willingly it shifts them to others, we are not surprised that jurors, who had sat tiresome weeks in a trial, with before them a possible confinement of other weary weeks, accepted this invitation to unload their burden on the judge, hoping that the right and wrong of a case, difficult to them, would be clearly perceptible to him, and a true verdict be eventually recorded by another, according to the evidence. The confinement of a jury without light, fuel or food, the hauling them round the circuit at the heels of the judge, to compel a verdict, were judicial methods not uncommon in an earlier age, but they are repugnant to the humane ideas of this one, and are justly stigmatized as barbarous ; and unduly prolonged confinement in a room, in the custody of officers, of men accustomed to activity and freedom, partakes of the same character.</p>

In Ahearn v. Mann, <a href="/nh/60/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="60 N.H. 472" data-case-ids="4475805" data-case-paths="/nh/60/0472-01">60 N. H. 472</a>, the trial judge, after calling the attention of the jury to the importance of an agreement on a verdict, and the annoyance and expense of a retrial, sums up thus: “ While no juror should surrender his honest convictions for the sake of obtaining a verdict, the misfortune of a disagreement should be <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>avoided, if further and careful deliberation can bring about unanimity of opinion.” In Johnson v. State, <a href="/ark/60/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="60 Ark. 45" data-case-ids="1903722" data-case-paths="/ark/60/0045-01">60 Ark. 45</a>, the instruction was : “ This cause has been a great expense to the county from which it came, and it ought to be decided; while I do not ask you to yield any question of conscience, you must not be obstinate or too tenacious in your views.” In Erwin v. Hamilton, 50 Howard’s Prac. Rep. 32, the case was given to the jury at 6 P. M. Friday. In about an hour, the jury returned with the statement that they were unable to agree; the court refused to discharge them, but said to them, if they failed to agree before the court adjourned for the evening they could seal up their verdict and return it on the afternoon of Monday; thus making a possible detention from Friday evening until Monday afternoon; on the same evening, about half past ten, the court sent word to the jury that it was about to adjourn until Monday, whereupon, within five minutes, the jury came in with a verdict. The coercion complained of was the implied throat of holding the jury until Monday afternoon in case of disagreement. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial judge did not exceed bis discretional authority, as he had a right to detain them until satisfied that a failure to agree resulted from a conscientious difference of opinion, and as long as this authority was not abused, the exercise of it should be sustained. In White v. Calder, <a href="/ny/35/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="35 N.Y. 183" data-case-ids="16946" data-case-paths="/ny/35/0183-01">35 N. Y. 183</a>, the jury came into court and stated that they had “ agreed to disagree.” The trial judge refused to discharge them saying, that they must deliberate further upon the evidence, and continue to dispassionately discuss the entire evidence, in which case he did not doubt they would eventually agree upon a verdict. Such instruction was held to be no error.</p>

They bear on ours in just one particular, which is, that they tend to show that probably no judge has in this century attempted to exercise the degree of constraint to which this jury was subjected. We do not doubt the authority of a judge to use reasonable methods to bring about a verdict founded upon conscientious conviction, and to in a proper manner press upon the jury their duty to render such a verdict; but his methods must not take the character of a mandate with penalties of both moral and physical suffering for disobedience. We have no <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>case of our own determining just what a judge may authoritatively do to promote unanimity. Some we have pointing out what he may. do by way of instruction, such as that he may in some cases express his opinion on the evidence, being careful to inform the jury that they are not bound by it; and that his instructions must, in view of the issue and evidence, be adequate; others that he must not assume facts not proved, or disputed. But the general rule embodied in the sixth item of instructions by Chancellor Bacon to Justice Hutton, on the appointment of the latter to the court of common pleas, has not been departed from, nor have we much improved upon it: “ That you be a light to jurors to open their eyes, but not a guide to lead them by the noses.” Nor in our opinion is the language of Justice Kent, in People v. Olcott, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Johns.%20Cas.%20801" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="2 Johns. Cas. 801">2 Johns. Cas. 801</a>, too emphatic, when he says : “ The doctrine of compelling a jury to unanimity by the pains of hunger and fatigue, so that the verdict in fact be founded not on temperate discussion and clear conviction, but on strength of body, is a monstrous doctrine that does not stand with conscience, but is altogether repugnant to a sense of humanity and justice.”</p>

After being out approximately twentj^ hours, they sent a note to the judge, not asking to be discharged, not asserting an inability to agree, but requesting a memorandum of the points affirmed. This pointed to a difference in recollection, or understanding of the law applicable to the evidence. While the judge could not properly grant their request in form, he might with entire propriety have again read the points to them in open court with his answers, at the same time calling their attention, if he thought proper, to his statements of the law in his general charge bearing on the same questions. He said to them if there was any particular point of law they wished him to explain or repeat he would do so. When it is noticed, that fourteen written points had been presented and answered, it is not surprising that laymen, intelligent though they were, could not in open court, at once, recall the points which gave rise to their difference or about which they were in doubt; but they received no further “ light to open their eyes.” Their entire conduct, from the time the case was given them in charge until <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>the verdict was rendered, indicated, not obstinacy, but, it seems to us, a patient, persistent, conscientious effort to agree. Nor, so far as we can see, was such a result unattainable by the exercise in a lawful manner of a lawful judicial authority. The evidence was voluminous, the law applicable to it in its different aspects was not brief; the jurors were not blockheads, but men of superior intelligence, groping for light in a mass of contradictory testimony, through a labyrinth of somewhat confusing legal propositions; what they needed in their difficulty was the lawful, patient, kindly aid of the able judge, whose duty it was to enlighten them on points of law which to them were not plain. We entirely concur with him in his very reasonable aversion to a retrial of the cause; but there is one thing more to be deplored than the vexation and expense of a retrial, and that is, the complete obliteration of the dividing line between the functions of court and jury.</p>

We do not think the fact that they were returned together affects the validity of the verdict. The error was in suggesting that method of obtaining unanimity. The jury in the communication say they stood eight to four, and that the minority in effect were induced to agree with the majority, because the court had promised to take this into consideration on a motion for a new trial. If the instruction was not error, neither was the verdict; the note is a mere reminder that the jury held the court to its promise. But this method of obtaining unanimity was unlawful. Where is the semblance of law that authorizes a judge to absolve a juror from the obligations of his oath ? The juror has sworn to render a verdict on the evidence ; in substance, the court says to him, if you agree to a verdict, which to you is not on the evidence, I will cure your disregard of duty by considering that fact on a motion for a new trial. Practically, by this method, the judge reached the same result he desired to obtain by a constitutional provision. He says, in reference to the law requiring unanimity: “In the constitutional convention I struggled to have the law modified. .... I think it a very unwise law in reference to civil cases, and that is why I wanted it changed, giving the legislature <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>power to permit the court to receive a verdict of less than twelve: but it was not adopted.” It seems to us, there was scarcely a necessity for such provision if the present proceeding was lawful. Eight jurors here agree to a verdict; four do not believe it to be the truth, yet assent to it as matter of form, under the instructions that such assent is no violation of their obligation. It was in fact a verdict by eight, or two thirds of the jury, in violation of the constitution which was adopted, but in accord with the one which the learned judge wanted, but which was not adopted. In form, the verdict is not a nullity; the assumed law which induced it had no existence. This disposes of the twenty-third and twenty-fourth assignments of error.</p>

The court affirmed the point, but further said it recalled no evidence that Florence was the trusted and confidential agent of his father. “ That language generally applies to one who is the attorney of the party, or acting in a fiduciary or confidential relation with him.” There w'as abundant evidence from the testimony of Florence himself, that he was the trusted and confidential agent of his father; in fact, the defense rested on that theory, and that Florence for years had so faithfully performed liis duty in that relation that it amply explained the favor shown towards him by his father.

    <p id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[265,585,1168,195]]]'>As to the fifteenth assignment, taking the court’s answer thereto in connection with the general charge, the jury could not have been misled, and it is not necessary to further discuss the subject.</p>
    <p id="AmbG" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[261,790,1172,657]]]'>As to the sixteenth assignment, which complains of this language, “ There is no evidence that Florence had any hand in making the will, or that he made any suggestion to his father on the subject, or as to the distribution of his estate,” undoubtedly standing by itself as the whole instruction on this subject, this would be error. What the court plainly meant was that there was no evidence that Florence drafted the will, was present at its execution, or expressly dictated the terms of it. This is apparent from the whole charge, in which the evidence of the exercise of undue influence through the opportunity and power of the peculiar and confidential relation is submitted to the jury. They could not have been misled by this language, although susceptible of another and a wrong construction.</p>
    <p id="b614-7" data-blocks='[["BL_614.6",614,[259,1455,1172,800]]]'>The twenty-second assignment of error alleges that the charge was one-sided and partial. We cannot say this assignment is altogether groundless. Clearly the court leaned very strongly in favor of defendants, and it is not improbable that state of mind led to at least some of the errors we have adjudged. Whether in the absence of these the remainder of the charge could be justly attacked for partiality, it is not necessary to discuss. The case, much to our regret, must go back for retrial, when of course the errors indicated will not again be committed. The case should then be tried on the law as we have now on two appeals pointed out, and on the evidence then presented, If so tried, the judgment will then rest on an irreversible basis, for the shortest road to a final judgment is through an impartial trial according to law; that will end the strife between these parties, and will end the trouble of the learned court below and ours about their contention.</p>
    <p id="b614-8" data-blocks='[["BL_614.7",614,[261,2272,1170,95]]]'>We find nothing of merit in the remaining assignments of error. The judgment is reversed and a v. f. d. n. awarded.</p>
