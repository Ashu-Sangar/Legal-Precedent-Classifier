Therefore, they cannot recover for any part of their claim for extras, except for so much as may have included changes made after this contract was entered into.] [1]</p>

Two papers are presented here, and there is some controversy as to which was in their possession, and which was furnished to them by Mr. Kline. The jury will decide that question. At all events they had one of these papers, either the original bill of items, or the revised bill of items, before they made their bid, and the jury will decide which one it was. Now the contract goes on to say— and I will read the clause immediately following the one I have already read — -“Now this agreement witnesseth that the said party of the first part” (that is to say Kendig &amp; Co.) “hereby covenants and agrees to furnish the lumber and mill-work needed and necessary in the erection and construction of the said twelve houses according to the bill of items, plans and drawings furnished the said party of the first part by the said party of the second part. . . . The question therefore for the jury to consider — and there is a question here for the jury to consider —is with reference to this matter of the bill of items ; and the jury, as I understand it, will have to determine what weight ought to be given to the bill of items which the plaintiffs had in their hands when they made their bid. I instruct you that this contract makes the plans and drawings and whatever specifications were furnished to Kendig &amp; Co. part of the contract, and it also makes the bill of items part of the contract, and I repeat this — these papers are all part of the agreement between the parties.] [2]</p>

They must have found also that the plaintiffs agreed to furnish the lumber called for upon the complete plans and specifications, and that they have received the contract price for all this lumber. The verdict is evidently for whatever material was furnished upon certain changes of plan made after the contract was signed; the remainder of the plaintiffs’ claim being rejected, because the lumber charged therein was embraced in the contract and therefore has already been paid for in full.</p>

Tn part, the decision depended on the written contract, and this the court construed as far as possible; but, owing to the contradiction between certain of its terms, parol testimony concerning the scope of the transaction became necessary, and the controversy upon this point could only be decided by the jury. The contradiction arose out of the fact that, while the contract referred to plans, specifications, drawings and a bill of items, so as to make these papers part of the agreement, they were found upon inspection to be unlike in several respects. The bill of items called for less material than was called for by the specifications and drawings, and therefore it became essential to determine which paper was intended by the parties to govern. This was a question, not of construction — for the written terms were contradictory, and could not be reconciled — but of fact, and could only be decided by a jury. The court could not decide it, for the words of the contract gave as much, and as little, aid to the one party as to the other, and the oral testimony was in direct conflict.</p>
