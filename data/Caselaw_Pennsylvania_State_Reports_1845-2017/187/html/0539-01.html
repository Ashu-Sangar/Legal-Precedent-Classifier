On January 27, 1896, a bill in equity was filed by Jacob R. Seitzinger praying, inter alia, that the borough be restrained by injunction from carrying out its contract ■with the company. To this bill the borough promptly prepared and filed a complete answer. The hearing on the rule for a preliminary injunction was on bill and answer and the rule was dismissed. The final hearing was also on bill and answer and resulted in the dismissal of the bill.</p>

It is also claimed that if the above contention is overruled there is still another objection to the contract which is fatal to its validity. The objection is that the contract was not preceded by an ordinance, or by a resolution transcribed in the ordinance book and duly advertised. It is admitted, however, that the contract was preceded by a resolution which was “ duly approved and signed by the chief burgess of the borough,” and that it was entered into in pursuance of and in accordance with said resolution. The sufficiency of the resolution thus approved is not questioned by the appellant, and his only ground of attack upon it is the alleged omission to record it in the ordinance book and to duly advertise it. We have carefully examined and considered all the Pennsylvania cases cited by the appellant in support of his contention pertaining to the resolution, and have failed to discover in them any warrant for it. It is a contention which overlooks the fact that the passing by a borough council of a resolution awarding a contract for lighting streets is not a legislative, but a ministerial act “in the nature of a business transaction relating to the municipal affairs of the <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>borough:” Millvale Boro., <a href="/pa/162/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="162 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="856832" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0374-01">162 Pa. 374</a>; Shaub v.

It was based on an ordinance enacted by the select and common councils of tbe city, on August 8, 1892, and approved by tbe mayor on the fourth day thereafter. Under and by this ordinance tbe railway company was required to pay to the city an annual license tax of $1.00 for each pole erected or maintained by it on any of tbe city’s highways. The company refused to pay the tax, thus imposed on the ground that under and by virtue of prior ordinances it <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>was exempted from such, taxatiou for a period of fifteen years. The imposition of the tax was an exercise of the police power of the city, and this is a power of which a municipality cannot divest itself for any period of time by ordinance or contract. It follows that the ordinances under which exemption was claimed were not available as a defense to the suit on the ordinance imposing the tax, and so the court held. There is no analogy between ordinances and contracts in derogation of the police power of a city and ordinances and contracts relating to its business affairs. The ordinances under which exemption was claimed in McKeesport v. Railway Co., supra, were of the former class, while the contract in question in the case at bar is of the latter.</p>
