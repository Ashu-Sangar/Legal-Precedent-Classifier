        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThe notes of the testimony of the defendant taken at a former trial were offered on the ground that she had become incompetent to testify by reason of the death of the original plaintiff in the action, and they were objected to on the ground that she was not a competent witness at the former trial. The question raised by tbe offer and the objection was whether tlie defendant in tlie trial of an action of ejectment brought by tbe purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale under a judgment against tlie husband who was then deceased was a competent witness in support of her title. Her title was in controversy. She had not derived tlie title from her husband, but by purchase in her own name, and tbe issue was whether sbe had paid for the property with her separate estate. In Rowley v. McHugh, 66 Pa. 269, it was held that in an action of ejectment by husband and wife in tbe right of tlie wife against a defendant who claimed title under a sheriff's sale of tlie land as the property of the husband, the wife was a competent witness under tbe act of 1869. It was said in the opinion: \u201c Here tbe wife was not called to testify against the husband, but in her own behalf. The ejectment was in her own right, and the husband was only a nominal party to the proceeding. If he had any interest in the event of his wife\u2019s recovery, it was contingent, and on the side of the wife. The argument that the wife was called to testify against the husband, because the defendant claimed title under the sheriff\u2019s sale of the land as the husband\u2019s property, lias no foundation for its support.\u201d The same question was raised in Young v. Senft, 153 Pa. 352, and the decision in favor of the competency of the wife was put upon the ground that she was not called to testify against the title of her husband, but in favor of her own.\nThere is nothing in the remaining assignments which need be noticed. It was certainly competent for the defendant to show how she acquired the means to pay for the property, and there was sufficient testimony which, if believed by the jury, sustained her contention. This testimony was of such a character that it could not have been withdrawn from the jury, and it was submitted in a charge which very clearly and fully presented the issue raised.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

Before Reppebt, J.\nAt the trial, the court under objection and exception admitted the testimony of defendant as delivered by her on a former trial of the case. [1]\nFor the purpose of showing that defendant had a separate estate, the court admitted under objection and exception evidence that she had received life insurance money on a policy on the life of her husband, part of which she had testified that she had paid for the property in controversy. [2, 3]\nThe court also admitted under objection and exception testimony which tended to show that the defendant had purchased and paid for the property. [4, 5]\nPlaintiff\u2019s points and the answers thereto among others were as follows:\n3. The defendant\u2019s evidence in this case is not of that high, rigid, conclusive and satisfactory character, necessary to sustain a verdict in her favor, for the premises in dispute. Answer : This is refused. [7]\n4. The evidence of the defendant, not being competent, is not to be considered by the jury. Answer: This is refused. [8]\nVerdict and judgment for defendant.
