The failure of the plaintiff to comply with the rule of law that imperatively required him to \u201c stop, look and listen,\u201d before attempting to cross defendant company\u2019s road at grade, was not merely evidence of negligence, but negligence per se, and a question of law for the court: Railroad v.

Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company.\nNegligence \u2014 Railroads\u2014\u201c Stop, look and listen \u201d \u2014 Province of the court.\nFailure on the part of a traveler crossing a railroad track at grade to \u201c stop, look and listen \u201d is not merely evidence of negligence, but it is negligence per se, and a question of law for the court.\nIn an action against a railroad company to recover damages for personal injuries received at a grade crossing, a nonsuit is properly entered where it appears that the plaintiff could have seen the approaching train at a point about twenty-five feet from the crossing, but that he drove upon the crossing, without stopping, although he looked and listened.\nArgued May 25, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 167, Jan. T., 1898, by-plaintiff, from order of C. P. Northumberland Co., Sept. T., 1896, No. 136, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum:, Mltchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damage for personal injuries.\nAt the trial it appeared that on March 19, 1896, plaintiff, while driving a two-horse team, was injured at one of defendant\u2019s crossings in the borough of Shamokin. Plaintiff could see the track until he reached a point about twenty-five feet from the crossing, when his view was obstructed by a bridge. Plaintiff testified that he drove slowly and looked and listened, but did not see any train. He did not actually stop at any point.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nJuly 21, 1898:\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nS. B. Boyer, for appellant.\nIt is not incumbent upon a traveler, about to cross a railroad track at a public crossing, to alight from the vehicle and go upon the track to look, before attempting to cross, when he can get a view of the crossing without alighting: Davidson v. Ry., 171 Pa. 522.\nThe question of contributory negligence was for the jury: McNeal v. Ry., 131 Pa. 184; Ellis v. R. R., 138 Pa. 506 ; Smith v. B. & O. R. R., 156 Pa. 82; Link v. Phila. & Reading R.

Wolverton, for appellee,\nwas not heard but argued in his printed brief: The nonsuit was properly entered: Myers v. R. R., 150 Pa. 388; Sullivan v. R. R., 175 Pa. 361; Reading & Columbia R. R. v. Ritchie, 102 Pa. 425; Peima. R. R. v. Beale, 73 Pa. 509; Hughes v. Del. & Hudson Canal Co., 176 Pa. 254; Hovenden v. R. R., 180 Pa. 249; Newhard v. R. R., 153 Pa. 421."
