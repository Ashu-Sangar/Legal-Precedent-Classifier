        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nThe testamentary words of the decedent as committed to writing and offered for probate are: \u201c Everything is to go to Willie. Everything is Willie\u2019s. I want everything to go to Willie.\u201d Two of the three witnesses to whom the words were addressed testified to them at the hearing in substantially the same form. The other witness, Mrs. Forman, stated them with a context as follows, \u201cMary don\u2019t you or the children worry about anything. I Avant Willie \u2014 brother Willie, she said \u2014 to have everything. It has been put off; I intended to fix it so there would be no trouble, but it has been put off.\u201d \u201c She realized then,\u201d continued this witness, \u201c she wasn\u2019t able to do anything.\u201d This testimony is open to two constructions, either that the words of the decedent were an expression of the intentions she had entertained but which she now realized it was too late to carry out, or that they were an effort to carry them out by a nuncupative will, as she had put off until too late the making of a will in writing. Even if the latter construction was clear, however, it would be unavailing, as the words rest on the testimony of a single Avitness where the statute requires two. It may well be doubted therefore upon any of this testimony standing alone whether the decedent herself regarded her words as an actual making of a will. And this doubt is greatly strengthened by the other testimony of one of the same witnesses, the nurse, Mrs. Rowland, that the decedent had on several previous occasions used almost the same words, coupled with the expression of an intention as soon as she was able to go down and \u201c fix everything for brother Willie,\u201d as she wanted him \u201cto have everything.\u201d \u201c Q. She had said those same words to you a week previous, and also a month before that? A. Yes, sir. She said she was going down to settle everything; and she Avas getting ready to go down when she was taken suddenly ill.\u201d No doubt these were the expressions of her settled testamentary intentions, but that is not enough. All our cases agree that each requisite of the statute must be strictly proved, and the very first requisite not only of nuncupative but of all Avills is the animus testandi. In Werkheiser v. Werkheiser, 6 W. & S. 184, it is said, the conversations \u201c it is true, go to show the intent of the decedent. But this is not enough. Every one who undertakes to make a testamentary disposition of his property, must conform to the law regulating such disposition; and if he does not take care to do so, the law cannot uphold it.\u201d And in Porter\u2019s Appeal, 10 Pa. 254, it was held that the decedent must intend not only to make his will, but to make it in the form that it is presented for probate; that is, there as here, to make a nuncupative will. \u201c There ought therefore to be present in order to constitute a nuncupative will, not only the animus testandi, but the mind and intent to nuncupate.\u201d It was accordingly held that, although the decedent declared his intentions to a scrivener who noted them in writing at the time and in the presence of decedent who called upon two persons present to witness that that was his will, yet it was not a valid nuncupative will because the testator had in contemplation a will to be put in writing.\nIn the present case, regarded in the light of our decisions on the subject, the decedent\u2019s intent to make a nuncupative will by the language proved is not sufficiently clear to sustain the will proffered.\nBut there is another aspect in which the appellant\u2019s case even more manifestly fails. There must not only be the testator\u2019s intent to make a will then and there, but an explicit call on persons present to bear witness that such was the intended effect of the testator\u2019s declaration. The words of the statute are that \u201c it shall be proved that the testator at the time of pronouncing the bequest did bid the persons present, or some of them, to bear witness that such was his will, or to that effect: \u201d Act of April 8, 1833, sec. 7, P. L. 249. The phrase \u201c or to that effect \u201d was intended to prevent the inference that any set form of words should be necessary, but not to diminish the requirement of a distinct and explicit request by the testator to persons present to remember and be ready to testify that the testator was thereby making his will. \u201c The rogatio testium, the calling on persons to bear witness to the act, must also be done at the time of the nuncupation, and must be proved by two or more witnesses who were present at the time: \u201d Yarnall\u2019s Will, 4 R. 46, 63. There is an entire absence of affirmative evidence that the decedent in this case bade the persons who testified to bear witness that what she was saying was her will, or that she used any expression which, even by liberal construction, can be treated as a request \u201c to that effect.\u201d She did desire the presence of the family, but even that is only proved by one witness, the nurse, and the purpose was not stated. It may be inferred, but the inference is not certain, and even if it were it is not enough. There must be clear proof. And very strong evidence to the contrary is furnished by the appellant himself, who on the day of decedent\u2019s death wrote to his nephew, the contestant, in terms implying that she had died without a will. If the beneficiary who was present when the words constituting the alleged will were spoken, did not then understand that there was any such will, it is clear that the case falls far short of the degree of proof the statute requires.\nThe court below also held that the will was ineffectual because not made in the extremity of the decedent\u2019s last sickness. On this point we entertain some doubt. There are mental as well as physical elements in such matters, and one of the former is the hopefulness of invalids who are unwilling to believe that death is near. Therefore, although there was sufficient time, even after the physician had warned the decedent to settle her affairs, for her to have made a will in writing, yet if she through misplaced confidence in her ability to \u201cpull through,\u201d as the doctor expressed it, postponed doing so, it would not necessarily follow that she might not yet make a valid nuncupative will. But it is unnecessary to consider this point further, as the will clearly fails on the others.\nDecree affirmed.",

Co., affirming decision of Register of Wills.\nBefore Green, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from register of wills, refusing to admit to probate an alleged nuncupative will.\nSarah A. Wiley, aged seventy-two years, died, leaving one brother, William Wiley Forman, and nephews and nieces. She had been an invalid for a number of-years before her death, and had been confined to her bed by illness at various times during this period; her principal ailment having been that of rheumatism, which among other physical disabilities had affected her hands to such an extent that she was able to write only with great pain and labor. At the time of her death, and for a long time previous thereto, she had been living with her brother, William Wiley Forman, at his residence.\nThe paper offered and rejected was as follows:\n\u201c Whereas, Sarah A. Wiley, widow, late of the city of Philadelphia and state of Pennsylvania, died on the twenty-third day of February, A. D., 1897, and during her last sickness and in the house of her habitation, where she had resided for the space of ten days or more next before making such will, being of sound and disposing mind, but being physically unable to write or sign her name to a will, made her last will on the twenty-second day of February, A. D. 1897, and at the time of pronouncing her bequest she did bid the undersigned persons present to bear witness that such was her will in the following words, to wit: \u2018 Everything is to go to Willie. Everything is Willie\u2019s. I want everything to go to Willie, he is the only one who has taken care of me,\u2019 meaning thereby her only brother, William W. Forman, who was also present at the pronouncing of the aforesaid bequest.\n\u201c Witnessed and signed by us to the above as being the last will and testament of the said Sarah A. Wiley at Philadelphia, Pa., on the twenty-eighth day of February, A. D. 1897.\n\u201c Mrs. Marion S. Rowland,\n\u201c Mrs. Mary G. Forman,\n\u201c Sallie Wiley Forman.\u201d\nJuly 21, 1898:\nThe evidence in support of the alleged will is stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nError assigned was the decree of the court affirming decision of register of wills in refusing to admit will to probate.\nWm. Henry Lex and John G. Johnson, with them Christopher Hager, for appellant.\nMrs. Wiley was in extremis and suddenly overtaken by her illness, so that when informed of her condition she had not the time nor opportunity to make a written will. And in being so informed did not realize the seriousness of her condition, and was surprised when she realized she was in extremis : Conaughton\u2019s Est., 30 W. N. C. 202.\nMrs. Wiley, in effect, bade the persons present to bear witness to her will: Arnett v. Arnett, 27 111. 247 ; Baker v. Dodson, 4 Humphreys, 342.\nPeter Boyd, with him George W. Wilgus, for appellees.\nA nuncupative will can only be allowed in a case where it was made in the extremity of the testator\u2019s last sickness, which has come upon him so suddenly, unexpectedly and violently as to prevent him putting his testamentary wishes in writing: Boyer v.
