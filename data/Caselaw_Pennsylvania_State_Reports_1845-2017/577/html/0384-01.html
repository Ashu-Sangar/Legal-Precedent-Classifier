Shambach therefore contends that because the ten write-in ballots were improperly cast pursuant to Section 1112 A(b)(3) of the Election Code, they were invalid regardless of whether the voters’ intentions were clear and the ballots were free from fraud. Shambach further argues that the Commonwealth Court erred in finding that Section 1112-A(b)(3) was similar to the statute at issue in <em>Appeal of James </em>because that statute involved paper ballots and Section 1112— A(b)(3) concerns voting systems that use automatic tabulating equipment, such as the optical scanning system used here. According to Shambach, Section 1112-A(b)(3) is more akin to Section 1216(e), which bars the inclusion of write-in votes for candidates already listed on a voting machine and which this Court upheld as a reasonable restriction in <em>Appeal of Yerger, </em><a href="/pa/460/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="460 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="482905" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0537-01">460 Pa. 537</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="460 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="482905" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0537-01">333 A.2d 902</a> (1975).

In doing so, we reviewed a representative ballot that had been introduced as an exhibit before the trial court, and noted that although James’ name was stated twice on the ballot, only one vote had been cast for him, and thus there was no claim of fraud. <em>See id. </em>at 65. Moreover, we found that the ballot “unmistakably, unerringly and precisely demonstrated [the voters’] intention[s] to vote for James.” <em>Id. </em>at 65-66. Therefore, because there was no fraud involved and the will of the voters who cast the write-in votes was clear, we held that “it would be a stultification of the very principle of democracy behind the Election Code” to deprive James of the 151 write-in votes simply on the basis that the Code did not expressly permit voters to cast write-in votes for listed candidates. <em>Id. </em>at 66-67. Accordingly, we liberally construed the Election Code so as to allow the 151 write-in votes to be counted for James. <em>See id.</em>

When dealing with a comprehensive and carefully drawn legislative scheme for the conduct of elections, we must take care not to consider the particular elements of the scheme without regard to their place in the entire structure.

Thus, an election official counting votes in an election in which Section 1216(e) applies must look both at any votes cast on the machine and at any write-in votes cast on an irregular ballot, in order to determine if a voter has double voted. Although we noted that the voting machines used in the election had a locking mechanism whereby once a voter raised a slide to cast a write-in vote, the machine locked so that the voter could not cast a vote for a candidate whose name was on the machine, we found that Section 1216(e)’s bar against write-in votes for listed candidates “erected a considerable safeguard against the failure of the locking mechanism.” <a href="/pa/460/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="460 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="482905" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0537-01">333 A.2d at 906</a>.

Thus, contrary to Shambach’s claims otherwise, we do not find that Section 1112-A(b)(3) plainly requires that write-in votes cast for listed candidates cannot be counted. We further note that Section 1112-A(b)(3) was enacted after both Section 1003(e) and Section 1216(e) as well as our decisions in <em>Appeal of James </em>and <em>Appeal of Yerger </em>interpreting those respective statutes, and yet the General <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>Assembly modeled the language in Section 1112 A(b)(3) on that in Section 1003(e), rather than that in Section 1216(e). <em>Compare </em>25 P.S. § 3031.12(b)(3), <em>ie., </em>Section 1112-A(b)(3) (when casting a write-in vote, a voter may add <em>“the name of any person not already printed on the ballot for that office </em>”) (emphasis added), <em>and </em>25 P.S. § 2963(e), <em>ie., </em>Section 1003(e) (in the write-in space, an “elector may insert <em>the name of any person or persons whose name is not printed on the ballot as a candidate for such office </em>”) (emphasis added), <em>with </em>25 P.S. § 3056(e), <em>ie., </em>Section 1216(e) (“no irregular ballot shall be cast on a voting machine for any person for any office, whose name appears on the machine as a candidate for that office, <em>and any ballot so cast shall be void and not counted </em>”) (emphasis added). Like the Commonwealth Court below, we find that the General Assembly’s decision in this respect to be significant. In fact, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that we can presume from the General Assembly’s decision to model Section 1112-A(b)(3) after Section 1003(e) that it intended Section 1112-A(b)(3) to be interpreted the same way that we interpreted Section 1003(e) in <em>Appeal of James.</em>

The statute thus unambiguously limits write-in votes to candidates whose names are not already on the printed ballot.

In addition to promoting efficiency in vote tabulation, limiting write-in votes to persons whose names are not listed on the ballot is a safeguard against confusion and double-voting. There is no reason to write-in names that already appear on the ballot. Moreover, in a state with millions of voters, many people have the same name.

We can assume that the General Assembly considered this prospect, and in negating the statute, the Majority has lost sight of the prospect. In its place, the Majority has reposed power in the courts to substitute their own judgments as to what individual voters intended. Under the legislative scheme, there is a logical presumption that a voter who writes a name in intends to vote for a different candidate than the one listed.

      <em> </em>The statutory provisions at issue in <em>James, Yerger </em>and here do not repose in ballot examiners or courts the free-ranging power to attempt to ascertain voter intent or rule out fraud when a vote has been cast in violation of an explicit election statute. While voter intention is paramount in the realm of the fundamental right to vote, ascertaining that intent necessarily assumes a properly cast ballot. By enacting the proscription at issue here, the General Assembly presumably weighed the factors bearing on that question. What the General Assembly decidedly did not do is vest discretion in the executive or the judiciary to reweigh those factors in determining whether or not to count a particular vote. To distinguish among substantially identical provisions in the Code on the basis of the judiciary’s assessment of the potential, or lack thereof, for fraud; the ability, or lack thereof, to accurately ascertain voter intent; or the nature and practicality of examining the ballot depending upon the type of voting system used, is to ignore the fact that the General Assembly has not provided for such an inquiry. Absent constitutional infirmity—and none has been argued here—we have no authority to reshape the election system adopted by the Assembly.</p>

Section 1216(e), which was at issue in <em>Yerger, </em>includes the additional instruction with respect to write-in ballots that duplicate the name of a listed candidate: “any ballot so cast shall be void and not counted.” 25 P.S. § 3056(e). The <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>Majority concludes that, because Section 1112 A(b)(3) does not contain similar language—as Section 1003(e) did not in James—it does not plainly require write-in votes for listed candidates to be invalidated. But the <em>Yerger </em>Court did not discuss this statutory disparity or consider it grounds for distinction. Moreover, the distinction is illusory. Even though Section 1112-A(b)(3) does not say “void and not counted,” the explicit proscription it enacts can have meaning <em>only </em>if improper votes are not counted. It is absurd to say that the statute does not permit write-in votes for a listed candidate, but that those votes must be counted despite a violation of the proscription. The redundancy in Section 1216(e) does not somehow operate to create ambiguity in Section 1112-A(b)(3). Finally, this factual distinction, even if it had currency, does not create power in this Court to strike down otherwise constitutional legislation.</p>
