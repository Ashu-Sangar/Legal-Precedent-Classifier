The Office of the Attorney General (“Employer”) employed James Liptak (“Liptak”), as a Narcotics Agent II. On August 27, 1998, Liptak and his wife spent a portion of the early evening at the Wolfendale’s Bar in Indiana Borough, Pennsylvania. After returning home, Liptak decided to go to a convenience store for some food and to fill his state vehicle with gasoline. On his way to the convenience store, Liptak spotted Nathaniel Arthurs, the owner of Wolfendale’s Bar, standing outside of his establishment. Having some matters to discuss with Arthurs, Liptak entered the bar where he played darts and had three drinks. While at the bar, Liptak overheard a female patron ask Arthurs if he knew of the availability of drugs. Liptak engaged in a conversation with the patron who wished to go to another bar, possibly to purchase some drugs. Liptak offered to take the woman to the bar to investigate what could be a drug outlet.</p>

The individual stopped a police officer, Officer Brian Murphy, and advised the officer that Liptak appeared to be intoxicated and that he had a woman with him as he was entering his vehicle. Officer Murphy investigated and after following Liptak’s vehicle for <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>some distance, the officer, now with back-up, signaled for Liptak to pull over.</p>
    <p id="b545-4" data-blocks='[["BL_545.5",545,[128,450,1152,412]]]'>Liptak exhibited signs of intoxication including slurred speech, glassy eyes, an unsteady gait, and an odor of alcohol. Recognizing that Liptak was a state employee, Officer Murphy asked if he was on duty. After Liptak evaded the question, he stated that he was involved in performing state work. When Liptak was informed that he was in no condition to perform any duties, Liptak became verbally abusive. The officers arranged for Liptak to be picked up by his wife.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.6",545,[127,883,1156,466]]]'>On October 26,1998, after the Employer interviewed Liptak and after the Employer investigated the incident, Liptak was charged with: (1) unbecoming conduct; (2) use of alcohol while off-duty; (3) operation of an official vehicle while off-duty and while using alcohol; (4) violation of standards of professional courtesy and etiquette; and (5) unauthorized use of departmental equipment. In a report dated October 28, 1998, the investigating agent found validity to the first three charges. On November 17, 1998, Liptak was terminated.</p>

Furthermore, the parties stipulated to the specific issue to be determined by the arbitrator: “Under the agreement, was there just cause for the discharge of James E. Liptak, and, if not, what shall the remedy be?”</p>
    <p id="b546-3" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[277,327,1155,864]]]'>
      <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>In resolving this issue, Arbitrator Gershenfeld found that although Liptak had committed the alleged misconduct, there was not just cause for Liptak’s termination. Specifically, the arbitrator considered, “in determining just cause,” three extenuating circumstances raised by the Union. These circumstances included dissimilar discipline imposed upon other employees for like offenses, Liptak’s long service with the Employer, and Liptak’s subsequent rehabilitation. After considering these circumstances, Arbitrator Gershenfeld reinstated Liptak to his former position, without back pay, and conditioned Liptak’s reinstatement upon his ability to refrain from further misconduct during the first three months upon return to his employment. In essence, the arbitrator found that just cause was lacking for termination, but imposed upon Liptak a lengthy suspension and a “last chance” for continued employment.</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[272,1234,1159,1126]]]'>The Employer appealed the arbitrator’s adverse award to the Commonwealth Court contending that the award was erroneous and that pursuant to the agreement, once the arbitrator found that Liptak had committed the misconduct for which he was charged, the arbitrator was without authority to reduce the discipline imposed by the Employer. A three judge panel of the Commonwealth Court agreed. Specifically, the Commonwealth Court found that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement restricted the arbitrator’s authority solely to the issue of whether Liptak was terminated for just cause. The court went on to conclude that once the arbitrator determined that Liptak had engaged in the misconduct for which he was terminated, i.e., found just cause to exist, the arbitrator had no authority to modify the penalty imposed by the Employer, relying upon <em>Township of Penn v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, </em><a href="/a2d/713/1218-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="713 A.2d 1218" data-case-ids="11828732" data-case-paths="/a2d/713/1218-01">713 A.2d 1218</a> (Pa.Commw.Ct.1998). Thus, the Commonwealth Court in its decision impliedly equated the finding of misconduct with the contractual requirement of “just cause” for dismissal. Based on this reasoning, the Commonwealth Court vacated the arbitrator’s award.</p>

In doing so, we necessarily must consider whether the Commonwealth Court properly applied the standard of review to be utilized when reviewing a grievance labor arbitration award under PERA, i.e., the essence test, and whether under that test, the Commonwealth Court correctly equated “just cause” under the collective bargaining agreement to mean misconduct as engaged in by Liptak.</p>
    <p id="b547-4" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[130,886,1158,203]]]'>Before we may address the issue on which we granted allocatur, however, we must resolve a threshold issue, raised by the Union, of whether the Employer properly preserved for review its challenge to the arbitrator’s award.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.6",547,[131,1112,1158,833]]]'>In support of its position that the Employer waived the issue, the Union offers that the Employer never argued at arbitration that the arbitrator lacked the authority to consider mitigating factors or that the arbitrator did not have the authority to determine whether the penalty of discharge was too severe. Furthermore, according to the Union, the Employer did not object to the introduction of evidence by the Union regarding the Employer’s treatment of other employees accused of similar misconduct, evidence regarding Liptak’s work history, and evidence of Liptak’s post-incident rehabilitation. If the Employer believed that the arbitrator lacked authority to consider mitigating circumstances and to alter the discipline imposed under the collective bargaining agreement if it found that Liptak had engaged in misconduct, then it should have objected to the mitigating evidence offered by the Union.</p>
    <p id="b547-6" data-blocks='[["BL_547.7",547,[133,1975,1159,413]],["BL_548.1",548,[283,340,1154,200]]]'>The Employer responds it did not waive the issue of the arbitrator’s authority to modify the discipline that it originally imposed as neither party knew of the arbitrator’s treatment of the evidence until he rendered his award. Thus, the Employer’s argument now regarding the arbitrator’s authority did not arise until the arbitrator sustained the reasons for the Employer’s actions and yet decided a lesser penalty was more appropriate. Furthermore, according to the Employer, it did <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>object to the introduction of evidence regarding Liptak’s past performance. Finally, the Employer offers that the issue of whether an arbitrator exceeds his or her authority implicates subject matter jurisdiction, and therefore, cannot be waived.</p>
    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[276,574,1158,1390]]]'>We find in this case, that the Employer did not waive its challenge to the arbitrator’s award on appeal. Specifically, the parties submitted to arbitration the issue of whether there was just cause for the discharge of Liptak, and if not, what the proper remedy should be. That is to say, the parties squarely placed before the arbitrator the issue of whether Liptak’s discharge was appropriate under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the issue before the arbitrator was one of contract interpretation. The Employer on appeal challenged the arbitrator’s interpretation of the agreement and the remedy awarded by the arbitrator. It is axiomatic that the parties could not have been aware at the arbitration how the arbitrator would interpret the just cause provision of the agreement which was directly implicated in the issue as framed. Therefore, we do not find waiver. To do otherwise would be to penalize a party for failing to anticipate and refute possible interpretations of a collective bargaining agreement at arbitration. Likewise, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Employer did not object to the mitigating evidence offered by the Union, this does not necessarily require a finding of waiver. Such evidence was entirely relevant to the remedy to be imposed by the arbitrator if he determined, initially, that there was not just cause for dismissal. Thus, because under the issue as stipulated to by the parties, there was an independent basis for admission of the mitigating evidence, the failure to object cannot be a basis for a finding of waiver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

We have indicated that arbitration is preferred in this context for a number of reasons. Arbitration allows disputes between labor and management to be resolved impartially by a specialized tribunal. Disputes are resolved promptly. Arbitration is a relatively inexpensive endeavor. Dispute resolution by arbitration also relieves the burden placed upon the already strained resources of the court system. Furthermore, arbitration has been heralded as an important factor in reducing industrial strife. <em>Danville Area School District v.

The collective bargaining agreement between the parties provides in relevant part that the “Employer shall not demote, suspend, discharge, or take any disciplinary action against an employe without just cause.” Article 28, Master Agreement. The contract further states that “any grievance or dispute which may arise concerning the application, meaning or interpretation of this Agreement shall be settled” through the grievance and arbitration procedure. Article 37, Master Agreement.

The Employer argues, and the Commonwealth Court found, that the arbitrator’s award failed to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, i.e., was not rationally derived from the collective bargaining agreement, because once the arbitrator found that Liptak engaged in the misconduct charged, just cause for the termination was established and the arbitrator was required to uphold Liptak’s discharge. This argument loses its traction when one considers the role of the arbitrator in interpreting the parties’ collective bargaining agreement and the concept of just cause as it is understood in labor relations.</p>

Although there is no exact definition, there is a general consensus as to some of the factors that may be considered in determining whether there is just cause for discharge or discipline, and in evaluating the penalty imposed.

By equating the undefined just cause provision with the acts of misconduct engaged in by Liptak, the Commonwealth Court vitiated the bargained-for role of the arbitrator and discounted the general understanding of the concept of just cause. As noted above, the role of the arbitrator was to interpret the terms of the collective bargaining agreement to resolve disputes. Because the concept of just cause, as generally understood, may be more than a simple determination of whether the employee engaged in the misconduct, it was for the arbitrator to interpret the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and not the courts. <em>See Cheyney University, </em><a href="/a2d/743/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="743 A.2d 405" data-case-ids="11487623,95778" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/0405-01,/pa/560/0135-01">743 A.2d at 416</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
