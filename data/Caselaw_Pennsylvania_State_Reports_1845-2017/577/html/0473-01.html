Appellant offered anecdotal evidence of his traumatic childhood and history of mental health problems through the testimony of his mother, sister, father, and two childhood acquaintances, all of whom indicated that they were willing and available to testify at Appellant’s trial. These witnesses testified that Appellant’s father physically abused Appellant and his mother. Appellant’s father rejected Appellant, and held out Appellant’s cousin as his true son. Appellant’s mother left Appellant’s father when Appellant was approximately five years old, and they eventually moved in with her mother; Appellant witnessed his grandmother fall down the stairs which caused her subsequent death. Appellant continued to live in the predominantly white neighborhood, where he was harassed because he was bi-racial and because he wore thick glasses. When Appellant refused to go to school, Appellant’s mother would discipline him by having male friends, as well as Appellant’s father, beat him. The witnesses testified to incidents in which Appellant appeared to be incoherent, angry, and/or depressed. They also related that Appellant’s mental health treatment began from age 8 and involved several hospitalizations at mental health facilities.</p>
