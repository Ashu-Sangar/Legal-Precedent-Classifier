The “title theory” of mortgages deems a mortgage to be a conveyance, while a competing theory, the “lien theory,” suggests that a mortgage merely represents a security interest. Petitioners argue that a mortgage has always been understood to be a conveyance in Pennsylvania under the “title theory,” while courts and conveyancers have also understood that the practical purpose of a mortgage is to provide security in exchange for the mortgagor’s fulfillment of conditions. Petitioners maintain that a mortgage comprises both a conveyance and a defeasance upon fulfillment of the mortgage requirements. Petitioners further argue that Pennsylvania case law has resolved the conflict between the “title” and <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>“Ken” theories of mortgage law by recognizing that mortgages have elements of both conveyances and Kens. Thus, a mortgage has a dual nature, acting as a conveyance of property between the mortgagor and mortgagee, while also acting as Ken between the mortgagor or mortgagee and third parties.</p>

Intervenor’s Brief at 8-9. But the City argues that, under Pennsylvania common law, mortgages merely represent security interests, and not a transfer of property. The City further argues that the “title theory” of mortgages should be deemed inapplicable as obsolete, since a mortgagee nowadays cannot dispossess the mortgagor without a default and a notice to cure the default.</p>

Respondent responds that an assignment is defined in Ladner as “a writing under seal, signed, witnessed, acknowledged and recorded, assigning the bond and mortgage to an assignee.” <em>Ladner, supra, </em>§ 12.29(a), at 88. Respondent argues that such a writing only assigns an already existing interest in real estate previously created in favor of the mortgagee as defined by the mortgage document. As no assignee’s rights can rise to a higher level than the rights of the assignor, respondent concludes that no property transfer occurs as a result of a mortgage assignment.</p>

      <em>Mortgage Satisfactions</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b860-5" data-blocks='[["BL_860.6",860,[279,828,1154,1008]]]'>As to mortgage satisfactions, petitioners first note that a mortgage is an agreement where, if the mortgagor satisfies the debt as scheduled, then the mortgage and the estate conveyed to the mortgagee terminate and become void. <em>See Ladner, supra, </em>§ 12.11, at 19-20. The most common way to satisfy a mortgage is through the mortgagee’s execution and recording of a “satisfaction piece.” Although a typical satisfaction piece does not employ words of conveyance, a “defeasance clause” is defined as: “A mortgage provision stating that the conveyance to the mortgagee will be ineffective if the mortgagor pays the debt on time.” <em>Black’s Law Dictionary, </em>428 (7th ed.1999). If the defeasance clause makes the original conveyance ineffective, then the effect of the satisfaction piece, which carries out this action, must be to reconvey title back to the mortgagor. In short, the recording of a satisfaction piece effectuates a defeasance, the purpose of which is to undo or revoke the original conveyance accomplished by the mortgage. Thus, petitioners conclude, the effect of the satisfaction is to transfer the mortgaged property back to the mortgagor.</p>
    <p id="b860-6" data-blocks='[["BL_860.7",860,[278,1862,1153,527]],["BL_861.1",861,[127,346,1151,148]]]'>Respondent responds that a mortgage satisfaction merely discharges the lien of a mortgage and does not transfer property or a property interest. Respondent notes that a “mortgage satisfaction” means that a notation is made on the margin of the record of the mortgage (or by a satisfaction piece) that the mortgage has been paid and discharged. Additionally, 21 P.S. § 720-2 provides, in pertinent part, that “Every mortgagee may enter of record in the office where the mortgage is recorded a duly executed satisfaction piece which shall forever thereafter satisfy and discharge the lien of the <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>mortgage referred to therein.... ” Thus, respondent concludes that a mortgage satisfaction does not constitute a property transfer.</p>
    <p id="b861-5" data-blocks='[["BL_861.5",861,[124,527,1156,1115]]]'>“A mortgage is in essence a defeasible deed, requiring the grantee to reconvey the property held as security to the grantor upon satisfaction of the underlying debt or fulfillment of established conditions.” <em>Hahnemann Medical, </em><a href="/citations/?q=416%20A.2d%20604" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="416 A.2d 604">416 A.2d at 607</a> (emphasis added) (citing <em>Payne’s Administrator v.

Once again starting with our predicate holding that a mortgage conditionally conveys the subject property, it is clear that when the obligations of the mortgage are satisfied, the effect of a recorded satisfaction must be to convey the property back to the mortgagor. Additionally, respondent’s contrary argument is spurious. While it is true that a satisfaction piece discharges the lien on the property, it does not follow that such a discharge ineluctably cannot also effectuate a property transfer. As noted by petitioners, when the mortgage is satisfied, it becomes void and the effect of the satisfaction is that the property is reconveyed back to the mortgagor. Thus, there are several consequences to a mortgage satisfaction, including a discharge of the lien <em>and </em>a reconveyance of the property to the mortgagor. Accordingly, the Court Administrator properly defined property transfer to include mortgage satisfactions.</p>

A release redefines the real-estate collateral which reduces the amount of real estate that will remain subject to the mortgage, usually in consideration for payment of less than the full amount of the mortgage debt. Mortgage releases can be employed to release all of the real estate collateral and are sometimes used even when the mortgagor has fulfilled all of the conditions of the defeasances. Similar to assignments, if the release of the mortgage were not deemed a reconveyance of the property, a situation would <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>arise where there had been a conveyance of the property to the mortgagee as a result of the original mortgage, but no return of title to the mortgagor upon release. Thus, as a practical matter, the recording of a mortgage release is tantamount to a “reconveyance” of property. Additionally, petitioners note that common forms of release of mortgage contain conveyancing <em>language—i.e., </em>does remise, release, quit-claim, exonerate and discharge unto the mortgagor all that certain portion of said mortgaged premises. <em>See Ladner, supra, </em>12.27(d), at 73. Petitioners thus conclude that if the transfer was merely of the mortgagee’s lien or some interest in the real estate less than title itself, it would be inconsistent with the very terms of the typical release forms.</p>
    <p id="b862-5" data-blocks='[["BL_862.5",862,[274,1097,1154,471]]]'>Respondent responds by noting that Ladner defines a “mortgage release” as an instrument duly signed and acknowledged by the mortgage holder whereby he agrees not to collect the mortgage debt by sale of the property released. <em>See Ladner, supra, </em>§ 12.27(d), at 72. Respondent thus argues that a mortgage release is, at best, a forbearance to act and cannot be considered a transfer of a property interest because no new or further interest in property is created by the execution of the release.</p>
    <p id="b862-6" data-blocks='[["BL_862.6",862,[273,1638,1157,755]]]'>A release of mortgage typically occurs when a single mortgage covers more than one property and the mortgagee desires to release one property from the lien without releasing the others. <em>See Ladner, supra, </em>§ 12.27(d), at 72. Since the property was conveyed to the mortgagee when the mortgage was entered into, the effect of a release of that mortgage must be that the property released is reconveyed to the mortgagor. Respondent’s argument that a mortgage release is merely a forbearance to act on the part of the mortgagee is unpersuasive. While a mortgage release is a forbearance on the part of the mortgagee to act and releases the mortgagor from the obligations under the mortgage, the release also reconveys the property to the mortgagor. Thus, the Court Administrator properly deemed mortgage releases to be subject to Act 122.</p>

This is clear from the very names of the actions themselves, for one does not “satisfy” a <em>transfer, </em>or “release” a <em>transfer; </em>one satisfies, assigns, <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>or releases an <em>obligation. </em>As these actions transfer no property, they should not be subject to § 3733(a.l)(l)(v)’s fee.</p>
    <p id="b865-5" data-blocks='[["BL_865.5",865,[123,460,1154,749]]]'>Section 3733(a.l)(l)(v) lists three taxable items only: “deed, mortgage or property transfer.” As a release, assignment, or satisfaction of a mortgage is not itself a mortgage, it can only be taxed if it is a “property transfer.” If a mortgage had to be enumerated separately in order to be assessed the fee, (i.e., the legislature felt mortgages are not clearly a part of “property transfers” -within the meaning of this section) it follows that the lesser related documents referencing mortgages, such as assignments, releases, and satisfactions, must also be specifically named in order to be taxed. They could have been enumerated, for they are hardly uncommon documents, but they were not. The legislature’s language, listing but three taxable categories, cannot and should not be broadened by regulatory definitional pronouncements.</p>
