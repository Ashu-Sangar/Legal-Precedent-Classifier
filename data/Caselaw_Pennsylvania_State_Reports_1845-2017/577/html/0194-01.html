Pursuant to Rule of Criminal Procedure 352, the Commonwealth filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, and Appellant filed a motion to bar its imposition, as well as an omnibus pre-trial motion in which he sought, <em>inter alia, </em>suppression of certain statements he made to Pittsburgh detectives while en route from New York to Allegheny County. The trial court denied the omnibus motion after a hearing on December 9, 1996, deferring until completion of the guilt phase any ruling on the death penalty motion. Trial was held on December 9-12, 1996, after which the jury found Appellant guilty of three counts of first-degree murder. The following day, the same jury determined that the aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating factors, and set the penalty at death for each homicide.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court denied <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>Appellant’s prior motion to bar imposition of the death penalty, and formally imposed three consecutive sentences of death.</p>

Thereafter, on December 30, 1996, the court appointed John Elash, Esq. (present counsel) to represent Appellant for purposes of filing a petition pursuant to the Capital Unitary Review Act (“CURA”), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9570-9579. The trial court denied the post-sentence motions by order dated April 24, 1997, and no appeal from such denial was taken. Subsequently, on May 2, 1997, Attorney Elash filed a CURA petition alleging trial counsel’s ineffectiveness in preparing for trial, and challenging the constitutionality of CURA. An amended CURA petition was filed August 4, 1997. This Court suspended CURA one week later, <em>see In re Suspension of the Capital Unitary Review Act, </em>No. 224 Criminal Procedural Rules Docket No. 2 (filed August 11, 1997), <em>reh’g denied, </em><a href="/pa/554/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="554 Pa. 625" data-case-ids="765980" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0625-01">554 Pa. 625</a>, <a href="/a2d/722/0676-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="722 A.2d 676" data-case-ids="11774776,765980" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0676-01,/pa/554/0625-01">722 A.2d 676</a> (Pa.1999), effectively rendering Appellant’s CURA petition moot and ending Attorney Elash’s representation.</p>

The matter thus remained dormant for several years until the trial court discovered that no decision was pending in the case. The court then issued an order, dated February 28, 2001, <em>inter alia, </em>reciting that Appellant’s CURA petition had been dismissed by operation of law upon CURA’s suspension, withdrawing all prior counsel, and re-appointing Attorney Elash to represent Appellant in his appeal to this Court. The trial court additionally prepared an opinion addressing the issues raised in Appellant’s pre-trial motion, in his death penalty motion, during trial, in his post-sentence motions, and in his CURA petition. The case was then certified for immediate appeal to this Court.</p>

Kohl-man then heard Anderson say, “Who is it?” and then, “Gerald.” A few seconds later an individual whose voice and accent Kohlman recognized as belonging to Appellant, picked up the phone and spoke with Kohlman. He identified himself as ‘G’, which Kohlman recognized as Appellant’s nickname. The phone was then placed down, and Kohlman heard Anderson say “ow” or “stop Gerald.” She then heard the sounds of a struggle, and then Anderson saying, “Call the police.” After summoning the police, Kohlman went to Anderson’s home, and, as she pounded on the front door, the police arrived and forced entry. Kohlman entered the house and observed Anderson on the floor and Anderson’s 18-day-old baby, Melanie Watkins, lying on the couch. She tried unsuccessfully to detect pulses on both victims. The police then asked her to wait outside on the front porch.</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[134,1422,1157,521]]]'>Another neighbor, Ronnie Williams, saw Appellant on the porch of the Anderson home during the evening of July 20, 1994. He said that he recognized Appellant as Anderson’s boyfriend, and that he saw him knocking on the front door to her home. He did not see him enter, because he went to answer the phone. When he returned to the front door several minutes later, the police had already arrived. The following day, Williams picked Appellant’s photo from a photo array as the individual he saw. He also identified Appellant at trial as the person he had seen.</p>

Officer Ghafoor arrived as Kohlman was trying to enter the residence. Upon entering, he observed Anderson on the floor and the baby on the couch. Anderson had wounds to her face and the baby had what appeared to be a gunshot wound to the abdomen. When the officer proceeded upstairs to secure the residence, he discovered the body of nine-year-old Charles Kevin Kelly, Jr. (“Kevin”) in the hallway <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>at the top of the stairs. Officer Ghafoor observed that Kevin had a bullet wound near his right ear and was not moving or breathing.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[274,515,1153,1216]]]'>Pittsburgh Homicide Detective Thomas Foley processed the crime scene. He testified that in the living room, where the bodies of Anderson and her daughter were found, a coffee table had been upturned and its contents spilled on the floor. Numerous spent .22 caliber shell casings, as well as several live rounds, were found throughout the room. Shell casings and spent bullets were also strewn about Kevin’s body. All three victims were warm to the touch, indicating recent death. Forensic pathologist Leon Rozin, M.D., testified that the victims all died of multiple gunshot wounds: eighteen-day-old Melanie Watkins had been shot twelve times; Beth Ann Anderson received eight shots to her trunk and head; and her son Kevin was shot five times in the face, head, and neck. There was soot or powder stripling around many of the wounds, indicating that the bullets had been fired at close range. The Commonwealth’s ballistics expert, Dr. Robert Levine of the Allegheny County Crime Lab, testified that all of the spent cartridge casings found at the crime scene were discharged from the same semi-automatic .22 caliber firearm, which was capable of holding a thirty-round clip. He additionally indicated that the markings on the bullets found at the scene were consistent with having been fired from a “Tech .22” semi-automatic handgun.</p>
    <p id="b488-6" data-blocks='[["BL_488.6",488,[274,1756,1152,622]]]'>Appellant’s friend Keith Platt testified that he had been with Appellant at a bar until approximately 9:30 p.m. on the night of the murders. One or two days after the crime, Appellant called Platt and said: “You know who this is. I’m not f—ing around. You know what I’ve done. Shut up and listen.” Appellant then told Platt that he needed Platt to contact several mutual acquaintances who owed Appellant money, and instruct them to send the money to Appellant. When Platt declined, Appellant threatened to harm Platt and his family if he did not cooperate. Platt also testified that he knew Appellant only as ‘G,’ and did not learn that his actual name was Gerald until after the murders.</p>

After waiving those rights orally and by executing a form to that effect, Appellant gave the agent a statement. He said that, on the evening in question, he left Pittsburgh at approximately 7:00 in his grandmother’s car. He admitted having been at Anderson’s house earlier that day, but denied having argued with her. He said that he drove to Fort Lee, New Jersey, left the car there, and took a bus into New York City. Although Appellant admitted knowing that he was wanted for Anderson’s murder, he claimed not to have been aware of the deaths of his daughter Melanie or Anderson’s son Kevin. He also admitted having seen an episode of the television show, “America’s Most Wanted,” which featured a story about him, but claimed that he had not paid close enough attention to learn of the death of his daughter, Melanie. He admitted further that he never inquired into Melanie’s well being after learning of Anderson’s death.</p>
    <p id="b489-5" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[138,1468,1153,687]]]'>On August, 3, 1995, Pittsburgh homicide Detectives Logan and McDonald drove to New York to bring Appellant back for trial. After an extradition hearing at which Appellant was represented by New York counsel, Attorney Earl Rawlins, Appellant and the two officers left for Pittsburgh. Detective Logan testified that, during the initial part of the drive, Appellant was talkative, but confined the discussion to matters unrelated to the homicides. As they approached Somerset, Pennsylvania, however, Appellant raised the topic of the killings. Detective Logan interrupted Appellant and advised him of his rights. Appellant said that he understood his rights and agreed to make a statement, which Detective Logan transcribed, and Appellant ultimately signed.</p>

The court denied the suppression request, reasoning that Appellant was raising an issue of credibility for the jury, rather than a question of whether the alleged confession violated his constitutional rights.</p>
    <p id="b490-4" data-blocks='[["BL_490.5",490,[273,612,1160,1374]]]'>According to Detective Logan’s trial testimony, Appellant began his statement by saying that “he was not the monster that the media and the police had panned him out to be.” He claimed that the killings were not premeditated, that they were just “something that happened.” He indicated that he had become jealous of a man named Lou with whom Anderson had begun spending time, and that he believed that Anderson was not being forthright with him regarding her relationship with Lou. A day or so before the murders, Anderson had spurned a marriage proposal. Appellant was also upset that his cousin Tyrone had stolen crack cocaine from him instead of bringing it from New York to Pittsburgh as instructed, and that, when he told Anderson about it, she made him feel like a “chump.” On July 19, 1994, still upset from this series of events, Appellant borrowed his grandmother’s car and drove towards Harrisburg on the turnpike, but then returned to Pittsburgh, arriving the morning of the 20th. He had in his possession a Tech .22 semi-automatic handgun equipped with a twenty-round clip. After driving around Pittsburgh and searching unsuccessfully for Tyrone, he visited his cousin Willa in an effort to calm down. Appellant then drove to Anderson’s house, gained entry with his key, and found Anderson talking on the phone, whereupon he walked into the kitchen, and then came back into the room where she was talking and shot her. Appellant denied having picked up the phone and spoken to anyone.</p>

When Appellant reached the top of the steps, Anderson’s son Kevin, who had come into the upstairs hallway, made eye contact with Appellant and then grabbed Appellant around the waist. At that point, Appellant decided to kill Kevin “because he knew who I was and what I had just done.” He then pushed Kevin away and shot him. Appellant checked <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>the rest of the second floor of the house and, finding nobody else, proceeded back downstairs, where Anderson’s body was on the floor and Appellant’s daughter Melanie was asleep on the couch. He then shot Melanie because he felt that he could not raise her, and he did not want anyone else to do so. Appellant tucked the gun in his waistband and left Anderson’s residence, trying to look “normal.” He could not recall how many times he had shot any of the victims. As he stopped to put gas in the car, he noticed that his ammunition clip was empty. He then drove to New York, where he threw the gun into the incinerator of an apartment building.</p>
    <p id="b491-5" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[134,934,1158,568]]]'>When Appellant and the detectives arrived at the headquarters of the Homicide Unit in Pittsburgh, Appellant was again advised of his rights; he then read and executed a preinterrogation warning form in the presence of Detectives Logan and McDonald, which contained <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Detective Logan reviewed his notes of Appellant’s statement with Appellant, and asked Appellant to sign each page if it accurately reflected what he had told the detective. Appellant signed the notes; after speaking with his mother by telephone, he declined to repeat his statement or have it tape-recorded.</p>

He also testified in his own behalf and denied involvement in the crime. He maintained that on the day of the killings he had left Pittsburgh in his grandmother’s car at 7:00 p.m., and that he was on the Pennsylvania Turnpike en route to New York when the killings occurred later that evening. He asserted that the statement produced by Detective Logan was fabricated, and that <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>the signatures on the notes and the pre-interrogation form were forged. He also claimed that Special Agent Bendetson had lied about the content of their discussion, and that Monique Kohlman had lied about having heard his voice on the phone. Additionally, he averred that his friend Keith Platt had lied about the threatening phone call that Platt allegedly received from Appellant. During cross-examination, Appellant admitted having been involved in drug trafficking, and claimed that, upon learning of the murders, he decided to stay in New York and conduct “illegal businesses” to pay for an attorney in the event that he was subsequently arrested.</p>

In view of the uncontested evidence that all three victims died of multiple gunshot wounds to vital areas of the body, and that the bullets were all fired from the same gun, the only question in dispute was the identity of the killer. In this regard, the Commonwealth presented multiple witnesses whose testimony tended to prove that Appellant was the perpetrator, including two police officers who recounted Appellant’s detailed confession. Additionally, the Commonwealth’s handwriting expert concluded that the signature on the confession matched Appellant’s sample signatures. It was also established that Appellant fled the jurisdiction and concealed himself from the police for ten months following the incident. In light of these proofs, the jury was justified in concluding that Appellant was the person who killed the victims. Accordingly, we now turn to Appellant’s claims of error.</p>

The challenged references were made by Keith Platt—who testified to the substance of a call Appellant made to him a day or two after the incident—and Detective Logan, who recounted a confession Appellant provided while traveling to Allegheny County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> In particular, after Platt described the threatening call he received from Appellant in which Appellant demanded money from their mutual acquaintances, defense counsel sought, on <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>cross-examination, to undermine the plausibility of Appellant’s having asked Platt to perform this service by eliciting testimony that Appellant had known such acquaintances longer than he had known Platt.

Platt responded, “Probably through drug dealings.” Later, when Detective Logan was recounting Appellant’s confession, he indicated that Appellant spoke of having traveled to New York to obtain “his drug supply,” and stated that the events stemming from one such trip—namely, Appellant’s cousin having stolen drugs from Appellant—contributed to his progressive anger leading up to the killings. Detective Logan explained that Appellant described these events in an effort to portray the killings as non-premeditated, but just “something that happened.” Appellant offers alternative theories to support his claim that all such drug testimony should have been excluded. He argues that: the trial court erred in allowing the testimony; counsel was ineffective for not “properly objecting” to it or seeking a cautionary instruction; and the trial court should have “redacted” the portions of Appellant’s confession which involved Appellant’s trips to New York to obtain drugs.</p>
