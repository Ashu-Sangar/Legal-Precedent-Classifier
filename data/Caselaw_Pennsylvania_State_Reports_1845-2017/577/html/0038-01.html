The prior version of § 651 simply referred to an "examination.” In 1996, the statutory language was amended to read, "physical examination or expert interview.” <em>See </em>Section 9 of the Act of June 24, 1996, P.L. 350, <em>amending, </em>77 P.S. § 651. The WCJ's action appears inadvertent because his discussion focused on the term "physical examination” in the analysis.

Claimant also argues adding the "physical” modifier to "examination” demonstrates the General Assembly’s intent to restrict employer’s access to claimant.

The majority notes the “medical” definition of “physical examination” as an “[e]xamination of the body by auscultation, palpation, percussion, inspection, and olfaction[,]” but rejects this definition in the workers’ compensation context, apparently concluding that medical definitions do not have legal force. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, op. at 44^5, 842 A.2d at 353 (quoting Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary at 1584 (19th ed.2001)).

An “examination” is commonly defined as “[a]ny investigation or inspection made for the purpose of diagnosis; usually qualified by the method used.” Steadman’s Medical Dictionary at 607 (26th ed.1995). <em>See also </em>Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary at 718-719 (“[t]he act or process of inspecting the body and its systems to determine the presence or absence of disease.

Section 1903(b) of the Statutory Construction Act provides that “[gjeneral words shall be construed to take their meanings and be restricted by preceding particular words.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(b) (emphasis added). Thus, use of the term “physical” in front of the word “examination” in Section 314(a) of the Workers’ Compensation Act is meant to limit the scope of the examination.</p>

However, <em>Marañe </em>was decided prior to the 1996 amendments to Section 314(a). The majority also avers that we are not bound by medical definitions of medical terms, pointing to the fact that “disability” is defined for workers’ compensation purposes as “loss of earning power,” which imports both economic and physical findings. <em>See Unora v.

      <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>Steadman’s defines “disability” as “any restriction of lack of ability to perform an activity in a manner or within the range considered normal for a human being. The term disability reflects the consequences of impairment in terms of functional performance and activity by the individual----” Steadman’s Medical Dictionary at 490. Understanding disability in terms of loss of earning power is entirely consistent with a consequence of impairment of functional performance. This alleged deviation from a purely medical definition of a term does not justify the majority’s decision in the present matter to ignore completely the settled understanding of a physical examination, to be conducted by a medical professional, in the unquestionably well-intended pursuit of the spirit of the Workers’ Compensation Act.</p>

As the legislature has acted within the last decade to limit the scope of Section 314(a) by adding the word “physical” to describe the acceptable examination, I cannot sign on to an opinion that would allow an examination that is not fairly characterized as a “physical examination.” <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921 (“When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit”).</p>
