The lower courts here split on the issue: the trial court determined that the construction contract claims are subject to the four-year period of limitations, but the Superior Court reversed, holding that such claims are subject to the six-year limitation. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the appropriate limitations period is the four-year period provided in Section 5525(a)(8). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand to that court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>

The Mall covers approximately thirty acres and contains various stores and shops. Construction of the Mall began in May 1992 and was substantially completed in September 1993. The Mall is built on land above a former coal mine. In 1991, before construction began, a soil subsurface investigation was completed and Gustine was advised of the existence of carbonaceous shale <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>layers in the ground, which often contain sulfide materials that may expand when exposed to moisture and oxygen. Gustine was further advised that structures built on carbonaceous shale are subject to possible damage in the form of heaving, buckling, and cracking due to the movement of the earth below the foundation.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[276,677,1151,311]]]'>Gustine contracted with appellant Architectural Services Group, Inc. (ASG) to design the site, to oversee the progress and the quality of the construction process, and to guard Gustine against construction defects or deficiencies in the work. Article 9.3 of the contract between ASG and Gustine provided that:</p>

By early 1998, movement or heaving had occurred in floor slabs of all buildings, sidewalks, and parking lots. Gustine employed several of the appellants to investigate the cause of the damage and to assess possible remedial actions. Thereafter, Gustine incurred substantial expenses to remediate the structural damage.</p>

On January 27, 2000, Gustine filed a complaint consisting of 357 paragraphs, naming 13 defendants and including 30 separate counts for breach of contract, breach of implied warranty, breach of duty to negotiate in good faith <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>and fair dealing, fraudulent misrepresentation, concealment, and professional negligence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The complaint alleged that Gus-tine incurred remediation costs in excess of one million dollars as well as lost profits.</p>

Consequently, since no other subsection refers to written contracts for the construction of real estate, the legislature intended for these contracts to be governed by the four-year limitation period of section 5525.</blockquote>

The panel reversed on the claims sounding in contract, however, holding that the six-year period in Section 5527, and not the four-year period provided in Section 5525(a)(8), applies to contract actions alleging latent real estate construction defects. The panel noted that, prior to its amendment in 1982, the Judicial Code had provided a six-year limitations period for actions <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>“upon a contract, obligation or liability founded upon a bond, note or other instrument in writing.” The panel viewed the 1982 legislation as intending to simplify various statutes of limitations by, among other things, reducing the limitations period for contracts actions to four years, while also establishing Section 5527’s six-year “catchall” provision for actions not otherwise specifically addressed. Nevertheless, the panel concluded that the residual limitations period governed this action, which involves written real estate construction contracts.</p>

By the same token, Gustine argues that a question of “unequal treatment” would arise if citizens who build on their own, such as Gustine, were afforded a shorter period of limitations than is available to persons who contract to build real estate as part of a condominium or other group association.

Gustine argues that it is disingenuous of ASG to defend a four-year limitations’ period by touting the availability of equitable tolling doctrines on one hand, while claiming the doctrines are foreclosed on the other.</p>

However, this narrow point is of little avail to Gustine because, as the trial court properly recognized, the plain language of Section 5528(a)(8) is clear and unambiguous: if the proviso concerning other limitations periods is not applicable, then the four-year rule set forth in 5525(a)(8) controls contract actions based upon a writing. This lawsuit in fact is just such a contract action and it is undisputed that there is no other specific statutory provision affording a longer period of limitations for actions upon real estate construction contracts, or latent defects in construction. There is no ambiguity in the statute upon its face, when read in conjunction with the other limitations provisions in the Judicial Code, or when read in conjunction with other limitations provided in other statutes, such as the Condominium Law, the Planned Community Law, or the Cooperative Law. Again, Section 5528(a)(8) specifically contemplates that there may be exceptions to the four-year, general contract action rule set forth. Implicit in such a legislative classification is a conclusion that, where as here, the proviso is not implicated, the four-year rule itself controls.</p>

Instead, the Assembly spoke in broad terms—just as it had in the prior version of the statute which provided a six-year period of limitations for contract actions—while leaving the door open for specific statutory exceptions.

The fact that the previous version of the statute provided a six-year period of limitations for actions upon written contracts, while the amended statute made those very same actions subject to a four-year period, is no basis for a finding of ambiguity.

But we do not dispute that the General Assembly could make the rational determination that a uniform general rule affording some measure of predictability is appropriate. The Assembly also could consider that existing equitable doctrines may operate to toll the limitations period and afford sufficient flexibility to capture the case where an injustice might otherwise result. The balancing of such “policy concerns” is the essence of the legislative process. Absent ambiguity or constitutional infirmity, it is not the place of this Court or the Superior Court to substitute its own balancing of equities in order to determine what limitations period is most “fair.” <em>See Taylor, supra, </em>at 630-32, <a href="/pa/576/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="841 A.2d 108" data-case-ids="16725,9281380" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0622-01,/a2d/841/0108-01">841 A.2d at 113</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2004%20WL%2086273" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="2004 WL 86273">2004 WL 86273</a>, at 5 (“Absent a valid constitutional objection ... it is not our role to second-guess th[e] legislative judgment.”); <em>Pantuso Motors, supra.</em>

We went on to note that we "express no opinion regarding the wisdom" of the <em>Romeo </em>panel's conclusion that the "interest of fair play” would have required the same result under the 1982 amendments. <em><a href="/pa/539/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="652 A.2d 830" data-case-ids="474135,7874655" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0390-01,/a2d/652/0830-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/539/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="652 A.2d 830" data-case-ids="474135,7874655" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0390-01,/a2d/652/0830-01">at 832-33</a>.</p>

The discovery rule is a judicially created device that tolls the running of the applicable statute of limitations until the point where the complaining party knows or reasonably should know that he has been injured and that his injury has been caused by another party's conduct. The complaining party must use reasonable diligence to discover the cause of an injury. <em>Crouse, </em><a href="/a2d/745/0606-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="745 A.2d 606" data-case-ids="11478939,95796" data-case-paths="/a2d/745/0606-01,/pa/560/0394-01">745 A.2d at 611</a>. While this Court has approved of the discovery rule, it has not definitively accepted or rejected the repair doctrine. That doctrine, however, has found considerable acceptance in the Superior Court. Under the repair doctrine, the applicable statute of limitations will be tolled where the evidence reveals that repairs were attempted; representations were made that <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>the repairs would cure the defects; and the complaining party relied upon such representations. <em>Amodeo v.

Prior to the 1982 amendments, the statutory construct provided that written contracts were subject to a limitations period of six years, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5527(2)(1980), while sales contracts, oral contracts, contracts relating to the furnishing of fixtures, and contracts implied in law were <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>subject to a limitations period of only four years. <em><a href="/a2d/733/0642-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="733 A.2d 642" data-case-ids="11547165" data-case-paths="/a2d/733/0642-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 5525(1980).
