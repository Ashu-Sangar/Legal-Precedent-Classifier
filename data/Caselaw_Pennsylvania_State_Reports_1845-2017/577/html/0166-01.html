The Board found that it had a legitimate interest in regulating the practice of auctioneering in order to safeguard the public in Pennsylvania, and both Auctioneers had been disciplined by other states for incidents of misconduct that were serious enough to establish a pattern thereby warranting the penalty imposed against Auctioneer Khan and the license revocation of Auctioneer Butt.

It decided that violations of due process occurred when the Board imposed sanctions based upon another jurisdiction’s disciplinary order, where there is neither an admission nor finding of wrongdoing regarding the alleged conduct. It found that the Maine Order could serve as a basis for a sanction in Pennsylvania because Auctioneer Khan had essentially pled <em>nolo contendere </em>in that Consent Agreement.

The Auctioneers complain that the Board ignored these contentions, which should have mitigated in their favor. We cannot agree. The Board, in a reciprocal disciplinary action, may not consider the merits of the discipline imposed by the foreign jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum in which to litigate them. We conclude that, in order to render the imposition of reciprocal discipline improper, the auctioneer must show either that: 1) there was no disciplinary action taken in the foreign disciplinary proceeding; 2) an appeal from the disciplinary action is pending; 3) the foreign disciplinary proceeding was <em>ultra vires </em>or lacking in the fundamentals of due process; or 4) the misconduct established in the foreign adjudication justifies substantially different discipline in this Commonwealth. <em>Cf Morrissey v.

That is a privilege governed strictly as a matter of state policy and that policy is set by the legislature. No state must admit a lawyer, auctioneer, doctor, chiropractor, real estate agent, or funeral director from any other state unless it so desires; when it does, it establishes such standards as it feels proper with respect to reciprocal licensing. Reciprocal discipline prevents licensed professionals from violating ethical rules, being disciplined, and then transferring to a new jurisdiction to continue to practice with an unblemished record of ethical conduct. The rules of reciprocal discipline expressly allow states to treat decisions reached in the disciplinary proceedings of other jurisdictions as a rebuttable conclusion that the auctioneer has engaged in conduct that violates ethical rules. It is beyond cavil that ethical rules are not for punishing wrongdoers, but have been established to determine the fit<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>ness of an individual to be an auctioneer as well as to protect the public from unscrupulous operators. <em>See, e.g., </em>63 P.S. §§ 734.3, 734.8, 734.13, 734.16-734.20.

In the instant matter, both auctioneers were provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard in Virginia, Maine, Texas, and Wisconsin by the proper licensing authority of each state. Only Auctioneer Khan was able to demonstrate that no disciplinary action was taken in the Virginia proceeding. Neither auctioneer contends that the disciplinary actions taken by Virginia, Maine, Texas, or Wisconsin are currently on appeal. In addition, there was no infirmity of proof because each auctioneer signed a consent agreement ending the disciplinary action.

The Auctioneers, at oral argument, plausibly asserted that professionals should be disciplined in like manner, analogizing to the disciplinaty rules issued by this Court. An important distinction is immediately apparent, however, in that admission of attorneys to practice law results from a judicial act and this Court is the sole arbiter of attorney discipline. In contrast, statutory licensing of other occupations and professions is legislative in nature and statutory licensing criteria are enacted by the General Assembly. Further, regulations promulgated by the governing occupational or professional boards spring from a legislative grant of authority and are administered by an executive agency. Thus, while the remaining co-equal branches of government are free to create their professional disciplinaty rules in concert with those of this Court, this Court may not impose its system of discipline on the professionals of our co-equal branches of government.</p>

With regard to the portion of the Board’s order as to auctioneer Khan which was based upon the Virginia consent order, however, I would also credit Khan’s argument that the Board’s actions are inconsistent with constitutional procedural due process guarantees.

Furthermore, the end result of the Virginia proceedings was not of a nature generally associated with an official determination that the licensee needs discipline: there was no revocation or suspension of the license, or even payment of a fíne, but mere reimbursement of administrative costs. The order, then, only provides evidence that allegations of possible misconduct were made and investigated, and that a settlement was reached. Indeed,</p>
