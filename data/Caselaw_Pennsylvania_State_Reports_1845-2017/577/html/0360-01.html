About an hour and a half was spent processing the pizza shop; the detectives left there <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>and spent half an hour searching the intersection where the robbers’ car had been stopped. They returned to the police station around 11:15 p.m.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[280,506,1154,776]]]'>Detective Fetters did not begin to question appellant until hours after his arrest, but appellant’s argument that there was “no reason to delay [the] interrogation,” is not correct. The detective explained at the suppression hearing that because he was the detective assigned to the case, he alone was responsible for interviewing three suspects, including appellant, and no other detective would have done so while he was processing the crime scene, especially when they had their own assignments coming in. <em>See </em>N.T. Suppression Hearing, 10/1/97, at 80-81. Half an hour into the interview, the detective realized appellant’s deception and had to spend another hour finding out his real name and obtaining his aunt’s permission to speak with him. Thus, nearly six and one-half hours passed until appellant was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and made his statement.</p>
    <p id="b660-6" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[277,1315,1155,679]]]'>Nothing in the record indicates this delay was aimed at overcoming appellant’s will, or that he was subjected to coercive tactics. Rather, the detective began interviewing appellant within five hours of arrest, as soon as feasible. Once appellant’s real name and age were ascertained, in spite of his efforts to conceal them, he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings; he answered “yes” to each question concerning his understanding of his rights and his waiver of them. Detective Fetters testified although appellant seemed “a bit nervous ... [a] bit apprehensive,” when he was given the warnings, he “became a little bit more relaxed and began to talk to me freely,” after being told his aunt had given permission for him to be interviewed. N.T. Suppression Hearing, 10/1/97, at 91.</p>

Detective Fetters was the only officer who stayed in the room with appellant. There were several breaks taken during the statement. Appellant was permitted to use the bathroom, and was given something to eat. The detective interrupted the interview to fill out a <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>juvenile flow chart on appellant, as well as to rest his hand from writing; during these breaks he told appellant he could relax. The detective testified that at no time did appellant tell him he wanted to stop the interview, or that he did not understand the conversation. Appellant’s physical demeanor never changed. Appellant signed his name at the conclusion of the four-page statement, as well as on each page. The entire process took just under four hours.</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[125,785,1154,799]]]'>Nothing in the duration or means of interrogation, appellant’s physical or psychological state, the conditions attendant to detention, the attitude exhibited by the detective during interrogation, or the duration or circumstances of appellant’s pre-interrogation detention, indicates appellant’s will was overborne or that his statement was the product of coercion. Although appellant was a juvenile, he lied about his age to prevent the discovery of outstanding bench warrants for his arrest. Appellant was aware he was being charged with robbery, and he knew his rights. His agreement to waive those rights and make a statement cannot be said to have been anything other than knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Accordingly, the Superior Court and the suppression court properly concluded the statement was admissible at trial, and appellant’s judgment of sentence is affirmed.</p>

That decision properly was made prospective because the new six hour rule directly affected daily police investigatory procedures. It would be inappropriate to fault police for relying upon existing law, rather than a time-specific, prophylactic rule that was not in existence at the time of an interrogation and arraignment. The Court’s formal abrogation of the <em>Davenport/Duncan </em>rule—or, more properly, our belated recognition that the rule has evolved in such a way that it is no longer the bright line rule it once purported to be—does not trigger equivalent concerns of detrimental reliance. As with most rules of procedure, this rule governed the conduct of the government, not that of the suspect; it did not operate to create a new personal “right” of criminal defendants. It is unlikely in the extreme that appellant here temporally confessed when he did in reliance upon the fact that more than six hours had passed since his arrest and, therefore, he could later invoke <em>Davenport/Duncan </em>in the hope of suppressing his otherwise-voluntary admissions. Indeed, given how riddled the rule has become with exceptions, no party who would benefit from it could properly be said to have “relied” upon it. <em>Contrast, Commonwealth v.

Finding that the <em>Duncan-Davenport </em>rule has essentially become ineffectual, the majority now abandons the rule and instead adopts a “totality of the circumstances” approach to the question of when statements will be deemed admissible. My primary concern with this approach is simply that, in the absence of reasonable and clear time restraints in which police officers are allowed to question suspects, suspects are much <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>more likely to be exposed to the coercive effect of prolonged police interrogation, which in turn, will yield a greater pool of unreliable confessions. By using time restrictions to curb police officers’ potential abuse of the interrogation process, the <em>Duncan-DavenpoH </em>rule, in my view, better safeguards the constitutional rights of defendants than the new “totality of the circumstances” approach adopted by the majority today and thus, should not be abandoned.</p>
    <p id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[125,775,1156,1227]]]'>Applying the <em>Duncan-DavenpoH </em>rule to the instant case, however, I do agree that Appellant is ultimately not entitled to relief. As this Court stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Washington, </em>and as I have reiterated above, the <em>Duncan-DavenpoH </em>rule is premised on a desire to avoid the coercive effect of prolonged police interrogation. <a href="/pa/547/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="547 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="468656" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0550-01">547 Pa. 550</a>, <a href="/a2d/692/1018-01" class="citation" data-index="183" data-cite="692 A.2d 1018" data-case-ids="11919311,468656" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1018-01,/pa/547/0550-01">692 A.2d 1018</a>, 1023 (1998). Consistent with this principle, this Court has found that the <em>Duncan-DavenpoH </em>rule has not been violated when a statement was obtained within six hours of the start of questioning on the offense at issue, even if that statement was obtained after the defendant had been in police custody for more than six hours. <em>See Washington, </em><a href="/a2d/692/1018-01" class="citation" data-index="184" data-cite="692 A.2d 1018" data-case-ids="11919311,468656" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1018-01,/pa/547/0550-01">692 A.2d at 1023</a> (no violation of <em>Duncan-DavenpoH </em>rule where period of pre-arraignment interrogation did not exceed six hours); <em>Commonwealth v.

Here, Appellant was arrested at 6:30 p.m., but interrogation did not begin until approximately 11:15 p.m. The interrogation ended at 4:35 a.m., less than six hours after it began, and Appellant gave his statement. Under these facts, I would follow the reasoning of this Court in <em>Washington </em>and <em>Persiano, </em>and find that the <em>Duncan-DavenpoH </em>rule has not been violated. As such, I am able to concur in the majority opinion’s denial of relief to Appellant.</p>
