(DL <em>&amp; </em>F) appeals from an Order of the Superior Court that affirmed an Order of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas (trial court) that granted the Petition to Intervene, Stay and Set Aside the Writ of Execution filed by DL &amp; F on a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MSDW) brokerage account. In 1994, Libros opened an Active Assets brokerage account with MSDW.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This was a joint account between Libros, Daughter, and her son, Joel B. Sarner (Son). At the time that she opened her MSDW account, she expressed to her account executive her wish that, so long as she was alive and in full control of her faculties, she would retain the ownership of, control of, and access to the account. Libros created the account so that her children could make withdrawals if she became incapacitated, as well as to fulfill her desire to use it as an estate planning device. Libros maintains that the monies in the account remain hers and that the account is titled jointly only as a matter of convenience. It is undisputed among the parties that Libros made all contributions to the brokerage account.</p>
    <p id="b924-5" data-blocks='[["BL_924.6",924,[278,1445,1152,781]]]'>From time to time, Libros issued checks and made withdrawals from the account. She alone possessed the passbook, earned and received all dividends and interest, and was the only one to report capital gains and losses from the account on her federal, state, and city income tax returns. She funded the account with sums from previously held investment accounts, some of which she had held individually, some of which she had held jointly with either Daughter or Son. Neither Daughter nor Son was aware of the previous joint accounts. In the mid-1990s, Libros instructed MSDW to restrict access to the account to her, alone. MSDW placed an operational memo on the account, based on the instructions provided by Libros, that, in the event that MSDW received conflicting instructions from any of the joint tenants, they were to freeze the account until Libros clarified the instructions.</p>

In 1997, DL <em>&amp; </em>F obtained a civil judgment against Daughter for $300,000. Whether as partial restitution, an attempt to ameliorate Daughter’s punishment, or for some other reason unknown to this Court, Libros gave DL &amp; F a check for $60,000.00 drawn on the MSDW account. Now aware of the joint account and in an attempt to satisfy the judgment, DL &amp; F filed a Praecipe for a Writ of Execution on the Active Assets account. Libros countered with a Petition to Intervene, Stay and Set Aside the Writ of Execution. Following a hearing, the trial court granted the Petition of Libros, and stayed and set aside DL &amp; F’s Praecipe for the Writ. The trial court concluded that, pursuant to the Multiple-Party Accounts Act (MPAA), 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 6301-6306, the joint account belonged entirely to Libros because she was the sole contributor. The trial court also determined that, even if the MPAA did not apply, pursuant to common law principles, the evidence established that Libros retained full dominion over the funds in the account and that Libros did not intend to give Daughter a present interest in it.</p>

However, that utility is lost if, during the lifetime of the joint depositors, the funds on deposit can be reached by a judgment creditor of either party. If the creator of the joint account, whose intent is usually testamentary in nature, could be impoverished by the acts of the joint tenant over which the <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>creator has no control, such as attempts of the other joint tenant or her creditors to reach the funds, there is great risk to the creator of the joint account. It may be these evils that Section 6303(a), 20 Pa.C.S. § 6303(a), was intended to limit, lending stability and security to the creation of joint bank accounts.</p>

Rather, he [or she] usually intends no present change of beneficial ownership.” Official Comment to 20 Pa.C.S. § 6303. Section 6303(a) is fundamental to the resolution of the issue at hand and states, in pertinent part, that “[a] joint account belongs, during the lifetime of all parties, to the parties in proportion to the net contributions by each to the sum on deposit, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.” 20 Pa.C.S. § 6303(a). This Section clearly sets forth the ownership rights to the assets of the joint account during the lifetime of the parties, and the General Assembly did not intend to allow a holder of an interest in a joint account to defeat the ownership rights of other joint owners with a unilateral act. Absent an <em>inter vivos </em>gift by Libros, Daughter had no ownership interest at the time that DL &amp; F sought to satisfy its judgment; at most she had a mere expectation of a right of survivorship.</p>

Furthermore, accounts with right of survivorship provisions are often set up to allow caretakers to assist senior citizens with the management of their finances. Their well-planned financial protection can best be honored by adhering to the statutory presumption created by Section 6303. Like other testamentary devices, creation of a joint account, without more, accomplishes no present transfer of title to property. If, as in this case, one person deposits all sums in the joint account, this arrangement contemplates transfer of title to those funds to the other person or persons named on the account upon the death of the depositor. Moreover, the creator of a joint account, like the maker of a will and unlike the giver of a gift, may change his or her mind prior to death. These considerations suggest that joint accounts share more in the character of testamentary devices <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>than they do in the character of present transfers of property, or gifts.</p>

Concerning the brokerage account, I do not believe that it is necessary to characterize it as akin to a “share account” to fall within the statutory definition, particularly since the latter is generally employed to denote a specific arrangement in the context of a credit union or savings and loan association. <em>See, e.g., Credit Union Nat’l Ass’n., Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys., </em><a href="/f-supp/700/1152-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="700 F.

Rather, for the same reason that share accounts are included in the definition, namely, because of their similarity to bank accounts, I would treat the account at issue as sufficiently analogous to a bank account. Here, the record indicates that the Active Assets Account provided by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter included characteristics generally associated with traditional bank accounts, for example, check writing privileges, loan privileges, a VISA debit card, a personal identification number for VISA card and ATM cash withdrawals, preprinted deposit slips, direct deposit of social security or payroll, and the placement of cash into a money trust, government trust, tax-free money market trust account or, significantly, an FDIC insured account. In addition, the account assets could include, <em>inter alia, </em>cash, certificates of deposit, money market funds, municipal bonds, stocks, government securities, mutual funds, and annuities.</p>
    <p id="b934-4" data-blocks='[["BL_934.5",934,[274,1257,1157,1006]]]'>Similarly, I do not believe that it is necessary to view the phrase “financial institution” as impliedly ambiguous, inasmuch as the definition in Section 6301 specifically states that it is “without limitation.” Moreover, consistent with the definition in Section 6301, the testimony at the hearing from a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter vice president indicated, <em>inter alia, </em>that the company provides a wide range of financial services and is subject to federal regulation. It is also noteworthy that the definition of financial institution varies within the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code. <em>Compare </em>20 Pa. C.S. § 6301 <em>with </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 6401 (defining financial institution as “[a]ny regulated financial institution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor or an affiliate of the financial institution”). Given the General Assembly’s express and substantial limitation upon the scope of the definition of a financial institution in Section 6401, it is at least arguable that the more open-ended definition contained in the Multiple-Party Accounts Act was intended to sweep more broadly.</p>

For example, the historical division between commercial banking institutions and firms engaged in securities investments reflected in the Glass-Steagall Act, <em>see </em>Act of Jun. 16, 1933, ch. 89, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%20188" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="48 Stat. 188">48 Stat. 188</a>, was partially abrogated with the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act, <em>see </em>Pub.L.

Indeed, even prior to repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, the drafters of the 1989 amendments to the Uniform Probate Code (from which the Multiple-Party Accounts Act is derived), acknowledged that, while the function of assets in a bank account is distinct from those in a security account:</p>

Banks are offering certificates of deposit of large value under the same account forms that were devised for low-value convenience accounts. Meanwhile, brokerage houses with their so-called cash management accounts and mutual funds with their money market accounts have rendered securities subject to small recurrent transactions. In the latest developments, even the line between real estate and bank accounts is becoming indistinct, as the “home equity line of credit” creates a check-writing conduit to real estate values.</blockquote>
