The Commonwealth Court affirmed the trial court and held that absentee ballots delivered by third persons were valid under these circumstances. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Section 3146.6(a)’s “in person” delivery requirement is mandatory, and that absentee ballots delivered in violation of the provision are invalid, notwithstanding the Board’s erroneous instructions to the contrary.

On October 10, 2003, with an eye to the upcoming November 4, 2003 election, the Republican Committee submitted a letter to the Board objecting to this practice and requesting that it strictly construe the “in person” delivery requirement set forth in Section 3146.6(a). In response, on October 22, 2003, the acting Chairman of the Board of Elections, the Honorable James McGregor of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, directed the Elections Division to refuse absentee ballots delivered by third parties. This policy was strictly enforced between October 22, 2003, and October 27, 2003.</p>

The reliance upon <em>Union Electric </em>to support some general theory of detrimental reliance is misplaced. As discussed <em>supra, Union Electric </em>involved a party who filed a late appeal in reliance upon a tax board’s improper extension of the statutory appeal deadline. The trial court quashed the appeal as untimely and the Commonwealth Court affirmed. This Court reversed and held that an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>(literally, “now for then”) was appropriate because there was a breakdown in the court’s operations through a default of its officers. We noted in <em>Union Electric </em>that “[ajllowing an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>is a recognized exception to the general rule prohibiting the extension of an appeal deadline.” <em>Id. </em>at 584. <em>Union Electric, </em>thus, is a case involving a jurisprudential doctrine governing judicial filing deadlines.</p>

The Board of Elections’ failure to follow clear substantive provisions of the Election Code does not constitute a breakdown in the court’s operations which a court has the power to remedy. Moreover, the position taken by the Board was one which was more likely to invite, rather than remedy, fraud. In addition, that position went to substantive matters—how to cast a reliable vote—and not to a mere procedural matter, such as a filing deadline. Finally, if we were to approve the Board’s contra-statutory actions here upon such “equitable” grounds, it would generate a far greater inequity: the uneven treatment of absentee votes throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

No similar argument has been forwarded here.
