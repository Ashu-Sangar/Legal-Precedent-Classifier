According to Appellants, this plain language mandates that, once the Commission allocates costs, the party or parties found responsible must bear and pay them, unless relieved of such obligation in the course of an appropriate appeal from the PUC’s order. Appellants argue that it would render the statutory scheme nugatory if parties deemed responsible by the Commission might nevertheless seek enforcement of private cost-allocation agreements in separate civil proceedings, efforts which Appellants denote as improper collateral attacks on the Commission’s decision making. In this regard, Appellants draw support from this Court’s characterization of the Commission’s cost-allocation decision making authority as exclusive, <em>see, e.g., City of Philadelphia II, </em>504 Pa. at 323, 473 A.2d at 1002-03; Mr. Justice Hutchinson’s concurring opinion in <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>

Rather, Conrail contends that the Legislature’s guiding focus was to enable the Commission to assign costs responsibility in the first instance, so as to ensure timely and effective completion of work in an arena in which public safety concerns are paramount. Indeed, Conrail notes that appellate courts have specifically found that Section 2704(a) and its predecessors permit enforcement of contractual rights in courts of law notwithstanding prior, discretionary cost allocations by the PUC.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In response to the City’s <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>contention that such decisions were overruled by <em>City of Philadelphia II </em>and <em>AT &amp; T, </em>Conrail explains that neither of these cases pertained to post-administrative-allocation enforcement of private contracts (rather, both focused on the precept that the PUC remains unfettered in its ability to make a discretionary allocation of costs absent voluntary payment of relocation costs pursuant to an agreement); nor did either reference the decisions that Appellants claim were overruled. With regard to Appellants’ contention concerning adoption of Justice Hutchinson’s <em>City of Philadelphia II </em>concurrence, Conrail observes that the <em>AT &amp; T </em>Court did so only to the extent that it was concerned with the case’s central focus, again, the contours of the PUC’s discretionary authority to allocate costs in the first instance. <em>See AT &amp; T, </em><a href="/pa/558/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="558 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="838614" data-case-paths="/pa/558/0290-01">558 Pa. at 304-05</a>, <a href="/a2d/737/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="737 A.2d 201" data-case-ids="11567829,838614" data-case-paths="/a2d/737/0201-01,/pa/558/0290-01">737 A.2d at 209</a>. Additionally, Conrail invokes this Court’s more general decisions taking note of the Legislature’s intention that the PUC should not become embroiled in contract enforcement matters that are more properly left to the civil courts, <em>see, e.g., Feingold v. Bell of Pa., </em><a href="/pa/477/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="477 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1738332" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0001-01">477 Pa. 1</a>, 9-11, <a href="/pa/477/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="477 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1738332" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0001-01">383 A.2d 791</a>, 795-96 (1978).</p>

Chiefly, Conrail observes that the Commission’s administrative expertise relates to public safety matters, not litigation of contract disputes; therefore, the agency’s equitable jurisdiction under Section 2704(a) to allocate costs should be deemed to extend only so far as necessary to accomplish this underlying, public purpose. Conrail contends that a civil action grounded on a pre-existing contract will have no impact on the Commission, its mission, or its cost allocation decisions; moreover, according to Conrail, failure to enforce contractual rights would result in untenable <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>uncertainties in commercial affairs. Indeed, Conrail observes that it would lack any incentive to permit the use of its property to carry other utilities’ facilities, particularly on an uncompensated basis, if it could not be reasonably assured that relocation costs would be borne by those other utilities. Thus, Conrail maintains, the PUC’s jurisdiction over cost allocations does not conflict with a trial court’s jurisdiction over a related contract matter, as each tribunal functions within its own independent legal sphere.</p>
    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[144,867,1157,1079]]]'>The Commission also filed a brief, as <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of Conrail’s position. Unlike Conrail, however, the Commission acknowledges that its jurisdictional mandate is an expansive one and includes the power to assess private contractual disputes regarding payment of costs of altering rail-highway crossings. The PUC contends only that such jurisdiction is not exclusive, and therefore, does not in and of itself foreclose the ability of parties to enforce an alternative allocation of costs among the parties pursuant to a private contract. In this regard, the Commission deems its cost-allocation function secondary to its primary mission of assuring public safety at rail-highway crossings. In fact, the Commission also takes the position that disputes as to the enforcement of contracts are best left to the civil courts, particularly where, as here, there is some uncertainty, or at least a dispute, concerning the validity, applicability, and/or enforceability of the contract in issue. The Commission suggests that its jurisdictional mandate represents a legislative application of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, pursuant to which deference is afforded to agency determinations in areas of their expertise.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

To the contrary, a central focus of each respective inquiry is the appropriate assignment of costs, here, for example, concerning relocation of the City water line at the Maclay Street crossing. Furthermore, this Court has endorsed the PUC’s position that it possesses jurisdiction to address contractual obligations within the context of a Section 2704(a) cost-allocation decision. <em>See AT &amp; T, </em><a href="/pa/558/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="558 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="838614" data-case-paths="/pa/558/0290-01">558 Pa. at </a>307 n. 11, <a href="/a2d/737/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="737 A.2d 201" data-case-ids="11567829,838614" data-case-paths="/a2d/737/0201-01,/pa/558/0290-01">737 A.2d at </a>210 n. 11.

First, this view is consonant with the terms of the relevant provisions of the Public Utility Code—while Section 2702(c) invests in the PUC “exclusive power” to direct, <em>inter alia, </em>the relocation of facilities at rail-highway crossings, <em>see </em>66 Pa.C.S. § 2702(c), Section 2704(a)’s cost-allocation proviso contains no such specification of jurisdictional exclusivity. We acknowledge that it would be possible to infer that exclusivity was intended from the Legislature’s directive that relocation costs are to be “borne and paid” as directed by the Commission. 66 Pa.C.S. § 2704(a). However, given the public-safety-orientation of the PUC’s role in rail-highway crossing matters, <em>see </em>66 Pa.C.S. § 2702(b), and practical realities concerning the character of and resources available in the administrative forum, as well as the scope and potential burden of contract interpretation and litigation,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> the <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>Commission’s interpretation permitting it latitude to abstain from finally determining the validity and legal effect of agreements, particularly where they are complex or uncertain, is not an unreasonable one.

The <em>Feingold </em>line of decisions, cited by Conrail, is distinguishable in this regard, as they rely upon the absence of an express statutory grant of power to the Commission to implement sought-after remedial relief. <em>See, e.g., Feingold, </em><a href="/pa/477/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="477 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1738332" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0001-01">477 Pa. at 8</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="477 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1738332" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0001-01">383 A.2d at 794</a>. Here, the General Assembly has expressly delegated the function of cost allocation for relocation of facilities at rail-highway crossings (the primary remedy sought by Conrail) to the Commission, at least in the first instance.</p>

Again, although certainly passages from these decisions, particularly <em>City of Philadelphia II, </em>may suggest exclusivity in Commission decision making, Conrail is correct in its observation that the facts of neither case directly implicated the exclusivity aspect; rather, both cases concerned the breadth of the PUC’s own jurisdiction in the first instance. The same is true of <em>AT &amp; T's </em>endorsement of Justice Hutchinson's concurring opinion, which was expressly limited to the commentary concerning <em>City of Philadelphia II's </em>actual holding, <em>see AT &amp; T, </em><a href="/pa/558/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="558 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="838614" data-case-paths="/pa/558/0290-01">558 Pa. at 305</a>, <a href="/a2d/737/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="737 A.2d 201" data-case-ids="11567829,838614" data-case-paths="/a2d/737/0201-01,/pa/558/0290-01">737 A.2d at 209</a>, and not Justice Hutchinson’s broader thoughts concerning the decision’s impact on exclusivity.</p>

We acknowledge Appellants' concern with statewide uniformity in cost allocation decision making but believe that such policy is offset by the desirability of reasonable certainty in contractual affairs, particularly since the Commission continues to signal its disinclination to resolve disputed matters of contract in its administrative assignments of costs.</p>
