The United Food and Commercial Workers of America, Local 23 organized and represented the full-time and part-time non-professional employees of St. Paul’s, including each of the twenty-one appellees herein. On behalf of those employees, the union negotiated with appellant and formally executed a CBA governing the terms of appellees’ employment. The CBA took effect in March of 1995 and was to expire in March of 1998. One month before expiration of the CBA, appellant and the union began negotiating the terms of a new work agreement. To provide for the interim <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>period between the expiration of the original CBA and the effectuation of a new agreement, the parties entered into an extension agreement whereby they agreed to operate under the terms and conditions of the original CBA until either party provided a ten-day notice of contract termination.</p>
    <p id="b345-4" data-blocks='[["BL_345.5",345,[138,603,1152,357]]]'>Several portions of the original CBA are at issue. First, the CBA provides that an employee who suffered a work-related injury is eligible for “light duty” work, with appellant retaining the sole discretion to assign light-duty-eligible employees to any “job classification.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In addition, the CBA gives appellant the right to make individual shift assignments and gives employees the right to select shifts in order of seniority.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

However, in April of 1998, during the extension period, appellant announced a new policy wherein light-duty employees were obliged to choose between one of only two work shifts—the 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. shift, or the 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. shift. Two light-duty employees were affected by the new policy, and appellant offered a shift preference to the senior of the two employees. The senior employee chose the day-time shift, forcing the other employee to have to resign her light-duty position because the later shift conflicted with her childcare arrangements.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Each appellee appealed, and their petitions were consolidated for hearing before a referee. On September 4, 1998, the referee issued a decision concluding that the work stoppage was a “strike” rather than a “lock-out” and, thus, affirmed the denial of benefits. The referee reasoned that a work stoppage would constitute a lock-out, and thereby qualify the employees for unemployment compensation benefits, only if “the employees offered to continue working for a reasonable time under the pre-existing terms and conditions of employment so as to avert a work stoppage [and] ... the Employer refused to ... extend the expiring contract and maintain the status quo____” Referee’s Decision at 4 (citing <em>Erie Forge and Steel Corp. v.

Finding that appellant had not refused to extend the expiring contract in order to maintain the status quo, the referee determined that the work stoppage was a strike rather than a lock-out. The referee concluded that Section 402(d) of the UCL, which makes an employee ineligible for unemployment compensation where unemployment is due to a work stoppage resulting from a “labor dispute (other than a lock-out),” barred appellees <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>from receiving benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellees appealed, and the Board affirmed without an opinion.</p>

Approximately one month before expiration of the CBAs, the employer and the union began negotiations for a new work agreement.

During the course of the parties’ negotiations toward a new agreement, the employer expressed concern over what it considered a work slowdown by the employees’ refusal to accept overtime work and over allegations of equipment and plant sabotage by the employees. Thereafter, the employer gave written notice to the union that all union employees would be locked out on April 28 and subsequently rejected the union’s offer to continue working under the extension.</p>

The employer appealed and a referee affirmed. Upon further appeal, the Board affirmed. The employer then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which reversed and remanded to the referee for findings of fact. Following the remand, the Board vacated its previous order and held that the claimants had first altered the status quo by <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>refusing to perform overtime work and by causing instances of sabotage to the employer’s equipment.

    <p id="b350-4" data-blocks='[["BL_350.5",350,[279,577,1154,900]]]'>On further appeal to the Supreme Court, this Court found that, because the work stoppage took the form of a lockout, the burden to demonstrate a disruption of the status quo rested with the employer. In considering whether the employer had met its burden, the Court examined the claimants’ conduct asserted by employer to have constituted a strike: the “slowdown,” the alleged sabotage, and the refusal to work overtime. Noting that the record was devoid of any evidence of specific acts of sabotage and that the Board had never made a finding of a concerted “slowdown,” the Court rejected the employer’s claim that the alleged conduct caused a disruption of the status quo, effectively constituting a strike. In addition, the Court rejected the employer’s claim that the claimants’ refusal to accept overtime work from the employer constituted a disruption of the status quo, explaining that the terms of the CBAs governed what factual situation might be deemed the status quo:</p>

In other words, it must be shown that required overtime work was part of the pre-existing terms and conditions of employment under the expired bargaining agreements. Clearly, this is not the case. The expired agreements provide for voluntary overtime work which the individual employees were free to accept or decline. The fact that during the month of April, 1979, more of the employees than usual exercised their right to refuse overtime work does not establish an alteration of the status quo on the part of the claimants.... The Commonwealth Court, in affirming the Board’s finding that the claimants altered the status quo by refusing overtime work, concluded that the status quo consisted not only of the terms and conditions of employment under the expired agreements, but also of the previous conduct of the parties. Our opinions in <em>Vrotney </em>and <em>Philco </em>limited the status quo to <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>the pre-existing terms and conditions of employment which, as here, are embodied in the expired agreement.

The Commonwealth Court, however, looked beyond the CBA and expressly considered the past conduct and/or practices of the parties in determining the status quo at the time of the work stoppage. The panel concluded that: “Employer arbitrarily altered the work schedules of these employees, thereby disregarding its past practice. We conclude that this was a change to the status quo.” Op. at 118-19, <a href="/pa/519/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="519 Pa. 515" data-case-ids="1813589" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0515-01">549 A.2d at 526-27</a>. As support for its focus on “past practices,” the panel looked not to the clear holding of <em>Miceli, </em>but to the language in footnote three in that case, where this Court stated that: “[t]he status quo consists of the previous terms and conditions of employment, nothing more, nothing less.” <a href="/pa/519/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="519 Pa. 515" data-case-ids="1813589" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0515-01">549 A.2d at </a>118 n. 3. While the footnote, if read in isolation, may fail to specify exactly what can be considered in defining the “previous terms and conditions of employment,” a reading of the entire majority opinion in <em>Miceli </em>leaves no doubt as to the holding of that case: the status quo consists of the previous terms and conditions of employment, as embodied in the original collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in footnote three of <em>Miceli </em>expressly or impliedly suggests that it was intended to limit the rule articulated at some length in text. The Commonwealth Court erred in interpreting <em>Miceli </em>to permit the consideration of <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>“past practices” beyond the express terms of the parties’ CBA in determining what constitutes the status quo. Indeed, to consider “past practices” not memorialized in the parties’ written agreement would eviscerate the clear and simple rule articulated in <em>Miceli. </em>We caution the courts below that their task is to effectuate the decisional law of this Court, not to restrict it through curtailed readings of controlling authority.</p>

Despite appellant’s past practice of allowing light-duty employees to choose to retain their regular shift hours, the parties’ agreement made clear that it was appellant, and not appellees, who reserved the authority to make individual shift assignments and to alter employee scheduling. When appellant exercised that right in April, 1998, it did not disrupt the status quo as defined by the bargaining agreement. Accordingly, when appellees participated in the subsequent work stoppage and set up picket lines, it was they, and not appellant, who disrupted the status quo. Thus, appellees, who initiated the work stoppage, failed to carry their burden, and the Board properly determined that appellees are correspondingly ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits under Section 402(d) of the UCL.</p>
