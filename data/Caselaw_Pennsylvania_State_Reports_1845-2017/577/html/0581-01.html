Kleinfelter sentenced appellant to six to twelve months for insurance fraud, one to two years for leaving the scene of an accident, and six to twelve months for tampering with evidence, each to run consecutively for an aggregate term of two to four years incarceration, plus $4,500 in fines. Appellant seeks a new sentencing hearing, before a new judge, arguing Judge Kleinfelter should have recused himself from the case.</p>

Cains died from the resulting injuries. Appellant did not stop or attempt to render assistance to Cains, but instead continued driving; he eventually stopped at a convenience store, bought duct tape, and made some repairs to his vehicle.</p>

A few days later, he took the vehicle to a body shop and had it repaired. Soon thereafter, appellant traded in the Jeep, which was resold to an out-of-state resident.</p>

Five months later, the Dauphin County Crime Stoppers Program received an anonymous tip implicating appellant. When questioned by police, appellant admitted he was the driver that killed Kenneth Cains, but insisted he had been distracted by files falling to the floorboard and did not see what he had struck. Appellant claimed he thought he hit a stop sign; he denied any knowledge of hitting Cains. Appellant was charged with homicide by vehicle, insurance fraud, leaving the scene of an accident involving death or personal injury, tampering with evidence, and four Vehicle Code offenses.</p>

    <blockquote id="b870-4" data-blocks='[["BL_870.5",870,[320,467,1114,480]]]'>Kleinfelter called that claim strange. He said most defendants with that view would plead not guilty and stand trial. The judge also said Marsico appeared to get the better end of the plea agreement because “he didn’t really give up anything” except a more tenuous vehicular homicide charge. “The whole idea of a hit-and-run charge is it involves personal injury to a person,” Kleinfelter said. “When Druce pleaded guilty to that charge, he admitted that he knew he hit somebody.”</blockquote>

So, if I am perplexed over the inconsistency of your claims, Mr. Druce, as against the facts, it’s not because I feel any impartiality (sic) towards you, it is because in my mind, which may lack the great sophistication of other legal minds, it doesn’t make sense.</blockquote>

Brief of Appellant, at 27. This assertion is clearly refuted by the distinction Judge Kleinfelter made in the very article complained of, and by the record. Appellant received a sentence of two to four years in prison, when he faced as much as 16 years. Particularly, appellant received the mandatory minimum for his only felony conviction, leaving the scene of the accident which caused Cains’ death, and merely six months for each attempt at covering up his guilt. Appellant, a public figure in a city where this crime was notorious, did not report his involvement, lied about it, and tried to cover it up. Judge Kleinfelter, on appellant’s tampering with evidence and insurance <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>charges, gave him a sentence equal to each month appellant hid his guilt and obstructed justice.

Indeed, the order denying review was careful in noting that it was “without prejudice.” By the same token, however, the matter is now before the Court in a significantly different posture than before. When appellant requested extraordinary review, this Court had no explanation from President Judge Kleinfelter as to why he had denied recusal; he had simply denied the motion without explanation. Now, however, we are presented with a record in which President Judge Kleinfelter has explored and expressed at some length the reasons why he was satisfied that he had not prejudged the matter and could remain fair and impartial at sentencing. Moreover, appellant is now in sentenced status and his judgment of sentence has been reviewed and affirmed on direct appeal by the Superior Court, the court with primary direct review responsibility.

Indeed, the salutary purpose which would have been served by ordering recusal at the presentencing <em>stage—i.e., </em>preventing the recusal issue from becoming an issue on appeal—cannot now be achieved. Instead, the question now before the Court is a question of law concerning whether President Judge Kleinfelter was required <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>to recuse, such that his failure to do so obliges us to vacate and remand for resentencing before another jurist.

I agree that a violation of Canon 3A(6) of the Code of Judicial Conduct does not automatically require recusal of the jurist. As I have previously articulated, though, in the present circumstance, I believe that the actions of President Judge Kleinfelter raised at least an appearance of impropriety and bias and, therefore, his refusal to recuse himself was error.</p>
    <p id="b880-9" data-blocks='[["BL_880.10",880,[285,2173,1151,204]],["BL_881.1",881,[123,331,1151,155]]]'>In October of 2000, right before sentencing, Thomas Druce, III (Druce) filed an Emergency Application to this Court requesting that we exercise our King’s Bench powers to force President Judge Kleinfelter’s removal from the sentencing <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>proceedings. The Court denied the request, but Mr. Justice Castille filed a Dissenting Statement, which I joined. The Dissenting Statement declared in its entirety as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b881-4" data-blocks='[["BL_881.5",881,[165,521,1112,768]]]'>I dissent. The published remarks attributed to President Judge Kleinfelter concerning this matter were not mere public statements made during the course of his official duties or attempts to explain the procedures of the court. Rather, they were comments concerning substantive matters in the case pending before him. <em>See </em>Pennsylvania Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3A(6) (judge should abstain from public comment about a pending proceeding). Accordingly, I would grant the Emergency Application for Recusal and/or Disqualification and remove President Judge Kleinfelter from this case. However, I would deny the motion for assignment of an out-of-county judge and allow the matter to be reassigned to another judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County.</blockquote>
    <p id="b881-5" data-blocks='[["BL_881.6",881,[126,1330,516,41]]]'>Reproduced Record at 216a.</p>
    <p id="b881-6" data-blocks='[["BL_881.7",881,[124,1410,1155,431]]]'>The decision whether or not to grant King’s Bench review is not a decision on the merits and, accordingly, principles of <em>stare decisis </em>do not apply. Thus, I standby my earlier-expressed sentiments, ably articulated by Mr. Justice Castille in his Dissenting Statement. I would reverse the Order of the Superior Court and remand the matter to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County for a new sentencing hearing, to be conducted by a different judge.</p>
