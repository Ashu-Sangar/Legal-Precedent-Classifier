Ms. Konow claimed that she was traumatized by the assault on Mr. Goodman, had fear of her client, and was unable to be a zealous advocate for El Shabazz. Although she had participated in the guilt phase of the case, Ms. Konow also said that she was primarily to try the penalty phase of the case if necessary. The experienced trial judge directed Ms. Konow to continue with the case. When she refused, the trial judge held her in civil contempt and directed that Ms. Konow be taken into <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>custody until she purged the contempt by continuing with the case.

    <p id="b941-12" data-blocks='[["BL_941.13",941,[120,1957,1153,248]]]'>Thus, Judge Klein adopted an approach which correctly left options open to the trial judge to resolve this matter in a fashion which would ensure the defendant the type of representation he deserved and vindicate the lawful authority of the court.</p>
    <p id="b941-13" data-blocks='[["BL_941.14",941,[120,2236,1152,149]],["BL_942.1",942,[272,338,1156,349]]]'>Judging from petitioner’s pleadings, it appears that she ignored Judge Klein’s directive to seek a stay from Judge Greenspan, which not only is reason enough to deny the <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>instant request, but which also forestalled the possibility of the flexible resolution envisioned by Judge Klein. Instead, petitioner demanded a further stay from this Court. That stay was granted by single-justice order on March 24, 2004, pending further order of the Court, and the Commonwealth now having been given an opportunity to respond, the Petition is before the entire Court.</p>
    <p id="b942-4" data-blocks='[["BL_942.5",942,[271,719,1158,569]]]'>Petitioner’s application fails for numerous reasons, among which are the following. First, the practical effect of granting a stay in this matter, rather than permitting the contempt appeal to proceed in its normal course, will be to continue to tie the hands of the trial judge and inevitably will lead to the declaration of a mistrial, since the jury has been sequestered and unnecessarily inconvenienced already. By tying the judge’s hands, the Court would prevent any prospect of a rational solution. There were other measures the trial court might take, as recognized by Judge Klein, which would be foreclosed by granting a stay.</p>
    <p id="b942-5" data-blocks='[["BL_942.6",942,[272,1311,1159,519]]]'>Second, issuing a stay in this case would reward the capital defendant for his misconduct by providing him with an unwarranted new trial—which may very well be the reason he punched one of his lawyers in the face in the first place. Rewarding the defendant for this behavior would fly in the face of this Court’s controlling authority in <em>Commonwealth v. Lester, </em><a href="/pa/554/0644-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="554 Pa. 644" data-case-ids="765957,765992" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0644-01,/pa/554/0644-02">554 Pa. 644</a>, <a href="/a2d/722/0997-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="722 A.2d 997" data-case-ids="11781367,765992" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0997-01,/pa/554/0644-02">722 A.2d 997</a>, 1004 (1998) (no abuse of discretion to deny counsel’s petition to withdraw after capital defendant punched him; court noted fear that scenario could occur with the defendant <em>ad infinitum).</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b942-6" data-blocks='[["BL_942.7",942,[273,1855,1156,413]],["BL_943.1",943,[117,334,1157,583]]]'>Third, issuing a stay would reward a recalcitrant attorney for flouting her ethical obligation to the court. Rule 1.16(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides that, “when ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.” If petitioner truly felt a new and sudden fear of her client charged with the rape and capital murder of a child,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> and/or felt that she was unprepared to continue in the case, <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>she could have raised a claim that the court abused its discretion in the regular course—like Lester’s lawyer did. Lawyers, who are officers of the court, should not be encouraged to act petulantly or defiantly when confronted with orders with which they disagree. In the rare case where the lawyer feels the matter is one of “principle” sufficient to warrant defiance, she should be prepared to pay the inevitable price of such contempt. To grant a stay would absolve petitioner of the choice at all, and would remove whatever prospect there was of the trial court’s order achieving its objective of “coercing” this lawyer to do her job.</p>
    <p id="b943-4" data-blocks='[["BL_943.5",943,[116,958,1159,465]]]'>Fourth, issuing a stay would also reward petitioner and the Defender Association for employing a litigation <em>strategy—i.e., </em>failing to seek a stay from the trial judge, so that she could explain her order—which has succeeded in preventing this Court from hearing the trial judge’s view of the matter, including what might well be crucial and controlling factual findings. We are asked to rule upon this matter without a record and without any statement of view from the trial judge, which alone is antithetical to a reasoned decision.</p>
    <p id="b943-5" data-blocks='[["BL_943.6",943,[116,1473,1157,905]],["BL_944.1",944,[288,338,1149,88]]]'>Finally, issuing a stay here would turn stand our review standard on its head. The order below is presumptively valid. Review of the contempt order would be for an abuse of discretion. Review in a stay posture, however, requires an extraordinarily high showing: the stay applicant must make a strong showing that: (1) she is likely to prevail on the merits; (2) she will suffer irreparable injury without a stay; (3) the stay will not substantially harm other interested parties; and (4) the stay will not adversely affect the public interest. <em>See Pennsylvania P.U.C. v. Process Gas Consumers Group, </em><a href="/pa/502/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="502 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1784533" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0545-01">502 Pa. 545</a>, <a href="/pa/502/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="502 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1784533" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0545-01">467 A.2d 805</a> (1983). Given that petitioner has not provided this Court with a transcript of the proceeding, or the trial court’s view on the matter, she cannot meet this heightened standard—particularly where a discretionary decision is at issue. I do not deny that it is a sad prospect to consider any member of the bar spending time incarcerated for contempt. But, petitioner has always held the key to her release. <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>The “injury” may easily be “repaired” by attending to her duties as an officer of the Court.</p>

She claims that she cannot provide competent representation consistent with Rule 1.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which provides, “A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation necessary for the representation.” In support of her position, she cites a case from Ohio, <em>State v.

Attorney Cocoves indicated that he was afraid of Williams and that his fear would be communicated to the jury. The trial court denied counsel’s motions to withdraw. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio determined that the trial court abused its discretion.

In <em>Lester, </em>the trial of a capital defendant was originally scheduled to begin on July 29, 1991. Lester requested the appointment of new counsel because he had filed a civil suit against his court appointed lawyer. When the court indicated that the trial would proceed, the defendant became disruptive. The court continued the case for two days to allow the defendant and counsel additional time to confer. On July 31, 1991, the court agreed to the appointment of new counsel because it was clear that the defendant intended to disrupt the trial and the court feared that Lester would harm his counsel. When trial began in November 1999, Lester stood up and informed the jury that he had filed a civil suit against his new lawyer. After the jury panel was removed from the courtroom, Lester punched his counsel. The following day, counsel sought permission to withdraw, which the trial court denied. The trial court based its decision, in part, on the fact that it had previously postponed Lester’s trial because it feared that Lester would physically harm his original counsel. In light of the recurrent nature of the defendant’s disruptive behavior, this Court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request of counsel to withdraw from representation. However, <em>Lester </em>is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter because (1) there is no indication in <em>Lester </em>that counsel felt that his personal safety was in jeopardy; (2) the assault occurred outside the presence of the jury; and (3) the <a id="p663" href="#p663" data-label="663" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*663</a>defendant in <em>Lester </em>had repeatedly engaged in obstreperous behavior, supporting the trial judge’s view that such behavior would likely recur.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a>

I fear that at some point in the future, long and unnecessary delay will occur, if the PCRA court, this Court, or a reviewing federal court deems a new trial appropriate based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel by Petitioner.</p>

Any harm to the Commonwealth would be minimal as it has made no averments that any evidence or testimony will be lost if trial does not immediately continue. The public interest will be better served by ensuring that the defendant receives adequate representation than by requiring the case to go forward under these circumstances. Accordingly, I would have allowed the stay to remain in place.</p>
    <p id="b948-4" data-blocks='[["BL_948.5",948,[280,718,1152,611]]]'>By allowing Attorney Goodman to withdraw from the case, the trial court recognized that when an attorney who has been assaulted by a client believes that he cannot continue to represent that client effectively, terminating such representation is appropriate. Considering that Petitioner saw the attack on co-counsel and expressed that she was traumatized by the incident, the decision of the trial court to excuse one member of the defense team but not the other is potentially inconsistent. This matter should be subject to thorough review by the Superior Court, and pending such review, Petitioner should not be compelled to return to trial or face incarceration.</p>

As an initial matter, I do not believe that under these circumstances, Petitioner’s failure to seek a stay in the trial court prevented meaningful review. In light of time restraints and her incarceration, she took the steps most effectively designed to achieve her release. Her attempt to seek relief from the Superior Court was eminently reasonable, and I refuse to assume that this was part of a strategy to euchre the judicial process. Moreover, I am disheartened by the general tenor of the Statement in Support of Denial, which unjustifiably accuses Petitioner and the Defender Association of using the unprovoked assault by El Shabazz as a litigation tactic.</p>

The Commonwealth also cites to Rule of Professional Conduct 1.16(c), which provides, "[w]hen ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.” However, a trial court’s discretion to require an attorney to continue representation of a client is not unfettered. As such, it behooved the trial court to consider Rule 1.1, as discussed above, as well as Rule 1.7(b) which provides that "[a] lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer’s own interests ...” (emphasis added).</p>
