As noted by Judge Smith in her concurrence/dissent in <em>Sherman, </em>the early cases simply assumed that the Commonwealth owned roadways which were designated as state highways, apparently because the parties failed to contest the question of Commonwealth ownership.

However, as the experience in the Commonwealth Court has shown, when an issue requires an analysis of the interplay between the statutes, it is unclear which governmental entity may be said to own a roadway located in a municipality that has been designated a state highway. There is no question that the portion of Chestnut Street where appellant fell was designated as part of the state highway system. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>But, there is force to appellant’s argument that the mere fact that Chestnut Street has been designated a state highway, which vests responsibility in the Commonwealth for its maintenance and repair, <em>etc., </em>does not mean that Chestnut Street and its accompanying sidewalks <em>(i.e., </em>the cartway and the sidewalks) must be deemed “owned” by the Commonwealth for purposes of Tort Claims Act immunity.</p>

Indeed, as Judge Smith noted in her concurrence/dissent in <em>Sherman, </em>the State Highway Law suggests a contrary conclusion: that the Commonwealth assumes responsibility for maintenance and repair of the road only, while responsibility for regulation of traffic, parking and use of the streets as well as the obligation to repair and maintain curbing and footways, remove snow and keep streets clean, remains with the city in which the street is located. <em>See </em>36 P.S. §§ 670-541, 670-542. Further, it is notable that the State Highway Law provides a procedure whereby the Commonwealth may acquire an interest in land either through purchase or the right of eminent domain, <em>see </em>36 P.S. 670-413, but such procedure is not implicated by the mere designation of a city road as a state highway.

It is also significant that this traditional recognition of the role played by municipalities is corroborated by contemporary regulation. For example, it is undisputed that the City of Philadelphia regulates parking and the flow of traffic on Chestnut Street by installing and maintaining traffic control devices, and Philadelphia Police Officers cite drivers for traffic infractions along Chestnut Street notwithstanding its designation as a state highway. As for the sidewalks, the City regulates street vendors and outdoor café seating on Chestnut Street’s sidewalks, places and maintains <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>trash receptacles on the sidewalks, and Philadelphia Police patrol the sidewalks and enforce the law. If the Commonwealth actually “owned” Chestnut Street, one would expect that the authority to regulate conduct on the street and sidewalks would reside with the Commonwealth, not the City.

The Commonwealth Court’s initial decisions which assumed Commonwealth ownership were based largely upon concessions or stipulations by the parties; but, mere agreement of the parties cannot establish a legally binding ownership interest in the Commonwealth, nor can it strip a municipality of its ownership interest, where the legislation itself does not do so. The General Assembly has established that city roads are designated as state highways “for maintenance and improvement,” <em>see </em>36 P.S. 670-541, and has specifically exempted the Commonwealth from “any obligation to maintain the curbing or footways of any such street, or to remove snow or keep streets clean.” <em>See </em>36 P.S. § 670-542.

I agree with the Commonwealth Court that, consistent with its decisions in <em>Bruce v.

Because existing case law supports the proposition that state highways are state property, <em>Greene County, </em>a narrow reading of Section 8542(b)(7) leads to the conclusion that the City of Philadelphia does not own the portion of Chestnut Street at issue in this case. Therefore, the City cannot be held secondarily liable for the injuries that Appellant sustained when she fell on a cracked sidewalk adjacent to privately owned real estate.</p>

While Section 8542(b)(7) imposes secondary liability on a local agency “by reason of its power and authority to require installation and repair of sidewalks under the care, custody and control of other persons,” only primary liability is imposed upon the Commonwealth for a dangerous condition of its sidewalks. Section 8544(b) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b) provides in relevant part:</p>

I recognize the unfairness of the fact that if Appellant had fallen one block south of Chestnut Street on a sidewalk adjacent to a road owned by the City of Philadelphia, then imposition of secondary liability on the local agency would be permitted pursuant to the exception to governmental immunity set forth in Section 8542(b)(7). However, because we must read exceptions to immunity narrowly, <em>Mascaro, </em>Appellant may only seek damages from the property owners.</p>
