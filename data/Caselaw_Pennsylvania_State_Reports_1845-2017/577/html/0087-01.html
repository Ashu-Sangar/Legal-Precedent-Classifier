Further, it contends that the Commonwealth Court’s construction reduces efficiency and predictability in the claims resolution process, <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>unreasonably burdens the MCARE Fund with litigating the question of prejudice in all cases of tardy Section 605 requests, and potentially increases its costs by depriving it of the opportunity to timely evaluate claims, all of which ultimately inure to the detriment of health care providers in the form of increased surcharges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The MCARE Fund distinguishes <em>Brakeman </em>as pertaining to general common law principles of contract, which did not apply to the CAT Fund as an executive agency charged with the provision of the unique form of statutory excess coverage that was enumerated in HCMSA. Moreover, the MCARE Fund contends that the public policy underlying <em>Brakeman </em>(protecting insureds from a complete denial of coverage) did not pertain in the circumstances presented, since the relevant provisions of Section 605 merely allocated responsibilities between the CAT Fund and the primary insurer. The MCARE Fund also distinguishes the provision authorizing the rejection of claims under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act based on late notice, as the prejudice requirement attaching thereto derives from the express statutory requirement that non-compliance be forgiven on a showing of reasonable excuse. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5522; <em>Leedom, </em><a href="/a2d/699/0815-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="699 A.2d 815" data-case-ids="11911090" data-case-paths="/a2d/699/0815-01">699 A.2d at 817-18</a>. In this regard, the MCARE Fund emphasizes that Section 605 contains no analogous (or other) excuse provision. Additionally, the MCARE Fund emphasizes that Section 605’s 180-day requirement was added to the statute through 1996 amendments, which reflected an ongoing shifting of coverage obligations from the CAT Fund to primary carriers. <em>See, e.g., </em>40 P.S. § 1301.701(d)(1)—(3) (superseded). Thus, according to the MCARE Fund, the 180-day amendment to Section 605 also reflects the General Assembly’s intent to restrict, define, and diminish the Fund’s obligations. Finally, the MCARE Fund notes that insurance carriers were advised in 1997, via a policy statement, that compliance with the 180-day requirement was a condition precedent to conferral of Section 605 status. <em>See </em>31 Pa.Code §§ 247.1, 247.2.</p>

They note that Section 702(c) contains an express cross-reference to Section 605, which they contend would be rendered superfluous by the MCARE Fund’s interpretation.

For example, on questioning at oral argument, the MCARE Fund indicated that, under its interpretation, it would be required to accept the first-dollar-indemnity-and-costs-of-defense obligation in a case in which a Section 605 request was submitted on the 179th day, even if discovery deadlines had passed in an underlying medical malpractice action, or after disposition of the case via summary or default judgment, due to unreasonable failures on the part of the primary carrier. Yet, the MCARE Fund’s brief contains multiple assertions that are inconsistent with this position. For example, the MCARE Fund acknowledges that, prior to the 1996 amendments adding the 180-day-request requirement to Section 605, Section 702(c) functioned as a limitation on the CAT Fund’s obligations under Section 605. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellant at 21 (“Because there was no bright line cut-off within which a primary carrier had to request section 605 status from the Fund, the Fund had to accept all such claims, <em>unless it could show that it was prejudiced as set forth in the language of section 702(c)” </em>(emphasis added)), 26 (same). The MCARE Fund points to nothing on the face of the 180-day amendatory language that suggests that it was intended to obliterate this basic interrelationship. Additionally, the MCARE Fund fails meaningfully to reconcile Section 702(c)’s explicit cross-reference to Section 605 within its interpretation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Given the circumstances at issue and the focus of the Commonwealth Court’s holding, we need not specifically confront these incongruities in the present case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> but will reserve such question to <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>a case in which a challenge is presented to the Fund’s use of health care providers’ contributions to supplant the obligations of a primary insurance carrier whose conduct has so prejudiced the Fund.

Parenthetically, however, the MCARE Fund may wish to consider at least prospective application of an interpretation that does not wholly conflate Section 605's request requirement with Section 702(c)'s re<a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>quirement of prompt notice in Section 605 cases. While it is true that a Section 605 request should generally serve as an effective notice for purposes of Section 702(c), not all Section 702(c) notices will constitute Section 605 requests, even in circumstances in which first-dollar-indemnity-and-costs-of-defense treatment may be available. For example, a carrier may in some circumstances wish to maintain the defense of an underlying claim, although it learned of the claim more than four years after the events giving rise to the potential liability of the health care provider. This might occur, for example, where factual or legal issues are in question which may be relevant to other cases in which the carrier has a substantial interest and, accordingly, it seeks to maintain closer control of the defense. In such a circumstance, the carrier would have been required to notify the CAT Fund pursuant to Section 702(c) in order to preserve the Fund's obligation in the nature of excess coverage, but would not have submitted a Section 605 request. Thus, under the plain terms of the statute, prompt notice can function independently of a Section 605 request in circumstances implicating Section 605. At least on the face of the statutory scheme, then, there is no reason why the obligation of prompt notice could not accrue prior to the passage of 180 days in a Section 605 case, for example, where dilatory conduct on the part of a primary carrier causes the Fund substantial prejudice.</p>

The remaining ambiguity, arising out of the fact that the CAT Fund’s obligation to defend was not explicitly conditioned on the receipt of prompt notice, <em>see generally </em>40 P.S. §§ 605, 702(d), could be resolved by merely recognizing, as the Commonwealth Court has previously in the Section 605 context, that the obligation to defend is integrally related to exposure to potential indemnification. <em>See, e.g., Connolly v.

We express no opinion concerning other issues that may be relevant to the ultimate outcome of these proceedings.

In my opinion, the CAT Fund’s provision of coverage has thus provided a welcome modicum of stability in the sometimes unhinged arena of medical malpractice litigation. The CAT Fund in these matters, on the other hand, seems to believe that the primary goal of the Fund is not to ensure the <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>provision of medical liability coverage in this commonwealth, but rather is merely to perpetuate its own existence, divorced from its purpose of ensuring the provision of medical liability coverage in this commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.5",387,[141,596,1157,651]]]'>Furthermore, the CAT Fund’s interpretation also strikes me as unreasonable. Health care providers are compelled by statute to pay a surcharge to the CAT Fund. Yet, the CAT Fund contends that it should be allowed to avoid providing statutorily-mandated coverage on the basis that notice of a claim went beyond a 180 day period, even when the CAT Fund concedes that it was not prejudiced by receiving notice beyond this 180 day window. Thus, per the CAT Fund’s interpretation, the health care provider pays for coverage it will not receive, and then potentially pays again if the claim against it (which the CAT Fund ought to cover) is found to be meritorious.</p>
    <p id="b387-5" data-blocks='[["BL_387.6",387,[141,1298,1157,376]]]'>Thus, in these matters <em>sub judice, </em>I would find that the requests for § 605 status were not prompt for purposes of § 702 as they were made beyond the 180 day window established in § 605. Yet, per § 702, I would find that the CAT Fund may not deny Appellees § 605 status as the CAT Fund has conceded that Appellees’ failure to provide prompt notice did not prejudice the CAT Fund. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>

Co., </em><a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">472 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">371 A.2d 193</a> (1977). In that matter, we reasoned that an insurer may not deny a claim simply because it did not receive prompt notice of a claim. Rather, the insurer must establish "not only that the notice provision was breached, but also that it suffered prejudice as a consequence.” <em><a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">at 196</a>.</p>
