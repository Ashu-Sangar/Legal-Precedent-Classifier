Appellant, MCI WorldCom, Inc. (“WorldCom”), presents issues regarding the propriety of the rates set by the PUC. Before we may reach those substantive issues, however, the threshold issue of whether federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over such disputes must be addressed.

Prior to the passage of the 1996 Act, the Communications Act of 1934 divided responsibility for regulating telecommunications into (1) federally-regulated long distance services and (2) state-regulated intrastate services. States generally granted incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC’s), such as Verizon, exclusive monopoly franchises to provide local services with an infrastructure that connects virtually every home and business in a local service area.</p>

In order to achieve market efficiency, Congress required that the network element price rates be “just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory” and “based on the cost ... of providing” the element or interconnection. <a href="/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20251" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="47 U.S.C. § 251">47 U.S.C. § 251</a>(c)(3); <a href="/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20252" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="47 U.S.C. § 252">47 U.S.C. § 252</a>.

Congress authorized state public utility commissions, such as the PUC, to adjudicate under federal law all disputed issues in a process termed “arbitration,” the result of which is an “interconnection agreement” incorporating the final terms of the relationship between the subject ILEC and the new entrant. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20252" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="47 U.S.C. § 252">47 U.S.C. § 252</a>(b)(1).

The rates set in MFS III were to be incorporated into Verizon’s interconnection agreements ■with WorldCom and other new entrants into Pennsylvania’s local communications market. On April 10, 1997, the PUC issued an interim order indicating that it did not plan to base UNE rates strictly on cost, but instead intended to balance <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>the cost-based mandate of the 1996 Act with the PUC’s competing desire to ensure that Verizon earn profits in an amount sufficient to cover the expense of deploying new high frequency broadband technology across the Commonwealth. In order to achieve this goal, the PUC adopted Verizon’s cost model, which did not employ the TELRIC methodology but which allowed Verizon to attempt to recoup its substantial capital investment in the proposed broadband technology network. On August 7, 1997, the PUC issued its Final Opinion and Order in which it reaffirmed, with one exception not relevant here, the findings set forth in the MFS III Interim Order. Two commissioners dissented.</p>

On December 8, 1997, WorldCom filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, pursuant to Section 252 of the 1996 Act, for review of the parties’ interconnection agreement. Verizon, AT&amp;T and the PUC all participated as parties to the lawsuit. On September 16, 1999, the Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation in which he concluded that the UNE rates set in the MFS III proceeding, based as they were upon Verizon’s non-TELRIC cost model, were inconsistent with the FCC’s binding regulations and, therefore, were unlawful. In a memorandum opinion, the Honorable Sylvia H. Rambo of the Middle District adopted the Magistrate Judge’s report with respect to the issue of UNE rates and remanded the matter to the PUC to reconsider its UNE pricing decisions in light of the FCC’s binding pricing regulations. <em>See Bell Atl.-Pa., Inc. v.

In addition to the issue of UNE pricing, the PUC had before it several other unresolved issues concerning local telephone competition. The PUC attempted to resolve all of these matters through a global settlement conference. World-Com participated in settlement proceedings conducted by the <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>PUC along with Verizon. On March 18, 1999, two sets of parties, one group including Verizon and the other including WorldCom, submitted competing joint settlement petitions to the PUC proposing resolutions of the issues in the petitions and in the stayed PUC dockets. Those petitions were offered as non-negotiable settlement propositions, intended to either be accepted or rejected in their entirety by the PUC. World-Com proposed in part, as did Verizon, to establish a compromise, non-TELRIC-based statewide average UNE loop rate of $14.01. The TELRIC-based average loop rate was asserted to be $10.09. WorldCom alleges that it made clear to the PUC that the $14.01 rate was acceptable to them only if the PUC adopted their petition in full.</p>

After eight days of hearings, the PUC issued a 288-page Global Order, ruling on nearly all outstanding issues in the pending dockets. The PUC adopted the rates set forth in the parties’ settlement petitions: $14.01. Several parties, including WorldCom, AT&amp;T and Verizon, appealed the Global Order to the Commonwealth Court. Verizon simultaneously appealed the Global Order to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania essentially raising the same arguments asserted before the Commonwealth Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In Verizon’s federal action, WorldCom and AT&amp;T filed cross-claims also challenging the Global Order.

The issues raised before the Eastern District are virtually identical to the arguments made before this Court.

WorldCom argues that these sections when read together require that legal challenges to a state commission’s approval of terms for interconnection agreements are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.
