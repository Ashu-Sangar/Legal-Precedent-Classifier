According to Appellant, Candidate improperly stated in his nomination petition and affidavit that his residence was in Allentown when he actually resides in Haverford, Pennsylvania, Montgomery County, an address that is outside of the 15th Congressional District. Appellant acknowledged that Candidate is not required by the U.S. Constitution to live in the 15th Congressional District to run for the office of Representative in Congress for the 15th Congressional District,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> but neverthe<a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>less asserted that Candidate’s misrepresentation of his residency required that his nomination petition be set aside.

Candidate further requested that the court grant him twenty days to recirculate the amended petition to those voters who signed his original petition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> On March 1, 2004, the Commonwealth Court held a hearing on Appellant’s challenge and Candidate’s motion. During the hearing, Candidate’s counsel stipulated to the fact that Candidate’s legal residence according to the Election Code is in Haverford because that is where his spouse lives. <em>See </em>N.T., 3/1/2004, at 17-18, 29-30. Candidate also testified, however, that on January 28, 2004, he began renting a townhouse in Allentown, and on that same day, he registered to vote in Lehigh County using the Allentown residence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
      <em>See id. </em>at 15-17. Candidate’s Allentown address and new election district were then placed on Candidate’s nomination petition, which was circulated among electors in the 15th Congressional District for signatures. According to Candidate, however, while the nomination petition was circulating, he consistently conceded during public speeches that he was from Montgomery County and new to the 15th District. <em>See id. </em>at 21. Moreover, before Candidate’s petition was filed, on February <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>9, 2004, an article was published in The Morning Call, a newspaper based in Allentown, regarding an interview the author had with Candidate. The article focused on the fact that Candidate is from Haverford and not the 15th Congressional District. <em>See </em>Jeff Miller, <em>Driscoll: Issues count, not geography </em>* * <em>15th District candidate isn’t from the Valley, but the Main Line, The Morning Call, </em>Feb. 9, 2004, at A.l. However, the article also stated that Candidate recently rented a townhouse for himself in the 15th Congressional District and although his wife and children plan to remain in Haverford for the present time, the entire family intends to move into the District permanently if Candidate wins the election. <em>See id. </em>The article quoted Candidate as saying that he would be happy to speak to voters to prove that the campaign “is about issues and ideas and people, not geography.” <em>Id. </em>Approximately one week after this article was published, Candidate filed his nomination petition and affidavit stating that his residence was in Allentown and his election district was in Lehigh County.</p>
    <p id="b790-4" data-blocks='[["BL_790.5",790,[270,1368,1157,683]]]'>The day after the hearing, on March 2, 2004, the Commonwealth Court entered an order denying Appellant’s request to set aside Candidate’s nomination petition, but granting Appellant’s request to require Candidate to amend his petition and affidavit to reflect his residence as in Haverford. The court further denied Candidate’s motion to permit him to recirculate his amended petition among the voters who had previously signed his petition. Finally, as a result of its decision not to set aside Candidate’s petition, the court directed the Secretary of the Commonwealth to certify Candidate as a candidate in the April 27th primary election for the Democratic Party nomination for the office of Representative for the 15th Congressional District.</p>
    <p id="b790-5" data-blocks='[["BL_790.6",790,[269,2076,1157,307]],["BL_791.1",791,[123,334,1158,626]]]'>In a memorandum opinion filed with its order, the Commonwealth Court explained that because Candidate is not required to live in the 15th Congressional District to run for the office of Representative of that district, the fact that he improperly stated his residence on his nomination petition and affidavit “is immaterial insofar as it relates to [Candidate’s] qualifications <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>for the office.” Commw. Ct. Op., 3/2/2004, at 5 (Slip). Furthermore, the court found that the evidence indicated that Candidate did not intend to deceive those electors who signed his petition as to his actual residence because not only did he forthrightly admit that he listed the incorrect legal residence on his petition, but he also publicly acknowledged that he is not from the 15th Congressional District and that his family continues to reside in Haverford during the newspaper interview conducted and published before his petition and affidavit were filed. <em>See id. </em>at 5-7. Moreover, the court credited Candidate’s testimony that his family intends to move into the district if Candidate is elected.</p>

      <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. The court additionally found that because Candidate was required to amend his affidavit to reflect his Haverford residence, that residence would be listed with his name on the ballot in the April 27th election and therefore “the electors, if not already aware through the media that [Candidate] is not a resident of the 15th Congressional District, will be so informed by the time of the Primary Election, and may make an informed choice at that time.” <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>

Rather, the evidence indicates that Candidate listed his Allentown address as his residence and Lehigh County as his election district because he believed that his residence and election district had changed to those places once he rented a home in Allentown and registered to vote in Lehigh County based on that address.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">15</a> This is <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>apparent from the evidence that Candidate freely acknowledged during the newspaper interview conducted while his petition was being circulated that he was from Haverford, that his wife and children live in Haverford, and that he only recently rented a townhouse in Allentown. Moreover, unlike McIntyre, Candidate candidly admits that he stated the improper legal residence on his petition and affidavit and thus the residence stated on his petition and affidavit now needs to be changed. Therefore, because Candidate’s Haverford address does not disqualify him from running for the office of Representative and because the evidence supports the Commonwealth Court’s finding that Candidate did not intentionally falsify his affidavit so as to deceive the public, we hold that the Commonwealth Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Candidate’s incorrect listing of his residence and election district was an amendable defect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">16</a> Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court’s order is affirmed.</p>
