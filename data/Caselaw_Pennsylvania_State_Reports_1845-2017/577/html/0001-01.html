Slip op. at 3. In further support of its conclusion, the trial court also noted that the Pennsylvania Department of State’s “2003 Election Calendar” had designated April 21 of the calendar year as the last day to change party enrollment before the primary.</p>

Friedman. Judge Friedman determined that the trial court had erred in relying upon Section 2603(e) and its “next following ordinary business day” proviso because the statute earlier referred to the “date of the primary ... or other subsequent event.” 25 P.S. § 2603(e). In Judge Friedman’s view, the reference to a subsequent event indicated that the Section “only applies in those cases where it is necessary to count forward in time, <em>not </em>where it is necessary to count backward in time.” Slip op. at 4 (emphasis original). The court instead deemed the time computation provision of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1908, to be controlling. Section 1908 provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>

Omitting Sunday from the computation, the thirtieth day would fall on a Saturday. Omitting Saturday from the computation, the thirtieth day would fall on a Friday. Thus, to be eligible to run as a candidate of a political body in the general election, a person must disaffiliate himself or herself from a political party by the Friday prior to the Sunday which is the thirtieth day before the primary election.</blockquote>
    <p id="b290-4" data-blocks='[["BL_290.6",290,[276,997,1155,582]]]'>Slip op. at 5 (footnote omitted). The court further concluded that petitioner was ineligible to run in the general election under Section 2603(e) because, when counting backwards is involved, “the next following ordinary business day prior to the Sunday which is the thirtieth day before the primary election also would be Friday.” Id. at 5 n. 4. Thus, under the court’s reasoning, despite the thirty-day period referred to in Section 2911.1 of the Code, a voter only has until thirty-two days before the primary election to disaffiliate himself from a political party in order to ensure eligibility as a candidate of a political body in the general election.</p>

Petitioner argues that the Commonwealth Court lost sight of that precept when it adopted the strictest possible construction of the Code, one that affords a putative candidate two days less time to change his party registration than is contemplated by the plain language of Section 2911.1. Petitioner further argues that the clear purpose of both Section 2603(e) of the Code and Section 1908 of the Statutory Construction Act is to expand the time to meet statutory deadlines to the next business day where, as here, the voter cannot take advantage of the specifically allotted time because the last day falls on a non-business day. Moreover, petitioner argues that since Section 2603(e) expressly applies to “any period of time,” the Commonwealth Court erred in construing the Section as limited to instances where it is necessary to count forward in time. Petitioner argues that, under Section <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>2603(e), a person seeking to change his party affiliation in the 2003 election cycle had until Monday, April 21, the twenty-ninth day before the primary, because the thirtieth day before the primary was a Sunday, a day on which the change could not be accommodated. Additionally, petitioner argues that the court should have afforded some deference to the Department of State Bureau of Elections, which had interpreted the Code to allow voters to register or change affiliation up until April 21, 2003, and had published this date as the deadline in the official State Election Calendar. Finally, petitioner avers that the court erred in retroactively applying what amounts to a “new rule” in order to preclude him from running for office.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Nor, contrary to the finding of the Commonwealth Court, do we believe that the trial court erred in looking to Section 2603(e) because that Section supposedly is intended to apply only to “forward-looking” computations and not to “backward-looking” ones. The fact that most statutory time computations are forward-looking no doubt played some role in the language employed in Section 2603(e). But, as petitioner accurately notes, this Section—which is found in the “Preliminary Provisions” of the Code and governs “Construction” of the Code as an entirety, and thus necessarily speaks in generalities—draws no such distinction.

The change of registration restriction in Section 2603 addresses the options of persons who would run for office as candidates of a political body—i.e., it speaks <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>to ordinary citizens. The thirtieth day before a Tuesday will always be the fifth preceding Sunday and, under the Election Code, primary elections are always held on Tuesday. See 25 P.S. § 2753 (“There shall be a General Primary preceding each general election which shall be held on the third Tuesday of May in all even-numbered years, except in the year of the nomination of a President of the United States, in which year the General Primary shall be held on the fourth Tuesday of April.”). Under the statutory proviso, where the last day upon which an act may be done is a Sunday, the “next following ordinary business day”—Monday in a world moving forward in time—effectively becomes the last day. A person looking to the plain language of the change of registration restriction and reading it in a common sense fashion would understand the statute to be speaking in terms of a linear progression in time—i.e., as expanding, and not contracting, the allotted period during which he may “disaffiliate” himself from a political party. The citizen should not be obliged to read the statute in a tortured fashion, as if he were the brilliant but often-confused wizard Merlyn in <em>The Once and Future </em>King,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> i.e., living backwards in time, so that the “next” day to accomplish the act becomes a day that already has passed.</p>

The Code essentially provides that a person has up until thirty days before the primary to decide to disaffiliate himself from his political party and create the option of a third-party candidacy in the general election. The Commonwealth Court’s reading, however, requires that the decision be made two days sooner than the statute plainly provides. If the General Assembly truly intended its thirty-day restriction upon the right of would-be political body candidates to change their registration to be a thirty-two day restriction, it could have said so explicitly. It did not do so. Bearing in mind that the Election Code is to be <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>read liberally in favor of the right to run for office and for voters to select a candidate of their choice, <em>Nomination Petition of Flaherty, supra, </em>as well as the proscription in the Statutory Construction Act against absurd or unreasonable results, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1), we conclude that petitioner’s change of registration here was effected in a timely fashion.</p>
    <p id="b295-4" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[129,661,1158,680]]]'>Analyzing the question under the computation provision in the Statutory Construction Act leads to the same conclusion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Section 1908 requires omitting the “last day” of any time restriction if it falls on Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday. Again approaching the legislation in a common sense fashion with an eye to the forward progression in time—and mindful of the requirements of liberal construction of the Code, and the duty to avoid unreasonable or absurd constructions— because a person contemplating a change in registration cannot accomplish it on the last day provided, that last day is omitted and the party should have until the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in which to change his registration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Because petitioner timely changed his party registration, the Commonwealth Court erred in reversing the trial court’s order refusing to set aside the nomination papers. Thus it is that we entered our per curiam order of reversal.</p>
