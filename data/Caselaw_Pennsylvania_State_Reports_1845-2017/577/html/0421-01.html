    <p id="b716-5" data-blocks='[["BL_716.5",716,[279,989,1152,944]]]'>Our independent review of the evidence reveals that, on November 7, 1994, appellant summoned paramedics and police to his home in Ross Township, Pennsylvania. The first police officer to arrive at the scene found appellant attempting to revive his thirty-six-year-old wife, Maryann Boczkowski, who was unconscious in the couple’s hot tub. Appellant, police officers and paramedics removed Maryann from the hot tub and attempted to revive her, but they were unsuccessful. Maryann was transported to Allegheny General Hospital at appellant’s request, rather than to the closest hospital. There, she was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed that Maryann’s death was caused by asphyxiation, resulting from blunt force trauma to her neck. The autopsy also showed numerous points of trauma of recent origin on Maryann’s body and head, including hemorrhages on her neck and bruises on the interior of her scalp, which were inconsistent with the treatment she received in the attempts to revive her. Maryann’s blood alcohol level at the time of her death was .22 percent.</p>
    <p id="b716-6" data-blocks='[["BL_716.6",716,[277,1958,1150,405]]]'>Meanwhile, a physical examination of appellant revealed fresh scratch marks on his arms, sides and hands. In addition, before Maryann was taken to Allegheny General Hospital, appellant spontaneously told police: “I hope they don’t try to put this on me.” Later, after voluntarily accompanying police to the Ross Township Police Department, appellant nodded in the affirmative when officers asserted that he had been involved in his wife’s death.</p>

      <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>Trial testimony also established that in the months preceding Maryann’s death, appellant had attempted to portray her to friends as an alcoholic. Maryann’s longtime friends, however, testified that they rarely saw Maryann intoxicated. In addition, appellant stipulated that he was the beneficiary of a $100,000 life insurance policy on Maryann’s life. Appellant also made incriminating statements to fellow inmates at the Allegheny County Jail, admitting his culpability for the deaths of both Maryann and his previous wife, Elaine, and responding to an inmate query regarding why he had killed both wives in the same manner with, “I don’t know. That was stupid, wasn’t it.”</p>
    <p id="b717-5" data-blocks='[["BL_717.5",717,[130,977,1156,894]]]'>Independent trial evidence established that appellant’s former wife, Elaine Boczkowski, had been found dead in her bathtub in Greensboro, North Carolina, on November 4, 1990. The factual circumstances of that death bore a marked similarity to the circumstances surrounding Maryann’s death: Elaine died in her bathtub, Maryann in a hot tub. Both women were in their thirties and in good health. Appellant reported to the North Carolina police that Elaine had been drinking alcoholic beverages before entering the bathtub; he told Ross Township police that Maryann had been drinking prior to entering the hot tub. Appellant told police in both jurisdictions that he and his wife had a minor argument on the evening before the death. In each case, police noticed that appellant had fresh scratch marks on his arms, hands and torso shortly after his wife’s death. The autopsies of both women revealed that they had died from asphyxiation, not drowning.</p>
    <p id="b717-6" data-blocks='[["BL_717.6",717,[131,1895,1154,299]]]'>The foregoing evidence adequately supports the jury’s finding that Maryann Boczkowski was unlawfully killed, that appellant, who was found with her, killed her, that he acted with the specific intent to kill when he applied blunt force to Maryann’s neck, and that the killing was done with premeditation and deliberation.</p>

In support of this claim, appellant points to the testimony of both the Commonwealth’s pathologist, who performed the autopsy on Maryann, and the defense pathologist. Their findings, appellant argues, are more consistent with accidental drowning than manual strangulation. Appellant suggests that the Commonwealth’s pathologist vacillated in his testimony regarding the cause of Maryann’s death. The record does not support his argument. The Commonwealth’s pathologist testified consistently that the cause of death was manual strangulation. Although appellant’s own pathologist testified that the cause of death was drowning, this is of no avail on a sufficiency claim: appellant’s argument is fatally flawed because it rests only on the evidence submitted by the defense, evidence which the jury was not obligated to accept. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant eventually failed in his attempts to prevent the transfer in the North Carolina trial and appellate courts and he was ultimately returned to the Commonwealth on October 22, 1998. Appellant does not dispute that he was unavailable for trial in Pennsylvania during this period because he was incarcerated in North Carolina. Appellant nevertheless argues that this time should not be deemed excludable for Rule 1100 purposes because his initial 1995 transfer to North Carolina for trial there was achieved by the Commonwealth in violation of a pending Pennsylvania court order which had stayed extradition to North Carolina pending disposition of the Pennsylvania murder charge.</p>

Appellant goes so far as to suggest that in the absence of “a positive claim by the defense that accident, not homicide, was the underlying cause of death,” proof tending to show absence of accident is irrelevant.

There were no eyewitnesses (other than appellant himself) and, although appellant made some incriminating statements and head movements that were interpreted as incriminatory, he did not give a detailed confession. Thus, the case against appellant was largely circumstantial: <em>ie., </em>consisting of proof that death was brought on by blunt force trauma and asphyxiation, not drowning; the fact that appellant was the only person with access, <em>etc. </em>The Commonwealth argues that proof of the circumstances surrounding the death of appellant’s first wife was highly probative in that it too tended to show that Maryann died at someone’s hands, and not by some other means, and that those hands belonged to appellant. In addition to ruling out accident as the cause of death, the Commonwealth argues, the evidence was also probative of appellant’s intent. The Commonwealth also notes that the prospect of prejudice arising from the evidence was ameliorated by the trial court’s repeated and explicit instructions to the jury as to the limited purpose of the evidence.</p>

At least for purposes of a homicide prosecution, where the victim, of course, is unavailable, we reject the notion that proof of an absence of accident is admissible only for responsive purposes. Although death itself occurs in innumerable ways, there are but a limited number of manners of death: suicide, natural causes, accident, homicide or, in rare instances, indeterminable. In a murder prosecution, the Commonwealth bears the affirmative burden of convincing the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the death was only by homicide; and, in a first-degree murder case, it bears the additional burden of proving that the defendant acted with premeditation and/or deliberation. The defendant, of course, is not obliged to present any evidence at all. In a case such as this, where there are no Commonwealth eyewitnesses, one appropriate way in which to prove that the death was by criminal means is to exclude the possibility of other manners of death.

This case provides a practical example. Certain of the evidence available to the Commonwealth here was suggestive that Maryann’s death could have been accidental, even if appellant did not affirmatively argue that inference. Illustrative are the facts that appellant told paramedics at the scene that on the night she died Maryann had consumed fourteen beers; that he and Maryann had been celebrating an upcoming event; that he had left her in the hot tub while he went to take a shower; and that, upon returning, he found her unconscious and face up in the hot tub. This account clearly suggested an acciden<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>tal death and it was certainly relevant for the Commonwealth to prove both the existence of the account and then to demonstrate its implausibility—since the very implausibility of the account by the person in the best position to know how the victim died was probative of guilt.

At approximately 3:45 a.m., Detectives Waters and James Cvetic spoke to appellant and noted that he had a small injury on his left thumb. After a further brief conversation, the detectives asked appellant if he would accompany them to the police station so that his sleeping children would not be disturbed.

Although appellant <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>was transported to the police station in a police vehicle, he was not handcuffed or restrained in any way.</p>

Appellant also agreed to submit to a polygraph examination. During this entire time, appellant was free to move around the police station and was told that he was free to leave at any time. Between approximately 6:00 a.m., when the polygraph examiner was contacted, and 8:15 a.m., when the examiner arrived at the police station, appellant ate breakfast with the officers while discussing football, his children and other topics.

Attorney Herb arrived at police headquarters at approximately 2:00 p.m. and met with appellant alone for approximately one hour.

Reasoning backwards from that fact, appellant argues that his earlier two references—invoking the name “Jim Herb” and later saying that maybe he should call “someone”—were themselves invocations of his right to counsel, which should have precluded police from questioning him without an attorney.</p>

Appellant argues that “twenty-one percent” of the Commonwealth’s witnesses testified exclusively about Elaine’s death in North Carolina, while a number of the witnesses who testified regarding Maryann’s murder also testified about Elaine’s murder.

A review of the trial testimony indicates that it was, indeed, limited to the areas of inquiry authorized by the Superior Court and was neither cumulative nor excessive. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the Commonwealth to introduce the precise evidence that the Superior Court order contemplated. Moreover, as noted above, the court’s repeated cautionary charges concerning the limited purpose of the evidence served to minimize any potential for unfair prejudice.</p>

Appellant argues that notwithstanding the Superior Court order, the trial court retained the obligation to exercise discretion regarding the evidence permitted at trial, to ensure its relevancy and probative value. Appellant claims that the trial court improperly admitted testimony from various witnesses that was cumulative and which essentially re-tried appellant for the North Carolina murder of Elaine during his Pennsylvania trial. For example, appellant points to witnesses Richard and Nancy Babica, Marianne Rochford, and Police Officer Brenda Vance as providing cumulative testimony regarding the circumstances of Elaine’s death. A review of their testimony, however, illustrates that appellant gave inconsistent versions of how he discovered Elaine in the bathtub. Therefore, their testimony was not cumulative.</p>

The testimony of Drs. Radisch and Butts was not cumulative. In 1990, Dr. Radisch was unable to assign a cause of death, but in 1994, upon reevaluation, Dr. Butts determined that Elaine’s death was caused by asphyxiation with aspiration of gastric contents due to chest compression and that the manner of death was homicide. To the limited extent that their testimony overlapped, the repetition was necessary to highlight the differing interpretations of Elaine’s injuries. Accordingly, their testimony was not cumulative.

White, </em><a href="/pa/490/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="490 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="1763829" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0179-01">490 Pa. 179</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="490 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="1763829" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0179-01">415 A.2d 399</a>, 402 (1980). “A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2504(a). Appellant argues that the jury could have found that he acted recklessly or grossly negligently when he left his intoxicated wife in the hot tub alone, where she drowned. The physical evidence, however, including the bruising and injuries indicating that Maryann had died from manual strangulation, would not support an involuntary manslaughter conviction and, once again, appellant defended on an accident theory. Therefore, the trial court properly declined to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter.</p>

The hot tub fluid in question was discarded and never processed by the crime lab, and the sinus cavity fluid was never extracted or analyzed. The record does not support appellant’s claim that he was entitled to an adverse inference instruction. Detective Cvetic testified that the hot tub water was not submitted to the crime lab because appellant had drained and cleaned the hot tub prior to the sample being taken. Thus, evidence pertaining to any analysis of the water would have been irrelevant. As for the fluid in Maryann’s sinus cavity, both Commonwealth and defense experts agreed that the presence of the fluid was an indication of drowning. Thus, it was the presence of the fluid, not its composition, that was pertinent to appellant’s defense of accidental death. Therefore, this claim fails.</p>

Then Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey issued an Executive Warrant directing that appellant be returned to North Carolina. The letter transmitting the Warrant to the Allegheny County District <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>Attorney’s Office related that the Governor “had no objection to delaying the delivery of [appellant] until local charges are disposed of, if any are pending.” Thereafter, at a February 15, 1995 hearing before the Honorable Kathleen A. Durkin of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, the Commonwealth presented the Warrant along with the supporting extradition papers from North Carolina. The Commonwealth requested that the court order appellant extradited to North Carolina, but asked for a stay of extradition pending disposition of the instant charges “including sentence, if applicable.” Appellant indicated his agreement with the order of extradition and the stay. That same day, Judge Durkin entered an “Order of Court to Extradite Fugitive” ordering extradition, but stayed the order “pending disposition of local charges.”</p>

The Commonwealth’s áction in this regard was unilateral; it never sought court modification of the stayed extradition order to authorize an immediate transfer of appellant. In accordance with DDA Conrad’s directive, appellant was delivered to North Carolina authorities on October 27, 1995. On November 1,1996, following a capital trial, appellant was convicted of the murder of Elaine Boczkowski in North Carolina and sentenced to life imprisonment. Six days later, on November 7, 1996, DDA Conrad filed a notice pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 352 (since renumbered Rule 801) of the Commonwealth’s intention to seek the death penalty in the case <em>sub judice, </em>listing as the single aggravating circumstance that appellant had been convicted of another murder committed before the offense at issue. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll).</p>

    <p id="b747-4" data-blocks='[["BL_747.5",747,[120,509,1161,946]]]'>Appellant argues that Judge Durkin’s order staying extradition was a valid one that was never lifted, vacated or modified by any court. Therefore, the District Attorney’s Office had no authority to act in contravention of that order and transfer appellant to North Carolina before the Pennsylvania charges were disposed. Had appellant not been unlawfully transferred to North Carolina, the factual basis for the single aggravating circumstance would not have existed and appellant would not have been eligible for the death penalty. Appellant argues that the Commonwealth should not be permitted to benefit from its blatant violation of the stayed extradition order, and he should be afforded some remedy. Appellant concludes that quashal of the single aggravating circumstance and a concomitant vacatur of the sentence of death is the appropriate remedy because it would restore the status quo ante, <em>ie., </em>it would place the parties back in the positions which existed before the Commonwealth’s violation of the court order.</p>
    <p id="b747-5" data-blocks='[["BL_747.6",747,[123,1488,1158,899]]]'>The Commonwealth does not dispute that its action in transferring appellant to North Carolina led to the creation of the aggravating circumstance it later relied upon to certify that this had now become a capital prosecution. The Commonwealth nevertheless argues that it did not engage in a “willful or intentional” violation of the stayed extradition order. This is so because there was a change in circumstances—appellant’s having successfully moved to exclude certain Commonwealth evidence and the pendency of the Commonwealth’s pre-trial appeal from the trial court’s order excluding that evidence—which precipitated the Commonwealth’s decision to transfer appellant to North Carolina. Because the Pennsylvania trial proceeding had “halted for a valid reason,” the Commonwealth argues, its returning appellant to North Carolina was reasonable. Furthermore, that action ensured that appellant’s right to a speedy trial in North Carolina was not impeded by the appellate delay here.</p>

As proof that it was not deliberately seeking to arrange for the creation of the aggravating circumstance, the Commonwealth notes that it was the party that originally requested the stay of extradition, a fact indicating that it was fully prepared to try the matter as a non-capital case. The intervening dispute over appellant’s partially successful motion in limine then changed the circumstances. The Commonwealth emphasizes that the fact that it prevailed upon its interlocutory appeal shows that it pursued that appeal in good faith. Because it did not seek the death penalty for an improper reason and because the aggravating circumstance unquestionably did exist by the time of trial, the Commonwealth concludes that appellant is entitled to no relief.</p>

At the hearing, defense counsel reviewed all the extradition paperwork and acknowledged it was in order. Counsel did not object to appellant’s return to North Carolina and agreed to have the Pennsylvania charges disposed of first; the court granted the Commonwealth’s request. Id.</p>
    <p id="b754-6" data-blocks='[["BL_754.8",754,[274,1077,1158,792]]]'>After the trial court granted appellant’s unrelated motion <em>in </em>limine&gt; the Commonwealth filed an interlocutory appeal. There is no suggestion, much less evidence, that the Commonwealth filed this appeal in order to procure an aggravator. This appeal was necessary, as the trial court erred in precluding certain evidence which substantially handicapped the Commonwealth’s case. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 311(d) (Commonwealth may seek appellate review of pretrial order which excludes Commonwealth evidence and thereby substantially handicaps its prosecution). Because of the appeal, the Commonwealth let appellant go to North Carolina, but did so without asking the trial court to lift the stay. The majority concludes these circumstances “introduced an impermissible element of arbitrariness into the eligibility decision.” Majority Opinion, <a href="/pa/577/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="577 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="91660" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0360-01">577 Pa. at 464-66</a>, 846 A.2d at 101.</p>

Still, it is worth noting that the Commonwealth was successful on appeal, but not until nearly 19 months after appellant’s conviction in North Carolina. The nature of the appeal and the indeterminate amount of time it would (and did) take made it appropriate to release appellant to North Carolina, which was prepared to try appellant’s case, <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>nearly 10 years in the making. The Commonwealth’s decision to forgo their priority position and allow his return to North Carolina was mere common sense, not arbitrariness, and was based upon sound reasoning and judicial economy.</p>
    <p id="b755-4" data-blocks='[["BL_755.5",755,[111,576,1165,1176]]]'>The real issue is not extradition, but the unilateral disregard of the stay. Had the Commonwealth moved to lift the stay, there appears no reason it would not have been granted— there was no real opposition by appellant to extradition beyond assuring the paperwork was in order. The trial court heard appellant’s motion to quash the aggravating circumstance and concluded the extradition of appellant to North Carolina was based on a logical and sensible decision. Trial Court Opinion, 10/03/2000, at 9. The trial court saw nothing improper in the fact that extradition took place while the Commonwealth’s appeal was pending in Pennsylvania. Id., at 27. Appellant never objected at the pre-extradition hearing, nor did he at the time he was transferred to North Carolina. The trial court did not find the action contemptuous. “[I]t is axiomatic that a court has inherent power to enforce its own orders ... and that this Court will not interfere with enforcement absent an abuse of discretion.” <em>Commonwealth v. Shaffer, </em><a href="/pa/551/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="551 Pa. 622" data-case-ids="507802" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0622-01">551 Pa. 622</a>, <a href="/a2d/712/0749-01" class="citation" data-index="146" data-cite="712 A.2d 749" data-case-ids="11818394,507802" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0749-01,/pa/551/0622-01">712 A.2d 749</a>, 751 (1998) (plurality) (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court reviewed the violation of its own order and failed to find any sanction necessary; I see no reason to second-guess its discretion.</p>
    <p id="b755-5" data-blocks='[["BL_755.6",755,[117,1784,1156,471]]]'>Appellant’s case in Pennsylvania was postponed for a valid reason and the Commonwealth’s action was not “clearly arbitrary.” I do not sanction the Commonwealth’s unilateral disregard of the stay, but it was a stay that the Commonwealth, not appellant, sought. Allowing the North Carolina charges to proceed expeditiously was the right thing to do. Speedy trial is a right inuring to the accused, not the Commonwealth, and delaying both trials for two more years was not the right thing to do.</p>

Hence I must dissent to the portion of my colleagues’ decision which reverses that penalty.</p>
