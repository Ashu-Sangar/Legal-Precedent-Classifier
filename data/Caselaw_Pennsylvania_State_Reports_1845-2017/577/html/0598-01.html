Furthermore, the statements tended to suggest that the Tuckers are hypocritical, that after condemning the gangsta rap industry for profiting from pornography, the Tuckers were only too willing to open up their own sex life for public inspection in order to reap a pecuniary gain.

The Court began with a discussion of an unconstitutional federal statute,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> the Sedition Act, which limited speech by prohibiting false statements about the United States, the Congress, or the President.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a>

However, the issue in <em>New York Times </em>was whether state libel law had an unconstitutionally chilling effect on free expression. The Court explained that the repressive effect of a criminal statute, like the Sedition Act, and an overly broad state defamation law was quite similar,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a> noting that “what a State may not constitutionally bring about by means of a criminal statu[t]e is likewise beyond the reach of its civil law of libel.” <em>New York Times, </em><a href="/us/376/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="376 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="379234" data-case-paths="/us/376/0254-01">376 U.S. at 277</a>, <a href="/us/376/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="376 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="379234" data-case-paths="/us/376/0254-01">84 S.Ct. 710</a>.

Rather, only through the course of case-by-case adjudication can we give content to these otherwise elusive constitutional standards. Moreover, such elucidation is particularly important in the area of free speech for precisely the same reason that the actual malice standard is itself necessary. Uncertainty as to the scope of the constitutional protection can only dissuade protected speech—the more elusive the standard, the less protection it affords.

The <em>Philadelphia Daily News </em>article stated that Mrs. Tucker suffered mental anguish, great humiliation, and mental pain and suffering, and that she was suing, in part, “to stop the production and distribution of gangsta rap to ‘impressionable youth, because it tends to corrupt the morals of minors.’ ” (R.R. 44a (quoting Mrs. Tucker).) The article reported that Mrs. Tucker alleged that she was slandered and that she “has reasonable fear for her life because violence and death play a central role in the gangsta rap arena.” Although the <em>Legal Intelligencer </em>article did not give as many details about the other relief sought by the Tuckers, it stated that the lawsuit sought relief for other <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>things, including damages for “humiliation, mental pain and suffering” because of the lyrics of the songs on the “All Eyez on Me” album.

(R.R. 34a.) Appellant-newspapers properly demurred to this statement. The Tuckers cannot prove actual malice based on their belief that Appellant-newspapers should have paid more attention to the Tuckers’ press release especially where the release did not deny that the Tuckers sought damages for diminished sexual relations. Indeed, the press release stated that Mrs. Tucker’s “husband, William, a well known businessman, joins her as a plaintiff in the suit.” (R. 72a.) The press release did nothing to dispel the belief of Appellant-newspapers that the loss of consortium claim included a claim for loss of sexual relations.</p>

(R.R. 34a, 36a.) We do not find any basis from which a jury could conclude that Appellant-newspapers acted recklessly or in knowing disregard of the truth in reliance on the statement of Mr. Fischbein. In fact, the newspapers acted reasonably in quoting Mr. Fischbein. As an attorney and the executor of the Estate of Shakur, he is an entirely appropriate person for the newspapers to have interviewed. He was not an unreliable source and reliance upon him is not evidence of actual malice. <em>Curran, </em><a href="/pa/497/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="497 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1775268" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0163-01">439 A.2d at 660</a>. Additionally, the emphasis on the “spin” of Mr. Fischbein to attract some of the more prurient interests of the public is not defamatory. “An action for defamation cannot be premised solely on defendant’s style or utilization of vivid words in reporting a judicial proceeding .... [an article does not become actionable] by reason of the alleged ‘flippant’ and ‘smart alecky’ style of writing which was utilized ... to create reader interest.” <em>Binder v.

Apparently, the <em>Legal Intelligencer </em>did not have the benefit of an interview with Mrs. Tucker, so it relied upon the Complaint and the other sources available. The fact that the newspapers did not interview Mrs. Tucker does not mean that they knew that the statement of Mr. Fischbein was false, nor does it create the inference that Appellant-newspapers had “obvious reasons to doubt the veracity” of his statements, especially where the <em>Tucker II </em>Complaint appeared to validate them. <em>St. Amant, </em>390 U.S. at 732, <a href="/us/390/0727-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="88 S.

It is also worthy of note that the <em>Newsweek </em>article was printed on August 20, 1997, eighteen days after the <em>Philadelphia Daily News </em>article and sixteen days after the <em>Legal Intelligencer </em>article.

Additionally, the Tuckers allege that Appellant-newspapers acted recklessly by failing to follow selected rules of journalistic ethics including: (1) not relying on biased sources; (2) failing to rely on the best sources; (3) not sensationalizing the news; and, (4) failing to check the sources and accuracy of the stories. <em><a href="/us/388/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="388 U.S. 130" data-case-ids="6167825" data-case-paths="/us/388/0130-01">Id.</a></em>
