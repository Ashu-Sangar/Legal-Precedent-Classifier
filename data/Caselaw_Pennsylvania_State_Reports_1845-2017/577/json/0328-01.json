        "text": "Justice SAYLOR.\nDISSENTING STATEMENT\nHowever incongruous it may seem, the General Assembly had defined the term \u201ctangible personal property,\u201d for sales and use tax purposes, to include cellular telecommunications service. See 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7201(m), 7201(rr) (superseded). Therefore, and since the Legislature has also defined the term \u201cmanufacture\u201d in terms of the production of \u201ctangible personal property,\u201d see 72 P.S. \u00a7 7201(c), I agree with Appellants\u2019 position that, under the manufacturing exclusion applicable to sales and use taxation, see 72 P.S. \u00a7 7201(k), (o), they are entitled to relief from sales and/or use tax assessments related to machinery, equipment, and supplies used in their cellular telecommunications businesses in the relevant taxing periods. As Appellants explain, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s central reliance on Suburban Cable TV Co. v. Commonwealth, 131 Pa.Cmwlth. 368, 570 A.2d 601 (1990), aff'd, 527 Pa. 364, 591 A.2d 1054 (1991), and Suburban Cable TV Co. v. City of Chester, 685 A.2d 616 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996), in denying relief was misplaced, since the former concerned a now-superseded taxing scheme that did not extend the manufacturing exclusion to production of electrical or electronic impulses, and the latter involved a local business privilege tax that did not define the term \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d\nI therefore respectfully dissent to the per curiam affirmance of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order.\n. As Appellants acknowledge, the General Assembly subsequently and prospectively modified the Tax Code so that, after the periods in question, they would no longer be eligible to invoke the manufacturing exclusion. See Act of June 29, 2002, P.L. 416, No. 89, \u00a7 1 (amending, inter alia, the definition of \"telecommunications service\u201d in Section 7201(rr) to exclude \"mobile telecommunications services\u201d).\n. In light of the above, I would not reach the question concerning whether Appellants are separately entitled to relief under the exclusion for rendering a public utility service. See 72 P.S. \u00a7 7201(k), (o). Nevertheless, I note my disagreement with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s approach in this regard, as I believe that it should have considered the range of constitutional concerns raised by Appellants, including those raised under the Supremacy and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution, pursuant to the principle of statutory construction that requires courts to presume that the General Assembly did not intend to violate constitutional precepts. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(3).",
