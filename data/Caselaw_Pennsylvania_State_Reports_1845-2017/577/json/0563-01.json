Wagner, individually and trading as Blue Bell Gulf, sustained when an underground pipe at his gasoline station ruptured, releasing gasoline into the soil under his and neighboring properties. I simply cannot accept the Superior Court\u2019s position that an insurance company providing general liability coverage for an insured\u2019s operation of a gasoline station can deny coverage for damages from a gasoline leak based on a general pollution exclusion, when that exclusion is buried on page twenty-five of the policy and the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cpollutant\u201d does not specifically reference gasoline.\nJustice NEWMAN joins.",
