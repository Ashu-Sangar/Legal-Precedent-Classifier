        "text": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 29th day of October 2003, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED and the Order of the Commonwealth Court is REVERSED. Opinion to Follow.\nBefore CAPPY, C.J., CASTILLE, NIGRO, NEWMAN, SAYLOR, EAKIN, JJ.\nOPINION\nJustice CASTILLE.\nThis Opinion is filed in support of this Court\u2019s unanimous per curiam order of October 29, 2003, which granted Lahr\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal and reversed the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order in this election matter. See In re: Nomination Papers of Joe Lahr, 577 Pa. 1, 842 A.2d 327 (2003). The practical effect of our order was to permit petitioner Lahr to remain on the November 4, 2003 general election ballot as a third-party candidate for the office of District Justice in newly-formed Magisterial District No. 12-2-05 in Dauphin County.\nTwo weeks before the general election, petitioner sought expedited review of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order which had reversed a trial court order denying the petition of respondents Lavon and Paula Postelle to set aside petitioner\u2019s nomination papers. In granting review and summarily reversing, this Court determined that the Commonwealth Court had erred in holding that petitioner had failed to change his party registration in a timely fashion under the Election Code, 25 P.S. \u00a7 2911.1, so as to render him eligible to seek the office of District Justice as a third-party candidate in the general election. We noted in the per curiam order that an opinion would follow.\nLavon Postelle won the Democratic nomination for the district justice seat in the May 20, 2003 primary election, while no candidate in the Republican primary qualified to appear on the general election ballot. Petitioner was a registered Republican who had cross-filed nomination petitions for both the Democratic and Republican primary elections for the new seat. Although the record is sparse, it appears that petitioner\u2019s primary candidacies were successfully challenged and he ultimately did not appear on either party\u2019s primary ballot. On Monday, April 21, 2003, twenty-nine calendar days before the primary election, petitioner filed a Registration Declaration with the Dauphin County Voter Registration Office changing his party registration to \u201cNo Affiliation.\u201d\nThereafter, on July 22, 2003, a political body calling itself \u201cJoe Lahr Justice\u201d filed nomination papers nominating petitioner as its candidate in the November 4, 2003 general election for District Justice. Through all times relevant here, petitioner maintained his registration as \u201cNo Affiliation.\u201d\nOn August 4, 2003, respondents petitioned to set aside the nomination papers alleging, inter alia, that petitioner had failed to timely change his party registration in accordance with Section 2911.1 of the Election Code. Section 2911.1 provides:\nAny person who is a registered and enrolled member of a party during any period of time beginning with thirty (30) days before the primary and extending through the general or municipal election of that same year shall be ineligible to be the candidate of a political body in a general or municipal election held in that same year nor shall any person who is a registered and enrolled member of a party be eligible to be the candidate of a political body for a special election.\n25 P.S. \u00a7 2911.1. Respondents argued that, because petitioner\u2019s change in registration (or \u201cdisaffiliation\u201d with a political party) occurred only twenty-nine days before the May 20th primary, he was ineligible to be the candidate of a political body in the general election.\nFollowing a hearing on October 3, 2003, the Honorable Joseph H. Kleinfelter denied respondents\u2019 petition. In finding petitioner\u2019s change of registration to be timely, President Judge Kleinfelter applied Section 2603(e) of the Election Code, which provides that:\nIn determining or reckoning any period of time mentioned in this act, the day upon which the act is done, paper filed, or notice given, shall be excluded from, and the date of the primary, election, hearing or other subsequent event, as the case may be, shall be included in the calculation or reckoning: Provided, however, That if the last day upon which any act may be done, paper filed, or notice given, shall fall on a Sunday or a legal holiday, the next following ordinary business day shall be considered as the last day for said purpose.\n25 P.S. \u00a7 2603(e). The trial court reasoned that: \u201cas the 30th day before the primary fell on a Sunday [i.e., April 20, 2003], [petitioner\u2019s] dis-enrollment as a member of a political party on Monday, April 21, was timely\u201d since April 21 was the next following ordinary business day from the last day upon which the change in registration could be effected. Slip op. at 3. In further support of its conclusion, the trial court also noted that the Pennsylvania Department of State\u2019s \u201c2003 Election Calendar\u201d had designated April 21 of the calendar year as the last day to change party enrollment before the primary.\nRespondents appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which reversed in a single-judge memorandum opinion by the Honorable Rochelle S. Friedman. Judge Friedman determined that the trial court had erred in relying upon Section 2603(e) and its \u201cnext following ordinary business day\u201d proviso because the statute earlier referred to the \u201cdate of the primary ... or other subsequent event.\u201d 25 P.S. \u00a7 2603(e). In Judge Friedman\u2019s view, the reference to a subsequent event indicated that the Section \u201conly applies in those cases where it is necessary to count forward in time, not where it is necessary to count backward in time.\u201d Slip op. at 4 (emphasis original). The court instead deemed the time computation provision of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1908, to be controlling. Section 1908 provides, in pertinent part, that:\nWhen any period of time is referred to in any statute, such period in all cases ... shall be so computed as to exclude the first and include the last day of such period. Whenever the last day of any such period shall fall on Saturday or Sunday, or on any day made a legal holiday by the laws of this Commonwealth or of the United States, such day shall be omitted from the computation.\nId. Looking backwards from the date of the primary election, and applying Section 1908 literally, the court concluded that petitioner had failed to timely change his party registration:\n[C]ounting backwards thirty days from the primary election, the thirtieth day falls on a Sunday. Omitting Sunday from the computation, the thirtieth day would fall on a Saturday. Omitting Saturday from the computation, the thirtieth day would fall on a Friday. Thus, to be eligible to run as a candidate of a political body in the general election, a person must disaffiliate himself or herself from a political party by the Friday prior to the Sunday which is the thirtieth day before the primary election.\nSlip op. at 5 (footnote omitted). The court further concluded that petitioner was ineligible to run in the general election under Section 2603(e) because, when counting backwards is involved, \u201cthe next following ordinary business day prior to the Sunday which is the thirtieth day before the primary election also would be Friday.\u201d Id. at 5 n. 4. Thus, under the court\u2019s reasoning, despite the thirty-day period referred to in Section 2911.1 of the Code, a voter only has until thirty-two days before the primary election to disaffiliate himself from a political party in order to ensure eligibility as a candidate of a political body in the general election.\nThe issue for review then is whether, under Section 2911.1, a person who changes his party registration twenty-nine days before the primary election is ineligible to be the candidate of a political body in the general election where\u2014as will always be the case so long as primaries are held on Tuesdays\u2014the thirtieth day before the primary falls on a Sunday. This statutory construction question is one of first impression. As the question is one of law, our review is plenary. Commonwealth v. Gilmour Manufacturing Co., 573 Pa. 143, 822 A.2d 676, 679 (2003); Phillips v. A-Best Products Co., 542 Pa. 124, 665 A.2d 1167, 1170 (1995).\nThe polestar of statutory construction, of course, is to determine the intent of the General Assembly. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a) (court\u2019s sole objective in construing or interpreting a statute remains to \u201cascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly\u201d); Hannaberry HVAC v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Bd. (Snyder, Jr.), 834 A.2d 524, 531 (Pa.2003). \u201cGenerally speaking, the best indication of legislative intent is the plain language of a statute.\u201d Gilmour Mamifacturing, supra. Furthermore, in construing statutory language, \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage____\u201d Id., (quoting 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903). The Statutory Construction Act also requires, among other things, that courts \u201cpresume that the General Assembly did not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1) (fundamental presumption in \u201cascertaining the intention of the General Assembly in the enactment of a statute\u201d is that \u201cthe General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable\u201d); Hannaberry, supra.\nPetitioner begins by invoking the settled principle that the Election Code is to be construed liberally so as not to deprive an individual of his right to run for office, or the voters their right to elect a candidate of their choice. See Nomination Petition of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327, 331 (2001); Petition of Ross, 411 Pa. 45, 190 A.2d 719, 720 (1963) (collecting cases). Petitioner argues that the Commonwealth Court lost sight of that precept when it adopted the strictest possible construction of the Code, one that affords a putative candidate two days less time to change his party registration than is contemplated by the plain language of Section 2911.1. Petitioner further argues that the clear purpose of both Section 2603(e) of the Code and Section 1908 of the Statutory Construction Act is to expand the time to meet statutory deadlines to the next business day where, as here, the voter cannot take advantage of the specifically allotted time because the last day falls on a non-business day. Moreover, petitioner argues that since Section 2603(e) expressly applies to \u201cany period of time,\u201d the Commonwealth Court erred in construing the Section as limited to instances where it is necessary to count forward in time. Petitioner argues that, under Section 2603(e), a person seeking to change his party affiliation in the 2003 election cycle had until Monday, April 21, the twenty-ninth day before the primary, because the thirtieth day before the primary was a Sunday, a day on which the change could not be accommodated. Additionally, petitioner argues that the court should have afforded some deference to the Department of State Bureau of Elections, which had interpreted the Code to allow voters to register or change affiliation up until April 21, 2003, and had published this date as the deadline in the official State Election Calendar. Finally, petitioner avers that the court erred in retroactively applying what amounts to a \u201cnew rule\u201d in order to preclude him from running for office.\nPreliminarily, we turn to the question of the interplay of the relevant time computation provisions in the Election Code and the Statutory Construction Act, a question this Court addressed in Petition of Kehler, 434 Pa. 274, 256 A.2d 623 (1969). Petition ofKehler involved challenges to the validity of absentee ballots, the salient issue on appeal being the timeliness of an appeal from a county Election Board order. The Board order was filed on a Thursday and, under the Election Code, the aggrieved party had two days to appeal the decision. See 25 P.S. 3157(a). The appeal was not taken until the succeeding Monday.\nIn Petition of Kehler, the difference between the computation provisions created a conflict and, ultimately, was outcome-determinative. This was so because the Statutory Construction Act specifically excludes Saturdays from time computations, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1908 (\u201cWhenever the last day of any such period shall fall on Saturday or Sunday [or a legal holiday] ... such day shall be omitted from the computation\u201d), while the Election Code does not. See 25 P.S. \u00a7 2603 (addressing only Sundays and legal holidays). If the Code controlled, the appeal would be facially untimely; if the Act controlled, the appeal would be proper. A divided Court (4-2) held that, where such an irreconcilable conflict between the provisions existed, the Statutory Construction Act, having been enacted later in time, supplanted the Election Code:\nThe meaning of [now-Section 1908] is clear. It refers to \u201cany law\u201d and \u201call cases.\u201d This section supersedes the computation method on all previously effective laws. No express repealer of the method of computation used in the Election Code is required because ... the Statutory Construction Act ... provides that the law with the latest date of enactment is to prevail if an irreconcilable conflict exists between laws passed at different legislative sessions.\n256 A.2d at 624.\nWith respect to the question presented sub judice, there is no equivalent \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d between the Code and the Act and, thus, we do not believe that the trial court erred in looking to Section 2603(e) of the Act upon that ground. Nor, contrary to the finding of the Commonwealth Court, do we believe that the trial court erred in looking to Section 2603(e) because that Section supposedly is intended to apply only to \u201cforward-looking\u201d computations and not to \u201cbackward-looking\u201d ones. The fact that most statutory time computations are forward-looking no doubt played some role in the language employed in Section 2603(e). But, as petitioner accurately notes, this Section\u2014which is found in the \u201cPreliminary Provisions\u201d of the Code and governs \u201cConstruction\u201d of the Code as an entirety, and thus necessarily speaks in generalities\u2014draws no such distinction. Instead, the statute speaks of \u201cdetermining or reckoning any period of time mentioned in this act\u201d (emphasis added).\nWe believe that the Code fully supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s change of registration, which was effected the very next business day after the Sunday representing the deadline upon which a change of registration could be effected, was timely. The change of registration restriction in Section 2603 addresses the options of persons who would run for office as candidates of a political body\u2014i.e., it speaks to ordinary citizens. The thirtieth day before a Tuesday will always be the fifth preceding Sunday and, under the Election Code, primary elections are always held on Tuesday. See 25 P.S. \u00a7 2753 (\u201cThere shall be a General Primary preceding each general election which shall be held on the third Tuesday of May in all even-numbered years, except in the year of the nomination of a President of the United States, in which year the General Primary shall be held on the fourth Tuesday of April.\u201d). Under the statutory proviso, where the last day upon which an act may be done is a Sunday, the \u201cnext following ordinary business day\u201d\u2014Monday in a world moving forward in time\u2014effectively becomes the last day. A person looking to the plain language of the change of registration restriction and reading it in a common sense fashion would understand the statute to be speaking in terms of a linear progression in time\u2014i.e., as expanding, and not contracting, the allotted period during which he may \u201cdisaffiliate\u201d himself from a political party. The citizen should not be obliged to read the statute in a tortured fashion, as if he were the brilliant but often-confused wizard Merlyn in The Once and Future King, i.e., living backwards in time, so that the \u201cnext\u201d day to accomplish the act becomes a day that already has passed.\nMoreover, to read the provision as operating to restrict a citizen\u2019s right to disaffiliate himself with a party and become eligible to run as a political body\u2019s candidate would render the Code\u2019s thirty-day promise illusory. The Code essentially provides that a person has up until thirty days before the primary to decide to disaffiliate himself from his political party and create the option of a third-party candidacy in the general election. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s reading, however, requires that the decision be made two days sooner than the statute plainly provides. If the General Assembly truly intended its thirty-day restriction upon the right of would-be political body candidates to change their registration to be a thirty-two day restriction, it could have said so explicitly. It did not do so. Bearing in mind that the Election Code is to be read liberally in favor of the right to run for office and for voters to select a candidate of their choice, Nomination Petition of Flaherty, supra, as well as the proscription in the Statutory Construction Act against absurd or unreasonable results, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1), we conclude that petitioner\u2019s change of registration here was effected in a timely fashion.\nAnalyzing the question under the computation provision in the Statutory Construction Act leads to the same conclusion. Section 1908 requires omitting the \u201clast day\u201d of any time restriction if it falls on Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday. Again approaching the legislation in a common sense fashion with an eye to the forward progression in time\u2014and mindful of the requirements of liberal construction of the Code, and the duty to avoid unreasonable or absurd constructions\u2014 because a person contemplating a change in registration cannot accomplish it on the last day provided, that last day is omitted and the party should have until the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in which to change his registration.\nAccordingly, we hold that a person who changes his party registration on the next business day following the thirtieth day before the primary election satisfies the deadline provided under Section 2911.1 of the Election Code. Because petitioner timely changed his party registration, the Commonwealth Court erred in reversing the trial court\u2019s order refusing to set aside the nomination papers. Thus it is that we entered our per curiam order of reversal.\nJustice BAER did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Petitioner ultimately lost the general election to respondent Lavon Postelle. However, since this situation is capable of repetition and involves important rights in the electoral arena, this Court chooses to address the matter.\n. Under the Election Code, a political body is an independent body of electors that has not acquired status as a political party. 25 P.S. \u00a7 2602(p); id. \u00a7 2831. A political body may secure a place for its nominees on the official ballot by filing nomination papers. Id. \u00a7 2911.\n. Respondents elected not to file a brief in opposition to the petition for allowance of appeal, instead noting their reliance upon the Commonwealth Court memorandum opinion. Accordingly, we lack an advocate\u2019s response to the various points made by petitioner.\n. At the time Petition of Kehler was decided, present-Section 1908 of the Act was found at 46 P.S. \u00a7 538. The substance of the provision has remained unchanged.\n. T.H. White, The Once and Future King.\n. The courts have generally employed Section 1908 in circumstances that require counting forward. See e.g., Commonwealth v. Revtai, 516 Pa. 53, 532 A.2d 1 (1987)(when last day of five-day period prescribed in rule of criminal procedure falls on weekend or legal holiday, filing on next day is timely); Commonwealth v. Jones, 473 Pa. 211, 373 A.2d 1338 (1977)(defendant not denied right to speedy trial under criminal rules where last day for trial under rule fell on Saturday and trial occurred on following Monday); County of Bucks v. Cogan, 150 Pa. Cmwlth. 74, 615 A.2d 810 (1992)(tax collector timely filed appeal from judgment where thirtieth day fell on Saturday, extending filing period to Monday); Spillane v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 26 Pa.Cmwlth. 536, 364 A.2d 1386 (1976)(where last day of sixteen-month period of limitation for filing workmen\u2019s compensation claim was Sunday, claim petition filed on following Monday was timely). But see Williams v. Wade, 704 A.2d 132 (Pa.Super.l997)(counting backward to construe rule of civil procedure requiring notice ten days prior to date of filing praecipe); Cheltenham Township Police Assoc. v. Cheltenham Township, 152 Pa.Cmwlth. 338, 618 A.2d 1234 (1992)(counting backward to construe statutory provision, which requires that collective bargaining begin at least six months before start of political subdivision\u2019s fiscal year).\n. It is notable that, in the only instance where this Court has applied the Statutory Construction Act to construe an Election Code deadline, it construed the deadline liberally to provide more, not less, time for compliance. Petition of Kehler, supra. And, in other contexts, the Act's effect has likewise been to extend the relevant statutory deadline where it falls on a weekend or a legal holiday. See supra n. 6. We find further support for our conclusion in the fact that the Pennsylvania Department of State apparently interpreted Section 2911.1 of the Code as we have, since the Department's \"2003 Election Calendar\" set Monday, April 21 as the deadline to change party registration. See Gilmour Manufacturing, supra, 822 A.2d at 679 (administrative agency's interpretations of statute are entitled to deference unless interpretation is unwise or violative of legislative intent)(citations omitted).",
