Did the Commonwealth Court err in affirming the trial court\u2019s decision that Hromisin v. Board of Assessment Appeals of Luzerne County, 719 A.2d 815 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1998), alloc. denied, 558 Pa. 634, 737 A.2d 1227 (1999), superseded the methods of determining uniformity established by this Court?\n2. Did the Commonwealth Court err in affirming the trial court\u2019s disregard of the uncontradicted valuation testimony propounded by the property owner and compound this error by then ruling on the competency and quality of such testimony when the trial court made no such determination?\nInasmuch as the constitutionality of Section 8(d.2) of the County Assessments Law of 1931, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5349(d.2), is called into question, the Attorney General is hereby invited to intervene. The Prothonotary is directed to provide prompt notice of this Order to the Attorney General.",
