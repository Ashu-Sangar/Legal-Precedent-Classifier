Mishoe recovered the maximum amount of coverage available to him under the other driver’s insurance policy, and then requested $600,000.00 in underinsured motorist benefits from his own insurer, Appellee Erie Insurance Company (“Erie”). Erie first offered to settle the matter for $75,000.00 and later increased its offer to $125,000.00. Dissatisfied with both of these offers, Mishoe invoked the arbitration provision in the insurance policy. The arbitrators awarded Mishoe $1,185,000.00, or about nine times the amount of Erie’s highest offer. Consequently, Mishoe sued Erie in the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County, claiming that Erie had acted in bad faith pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371. Mishoe demanded a jury trial, but the trial court struck the jury demand.</p>

In arriving at <em>our </em>conclusion that the foregoing language does not provide for the right to a jury trial, we relied on three criteria. First, we put substantial emphasis on the fact that the PHRA was silent regarding the right to a jury trial. <em>See <a href="/a2d/741/1272-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="741 A.2d 1272" data-case-ids="11658252,11658309,837196,837200" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/1272-01,/a2d/741/1272-02,/pa/559/0629-01,/pa/559/0630-01">id.</a> </em>As we explained, “the General Assembly is well aware of its ability to grant a jury trial in its legislative pronouncements,” and therefore, “we can presume that the General Assembly’s express granting of trial by jury in some enactments means that it did not intend to permit for a jury trial under the PHRA.” <em>Id.; cf. Hoy v. Angelone, </em><a href="/pa/554/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="554 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="765959" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0134-01">554 Pa. 134</a>, <a href="/a2d/720/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="720 A.2d 745" data-case-ids="11806154,765959" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0745-01,/pa/554/0134-01">720 A.2d 745</a>, 748 (1998) (the General Assembly’s use of specific language to permit punitive damages in numerous statutes reflects intention to allow such damages only when expressly provided). Second, we focused on the General Assembly’s use of the term “court” in the PHRA, which we stated was “strong evidence that under the PHRA, it is a tribunal, rather than a jury, that is to make findings and provide relief.” <em>Wertz, </em><a href="/a2d/741/1272-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="741 A.2d 1272" data-case-ids="11658252,11658309,837196,837200" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/1272-01,/a2d/741/1272-02,/pa/559/0629-01,/pa/559/0630-01">741 A.2d at 1274</a>.

We also note that if we were to accept Mishoe and Hamer’s "tradition” argument, we would be compelled to construe section 8371 as requiring some remedies to be awarded by a judge and others by a jury. This is because the first and third remedies provided by the statute, interest and costs and fees, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8371(1) and (3), are traditionally awarded by a judge, while the second remedy, punitive damages, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8371(2), is traditionally awarded by a jury. Thus, Mishoe and Hamer’s approach would create two simultaneous meanings for the term "court” within section 8371. Specifically, “court” would mean "judge” regarding the first and third remedies, but “court” would mean "jury” with regard to the second remedy. There is nothing in the text or history of section 8371, however, that supports the notion that the legislature intended to use "court” as some sort of verbal chameleon. <em>Cf.

In addition, Mishoe and Hamer’s approach ignores the overall context of section 8371, which presupposes a single meaning for the term “court." <em>See O’Rourke, </em><a href="/pa/566/0161-02" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="778 A.2d 1194" data-case-ids="706228,706273,706325,9497965,9497983,9498039" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0161-02,/pa/566/0160-01,/pa/566/0161-01,/a2d/778/1194-01,/a2d/778/1194-02,/a2d/778/1194-03">778 A.2d at 1201</a> (“we should not interpret statutory words in isolation, but must read them with reference to the context in which they appear”).</p>

I did not agree with the approach or conclusion in <em>Wertz, </em>as to both the question of statutory construction and the constitutional question, and I continue to believe what I expressed in dissent. I recognize that the insurance bad faith statute here, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371, is not the same statute as was at issue in <em>Wertz </em>and, thus, this case is not strictly controlled by <em>stare decisis. </em>Nevertheless, as the Majority accurately notes, the statutes are remarkably similar for purposes of the statutory interpretation issue presently facing the Court. Op. at 1156 (“the very factors that led us to conclude that there was no right to a jury trial in <em>Wertz </em>are also present in this case”). This is so much the case that, after careful consideration, I am convinced that there is an insufficient distinction between the two as to warrant distinction of, or departure from, <em>Wertz. </em>In addition, the approach to the constitutional question in <em>Wertz </em>was so very narrow, <em>see Wertz, </em><a href="/a2d/741/1272-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="741 A.2d 1272" data-case-ids="11658252,11658309,837196,837200" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/1272-01,/a2d/741/1272-02,/pa/559/0629-01,/pa/559/0630-01">741 A.2d at 1280-81</a> (Castille, <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>J., dissenting), that fidelity to the decision necessarily requires rejection of the constitutional claim raised here.</p>

Of course, we recognize the difficulty in ascertaining the General Assembly’s intent where the statute provides no express answer. However, we are secure in the knowledge that if we are mistaken as to the legislature’s intent, the General Assembly may simply amend the PHRA to realize any heretofore unstated legal right that it contemplated. <a href="/a2d/741/1272-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="741 A.2d 1272" data-case-ids="11658252,11658309,837196,837200" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/1272-01,/a2d/741/1272-02,/pa/559/0629-01,/pa/559/0630-01">741 A.2d at 1275</a>.

Indeed, the bulk of my dissent in <em>Wertz </em>was devoted to the state constitutional implications of the majority decision. Whether <em>Wertz </em>was right or wrong on the statutory construction question, I think it is important that our approach to these matters be consistent.

The circumstances under which a statute was enacted and legislative history are sometimes used to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(2), (7). Yet, the parties have not offered, and I have not found, any legislative history that would shed light on the availability of a jury trial in an action brought pursuant to section 8371 or evidence of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of section 8371. Therefore, the absence of relevant background as to the passing of section 8371 fails to advance the analysis. Moreover, there is a lack of former law and legislative and administrative interpretations of section 8371. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(5), (8). Thus, these factors do not aid in the determination of the issue before us.</p>

Finally, while the parties have weighed in on the significance of the General Assembly’s providing for the award of punitive damages, as it relates to the right to a jury trial, neither party has in a meaningful fashion addressed the effect of section 8371’s provision for interest and/or court costs and attorney fees against the insurer. Consistent with the recognition that the term "court” as used in section 8371 is capable of meaning judge or judge and jury, and becatxse a judge has traditionally awarded interest, costs, and fees, <em>Bata v. Central-Penn National Bank of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/448/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="146" data-cite="448 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1944697" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0355-01">448 Pa. 355</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=293%20A.2d%20343" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="293 A.2d 343">293 A.2d 343</a>, 356 n. 29 (1972), for purposes of section 8371, I would find that the Legislature intended for a judge to determine interest, court costs, and attorney fees. <em>The Birth Center, </em><a href="/a2d/727/1144-01" class="citation" data-index="148" data-cite="727 A.2d 1144" data-case-ids="11634346" data-case-paths="/a2d/727/1144-01">727 A.2d at </a>1160 n. 10; <em>Kehrer, </em><a href="/pa-d-c4th/25/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="149" data-cite="25 Pa.
