    <p id="b347-8" data-blocks='[["BL_347.8",347,[218,742,1156,581]]]'>This appeal presents a tax issue of first impression for this Court: whether a Pennsylvania corporation’s sales of goods to out-of-state purchasers, who retrieve the goods at the seller’s place of business in Pennsylvania and then transport the goods outside of Pennsylvania, should be included in the Pennsylvania corporation’s calculation of coiporate net income (“CNI”) tax under the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7101 <em>et seq. </em>For the reasons that follow, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue’s regulation, which treats such sales as in-state sales, is contrary to the Code and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b347-9" data-blocks='[["BL_347.9",347,[219,1347,1154,1008]]]'>This matter proceeded in Commonwealth Court based upon a stipulation of facts pursuant to Appellate Rule 1571(f). The stipulation constituted the entire record of the proceeding and thus the relevant facts are undisputed. Appellee, Gilmour Manufacturing Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, manufactures lawn and garden products at a facility in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. The parties agree that the products constitute tangible personal property. Gilmour sells its goods throughout the United States, most often shipping them to out-of-state purchasers through common carriers and paying the freight charges for the shipping. Some of Gilmour’s out-of-state customers, however, prefer to retrieve the products themselves at Gilmour’s Pennsylvania loading dock. Gilmour refers to these customer pick-up transactions as “dock sales,” for which Gilmour provides a freight allowance to its customers. Gilmour generally knows the destination to which its out-of-state “dock sale” customers transport the products. The proper tax treatment of Gilmour’s “dock sales” income is the issue before this Court.</p>

The apportionment formula is an arithmetic average of three factors, <em>i.e., </em>property, payroll and sales factors. As to each factor, the numerator represents business conducted within Pennsylvania and the denominator represents business conducted everywhere else. The property and payroll factors are not in dispute on this appeal; it is the sales factor, and more particularly the numerator of that factor <em>(i.e., </em>sales conducted in Pennsylvania), which is at issue.</p>

In its 1991 CNI tax report, Gilmour excluded its “dock sales” to out-of-state purchasers from its calculation of the numerator of its sales factor, considering those sales to be out-of-state. The Department of Revenue, however, disagreed with Gilmour’s calculations. Consistently with its interpretation of the relevant existing regulation, the Department recalculated Gilmour’s taxes to include as sales in Pennsylvania dock sales where out-of-state purchasers retrieved the goods themselves.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Gilmour’s out-of-state dock sales for 1991 totaled $2,385,362.

Under Gilmour’s reading, the phrase “within this state” modifies the immediately preceding word “purchaser” as to goods either “delivered” or “shipped.” Thus, a dock sale would be deemed in this state only if the purchaser was a Pennsylvania-based purchaser. Gilmour argued that goods purchased by out-of-state-based buyers and destined for out-of-state locations are out-of-state sales for purposes of the CNI tax, irrespective of whether the goods were delivered to the buyer in Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argued that the phrase “within this state” modified the word “delivered.” Under this construction, a dock sale would be deemed to have occurred within Pennsylvania if the purchaser actually took delivery here, irrespective of the home state of the purchaser or the destination to which the purchaser was taking the goods.</p>

Accordingly, the <em>Gilmour II </em>court entered judgment in favor of Gilmour in the amount of $17,912 plus interest.

Generally speaking, the best indication of legislative intent is the plain language of a statute. <em>See, e.g., Bowser v.

Since the regulation is neither clearly inconsistent with the Tax Code nor unreasonable, the Commonwealth argues, the Commonwealth Court erred in failing to defer to the Department and by substituting its own judgment. In addition, the Commonwealth argues that its “delivery rule” interpretation is sensible because the focus should be on the Pennsylvania taxpayer (here Gilmour), not on the buyer and, therefore, “completed sales” in Pennsylvania should be deemed sales within the state. The Commonwealth also notes that the delivery rule it advocates offers the added benefit of ease of administration, since it is “far simpler” to determine where physical delivery occurs than to ascertain the ultimate destination of goods once the goods leave the seller’s dock. Finally, the Commonwealth argues that the Commonwealth Court’s reliance upon decisions from other jurisdictions was misplaced.</p>

Gilmour also argues that the Commonwealth’s focus on the fact that the dock is located in Pennsylvania ignores the statutory mandate to ignore delivery or f.o.b. terms. Finally, Gilmour argues that the statute should properly be understood as establishing a “destination test” because weighting the sales factor in favor of the out-of-state contribution to gross income acts as a counterbalance to the fact that the other two factors involved in computing the CNI tax, <em>ie., </em>property and payroll, are “biased” the other way, in favor of in-state activity.</p>

After careful consideration, we agree with the <em>Gilmour II </em>court’s holding and reasoning. The <em>Gilmour II </em>court found that the phrase “within this State” modifies the immediately preceding word “purchaser,” and thus only sales to Pennsylvania purchasers are includable in the numerator of the sales factor for CNI tax purposes. Viewing the plain language of the statutory provision in a common sense fashion, we agree that, as a matter of basic sentence construction, the phrase “within this State” was intended to modify the immediately preceding word “purchaser.” This logical construction of the statute also gives effect <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>to all of its terms, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a), including the term “shipped” and the concluding remonstration that the “f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale,” which obviously could encompass delivery terms, are not to be deemed controlling. Moreover, if the General Assembly had intended “within this state” to modify “delivered,” as urged by the Commonwealth, the statute could have been drafted to accomplish that purpose simply by omitting the misplaced comma and inserting the phrase immediately after the word “delivered.” Notably, however, that would have required the General Assembly to deviate significantly from the language it obviously adopted from the UDITPA. The statute would then read as follows given the above:</p>
    <blockquote id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[245,1020,1112,194]]]'>Sales of tangible personal property are in this State if the property is delivered within this State or shipped to a purchaser within this State, regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale.</blockquote>

The problem with the statute as written is that, using the rules of grammar, as we must, one cannot easily ascertain what actions (the verbs) or what parties (the nouns) the phrase “within this State” modifies or references. Since we must apply the rules of grammar and since we must construe the taxing statute in favor of the taxpayer, then Gilmour must, perforce, prevail.</p>
