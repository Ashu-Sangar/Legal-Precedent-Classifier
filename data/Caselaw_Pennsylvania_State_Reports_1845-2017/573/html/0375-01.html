Following a plea colloquy, the trial court accepted Appellant’s plea and held a degree-of-guilt hearing. Following the degree-of-guilt hearing, the trial court found Appellant guilty of first-degree murder. Prior to sentencing, Appellant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On October 10, 1997, the trial court denied the motion and sentenced Appellant to life in prison. Appellant, represented by new appointed counsel (“appellate counsel”), filed timely post-sentence motions, in which he argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred in refusing to allow Appellant to withdraw his guilty plea and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to develop a complete defense in spite of Appellant’s desire to proceed to trial. Following an evidentiary hearing at which trial counsel testified, the trial court denied the post-sentence motions. The Superior Court affirmed Appellant’s judgment of sentence on March 5, 1999.

      <em>Daniels </em>makes clear that under Rule 122, Appellant is entitled to the assistance of counsel through his discretionary appeal to this Court on direct appeal. We have previously concluded that an appellant’s rule-based right to counsel, such as the one at issue here, permits this Court to review an ineffectiveness claim based on that right brought pursuant to the PCRA. In <em>Commonwealth v. Albrecht, </em>the appellant claimed that his PCRA counsel had been ineffective for filing a brief in which counsel explicitly waived most of the seventy-two issues raised by the appellant’s former PCRA counsel in his amended PCRA petition. <em>Albrecht, </em><a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">720 A.2d at 698-99</a>. Employing a similar analysis to that adopted by the PCRA court in the instant case, the Commonwealth essentially argued in <em>Albrecht </em>that the appellant’s claim was not cognizable under the PCRA because the appellant had no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in post-conviction proceedings. <em><a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">at 699</a>. In rejecting that argument, this Court stated: “Though we agree with the [Commonwealth’s] argument regarding the scope of the Sixth Amendment, we have never found our power to review, and if necessary, remedy the deficiencies of counsel at the post-conviction stage circumscribed by the parameters of the Sixth Amendment.” <em><a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">Id.</a> </em>(citation omitted). We then found that, although the appellant had no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in post-conviction proceedings, he certainly had a right, based on Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>Procedure 904,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> to the assistance of counsel to prepare and litigate his PCRA petition. Such a right, we reiterated, necessarily included the concomitant right to the <em>effective </em>assistance of counsel. <em><a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">at 700</a>.

      <em>Id,, </em>at 572 (footnote omitted and emphasis added). We reasoned that counsel’s unjustified failure to perfect a requested appeal is the functional equivalent of having absolutely no representation at all on direct appeal, a clear violation of the federal and state constitutional right to counsel, and that where this occurs, there is no need for the appellant to show the merits of the underlying issues he would have raised on appeal. <em>See <a href="/a2d/736/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="736 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="11575941,838560" data-case-paths="/a2d/736/0564-01,/pa/558/0214-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/736/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="736 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="11575941,838560" data-case-paths="/a2d/736/0564-01,/pa/558/0214-01">at 571</a>.</p>

According to the Commonwealth, because Appellant has no right to allowance of appeal, he must, in essence, show that his underlying claims were deserving of this Court’s review in order to show that his counsel’s inaction “undermined the truth-determining pro<a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>cess.” This argument, however, confuses the “right” to allowance of appeal with the right to <em>file </em>a petition for allowance of appeal. The Commonwealth properly points out that there is no right to allowance of appeal in this Court. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1114 (“[R]eview of a final order of the Superior Court ... [by this Court] is <em>not a matter of </em>right&gt; but of sound judicial discretion, and an appeal will be allowed only when there are special and important reasons therefor.” (emphasis added)) Nonetheless, provided that appellate counsel believes that the claims that a petitioner would raise in a PAA to this Court would not be completely frivolous, a petitioner certainly has a right to file such a petition to this Court. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1112 (“An appeal may be taken by allowance ... from any final order of the Superior Court[,]” and allowance for such appeal “may be sought by filing a petition for allowance of appeal” with this Court "within the required time limit). Indeed, only by doing so can a petitioner avail himself of the opportunity to have this Court at least consider whether his claims warrant our review and if so, whether those claims ultimately entitle him to relief.</p>
    <p id="b586-5" data-blocks='[["BL_586.4",586,[229,1420,1164,848]]]'>In light of this right to file a PAA to this Court, and given Appellant’s rule-based right to the effective assistance of counsel through his discretionary appeal to this Court on direct appeal, we disagree with the Commonwealth’s assertion that <em>Lantzy </em>is inapplicable here. Rather, we find the reasoning of <em>Lantzy </em>equally persuasive in the circumstances presented by this case. Here, appellate counsel readily admitted that he simply failed to file a PAA on Appellant’s behalf, after promising that he would do so. Such a failure cannot be regarded as anything less than providing Appellant with <em>no </em>representation at all on that PAA, a clear violation of Appellant’s rule-based right to counsel. Similar to Lantzy, we find that such a wholesale denial of counsel sufficiently establishes that the truth-determining process has been undermined, rendering a showing that this Court would have granted review on Appellant’s underlying claims unnecessary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Thus, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand the matter to the PCRA court to consider, consistent with this opinion, Appellant’s claim that he is entitled to file a PAA to this Court <em>nunc pro tunc.</em>
