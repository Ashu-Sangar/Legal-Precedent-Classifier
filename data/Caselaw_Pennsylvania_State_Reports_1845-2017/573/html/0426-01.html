In addition, the trial court ruled that appellant was a high-risk, dangerous offender pursuant to the then-governing provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714. Accordingly, the trial court sentenced appellant to consecutive terms of 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment on the rape conviction and 10 to 20 years’ imprisonment on the kidnapping conviction. The trial court also sentenced appellant to 1 to 2 years’ consecutive imprisonment on the abuse of corpse conviction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

The car’s engine was still running, the driver’s side door was open, the radio was playing and the interior lights and headlights were on. There was a rough abrasion on the back bumper of the victim’s car. There was a pool of blood on the ground in front of the vehicle with drops of blood leading away from it. A tire iron was located near the pool of blood. Later that morning, police discovered a pair of sneakers and a pair of female underpants with a sanitary pad near the abandoned car. The sneakers were later identified as belonging to the victim and the underpants were later identified as the size worn by the victim. Hairs found on the sanitary pad were consistent with the pubic hairs of the victim. The police also obtained tire impressions from the scene.</p>

That evening, investigators from the Delaware County Criminal Investigation Division (CID) questioned appellant concerning the Willard murder. Appellant told the investigators, among other things, that he drove a 1993 Ford Escort until March of 1997, that he had been to the same bar that the victim had been to on the night of June 19, 1996, previously with a former girlfriend, and that he routinely traveled on Interstate 476.</p>

Rumer told the troopers that appellant had confessed to her that he murdered Aimee Willard. She told police that appellant related the following events to her: Appellant observed Aimee leave the bar, get into her car, and begin to drive away. He followed in his own car. Appellant stopped Aimee’s car on Interstate 476 and flashed a fake police badge. When Aimee asked why she was being stopped, appellant told her that she was swerving on the road. Aimee then became angry, at which point appellant punched her, knocking her unconscious. After placing the victim in his car, appellant drove to an abandoned building. Appellant took the victim’s clothes, placed them in a trash bag and threw them away. Appellant hit the victim’s head with a hard object and killed her.

The police seized and removed the following articles: the left front tire of the vehicle, a Firestone FR440 P17570R13; the oil pan from the undercarriage of the vehicle; and the right front door panel, which contained several brownish spots that later tested positive for blood. The tire taken from appellant’s car was consistent in tread design, size, and wear pattern with the tire impressions taken from the area where the victim’s car was found abandoned. The repeating cross-rectangle shape features, the vertical lines, and the machined edge present on the oil pan taken from appellant’s vehicle matched the pattern injury on the right side of the victim’s body. Most significantly, deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) testing of the bloodstains on the door panel indicated that Aimee Willard was a contributor to the stains.</p>

O’Donald was placed on the same cellblock as appellant for approximately two weeks in July. On July 17, 1997, while appellant was in O’Donald’s cell, appellant told him, “if I had disposed of the body, there would be no problem,” and “no body, no Grand Jury indictment.” In addition, appellant stated that, “if everyone does what I tell them, I’ll be alright.” Later that day, while O’Donald was in appellant’s cell, appellant stated, “I grabbed the bitch and she said please don’t do this.” He told <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>O’Donald that he then said to the victim, “I’ll do whatever the fuck I want, just shut up,” to which she replied, “just don’t kill me, I’ll do anything.” Appellant told O’Donald that at that point, “we did whatever we wanted with her, she did whatever we told, and when we were done, I almost took her head off, and we crammed a tree branch up her cunt.”</p>

The Sergeant further testified that he informed appellant that, regardless of whether appellant was aware of his constitutional rights, he nonetheless had to advise him of his complete <em>Miranda </em>rights and that he then proceeded to recite the warnings in then-entirety from the beginning. Sergeant Keenan testified that he asked appellant if he understood the warnings and appellant answered that he did, at which point Sergeant -Keenan began to question appellant concerning the criminal trespass then under investigation.

The relevant facts concerning these statements, as determined by the suppression court, are as follows: On October 14,1997, a judge of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas ordered the Superintendent of SCI-Camp Hill, the prison where appellant was incarcerated, to release appellant to the custody of CID Detectives John Easton and Joseph O’Berg the following day for transportation to the offices of the CID for the purpose of a “hearing.” On the morning of October 15, 1997, Detectives Easton and O’Berg and Trooper Tedescung Bandy of the Pennsylvania State Police arrived at Camp Hill to transport appellant. Appellant was informed that the reason he was being taken to Delaware County was so that he could be questioned concerning the Willard murder. Appellant agreed to accompany the police. Upon appellant’s arrival at the CID offices, Chief John McKenna of the CID orally advised appellant of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Appellant orally indicated that he understood each right. When he was asked whether, knowing these rights, he was willing to discuss what he knew about the Willard murder, he replied that he was, and that he wanted to clear his name. Appellant answered the officers’ questions until he was asked whether he <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>ever had sexual intercourse with Aimee Willard. At that point, appellant became upset and stated that he was not going to answer the question. The trial court suppressed this response and the statements made by appellant after the invocation of rights. Appellant’s statements to the police prior to the invocation, however, were admitted into evidence. <em>See </em>Trial Court slip op. at 25-26.</p>
    <p id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[221,713,1162,1113]]]'>Appellant challenges the admission of those statements which were admitted on two grounds. First, appellant argues that the procedure employed by law enforcement officials to secure his transfer to the CID offices for questioning violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Appellant asserts that members of the CID had previously attempted to question him while he was incarcerated at the Montgomery County Prison. Appellant, however, refused to meet with them and became agitated and indicated that he would prefer to spend time in 24-hour lockup rather than meet with the detectives. Appellant asserts that the CID investigators concluded that he had to be removed from prison in order for them to have any chance of obtaining inculpatory statements from him. Accordingly, he contends that the Commonwealth falsely represented to the trial court that appellant’s presence was required at a hearing—when, in fact, no hearing was scheduled—to obtain an order authorizing appellant’s release to the custody of CID detectives. Appellant asserts that “[t]his is the type of offensive governmental action that the Fourth Amendment was directed against and the exclusionary doctrine designed to deter.” Brief of Appellant at 15-16.

Appellant, however, does not cite to any record evidence, nor have we identified any, supporting his assertion that the error in the order was the result of false representations or other intentional wrongdoing on the part of the Commonwealth. In fact, at the suppression hearing, the prosecution characterized the error in the court’s order as a <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>“mistake” or “oversight.” N.T. 07/24/1998 at 86-87.

At the time appellant was moved to Delaware County, he was already a prisoner serving time on unrelated charges; he was already unquestionably “seized” for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. The only change in appellant’s status that occurred on October 15th was the location of his custody. The transfer from jail to the CID offices in Delaware County did not constitute a separate seizure of appellant under the Fourth Amendment for the obvious reason that he was already lawfully in custody. <em>See Commonwealth v. Watkins, </em><a href="/a2d/750/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="750 A.2d 308" data-case-ids="11525478" data-case-paths="/a2d/750/0308-01">750 A.2d 308</a> (Pa.Super.2000) (transfer of defendant from jail where he was serving time for drug offense to police station for questioning concerning unrelated homicide did not implicate rights under Fourth Amendment). Furthermore, appellant was not misled regarding the true purpose of his transfer. The police specifically informed appellant that they would be transporting him to the CID offices to discuss the Willard murder and appellant expressly agreed to go with them. Moreover, we are aware of no decision, and certainly appellant cites none, for the proposition that procedural irregularities in the transfer of a prisoner may be the basis for suppressing an otherwise lawful confession on Fourth Amendment grounds. Indeed, the notion of offensive or outrageous governmental conduct, not involving a seizure, sounds under due process, not the Fourth Amendment.</p>

Trial counsel testified that, when he interviewed Ms. Ganges, she appeared to him to have no independent recollection of appellant driving her to the doctor’s office on the morning of June 20, 1996, or of any other events on that day, and that he was concerned that she would not fare well under cross-examination by the Commonwealth. N.T. 3/4/1999 at 111-12. In addition, trial counsel testified that because Ms. Ganges was appellant’s mother, he felt that the jury would view her as biased in favor of her son and not credible, particularly since there was no evidence that corroborated her story. <em>Id. </em>at 113. Further, trial counsel believed that Ms. Ganges’s testimony might actually lend credence to, rather than cast doubt upon, the Commonwealth’s theory that appellant returned to the scene of the crime later in the morning of June 20, and placed the victim’s sneakers and panties at the scene. Trial counsel reasoned that there was no physical evidence or any eyewitnesses that conclusively placed appellant at the crime scene later in the morning of June 20th, and that introducing evidence to rebut the Commonwealth’s theory would lead the jury to conclude that the theory was more compelling than it in reality was. <em>Id. </em>at 113-14. Trial counsel also testified that Ms. Ganges had repeatedly indicated to him that she believed the prosecution of her son was tantamount to a lynching, and that he was concerned that, if called to testify, she would express these personal views, which would alienate the jury and hinder the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 120. This concern proved well-founded in light of Ms. Ganges <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>testimony at the penalty phase in which, among other things, she accused the trial prosecutor of being a liar, a cheat, and a disgrace to the court, and asserted that the jury had not followed the evidence and that its guilty verdict was racially motivated.

Trial counsel had a private investigator look into Ms. Powell’s story and the investigator determined that Powell knew Gilda Drummond, a member of appellant’s extended family. <em>See </em>N.T. 4/20/1999 at 53-54. In addition, the investigator was unable to corroborate Ms. Powell’s alleged observations through any other source. <em>See </em>N.T. 3/4/1999 at 88, 208. In light of Ms. Powell’s connection to appellant’s family, and the fact that her testimony could not be corroborated, trial counsel concluded that she would not be a helpful witness. This was a reasonable strategic decision by counsel. Further, we are more than satisfied that appellant was not prejudiced by the absence of Ms. Powell’s testimony. Ms. Powell testified at the post-sentence evidentiary hearings that she did not see the object that was dumped by the white male on the morning of June 20, 1996, because it was covered by a white sheet. N.T. 4/20/1999 at 158. She did testify, however, that it measured only approximately three and one-half feet in length. <em>Id. </em>at 161. Tellingly, Ms. Powell further testified that she was alone at the time she made her observations. <em>Id. </em>at 181. It is highly unlikely that the vague, uncorroborated testimony of a person acquainted with a member of appellant’s family that she saw an unidentified white male dump an unknown object much shorter in length than the victim at a vacant lot where people frequently leave trash and debris would have been even marginally helpful to appellant’s defense—especially when his own statements and DNA tied him to the offense.

Dr. Cook informed trial counsel that appellant could possibly have a “cognitive disorder,” which would support a defense of diminished capacity at trial, but that further testing was required to confirm this diagnosis. Thereafter, on May 1, 1998, trial counsel discussed the possibility of pursuing a defense of diminished capacity with appellant. Trial counsel explained the defense to appellant and also explained to him that in order to effectively pursue this defense, appellant would have to undergo additional neuropsychological testing. Appellant, who had some significant experience with the criminal justice system, responded that he was not interested in a defense that would, at best, merely reduce an inevitable homicide conviction to third-degree murder. In addition, he stated that his mental state was irrelevant to the case because he did not kill Aimee Willard and that he would not cooperate with further psychological testing. <em>See </em>N.T. 3/4/1999 at 136-37. Shortly prior to trial, counsel again discussed the possibility of pursuing a diminished capacity defense with appellant, and appellant reiterated that he would not pursue this defense and was unwilling to submit to the additional psychological testing necessary to effectively present it. <em>See id. </em>at 149-51.

In <em>Hughes, </em>the appellant was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights from a standard police interrogation card and he orally indicated that he understood each right. The police then asked Hughes whether he wished to give up these rights and talk with the officers. Hughes responded that he did not know what this was all about. The police then informed him that they were investigating a double murder and robbery and proceeded to question him regarding these crimes. Hughes answered the questions and his statements were admitted at his trial. On appeal, Hughes alleged that because he did not expressly waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to the officers’ interrogation, his statements should have been suppressed under the Pennsylvania Constitution. This Court held that Hughes’ rights under the Pennsylvania Constitution were not violated. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice (now Chief Justice) Cappy reasoned as follows:</p>

Although the test for ineffectiveness in Pennsylvania is the same as <em>Strickland’s </em>two-part performance and prejudice standard, in application this Court has come to characterize the test as a tripartite one, by dividing the performance element into two distinct parts, <em>i.e., </em>arguable merit and lack of reasonable basis. <em>Busanet, </em><a href="/pa/572/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="208" data-cite="817 A.2d 1060" data-case-ids="716441,9368884" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0535-01,/a2d/817/1060-01">817 A.2d 1060</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2031846306" class="citation" data-index="209" data-cite="2002 WL 31846306">2002 WL 31846306</a>, at *3 n. 11; <em>Jones, </em><a href="/pa/571/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="210" data-cite="811 A.2d 994" data-case-ids="1070135,1070144,9318906,9319023" data-case-paths="/pa/571/0112-01,/pa/571/0112-02,/a2d/811/0994-01,/a2d/811/0994-02">811 A.2d at </a>1003 n. 7.</p>

Mr. Justice Saylor holds the view that, when faced with a client who is not cooperating in critical aspects of trial preparation in a capital case, trial counsel has an obligation to apprise the trial court at the earliest opportunity to enlist the court’s direction and assistance. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b681-5" data-blocks='[["BL_681.7",681,[257,631,1155,1021]]]'>Although I fully agree with the majority that the “bring-down” order was undoubtedly erroneous, I cannot agree with the majority’s seemingly dismissive approach to the <em>misuse </em>of that erroneous order. To that end, the majority notes that Appellant does not cite to any evidence of record establishing that the error in the order was anything other than a mere “mistake” or “oversight.” While that may be true, it still remains that the order only authorized the transfer of Appellant <em>for a hearing </em>and not for what it was ultimately used for-the questioning of Appellant regarding the Willard case. In my view, the Commonwealth should simply not be allowed to use a court order for one purpose when that order explicitly authorizes its use only for a different purpose. <em>See Commonwealth v.
