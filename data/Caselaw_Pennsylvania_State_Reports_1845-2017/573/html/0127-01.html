Furthermore, the trial court held that the District Attorney committed an abuse of discretion when she did not detail her reasons for disapproving the private criminal complaints. Finding that the evidence established that there was a <em>prima facie </em>case for charges of third degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and other related offenses, the trial court directed the District Attorney to approve Appellant’s complaints and file charges against Hickson and Martinez.</p>

She argued that she had recently learned that Appellant intended to run for the office of district attorney of Philadelphia at the next election, and was pursuing the complaints against Hickson and Martinez in order to advance his own political career. Also, the District Attorney alleged that Appellant had a personal financial interest in the matter as he had entered into a contingent fee agreement with members of Griffin’s family with regard to any recovery the Griffin family received in a civil lawsuit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The District Attorney alleged that such motivations were inherently improper, and militated that the complaints should be disapproved.

In the alternative, Judge Johnson posited that even if standing were a requirement, the individual who sought judicial review of a district attorney’s decision to disapprove a private criminal complaint filed by that individual would indeed have standing.

Throughout his dissent, Judge Johnson indicated his concern over the majority’s recognition that the victim, the victim’s family, or personal representative have a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in seeing the alleged perpetrators brought to trial, an interest distinct from and more significant than that held by a member of the general public. In his opinion, such a holding was grossly misguided as “a victim has no greater interest in the prosecution of a criminal than does any other member of the public.” <em><a href="/a2d/765/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="765 A.2d 372" data-case-ids="11075753" data-case-paths="/a2d/765/0372-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/765/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="765 A.2d 372" data-case-ids="11075753" data-case-paths="/a2d/765/0372-01">at 385</a>.</p>

It is axiomatic that those most likely to be affected by a crime will be the victim himself or his relatives. It may even be quite rare that an individual outside this group would be able to meet the standing test. Yet, unlike the <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>Superior Court below, we do not find it prudent to limit standing artificially to this group of people. Rather, it is possible that other individuals who are not related to the victim may be able to show that the crime visited upon them a substantial, direct and immediate injury.</p>
    <p id="b341-5" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[216,611,1154,1052]]]'>We now turn to applying this test to Appellant. First, we note that Appellant does not allege that he is related to Griffin. Yet, as noted <em>supra, </em>this is not dispositive of the issue; rather, we must analyze whether Appellant has alleged facts that establish that he has been personally aggrieved by Griffin’s death. We find that he has failed to meet this standard. First, he has not established any peculiar, individualized interest in the outcome of the litigation that is greater than that of any other citizen. Thus, his interest is not “substantial”. <em>See Bergdoll, supra. </em>Furthermore, Appellant cannot show that Griffin’s death harmed him personally in any fashion; thus, Appellant has no “direct” interest. <em>Id. </em>Finally, as Appellant cannot show that Griffin’s death harmed him in any particular manner, he cannot show that he had an “immediate” interest. <em>Id. </em>As Appellant has no direct, substantial, or immediate interest in seeking review of the District Attorney’s disapproval of the private criminal complaints filed against Hickson and Martinez, we find that the Superior Court properly denied Appellant relief on the basis that he lacked standing in this matter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

We acknowledge that in civil matters, we allow, in rare instances, a citizen to litigate a matter in which he has no substantial, direct, and immediate interest.
