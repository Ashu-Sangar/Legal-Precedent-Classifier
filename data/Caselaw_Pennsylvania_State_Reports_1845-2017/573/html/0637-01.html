In spite of repeated attempts to reach an amicable end to the lease, Summit consistently refused to allow Shoe Show to terminate its operations. Meanwhile, Shoe Show’s financial shortfalls from its operations at the Centre began to mount, as it lost $98,280 in fiscal year 1998 and $108,846 in fiscal year 1999. Consequently, on or about January 4, 2000, Shoe Show notified Summit that it intended to vacate the premises, yet simultaneously pledged to continue its payment of the base rent required by the lease agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Summit responded that Shoe Show was obligated by the agreement to keep the store open.</p>

Shoe Show responded with a witness of its own in support of its contentions that Summit’s claim, at bottom, was for monetary damages and thus could be remedied at law, and that the balance of harms favored Shoe Show because it would have lost a projected $121,906 in fiscal year 2000 and would have been faced with $272,913 in costs to reopen the closed Centre location.</p>

Specifically, Shoe Show argues that the Superior Court was bound to affirm the trial court’s order unless it found that the trial court abused its discretion. Such was not the case here, according to Shoe Show, because the trial court properly found that Summit had failed to present any evidence of irreparable harm, and instead presented only speculative and uncorroborated claims. On the other hand, Shoe Show points out that it proved to the trial court that it would have sustained substantial financial harm had an injunction been entered. Thus, Shoe Show avers, the trial court’s decision had a reasonable basis and should have been affirmed by the Superior Court. Shoe Show claims that the Superior Court instead conducted what amounted to an improper <em>de novo </em>review of the record, and in doing so, erroneously credited the testimony of Summit’s witness after the trial court had rejected that testimony as speculative. Shoe Show therefore contends that the Superior Court’s order must be reversed. We agree.</p>

Shoe Show filed a preliminary objection to Summit’s complaint, arguing that Summit was not entitled to equitable relief because it had an adequate remedy at law in damages. As the matter proceeded solely on Summit’s petition for a preliminary injunction, however, the trial court did not dispose of Shoe Show’s preliminary objection. We likewise take no position regarding the underlying equity complaint.</p>

Although Summit correctly points out that the lease agreement allows Summit to pursue equitable remedies in-addition to liquidated damages, and also appears to be correct that the lease agreement's "use” provision is a material term, the parties' agreement in this case cannot supplant the legal restriction that a preliminary injunction is not available where damages provide an adequate remedy. Additionally, we refuse to consider Summit's claim that injunctive relief is necessary for it to enforce similar leases, as we cannot speculate regarding future cases that may offer different factual circumstances.</p>

Summit contends, and the Superior Court concluded, that it was inappropriate for the trial court to consider Shoe Show’s reopening costs because such expenses were caused solely by Shoe Show’s "wrongful” departure from the Centre. <em>See <a href="/a2d/786/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="786 A.2d 240" data-case-ids="9454401" data-case-paths="/a2d/786/0240-01">786 </a></em><a href="/a2d/786/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="786 A.2d 240" data-case-ids="9454401" data-case-paths="/a2d/786/0240-01">A.2d at 246</a> ("any losses sustained by [Shoe Show! to re-open the store would result from their [sic] own desertion”). We, however, reject the notion that the trial court was not permitted to consider Shoe Show’s reopening costs, as Summit was notified on or about January 4, 2000 of Shoe Show’s imminent departure, yet did not promptly seek an order in equity to prevent its occurrence. Rather, Summit waited until over six weeks had elapsed and Shoe Show had long departed to file its petition for a preliminary injunction on February 17, 2000. Thus, as Summit failed to take swift action in an attempt to prevent Shoe Show’s departure, it cannot now complain that the natural consequences of that departure were considered in the trial court’s equity calculus. <em>See, e.g., Barnes &amp; Tucker Co. </em>v. <em>Bird Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/334/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="334 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1190792" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0324-01">334 Pa. 324</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20146" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="5 A.2d 146">5 A.2d 146</a>, 150 (1939) ("equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber upon their rights”).</p>

In addition to the Superior Court’s failure to abide by the applicable standard of review, we are also troubled by the Superior Court's failure to even acknowledge that its reversal of the trial court order was the equivalent of granting a mandatory preliminary injunction, an extraordinary remedy that should be utilized only in the rarest of cases. <em>See Mazzie v.
