After attacking several young men, Appellee and others from his group, caught up with Eddie Polec (Polec) at the St. Cecelia’s Roman Catholic Church, where Polec fell on the ground, as he attempted to escape from the gang. Appellee struck Polec in the head and then lifted him off the ground by the belt and collar. As Appellee held Polec in the air, one of his cohorts used a baseball bat to deliver additional blows to Polec’s head. Other members of the gang also hit and kicked Polec in the head. The next morning, Polec died from multiple head trauma inflicted in the beating.</p>

The PCRA Court dismissed this petition as untimely and Appellee sought review with the Superior Court, arguing that previous PCRA counsel was ineffective for withdrawing the first petition. The Superi- or Court reversed the PCRA Court and remanded for an evidentiary hearing, holding that, due to the “unique procedural posture” of the case, the second, untimely petition should be treated as an amended first petition. The Commonwealth filed a petition for reconsideration, which the Superior Court denied. Thereafter, the Commonwealth sought allowance of appeal, which we granted. For the following reasons, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court.</p>

Therefore, unless he could demonstrate that one of the exceptions outlined in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1) applied, Appellee had until January 15, 1999, to file all PCRA petitions for post-conviction relief.

Instead, approximately eleven months after withdrawing his initial petition, well past the one-year time limit mandated by the PCRA, he filed the latest PCRA petition. The Superi- or Court treated this new petition as an amended first petition, “based upon the unique procedural posture of this case <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>and the fact [Appelleej’s first counseled PCRA petition was effectively withdrawn without prejudice.” <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b710-5" data-blocks='[["BL_710.5",710,[221,727,1161,744]]]'>As previously stated, this Court has consistently upheld and repeatedly noted the jurisdictional nature of the PCRA time requirement. <em>See, e.g., Murray; Fahy; Lark. </em>Indeed, in <em>Fahy, </em>we specifically held that the PCRA “jurisdictional time limitation is not subject to equitable principles such as tolling____” <em>Fahy, </em><a href="/a2d/737/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="737 A.2d 214" data-case-ids="11567898,838539" data-case-paths="/a2d/737/0214-01,/pa/558/0313-01">737 A.2d at 222</a>. Accordingly, we reject the instant attempt by the Superior Court to circumvent the PCRA time-bar by treating the second PCRA petition as an amendment to the first petition, where, as here, the second petition was filed after the expiration of the PCRA filing deadline. Moreover, we note that the Superior Court ignored the fact that the petition was withdrawn and, therefore, there was nothing pending before the PCRA court that Appellee could “amend.”</p>
