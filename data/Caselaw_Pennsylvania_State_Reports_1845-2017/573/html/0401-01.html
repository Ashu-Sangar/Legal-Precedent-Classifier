As such, the Department contends that it is among its essential functions to inquire as to whether cost estimates have, in fact, been obtained by the local government where there is a material, factual dispute in this regard.

The choice, instead, lies in the administrative authority of the Department as it reviews citizen complaints under the purview of regulations properly promulgated under the authority and jurisdiction granted by the General Assembly....

At oral argument, however, the County agreed with the Department that there is little justification in the Debt Act to support a fraud threshold to Department hearings. The County maintained, nonetheless, that it is important for this Court to reaffirm that debt proceedings should be protected from unfettered interference by the Department or disgruntled taxpayers.</p>
    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[198,1027,1155,892]]]'>As noted, the Debt Act establishes controls over a local government which seeks to incur indebtedness on bonds or notes. <em>See </em>53 Pa.C.S. § 8001(d). The enactment requires disclosure to ensure lawfulness and public notice, while at the same time constraining administrative agency review in deference to the discretion of a local government body to pursue major projects in furtherance of the public interest. <em>See Borough of Brentwood, </em><a href="/a2d/657/1025-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="657 A.2d 1025" data-case-ids="11942479" data-case-paths="/a2d/657/1025-01">657 A.2d at </a>1027 n. 5. The realistic cost estimate requirement represents one restrained mechanism fashioned by the General Assembly to ensure the requisite fiscal responsibility without unnecessary intrusion. <em>See </em>53 Pa.C.S. § 8006. “Such pre-planning, it has been found, enables a local government unit to have a reasonable idea as to costs and avoid the inevitable misunderstandings that arise when construction bids are received.” Local Government Commission, Report to the General Assembly and Draft of Local Government Unit Debt Act, at 6 ¶ 6 (Jan. 1972).</p>

Indeed, at hearing, Complainants succeeded in establishing that the statutory requirement had not been observed by Council. The fact that the County was not required by the statute to affirmatively include the cost estimates in its submission to the Department merely suggests that the General <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>Assembly did not see the need to include them as an element of a local government’s <em>prima facie </em>case for approval, thus placing the burden on complainants to establish that cost estimates were not in fact obtained. The absence of a reference to cost estimates from among Section 8111’s submission requirements does not suggest that the Legislature intended to shield local government units from any scrutiny regarding compliance with the statutory cost estimate requirement. The Department’s express jurisdiction and authority to hear and determine all procedural and substantive matters arising from debt proceedings, <em>see </em>53 Pa.C.S. § 8211(d), plainly subsumes the ability to conduct an evidentiary hearing to address a material factual controversy in this regard.</p>
    <p id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.4",612,[239,1016,1161,624]]]'>Further, on review, it is clear that the requirement of a well-pleaded averment of fraud as a prerequisite to a Department hearing unduly restricts taxpayers’ ability to question, and the Department’s ability to ensure, compliance with procedural and substantive provisions of the statute. The Department is also correct in its summary of the derivation of the fraud requirement. Indeed, that in each of the cases cited by the Commonwealth Court the Department had determined that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary suggests that the Department gives heed in practice to the accurate understanding of its role in debt proceedings as detailed in its briefing before this Court.</p>
    <p id="b612-5" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[237,1673,1161,683]],["BL_613.1",613,[203,317,1153,151]]]'>In summary, neither the Debt Act nor its supporting regulations requires a well-pleaded averment of fraud as an essential predicate to an evidentiary hearing in debt proceedings. To the extent that the Commonwealth Court’s decisions in <em>Simonetti; Borough of Brentwood </em>and <em>County of Northampton </em>interject such a requirement, those decisions are disapproved. We hold that the Department has jurisdiction and authority under the Debt Act and its associated administrative regulations to conduct evidentiary hearings to resolve material factual controversies arising from procedural and substantive matters within the purview of the Act. While such hearings are to be avoided where possible and should not be invoked to unnecessarily hinder legitimate debt undertakings, nothing <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>presented here suggests that the restrictions embodied in the Act and the regulations are insufficient to maintain the essential balance that was intended by the Legislature.</p>

In opposition to the dismissal, the Department asserted that the Commonwealth Court’s published opinion unduly constrains its ability to conduct its essential, statutory review function. The Court denied the motion to dismiss by Order dated March 13, 2003.</p>
