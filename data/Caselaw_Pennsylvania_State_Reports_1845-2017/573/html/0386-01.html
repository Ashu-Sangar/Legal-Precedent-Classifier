The Commonwealth Court held that the payment of IOD benefits is not the workers’ compensation equivalent of an employer issuing a notice of compensation payable (“NCP”) and, for that reason, held that the City could properly challenge the petition for benefits. We affirm the Commonwealth Court’s determination that the City properly could challenge the petition for benefits, albeit on different grounds than those specified by the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b590-4" data-blocks='[["BL_590.4",590,[232,769,1165,890]]]'>The facts pertinent to the legal issue before this Court are undisputed. The Workers’ Compensation Judge (“WCJ”) found the following facts: Appellant was employed as a police officer with the City of Philadelphia. She was assigned as a Captain’s Aide, which required her to perform clerical work, although she could at any time be assigned to patrol duty. On February 14, 1995, appellant left work at approximately 6:30 p.m., got into her own private automobile while still wearing her uniform shirt under an open leather jacket, and drove to her home. As appellant pulled her car into the driveway that she shared with the adjoining house, she noticed a black male enter the driveway, proceed to the gates behind her and begin tampering with the locks on the gates. Appellant remained in her car with the window halfway down. Becoming suspicious, she turned toward her pocketbook to retrieve her handgun. When she turned from her pocketbook, the man was at her car window.</p>
    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[229,1692,1164,687]],["BL_591.1",591,[235,331,1153,150]]]'>Appellant asked the man what he was doing in her yard and told him to leave. The man responded that he wanted to ask appellant a question. Without warning, he punched appellant in the face and reached into the car and grabbed one handle of appellant’s pocketbook. Appellant held onto the other handle of the pocketbook because her gun, which was not her service revolver but was a personal weapon, was still in the pocketbook. The car door opened, and appellant struggled with the man and fell to the ground. Appellant’s pocketbook ripped, spilling the contents onto the ground. Her attacker scooped up some of the items from appellant’s pocketbook and ran away. Appellant testified that she twice identified herself as a police officer during the assault; however, the investigation <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>report of the incident, which contained information supplied by appellant, does not indicate that appellant so identified herself. As a result, the WCJ did not credit this particular testimony.</p>
    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[235,504,1155,783]]]'>Appellant suffered an ankle fracture as a result of the assault, which required surgical repair and a four-day hospitalization. Appellant did not work from February 16, 1995 through August 8, 1995, when she returned to her job as a Captain’s Aide. She was unable to perform patrol duty. Appellant’s supervisor, Captain Lawrence Kirkland, approved IOD benefits for appellant, and she received those benefits from February 16, 1995 to June 16, 1995. At that point, the Police Safety Office determined that Capt. Kirkland did not have authority to approve IOD benefits and stopped the payments. From June 16, 1995 until appellant’s return to work on August 8, 1995, Capt. Kirkland placed her on sick leave. Appellant then filed a workers’ compensation claim and a penalty petition based upon the termination of her IOD benefits.</p>
    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[236,1318,1154,467]]]'>The City of Philadelphia opposed appellant’s workers’ compensation claim on the ground that she was not injured in the course and scope of her employment. The WCJ dismissed appellant’s claim and penalty petitions, finding that appellant had failed to meet her burden of proving that she was acting in the course and scope of her employment when she was attacked outside her home after her shift was completed. The WCJ further found that appellant had failed to demonstrate that the City had violated the Workers’ Compensation Act.</p>
    <p id="b591-6" data-blocks='[["BL_591.6",591,[236,1809,1157,575]],["BL_592.1",592,[232,329,1166,788]]]'>On appeal to the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (“WCAB”), appellant argued that the WCJ’s decision was not supported by the evidence because the WCJ had erred in disregarding the fact that appellant had previously received wages, in the form of IOD benefits, in lieu of workers’ compensation. Appellant claimed that the City was estopped from denying liability for compensation benefits by virtue of its previous payment of IOD benefits to appellant. The WCAB affirmed the WCJ’s decision, holding that IOD benefits are not the equivalent of workers’ compensation benefits, but instead are “distinctly dissimilar benefits.” WCAB Op. at 6. <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>The WCAB found that the City’s payment of IOD benefits was not in lieu of workers’ compensation, but rather was payment for “an injury ostensibly compensable under [the City’s] own internal rules and regulations governing the eligibility for and disbursement of IOD benefits.” <em>Id. </em>at 6-7 (footnote omitted). Having determined that IOD benefits are not the equivalent of workers’ compensation benefits, the WCAB found that the City had not admitted liability under the Act by making IOD payments and, therefore, the City was not barred or estopped from challenging appellant’s entitlement to workers’ compensation benefits. The WCAB further found that appellant was not performing her duties as a police officer at the time she was assaulted. Instead, she was found to be an unfortunate, off-duty victim of a crime. Thus, the WCAB held that appellant was not entitled to workers’ compensation benefits.</p>
    <p id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[229,1141,1163,731]]]'>Appellant further appealed to the Commonwealth Court, contending that the WCAB erred in holding that the City did not admit liability under the Act by paying IOD benefits. Appellant noted that, under the Act, an employer who either pays compensation to an employee or issues a notice of compensation payable (“NCP”) is generally estopped from contesting liability for the injury. Appellant further noted that Commonwealth Court precedent had equated the Philadelphia Civil Service Regulation under which IOD benefits are paid to equivalent compensation paid pursuant to an NCP. Accordingly, appellant argued that the payment of IOD benefits should be considered the equivalent of payments pursuant to an NCP for purposes of determining an employer’s liability under the Act.</p>

The court held that the standard of proof for the award of IOD benefits differs from the “in the course of employment” standard applicable to an award of workers’ compensation benefits; therefore, payment of IOD benefits is not the equivalent of the issuance of an NCP. Thus, the Commonwealth Court found that the City’s initial payment of IOD benefits to <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>appellant did not preclude the City from later opposing appellant’s workers’ compensation claim and arguing to the WCJ that appellant’s injuries were not work-related.</p>

Therefore, according to Sammons, the only issue before the Commission on appeal was whether his service-connected disability had resolved, thereby allowing him to return to active duty. In resolving the appeal, the Commonwealth Court opined that: “Civil Service Regulation 32 is similar in intent and form to the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act (Act), and we have held that the principles enunciated in interpreting that Act will apply to Regulation 32 where similar substantive issues are involved.” <a href="/a2d/673/0998-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="673 A.2d 998" data-case-ids="7867209" data-case-paths="/a2d/673/0998-01">673 A.2d at 1002</a>, <em>citing Ciccimaro v.

The City also does not dispute that the principles which animate application of the Act may effectively control, or at least exist as persuasive authority, in resolving disputes arising under Regulation 32—but, and this is the key to the City’s position, only if similar substantive issues are involved. The City thus posits that, even though some provisions of the Act apply to situations in which IOD benefits are paid, <em>see, e.g., </em>77 P.S. § 602 (statute of limitations applicable to workers’ compensation benefits begins to run once other forms of compensation for work-related injuries have ceased), the Act and Regulation 32 are not always interchangeable.</p>

In addition, while the Act requires an employer to promptly investigate a claim for compensation within twenty-one days of notice of an injury (77 P.S. § 717.1), Regulation 32 imposes no such requirement. These two features of workers’ compensation law, not present in the context of disputes under the City Regulations, played prominent roles in the <em>Sammons’ </em>court’s explanation why a payment of benefits should be deemed an admission “that an employee’s injury arose in the course of employment and is related thereto.” <a href="/a2d/673/0998-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="673 A.2d 998" data-case-ids="7867209" data-case-paths="/a2d/673/0998-01">673 A.2d at 1002</a>.

At the time of the fall, Blue Grass did not maintain workers’ compensation insurance in Indiana but did maintain such coverage in Pennsylvania with the State Workmen’s Insurance Fund, but only for workers who were injured while either working or residing in Pennsylvania. The claim form completed by the Insurance Fund when it received notice of the claimant’s injury listed that the claimant resided in Pennsylvania at the time of the injury. Based upon the information supplied by Blue Grass, the Insurance Fund issued an NCP listing the claimant’s address as a Kentucky address and began paying weekly benefits to claimant as well as paying his medical bills.

      <em>Waugh </em>clearly recognizes that the issuance of an NCP does not preclude an employer from seeking to set aside the notice based upon a material mistake of fact. That is precisely what occurred here. The City, through appellant’s captain’s unau<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>thorized action, paid appellant IOD benefits without the Police Commissioner determining whether her injury qualified her for those benefits. Under the plain language of the pertinent regulation, appellant’s captain was not authorized to approve IOD benefits—a point he conceded and which appellant does not dispute. The Police Safety Office, once it was able to actually investigate appellant’s injury, determined that she was not injured while on duty and therefore was ineligible for IOD benefits. The City immediately ceased paying IOD benefits to appellant based upon the results of the Safety Office’s investigation.</p>

The City should not be harmed merely for having recognized its responsibility and paying benefits while it then proceeded to investigate the legitimacy of the claim. Indeed, given the distinctions between the Act and the City Regulation which we have described above—ie., the absence of an explicit NCP procedure and the absence of a time-frame for investigation of the work-relatedness of a claimed injury under the Regulations— it would be unfair to impose on the employer such an artificial consequence.

However, unlike the majority, I would not reach that conclusion by artificially equating IOD benefits to workers’ compensation benefits for purposes of applying Section 771 of the Workers’ Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 771. As the City points out, the required procedures for the award of IOD benefits are very different from those applicable to the issuance of a notice of compensation payable (“NCP”) for workers’ compensation benefits. <em>See </em>Op. at 1240-42 (Philadelphia Civil Service Regulation 32 regarding IOD benefits neither contains a formal NCP procedure nor sets forth a time in which the investigation of a claim for compensation must be completed.) As such, I do not agree with the majority’s implicit suggestion that it may be appropriate to restrict an employer’s ability to modify or set aside IOD benefits to the same extent that an employer’s ability to modify or set aside an NCP for workers’ compensation benefits is restricted by section 771.</p>

In my view, Appellant should simply consider herself fortunate to have received four months of gratuitous benefits. Were the question of her entitlement to retain those benefits before this Court, I would surely be inclined to order them repaid to the City.</p>
