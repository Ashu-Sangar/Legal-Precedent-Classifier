    <p id="b687-9" data-blocks='[["BL_687.9",687,[270,1078,1157,1121]]]'>Appellant J.R. is the father of N.R. and is divorced from his mother, T.K., who has since remarried. As part of the divorce decree, J.R. and T.K. agreed to share legal custody of N.R., with primary physical custody remaining with T.K. N.R. thus resides with his mother and stepfather during the week, spending weekends with his father. In 1994, J.R. purchased a BB gun for N.R. as a Christmas present. T.K. approved of the gift, provided that the gun was kept at J.R.’s home. N.R. was aware of such condition, was advised by J.R. concerning the safe use of the gun, and had successfully completed a gun safety program in the course of obtaining a hunting license. At some point, J.R. learned that N.R. wanted to take the gun to his mother’s home. Although he did not speak with T.K. regarding the removal of the gun, J.R. allowed N.R. to take the gun after being assured by him that his mother approved. Subsequently, T.K. found the BB gun lying on top of her car in the driveway and confronted her son as to why it had been brought home and left in the open. T.K. then asked N.R. to return the gun to J.R.’s residence. Despite the request, however, N.R. never returned the BB gun, and T.K. never ascertained if he had done so.</p>

At the time, N.R.’s mother and stepfather were at work. Although he had not previously misused the BB gun, on this occasion, N.R. pointed it at A.H. and, believing the gun to be unloaded, pulled the trigger, discharging a BB into A.H.’s abdomen. A.H. ultimately underwent exploratory surgery to determine the extent of the injury, with the operation revealing small perforations of the liver and colon, which were repaired by single sutures. In addition, A.H.’s appendix was removed, although it was not injured from the BB. A.H. was hospitalized for ten days, and returned to school three weeks following the procedure. The surgery left A.H. with an eight- and-one-half to nine-centimeter scar on his abdomen.</p>

The trial court granted summary judgment, and A.H.’s parents proceeded to trial against N.R., who admitted negligence, thereby limiting the issue to one of damages. In this regard, A.H.’s parents presented, <em>inter alia, </em>expert testimony concerning the nature of the surgery and of a potential cosmetic procedure to lessen the scar. The only medical expense evidence introduced was that associated with the cosmetic surgery, which indicated a cost between $2,300 and $2,700. A.H. testified to experiencing considerable pain from the injury and to embarrassment from the appearance of <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>the scar; however, he was undecided as to whether he would proceed with a cosmetic procedure. After the presentation of evidence, the jury found in favor of A.H.’s parents, awarding damages in the amount of $4,625. A.H.’s parents filed a motion for a new trial, challenging the entry of summary judgment on behalf of J.R., and asserting that the damage award was inadequate.</p>
    <p id="b689-5" data-blocks='[["BL_689.5",689,[255,711,1155,1009]]]'>Explaining the reasons for granting summary judgment, the trial court offered that the record failed to establish negligence on the part of J.R., as he communicated with T.K. concerning the purchase of the BB gun, he instructed N.R. on the handling of firearms, he directed that the gun be kept at his (J.R.’s) home, and N.R. had completed a gun safety course. Furthermore, the court reasoned that no basis existed upon which to find that J.R. was negligent in supervising his son, as T.K. had primary physical custody of N.R. and, correspondingly, had the responsibility to control her son while he was on her property. With respect to the amount of damages, the trial court noted that: A.H. testified that the scar only bothered him when people asked about it; the jury was not shown any recent pictures of the scar; the only evidence concerning the medical expenses was connected with the cosmetic surgery; and A.H. was undecided as to whether he was going to undergo such procedure. The court therefore concluded that the verdict was not so contrary to the evidence as to shock its sense of justice.</p>

To the extent that the appeal sought to challenge the order entering summary judgment, J.R. argued that it was untimely, as A.H.’s parents should have obtained a determination of finality when the order was issued. In the alternative, J.R. maintained that A.H.’s parents should have filed a separate and specific notice of appeal from the summary judgment order following entry of the order <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>denying post-trial motions, as opposed to challenging the order in an appeal generally from the denial of post-trial relief. Reversing in a published decision, the Superior Court concluded that, where, as here, judgment was ultimately entered, a notice of appeal filed prior to the entry of judgment will be treated as timely filed. <em>See K.H. v.

Next, the court observed that the note following Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 341,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which concerns final orders, explains that the failure of a party to apply for a determination of finality shall not constitute a waiver, and that the matter may be raised in a subsequent appeal following the entry of a final order disposing of all claims and all parties. <em>See <a href="/a2d/778/0695-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="778 A.2d 695" data-case-ids="9496764" data-case-paths="/a2d/778/0695-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/778/0695-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="778 A.2d 695" data-case-ids="9496764" data-case-paths="/a2d/778/0695-01">at 698</a>.

The court distinguished <em>Pellak, </em>explaining that the non-custodial parent in that case was unaware of the air pistol used in the incident, whereas in the present case, the father was aware of the existence and possible location of the BB gun. <em>See id. </em>at 700. Under such circumstances, the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence, if believed by the jury, that J.R. knew or should have known of the necessity to exercise control over N.R. <em>See id. </em>The court also held that the verdict of $4,625 was inadequate because: A.H. testified that he felt pain like he never felt before and was fearful of undergoing surgery; exploratory surgery was performed, resulting in a six-inch incision; and A.H. remained in the hospital for ten days, during which he underwent treatment for fear and refusal to eat. <em>See id. </em>at 700-01. In addition, the court noted that A.H. testified that the scar caused him some embarrassment, and that plastic surgery to lessen the scar would cost between $2,300 and $2,700. <em>See id. </em>at 701.</p>

J.R. emphasizes that the notice of appeal was filed from the order denying post-trial motions; while acknowledging that such motions included a challenge to the order granting him summary judgment, he maintains that a motion for post-trial relief may not be filed to an order granting summary judgment. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. No. 227.1, note. A.H.’s parents counter that the order granting summary judgment was not appealable until the disposition of the claim against N.R., their post-trial motions alleged as an error the grant of summary judgment to J.R., and no provision in the applicable rules, statutes, or case law requires separate notices of appeal from two discrete aspects of a final judgment.</p>

The note following Rule 341 further provides that the failure of a party to apply to the court for a determination of finality does not result in a waiver, and the matter may be raised in a subsequent appeal following the entry of a final order. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 341, note. Thus, in an action involving multiple defendants, and in the absence of an express determination by the trial court under Rule 341(c), an order granting summary judgment as to one party is treated as appealable as of right only after the disposition of the claims involving the remaining parties. <em>See generally Gutteridge v.

Mullen, </em><a href="/pa/565/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="565 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="124703" data-case-paths="/pa/565/0386-01">565 Pa. 386</a>, 391, <a href="/a2d/773/0764-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="773 A.2d 764" data-case-ids="11092023,124703" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0764-01,/pa/565/0386-01">773 A.2d 764</a>, 766 (2001).

Here, as emphasized by the Superior Court and A.H.’s parents, A.H. testified that he experienced considerable <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>pain; he underwent exploratory surgery, which revealed small perforations of his liver and colon; he remained in the hospital for ten days and received counseling; the scar from the surgery causes him embarrassment; and a surgeon opined that the scar would become larger absent cosmetic surgery, a procedure that would cost between $2,300 and $2,700.</p>

In addition, the trial court stressed that A.H. stated that the scar only bothered him when he was asked about it; the jury was not shown any recent photographs of or provided with a view of the scar; and A.H. was undecided as to whether he was going to proceed with any cosmetic surgery. The trial court also underscored that the only evidence introduced concerning medical expenses was that associated with the possibility of cosmetic surgery. In light of the competing evidence of the circumstances surrounding the injury, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to find that the jury’s verdict was so contrary to the evidence as to shock the court’s sense of justice. <em>See Davis, </em><a href="/pa/565/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="565 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="124703" data-case-paths="/pa/565/0386-01">565 Pa. at 390-91</a>, <a href="/a2d/773/0764-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="773 A.2d 764" data-case-ids="11092023,124703" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0764-01,/pa/565/0386-01">773 A.2d at 766</a>.</p>

This argument implicates a different theory of liability, namely, negligent entrustment. <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 308, 390 (1965) (addressing negligence associated with permitting unqualified or incompetent persons to use things). Apart from employing the phrase in connection with their negligent supervision argument, however, A.H.’s parents do not develop such theory, and it is beyond the scope of the issues identified in our limited grant of review in this case.</p>

This duty is not peculiar to a father. It extends to the mother also in so far as her position as mother gives her an ability to control her child.” Thus, to ascertain whether an <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>individual parent is negligent and liable for the tortious conduct of a child, the ultimate question focuses on the ability and opportunity of that parent to control the child. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>J.R. (Father) did not have physical custody of N.R. (Son) during the week. Son brought the BB gun to the home of T.K. (Mother) and kept it there, despite Mother’s request that he take the gun back to the residence of Father.</p>
