The County filed tax liens against the property, which were later assigned to GLS pursuant to the Agreements. On March 16, 1998, Pentlong received a GLS Capital Tax Lien Payoff Report (the “Pent-long Report”) from GLS, indicating that: the face amount owed on the tax liens was $1,252.89; interest had accrued on the unpaid taxes in the amount of $281.99; penalties totaled <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>$32.76; and additional costs totaled $180, or $60 for each of the three years that Pentlong had owed taxes.

On May 21,1998, GLS sent Weitzel a letter with an attachment (the ‘Weitzel Report”), stating that the Kens, interest, costs, fees, and expenses owed to GLS totaled $17,572.73. The letter demanded that Weitzel promptly pay the total amount due by certified funds or GLS would satisfy the debt through a sheriffs sale of Weitzel’s property at 10 a.m. on June 1, 1998. The Weitzel Report itemized lien-servicing of $55 per year for the tax years 1988, 1989, 1990, 1992, and 1993, and $60 per year for the tax years 1994 and 1995, which totaled $395 for all seven years. The Weitzel Report also indicated that GLS had added $2,829.59 in fees and expenses, which included counsel fees, and $1,229.50 in execution costs. The Weitzel Report additionally provided that the total accrued interest was computed at a twelve percent per annum rate.

In Count I of their complaint, Taxpayers al<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>leged that GLS had been unjustly enriched because: (1) GLS was not entitled to collect twelve percent per annum interest on the unpaid face amount of its assigned liens; (2) GLS was not entitled to collect a full month’s interest for only a partial month’s delinquency; (3) GLS was not entitled to collect counsel fees; (4) GLS was not entitled to collect unrecorded costs from taxpayers, including filing, satisfaction, assignment, and revival fees; and (5) GLS was liable to Taxpayers for the costs they incurred resulting from GLS’s requirement that Taxpayers pay off the tax liens by certified funds. In Count II of their complaint, Taxpayers alleged that GLS was guilty of a fraudulent scheme to assess, bill, and collect unauthorized amounts. Taxpayers sought declaratory and injunctive relief, the imposition of a constructive trust, an accounting, and damages.</p>

Although the trial court denied GLS’s preliminary objections for failing to state a claim, it granted GLS’s motion to strike. At the same time, however, the trial court granted Taxpayers leave to amend the complaint, and on October 26,1998, Taxpayers filed an amended complaint, adding Weitzel, who had paid GLS by certified funds, as a representative plaintiff. On November 17, 1998, GLS filed preliminary objections to the amended complaint, but before the trial court ruled on those objections, on December 7, 1998, Taxpayers filed a second amended complaint. On October 18, 1999, the County filed a petition to intervene as a defendant, which the trial court subsequently granted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The court found, however, that the maximum interest rate that GLS could charge was ten percent and that GLS had no right to collect counsel fees. The court also determined that GLS was not responsible for the additional costs incurred by Taxpayers as a result of the requirement that payment be made by certified funds and remanded the matter to the trial court for factual findings to determine whether the County actually incurred each lien-docketing cost that GLS charged Taxpayers.</p>

Such matters are completely foreign to the scire facias procedure. With their distinct factual focus, scire facias proceedings are simply ill-suited for the resolution of the novel and purely legal challenges presented here. Moreover, even if the thousands of delinquent taxpayers affected by GLS’s collection policies were able to have their legal challenges to GLS’s authority resolved through the scire <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>facias procedure, they would have to do so individually in piecemeal litigation, which not only is inefficient, but is also likely to yield inconsistent results. <em>See Schrader, </em><a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.2d%20696" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="182 A.2d 696">182 A.2d at 698</a> (equitable relief available to prevent duplicative lawsuits).

When the County files papers for any one of these purposes, the Prothonotary records the filing on the appropriate docket and is also expected to note on the docket the statutory charge as prescribed by the Fee Act. All of the parties agree that when any such statutorily defined fee is recorded on the docket, the County is authorized pursuant to Section 7103 to collect that fee from the taxpayer as part of the delinquent tax.</p>

In <em>Taggart </em>and <em>Egolf, </em>this Court ruled that assignees of use-plaintiffs, <em>i.e., </em>private contractors enforcing municipal claims under the Act, could not add to their assigned rights additional rights conferred only to municipalities. In <em>Egolf, </em>the assignee of a use-plaintiff filed an assumpsit action, reserved for municipalities, to recover judgments from the property owner. This Court refused to give a use-plaintiff’s assignee the right to bring an assumpsit action, because that right was expressly reserved for municipalities and the assignee did not receive that right from the municipality. <em>Egolf, </em><a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.%20604" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="171 A. 604">171 A. at 605</a>. Similarly, in <em>'Taggart, </em>the assignee purchased a municipal lien after it was discharged, but then tried to redeem the property after a sheriff’s sale. Given that the assignee did not receive his rights from a municipality, this Court refused to give him the right of redemption. <em>Taggart, </em><a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.2d%2068" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="108 A.2d 68">108 A.2d at 69</a>. Thus, in neither <em>Egolf </em>nor <em>Taggart </em>did the assignee receive his rights directly from the municipality. Here, however, the County explicitly assigned to GLS its rights to collect and enforce the tax liens. Thus, contrary to Taxpayers’ assertions, this Couit's holdings in <em>Egolf </em>and <em>Taggart </em>are inapplicable to the instant case.</p>

Under general assignment principles, the third party succeeds to the original obligee’s rights against the party obliged to make the payment, unless the third party intended to relieve the obligor of any future obligations. The purchase of tax claims created under the Act is governed by these common law principles, and accordingly, the municipal assignor transfers its whole interest in an unpaid tax claim to its third party assignee. Thus, the claim does not evaporate upon assignment, as Taxpayers suggest, but rather simply substitutes the assignee as the new obligee.</p>

In their brief to the Commonwealth Court, Taxpayers argued that Section 5648 of the Fiscal Code did not apply, but did not argue which statutory provision did in fact apply. The Commonwealth Court subsequently determined sua sponte that, pursuant to Section 7143 of the Act, the maximum amount that the County could charge on its tax liens was ten percent. However, because Taxpayers never suggested that ten percent was the appropriate rate, or that the County Council failed to implement the maximum rate, the Commonwealth Court vacated the trial court's order insofar as it granted Taxpayers’ motion for judgment on the pleadings based on its finding that the applicable interest rate was twelve percent. We note that in their brief to this Court, Taxpayers again merely restate their argument to the Commonwealth Court that Section 5648 does not apply without arguing the applicability of Section 7143.</p>

Taxpayers also argue that Section 5648 does not apply to GLS, because GLS is not a “collector of delinquent taxes” as specified in that provision. This argument, however, fails to recognize that Section 5648 makes two distinct pronouncements: (1) that taxes themselves generate interest at a rate not to exceed twelve percent, and (2) that when this interest is collected by the County, it must be paid into the County’s general fund. In that second regard, Section 5648 merely directs the County, when acting as a tax collector, to deposit any collected taxes and added interest into the County’s general treasury as opposed to some special fund or a County official’s pocket. <em>See generally </em>Pa. Sen. J., 130th Leg., Reg. Session 733-38 (Feb. 22, 1933) (discussing legislature’s attempt to abolish office of tax collector as an "abscess on the body politic in Allegheny County”); Pa.

Based solely on the definitions of tax claims and municipal claims, as stated in Section 7101 of the Act, it may appear that municipal claims are a more specific subset of general tax claims. On the other hand, based on the same language, GLS and the County argue the opposite, <em>i.e., </em>that tax claims are in fact a subset of municipal claims. Both constructions, however, overlook the fact that the legislature <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>repeatedly uses both terms within the Act, often within the same provision, and periodically dictates that the two types of claims be treated differently. For example, Section 7145 of the Act discusses both tax and municipal claims, and defines property differently for each type of claim. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 7145. Specifically, Section 7145 provides that "[t]he property described in tax claims shall include the whole property against which the tax is levied[; t]he property described in municipal claims may include the whole contiguous property.” <em>See also </em>53 P.S. § 7109 (stating that "the estate and title of such owner or owners ... may not be exempt from taxation or municipal claims”); 53 P.S. § 7111 ("This [A]ct shall apply only to claims wherein the right to file a lien accrues after the date of its passage, and to tax claims for the years one thousand nine hundred and twenty-one, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, and one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three, and to municipal claims heretofore lawfully imposed or assessed within six months before the passage of this [A]ct and not liened at the time of its passage.”). Given that this Court presumes that the legislature did not intend provisions of its enactments to be mere surplusage, <em>see Masland v.
