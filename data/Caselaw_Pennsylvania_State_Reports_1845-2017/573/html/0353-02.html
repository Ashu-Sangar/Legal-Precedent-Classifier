    <p id="b557-7" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[222,786,1155,1073]]]'>In January of 1999, the Borough of Ellwood City (the “Borough”) began withholding, via payroll deduction, contributions to the police pension plan from its employee police officers, at a rate of five and six-tenths percent of each officer’s gross monthly wages. Such action was based upon an actuarial valuation report for the plan, prepared pursuant to the Borough’s obligations under the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> also known as Act 205. The report indicated that there was a shortfall of monies available to meet annual obligations in the amounts of approximately $14,000 for 1998 and $28,000 for 1999, and that to meet financial requirements, members must contribute five and six-tenths percent of their salaries for 1999. The report also reflected a prevailing surplus, measured by comparison of the actuarial value of plan assets with actuarially accrued liabilities. Significantly, despite such a surplus, a pension fund may be incapable of meeting present obligations absent an infusion of monies, since Act 205 effectively caps the amount of a surplus that can be utilized to meet financial requirements in any given year at ten percent. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 895.302(c).</p>

In response, the Borough relied on the provisions of the Police Pension Fund Act (Act 600), <em>see supra </em>note 1, requiring police pension fund members to contribute an amount between five and eight percent of their monthly compensation, prior to contribution of the remainder of needed annual contributions (as determined by an actuary) by the municipality. <em>See </em>58 P.S. § 772. While Act 600 does authorize reduction or elimination of member contributions, the Borough emphasized the limited conditions under which Act 600 authorizes this to occur, as follows:</p>

In his decision, the arbitrator adopted the Bargaining Unit’s position that the interpretation of actuarial soundness from the 1992 arbitration—focusing solely upon the predomination of actuarially determined assets over liabilities—controlled.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> In this <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>regard, the arbitrator emphasized that, since the issuance of the 1992 arbitration award, the relevant terms of the CBA had been reaffirmed on multiple occasions via the collective bargaining process.

    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[230,660,1166,952]]]'>The Borough then filed a petition to vacate the award in the court of common pleas, contending that the arbitrator exceeded his authority, because Act 600 and Act 205 prohibit the elimination of police officer contributions to a pension where Borough contributions are required to maintain actuarial soundness on broader terms than the mere maintenance of assets exceeding liabilities. The common pleas court, however, denied relief on the petition, indicating that the record did not demonstrate that the arbitrator’s award directed the Borough to make contributions. <em>See, e.g., Borough of Ellwood City v.

In this regard, the Borough highlighted that the common pleas court’s decision gave no account for Act 205’s effective proscription against utilization of more than ten percent of surpluses in meeting annual financial requirements of the plan. The Commonwealth Court agreed that the existence of a surplus in the pension fund by itself is insufficient as a basis for reducing or eliminating employee contributions; rather, it found that such action must be grounded upon an actuarial report prepared in accordance with Act 205, which sets forth <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>the minimum funding requirements for municipal pension plans. <em>See Borough of Ellwood City v.

Specifically, I cannot concur with the majority’s reasoning that <em>Grottenthaler </em>is distinguishable <em>from </em>this case because the <em>Grottenthaler </em>court “emphasized the identity of the employer as the Commonwealth in and of itself, as opposed to a political subdivision such as the Borough.” Slip op. at 10-11. In my view, this does not constitute a principled reason for distinguishing <em>Grottenthaler </em>because that case did not hinge on such a distinction, as evidenced by the fact that the <em>Grottenthaler </em>court specifically relied on a collective bargaining case involving a <em>municipal </em>employer to support its conclusion that the <em>Commonwealth </em>was barred from asserting the applicable statutory prohibition. <em>See Grottenthaler, </em><a href="/pa/488/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="488 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="1761005" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0019-01">410 A.2d at </a>809 (citing <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>

    <p id="b568-5" data-blocks='[["BL_568.6",568,[238,817,1159,567]]]'>I join the Opinion of the Majority, which correctly determined that the finding contained in the Act 205 Actuarial Report, that the Pension Fund was unsound, required the Bargaining Unit members to contribute to the Fund, despite the existence of an arbitrator’s definition of actuarial soundness as being one in which Fund assets exceed Fund liabilities. However, I write separately to note that (1) there is no provision in either Act 600 or Act 205 that supports this definition, and (2) the CBA explicitly recognizes that member contributions are required when an actuary determines that the Fund is unsound.</p>
    <p id="b568-6" data-blocks='[["BL_568.7",568,[236,1417,1163,515]]]'>First, neither Act 600 nor Act 205 permits the elimination of employee contributions to a municipal pension plan merely because the Fund’s assets exceed its liabilities. Instead, both Acts require that an independent actuary in an Act 205 Actuarial Report make the determination of actuarial soundness. 53 P.S. § 895.201(a), (b); 55 P.S. § 772(c). At the time of the 1992 McDaniel Award, we cannot tell whether the Pension Fund was actuarially sound; we only are aware of the fact that the arbitrator was called upon to make that determination.</p>
    <p id="b568-7" data-blocks='[["BL_568.8",568,[233,1966,1161,418]],["BL_569.1",569,[219,311,1153,628]]]'>The Bargaining Unit asserts that the definition of actuarial soundness is set forth in the 1992 McDaniel Arbitral Award and controls any determination concerning whether member contributions are required. It further states that its position is supported by the fact that the 1993, 1995, and 1997 successor agreements made no change to the definition and these agreements limit the meaning of the term. However, this issue was previously challenged by the Bargaining Unit and <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>resolved against it. Indeed, in 1995, the Borough implemented an eight percent pension contribution because an Act 205 Actuarial Report called the actuarial soundness of the Pension Fund into question. The Bargaining Unit challenged the authority of the Borough to implement this contribution before the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (PLRB). It claimed that the interpretation of the McDaniel Award controlled and that the Borough had not bargained the 1995 agreement in good faith because it had included a contribution requirement. The PLRB dismissed the complaint, rejecting the arguments of the Bargaining Unit. The Bargaining Unit failed to appeal this determination.</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[220,969,1153,789]]]'>Second, pursuant to Section 6 of Act 600,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> only the Borough has the authority to eliminate or reduce member contributions based on the soundness of the Fund. 55 P.S. § 772(c). That authority is discretionary. Section 6 provides that “the borough may, on an annual basis ... reduce or eliminate payments into the fund by its members.” 53 P.S. § 772(c) (emphasis added). The exercise of the Borough’s discretion to eliminate or reduce member contributions is governed primarily by the Act 205 Actuarial Report. When the actuary determines that the Pension Fund is actuarially unsound, and so states in the Act 205 Actuarial Report, the Borough has no discretion to either reduce or eliminate member contributions. It is only when the Pension Fund is actuarially sound that the Borough may exercise its discretion to alter those contributions.</p>

Article V, Section G(3) of the CBA provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b570-4" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[287,426,1116,256]]]'>(3) In the event it is actuarially determined that the amount of annual contribution is not keeping the Plan actuarially sound, then such contribution shall be increased at a percentage necessary to make the Pension fund again actuarially sound.</blockquote>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[241,702,1162,634]]]'>(Emphasis added). Because the actuary in this case determined that the Fund was unsound and mandated that member contributions be required in the amount of 5.6%, the Bargaining Unit members must contribute. The language of the CBA itself requires an actuarial determination, not a Borough or arbitral determination, that member contributions are required. Thus, I do not believe that the McDaniel Award is applicable, but is reserved for those instances in which the actuary has not declared the Pension Fund unsound and the Borough has not reduced the contributions required. That is not the factual predicate before us; here, it was “actuarially determined” that contributions were required.</p>
    <p id="b570-6" data-blocks='[["BL_570.6",570,[238,1356,1179,470]]]'>Finally, I observe that the basis for our decision today is that the imposition of a 5.6% Pension Fund contribution is consistent with Act 205, Act 600, and the CBA. There is no term of employment set forth in the CBA in this case that was agreed to by the Borough to obtain a favorable bargaining position. The Bargaining Unit has always been required to accept the imposition of member contributions to the Pension Fund when it is “actuarially determined” that such contribu-' tions are required.</p>

I respectfully dissent, however, from the Court’s mandate, which simply affirms the Commonwealth Court’s reversal of the trial court and vacatur of the arbitration award. In my view, there is a middle ground, adverted to <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>by the Majority, Slip op. at 12, which should inform our mandate. I would hold that, where a party to a CBA invokes a pre-existing statute to avoid the consequences of a provision included in the CBA, and where the issue involves a core employment term such as wages, hours, pensions, or conditions of employment, then the CBA should be rescinded and the bargaining <em>status quo ante </em>restored. Accordingly, I would mold our mandate to direct the parties to return to the bargaining table to effect a knowing agreement that accounts for the commands and consequences of Act 205.</p>
    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[216,885,1155,806]]]'>I come to this view because, while I agree that a grievance arbitration award that conflicts with Act 205 cannot be upheld, I also believe that the salutary principles animating cases such as <em>Grottenthaler v.

I believe it is fundamentally unfair to permit an employer, or a bargaining unit for that matter, to gain a retroactive advantage when an existing statute is later found by the courts to operate to alter a fundamental term of a labor agreement reached after arms’ length bargaining.

In addition to ignoring the very plain statutory command here, such a course would ignore the fact that not all of these disputes involve circumstances where a party could be fairly accused of overreaching or bad faith. It may well be that the parties did not perceive, or did not fully perceive, the complication which arose; or the area in issue was unsettled; or the parties had conflicting but reasonable interpretations of their bargaining authority over a particular question. Indeed, in this very case, the employer has forwarded a cogent argument based upon the plain language of Act 205, while the bargaining unit has forwarded a logical argument based upon the essentially equitable analysis that controlled cases like <em>Pittsburgh Joint Collective Bargaining Comm, </em>and <em>Grottenthaler. </em>Thus, I do not view the issue as a simple matter of identifying good and <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>bad faith in the bargaining process: our task may also involve an obligation to protect the parties from the consequences of a material, apparent mutual mistake in the bargaining process concerning a core employment matter.</p>

Thus, although I concur in most of the Majority’s analysis, including its conclusion that Act 205 precludes approval of the arbitration award as entered, I would remand the matter to permit the parties to return to the bargaining table.</p>
