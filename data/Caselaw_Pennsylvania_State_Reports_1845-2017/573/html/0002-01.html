On the other hand, a landowner of a tract containing more than ten acres cannot subdivide or develop his land until he performs an analysis of the soil on the tract.

In addition, Appellant claimed that the provisions in the Ordinance restricting the degree of development on the buildable site area were unreasonable and therefore, should also be deemed invalid. Between September 16, 1996 and September 20, 1999, the ZHB held a series of 29 hearings regarding Appellant’s challenge. Throughout the hearings, the Board asserted that the Ordinance was valid. However, a month prior to the conclusion of those hearings, the Board, pursuant to its authority-under Section 609.2 of the MPC, adopted Resolution 99-07, in which it questioned the validity of the Ordinance. In Resolution 99-07, the Board stated that it had resolved that:</p>

In an Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> Justice Roberts noted that while minimum lot size requirements may be justified in certain circumstances, “[a]t some point along the spectrum ... the size of lots ceases to be a concern requiring public regulation and becomes simply a matter of private preference.” <a href="/citations/?q=268%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="268 A.2d 765">268 A.2d at </a>766 (citing <em>National Land and Investment Co., </em><a href="/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20597" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="215 A.2d 597">215 A.2d at 608</a>).

While Appellant recognizes this distinction, it nonetheless argues that the extraordinary justification standard should apply because the Ordinance <em>results in </em>a density limitation of one house per every two acres or more. However, we find no support for such an argument in <em>Concord Twp. Appeal. </em>To the contrary, the lead opinion in that case speaks only about minimum lot sizes <em>per se, </em>and in no way suggests that an extraordinary justification standard should apply any time a zoning regulation merely results in lot sizes of two acres or more. Moreover, the Commonwealth Court cases following <em>Concord Twp. Appeal </em>never interpreted the lead opinion to have such a broad effect.

In support of its argument, Appellant explains that because virtually all of the land in the AP District that is not wetlands, floodplains, or steep slopes, is either prime farmland, farmland of statewide importance, or farmland of local importance, a landowner in the AP District essentially must set aside fifty percent of his land for agricultural purposes as a result of the Ordinance’s set aside provisions. Furthermore, according to Appellant, the set aside requirement is not substantially related to the Township’s interest in preserving agriculture, but rather is meant to serve the Township’s desire to maintain open space and to preserve its bucolic character. Finally, Appellant asserts that even if such a large set aside requirement is found to be reasonable and substantially related to the Township’s interest in preserving its agricultural lands, the additional restrictions placed by the Ordinance on the buildable site area, <em>e.g., </em>the one-acre minimum lot size, are unreasonable and not substantially related to the Township’s interest in preserving its agricultural land because they concern that area of the tract already designated as “buildable.”</p>

The restrictions placed by the Ordinance on a landowner of a tract containing greater than ten acres in the AP District must be looked at as a whole, and when considered as such, we agree with Appellant that they unreasonably infringe upon a landowner’s constitutionally protected right to freely use and enjoy his property. While the Township undoubtedly has an interest in preserving its agricultural lands, that interest does not completely outweigh a landowner’s right to use his property as he sees fit. <em>See Hopewell Twp., </em><a href="/pa/499/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="499 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1778915" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0246-01">452 A.2d at 1343-44</a>.</p>

Indeed, the Township seemed to want to reach such a reasonable balance in creating the Ordinance. Catherine Guathier, a member of the Bucks County Planning Commission who assisted the Township Commission with the preparation of its undated Comprehensive Plan and the Ordinance, testified during the ZHB hearings that in establishing the Ordinance, the Commission chose not to adopt the zoning schemes used by Lancaster and York Counties in order to preserve their agricultural lands because there are greater developmental pressures in the Township than in Lancaster and York, and accordingly, the Commission did not want to completely foreclose a landowner from developing his property. R.R,. 194a; <em>see also </em>R.R. 1702a-03a. Further, Ms. Guathier testified that the Commission recognized that “a farmer [may need] to subdivide off a couple lots in order to make some money and make the farm economical for family members,” and therefore, they wanted to ensure that a farmer had that option. R.R. 296a-98a; <em>see also </em>R.R. 1700a-01a. Ron Dise, the chairman of the Commission, also stated that in creating the set aside restrictions, the Commission realized that they “were dealing with a person’s single largest asset, so we wanted to proceed with that in mind and to try to maintain some fairness.” R.R. 1700a; <em>see also </em>1744a-45a.</p>

The Ordinance then further restricts a landowner on the area that remains open for development to building single-family homes on a minimum size of one acre, which is free of watercourses, floodplains, floodplain soils, wetlands, lakes, or ponds.

Given this testimony, it appears that the one-acre minimum lot size requirement was adopted merely because it was considered a “good number” and a number that would stall the development of large houses on small lots. Indeed, the Township clearly recognized that a one-acre minimum lot was not necessary for the development of a single-family detached dwelling, as the Ordinance allows for a minimum lot size of as low as 8,000 square feet in the performance subdivision area of the R 3 Residential District. <em>See </em>Ord. 118, Table of Dimensional Regulations, R.R. 2574a; 959a, 968a; <em>see also </em>R.R. 1702a (Mr. Dise stating that Commission considered lot sizes of 10,000 or 20,000 square feet when planning Ordinance).</p>

While we acknowledge that the Township has a legitimate interest in preserving its agricultural lands, we find that by requiring landowners of tracts greater than ten acres to set aside between fifty and sixty percent of the agriculturally productive land on their tracts, the Township reasonably meets that interest. By also limiting a landowner to developing homes on one-acre minimum lots on the buildable site area, however, the Township is no longer attempting to preserve agriculture, but rather, is improperly attempting to exclude people from the area and in so doing, is unreasonably restricting the property rights of the landowner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_27" id="ref_footnote_1_27">27</a> Thus, as the Ordinance’s minimum lot size requirement is an unreasonable restriction on a landowner’s right to use his property and not substantially related to the Township’s interest in preserving its agricultural lands, we find that the ZHB abused its discretion in sustaining the amended Zoning Ordinance as constitutionally valid.</p>

Indeed, it appears that a majority of the Court actually found that a zoning ordinance, such as Concord Township's, which mandates that residential development occur on minimum lot sizes of two acres or more, must be treated like any other zoning ordinance and therefore, presumed valid unless a challenging party can establish that it is unreasonable, arbitrary, or not substantially related to a police power purpose. As stated above, the three dissenting Justices specifically rejected the extraordinary justification standard announced by the lead opinion in favor of the general standard applied to all other zoning ordinances. <em><a href="/citations/?q=268%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="268 A.2d 765">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=268%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="268 A.2d 765">at 772-80</a>. While Chief Justice Bell, in his concurring opinion, did not explicitly state that he believed that the standard applied to other zoning ordinances was the appropriate standard to use in reviewing zoning ordinances mandating minimum lot sizes of two acres or more, his concurring opinion seems to imply as such, particularly given that he cited and relied on cases that applied the traditional standard. <em><a href="/citations/?q=268%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="268 A.2d 765">Id.</a> </em>at 772 (citing <em>Cleaver, </em><a href="/pa/414/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="414 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1890433" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0367-01">414 Pa. 367</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.2d%20408" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="200 A.2d 408">200 A.2d 408</a>; <em>Eller v.

We agree with Appellant that because essentially all of the AP District that is not wetlands, floodplains or steep slopes, consists of either prime farmland, farmland of statewide importance or farmland of local importance, a typical landowner of tracts containing more than ten acres in the AP District must set aside at least fifty percent of his tract. Indeed, this was recognized by the Township in requiring such a set aside restriction. R.R. 1806a; <em>see also </em>R.R. 196a, 1741a (testimony by those involved in establishment of the Ordinance that at least five acres was necessary for a good, farmable piece of property).</p>

It is undisputed by the parties that it is difficult for a landowner after setting aside half of his tract to develop just a few homes on the remainder of the tract due to the need to develop an expensive septic system for those homes.

Mr. Dise also testified that in his personal opinion, the one-acre minimum lot size requirement was an effective way to prevent the creation of "small towns,” which did not, in his view, "make sense to have within the AP district.” R.R. 1787a-89a. Mr. Dise did not testify, however, that this view was shared by the other members of the Commission and thus, we do not consider the suppression of towns to be one of the Township’s motivations for enacting the one acre limit here.</p>

Appellant also argues on appeal to this Court that the Ordinance was invalid because the Board admitted its invalidity by adopting Resolution <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>99-07 pursuant to Section 609.2 of the MPC. According to Appellant, Section 609.2 is only applicable to situations where a municipality has determined that its zoning ordinance is substantively invalid, and cannot be casually invoked where the municipality thinks that an Ordinance <em>may </em>be invalid. Thus, Appellant asserts that the Board’s enactment of Resolution 99-07, in which it questioned the validity of the Ordinance, must be construed as an unequivocal admission by the Township that the Ordinance is invalid. We agree with Appellant that Resolution 99-07 was not inconsequential to the ZHB’s consideration of Appellant’s challenge. Given that the legislature has designated the Board as the agency responsible for zoning measures in the Township and has also specifically directed the Board to pass resolutions by means of Section 609.2 declaring a zoning ordinance invalid when the Board finds that it is unreasonable or fails to reflect the interests of the Township, we find that the ZHB should have given some evidentiary weight to the Board’s adoption of Resolution 99-07 pursuant to its authority in Section 609.2, and to that end, should have looked at a record of the Board’s proceedings regarding its passage of Resolution 99-07. However, the Board’s adoption of Resolution 99-07 after the commencement of the proceedings before the ZHB did not establish the Ordinance was invalid as a matter of law, especially in the instant case where the Board merely stated in Resolution 99-07 that the Ordinance may be invalid. <em>See Appeal of Marple Gardens, </em>99 Pa.Cmwlth. 485, <a href="/pa-commw/99/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="514 A.2d 216" data-case-ids="1350979" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/99/0485-01">514 A.2d 216</a>, 221 (1986); <em>Sultanik v.
