The first occurred in 1989 and the second in 1992. In the 1992 accident, he sustained injuries to his head, jaw, back, and shoulder. By August of 1993, the residual pain from his injuries was so severe he said that he “wanted to die.” Despite the fact that he was treated by several physicians and <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>prescribed strong medication, the pain continued. In August of 1993, upon referral by one of his physicians, Mr. Toogood began to visit Dr. Rogal, a dentist, for treatment of jaw pain. These visits occurred at The Pain Center, a multi-disciplinary medical center that is owned primarily by Dr. Rogal. While at The Pain Center for treatment of his jaw pain, Mr. Toogood also received paravertebral nerve block<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> injections from Dr. Stone, a consulting anesthesiologist at The Pain Center, for treatment of severe back, shoulder, and neck pain.</p>

After receiving the final injection, Mr. Toogood felt pain, experienced difficulty breathing, and remained at The Pain Center for a short time before driving himself home. While at home, he collapsed and was taken to The Chester County Hospital complaining of breathing difficulties. At the hospital, he was treated by William Dellevigne, M.D. (Dr. Dellevigne), who diagnosed and repaired a pneumothorax.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Mr. Toogood fully recovered from the injury and, as Dr. Dellevigne recalled, he never returned for a follow-up visit.

The key to the doctrine is that a sufficient fund of common knowledge exists within a jury of laypersons to justify raising the inference. Instead of directly proving the elements of ordinary negligence, the plaintiff provides evidence of facts and circumstances surrounding his injury that make the inference of the defendant’s negligence reasonable. “The gist of res ipsa loquitur ... is the inference, or process of reasoning by which the conclusion is reached.

Previously, the fact that medicine is not an exact science, that the human body is not susceptible to precise understanding, that the care required of a medical professional is the degree of learning and skill common in his profession, and that, even with the greatest of care, untoward results do occur in medical and surgical procedures, were of elevated importance in determining whether the medical professional had been negligent. <em>Salgo v.

Originally, a plaintiff could not employ a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction if the plaintiff had evidence regarding the cause of the accident. Thus, <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was reserved for obvious cases in which lay jurors could apply their own knowledge and common sense to establish the cause of the injury and deduce an inference of negligence.

In contrast, plaintiffs in <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>cases rely on the jury to fill in the missing pieces of causation and negligence, inherent in their cases, with the jury’s common experience. Determining whether there was a breach of duty, however, involves a two-step process: the court must first determine the standard of care; it then must examine whether the defendant’s conduct measured up to that standard. Not only does the plaintiff have the burden of proving that the defendant did not possess and employ the required skill and knowledge, or did not exercise the care and judgment of a reasonable professional, he or she must also prove that the injury was caused by the failure to employ that requisite skill and knowledge.

      <em>Res ipsa loquitur </em>must be carefully limited, for to say whether a particular error on the part of a physician reflects negligence demands a complete understanding of the procedure the doctor is performing and the responsibilities upon him at the moment of injury. Thus, in evaluating a doctor’s decision to administer a nerve block injection in a particular location, an intelligent jury analysis requires some under<a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>standing of the results of giving the injection in various places; the skill required in pinpointing a specific location; and the likelihood of giving the injection in an unintended site.

As aptly noted by the Justices of the Supreme Court of New Mexico, “The cause and effect of a physical condition lies in a field of knowledge in which only a medical expert can give a competent opinion.... [Without experts] we feel that the jury could have no basis other than conjecture, surmise or speculation upon which to consider causation.” <em>Woods v.

It is only when each of the three conditions is satisfied that an inference of negligence can be drawn from the occurrence of an injurious event.

Therefore, it was essential to Mr. Toogood’s claim to introduce expert testimony. This testimony was needed to establish first, the standard of care required for the procedure and, second, that the physician breached that standard of care. These are essential elements for a medical malpractice action that do not evaporate when the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is applied. Accordingly, Mr. Toogood failed to establish his <em>prima facie </em>case of medical malpractice and the trial court committed errors of law in permitting this matter to go to the jury without expert testimony as to the standard of care and in subsequently denying Appellants’ motion for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto.</em>

For that reason, society should not allow a doctor’s actions to be second-guessed at trial without a clear understanding of the standards required. Second, medicine is not an exact science. Much discretion exists in a doctor’s practice of medicine that should not be condemned in hindsight. Third, the practice of medicine is a complex and experimental field.

Hardly a man, woman or child (even those of tender age) exists in this country who has not had injections of one kind or another. * * * So the giving and receiving of injections and the lack of nerve injury therefrom ordinarily has become a matter of common knowledge”) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). Moreover, I believe that the second prong of the <em>res ipsa </em>test is satisfied not only because there was no genuine dispute in this case that Dr. Stone was the individual who gave the injection, but also because Toogood presented specific expert testimony that the injection caused the collapsed lung. Finally, the third prong of the <em>res ipsa </em>test was plainly satisfied because, as this Court recognized in <em>Hightower-Warren, </em>it is “within the scope of [a physician’s] duty of care to protect his patient against preventable injuries which could reasonably occur during the performance of surgery,” and the same holds true for the medical procedure at issue here. <a href="/a2d/698/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="698 A.2d 52" data-case-ids="11998130,960542" data-case-paths="/a2d/698/0052-01,/pa/548/0459-01">698 A.2d at </a>55 n. 7 (alterations in original) (citation omitted).</p>

Whether or not any such complexities actually exist, I do not agree that the fact that special skill and training may be required to perform a nerve block injection precludes the application of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>on the facts of this case, where the needle punctured Toogood’s lung. Surely, a jury can draw on its common general knowledge to infer that a nerve block injection needle should never puncture the patient’s lung absent the doctor’s negligence. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 328D cmt. e (“[I]t is enough that the facts proved reasonably permit the conclusion that negligence is the more probable explanation.”). Of course, the defendant remains free under the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine to rebut the inference of negligence with its own evidence that such injections pose a greater risk of organ puncture than common perception suggests.</p>
