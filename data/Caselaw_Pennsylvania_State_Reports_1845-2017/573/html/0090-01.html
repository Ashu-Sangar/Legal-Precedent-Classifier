Pursuant to a contract with Federal Express, the Hospital collected urine samples and then forwarded those samples to an outside laboratory for testing. On the day in question, Sharpe maintains, numerous events transpired at the Hospital that affected the chain of custody associated with her urine sample, as a result of which it was misidentiffed and/or mishandled. Consequently, Sharpe alleges, the urine sample falsely tested positive for cocaine. When she disputed that outcome, the Hospital conducted an internal investigation at the request of <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>Federal Express. Following the investigation, through which the Hospital verified the chain of custody, Sharpe’s employment with Federal Express was terminated.</p>

Sharpe proceeded to assert claims of, <em>inter alia, </em>negligence and deliberate and reckless misconduct against the Hospital.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Sharpe did not assert any claim against the entities that had performed the testing and reported the results to Federal Express; the Hospital, however, joined those entities as additional defendants.</p>

On Sharpe’s appeal,, the Superior Court affirmed in a memorandum opinion, also citing to <em>Ney </em>and <em>Tomko </em>and rejecting Sharpe’s position that public policy would support the imposition of a duty upon the Hospital. As to the latter point, the Superior Court reasoned that, despite Sharpe’s attempt to distinguish precedent based upon her status as an existing employee, the duty that she advocated would not apply to a readily discernible and identifiable class and would thus be overbroad. Moreover, the court distinguished the out-of-state authority cited by Sharpe, <em>see Stinson v.

Moreover, President Judge McEwen noted that, while Sharpe did not assert a claim against the laboratory and the individuals that actually performed the test, she nonetheless alleged a plethora of failures on the part of the Hospital concerning its collection and handling of the urine specimen. President Judge McEwen also found it critical that Sharpe had already attained employment with Federal Express for purposes of imposing a duty of reasonable care, given the resultant loss of employment and the stigma inevitably attaching to her subsequent attempts to obtain employment. He would have imposed a duty upon any <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>hospital or laboratory involved in any stage of drug testing to adhere to a standard of reasonable and prudent conduct to prevent an undue risk of harm from false positive test results. Judge Olszewski issued a concurring memorandum, acknowledging that the court was bound by <em>Ney </em>and <em>Tomko, </em>but indicating that he would have reached a different result in those cases. Unlike President Judge McEwen, however, Judge Olszewski would not have distinguished this matter on the basis of Sharpe’s existing employment relationship with Federal Express; instead, finding the Superior Court cases to “unnecessarily perpetuate the outdated requirement of privity,” he invited either the <em>en banc </em>Superior Court or this Court to overrule the relevant line of decisions.</p>

Evans, </em><a href="/pa/551/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="551 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="507875" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0496-01">551 Pa. 496</a>, 502, <a href="/a2d/711/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="711 A.2d 458" data-case-ids="11821015,507875" data-case-paths="/a2d/711/0458-01,/pa/551/0496-01">711 A.2d 458</a>, 461 (1998). As the Hospital’s motion for summary judgment, as well as the reasoning of the trial court and the Superior Court, focused solely upon the existence of a duty extending from the Hospital to Sharpe, the analysis implicated by this matter is confined to that narrow inquiry. In this regard, Sharpe continues to maintain that, because of the foreseeable ramifications of improperly performing employment-related drug testing, the entities involved in the process should, as a matter of public policy, be held responsible for the consequences of their errors. Sharpe attempts to restrict the scope of the duty that she advocates, focusing upon the existence of a current employment relationship with Federal Express and distinguishing the present factual scenario from instances pertaining to prospective employment. The Hospital, relying in large part on <em>Ney, </em>focuses upon Sharpe’s third-party status to its contract with Federal Express and argues that a legally enforceable duty cannot be based upon such third-party standing. In addition, the Hospital emphasizes that Sharpe’s claim, as indicated in her brief, seeks to impose liability against entities performing drug tests, in this case, the laboratory; such liability should not, however, extend to the <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>Hospital, which did not test the sample or provide diagnosis and treatment.</p>

Although Sharpe also asserted claims of defamation, fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of contract, she voluntarily withdrew those claims before the trial court. Moreover, while Sharpe did not withdraw her claim for deliberate and reckless misconduct, the trial court and the Superior Court engaged in no discussion of that count. Nor do the parties advance any argumentation along these lines.</p>

The scope of the obligations assumed by a physician under a contract with an insurance company, and the absence of affirmative conduct on the part of the physician that would itself result in direct harm to the examinee, also provide a basis for distinguishing those Superior Court cases that have found the lack of a duty between the physician and the examinee. <em>See, e.g., Promubol v.

Privity of contract, however, is not an essential prerequisite to the existence of a duty, as the law may operate under certain circumstances to impose a duty in favor of a third party against one operating under a contract, without reference to the terms of that contract. <em>See, e.g., Prost v.

As President Judge McEwen suggested in his dissent, <em>Hey </em>may be distinguished on the basis that the employee there was seeking damages for the loss of potential employment arising from pre-employment drug screening.
