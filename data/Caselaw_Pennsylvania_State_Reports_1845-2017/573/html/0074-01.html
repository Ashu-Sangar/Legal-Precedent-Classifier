    <p id="b278-6" data-blocks='[["BL_278.7",278,[224,1017,1166,1213]]]'>The obstetrical malpractice action, commenced in July of 1996 in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. The plaintiffs (mother and child) alleged that a physician employee of HMC provided inappropriate obstetrical care to mother, which caused severe injuries to the child. Mother and child also alleged that HMC was vicariously hable for the harm they suffered. HMC agreed to settle the case. To finance the settlement, HMC tendered $200,000.00 of the physician’s primary coverage to the Fund. The tender triggered the Fund to provide the physician’s $1,000,000.00 statutory insurance coverage and authorized settlement for $1,200,000.00. The plaintiffs declined to settle for that amount. Notwithstanding that HMC had self-insured $8,000,000.00 of excess insurance for the physician and, in addition to that, a shared private excess layer of $25,000,000.00, it chose not to make payment from its self-insured excess layer. Instead, HMC attempted to tender its own $200,000.00 of primary coverage to the Fund with the apparent expectation that the Fund would then make another $1,000,000.00 available to finance the settlement. However, the Fund declined to make payment on the vicarious liability claims against HMC because it believed that its payment was not implicated until the insurance available to the primarily hable physician was exhausted.</p>

In that case, a child and his parents sued HMC and a pediatric cardiologist employed by HMC because the cardiologist performed a procedure on the child that allegedly caused the child injury. Similar to the obstetrical action, there was neither a claim that HMC committed any overtly negligent act, nor a claim that HMC failed to take action it should have taken. The plaintiffs alleged, instead, that HMC was subject to vicarious liability because the physician was an employee of HMC. To settle the casé, HMC tendered the physician’s $200,000.00 in primary coverage and the Fund, on behalf of the physician, made $1,000,000.00 in settlement monies available. The plaintiffs declined to settle for $1,200,000.00. Hence, HMC tendered its own $200,000.00 in primary insurance expecting that the Fund would contribute an additional $1,000,000.00. However, the Fund again declined to pay because it claimed that its coverage for HMC was not implicated until the available insurance of the primarily liable physician was exhausted. HMC then used its own funds to make up for the discrepancy between the physician’s $1,200,000.00 and the amount necessary to settle the case. It then sued the Fund in Commonwealth Court demanding that the Fund repay HMC the dollar amounts it claimed should have been paid by the Fund.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The General Assembly created the Health Care Services Malpractice Act to “make available professional liability insurance at a reasonable cost, and to establish a system through which a person who has sustained injury or death as a result of tort or breach of contract by a health care provider can obtain a prompt determination and adjudication of his claim and the determination of fair and reasonable compensation.” Section 102 of the Health Care Services Malpractice Act, Act of October 15, 1975, <em>as amended, </em>40 P.S. § 1301.102.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> To implement these goals, the Act calls for the creation of the Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund. To participate in the Fund, the Act requires health care providers to purchase a minimum amount of primary professional liability insurance coverage. The parties agree that at the time the primary policies were issued in favor of the physicians and HMC, they were required to maintain $200,000.00 in primary insurance per occurrence each. 40 P.S. § 1301.701(a). The Fund pays “settlements ... against a health care provider ... to the extent such health <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>care provider’s share exceeds [this $200,000.00 in] basic coverage in effect at the time of occurrence.” 40 P.S. § 1301.701(d). To maintain the Fund, the General Assembly requires health care providers to pay an annual surcharge<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> on the primary insurance premium.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> 40 P.S. § 1301.701(e).

    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.6",281,[224,884,1155,618]]]'>An understanding of the levels of insurance coverage HMC obtained for itself and its physician employees is also essential to this case. The best way to conceptualize the layers of insurance is to imagine two columns, each with four layers; the first column showing the insurance HMC obtained for its physicians and the second showing the apparently identical coverage it obtained on its own behalf. The bottom level of each column represents a $200,000.00 self-insured layer of basic coverage. The next level shows the $1,000,000.00 Fund limit of liability. The third layer is a self-insured excess layer of $3,000,000.00. The fourth represents a $25,000,000.00 layer of excess insurance.</p>

We first consider a situation in which the <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>parties settle for $200,000.00. Such a settlement would indisputably not require recourse to HMC’s column of insurance because the primarily liable physician has sufficient insurance coverage to finance the settlement. Similarly, a case with a settlement value of $1,200,000.00 would also not require monies from HMC’s column of coverage because the payment from the physician’s first layer plus the full amount of the physician’s statutory coverage would satisfy the claim. A claim greater than $1,200,000.00 but less than $1,400,000.00 would also not raise the issue in this case because, regardless of whether the additional $200,000.00 comes from the physician’s self-insured excess layer or HMC’s self-insured primary layer of coverage, the resources for the settlement would come from HMC.</p>
    <p id="b282-4" data-blocks='[["BL_282.5",282,[231,1095,1161,582]]]'>The issue arises where, as here, the settlement amounts in the underlying medical malpractice actions were each in excess of $1,400,000.00. A settlement in excess of $1,400,000.00 requires a determination of whether settlement amounts must be paid from the third level of the physician’s column, the level representing $3,000,000.00 in self-insured excess coverage, or the second level of HMC’s insurance column, representing the statutory coverage of HMC. The Fund contends that the additional settlement funds should come from the physician’s excess insurance layer and HMC contends that they should come from the second layer of HMC’s column.</p>

HMC refers this Court to the use of the word “any” and argues that it refers to both of the two categories of health care providers, the physicians and the hospital. HMC reasons that the words “no insurer providing excess professional liability insurance to any health care provider ... shall be liable for payment of any claim against a health care provider for any loss or damages except those in excess of the fund coverage limits” means that HMC need not make payment out of its self-insured excess layer until the Fund pays its statutory insurance on behalf of <em>both </em>the physicians and HMC.</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[217,937,1154,643]]]'>The Fund maintains that Section 1301.705(a) provides that an excess insurer of the physician health care provider need not make payment unless the loss exceeds the Fund coverage limits for that provider. In the underlying cases, the Fund argued that its payment of the limits of the physicians’ coverage satisfied the requirement of Section 1301.705. The Fund further asserts that the self-insured excess coverage of HMC is triggered because the amount of the loss exceeds the fund coverage limits for the physicians. Consequently, the Fund submits that Section 1301.705(a) authorizes it to require HMC to exhaust the insurance coverage available to the physicians before the Fund is required to accept the tender of HMC.</p>

We believe that both parties have read too much into the statute. Contrary to the position of HMC the statute does not prohibit the Fund from requiring HMC to exhaust the physicians’ coverage. A fair interpretation of the statute is that the excess carrier for any particular health care provider need not make payment unless the loss exceeds the Fund’s coverage limits for that provider. However, contrary to the Fund’s interpretation, the statute also does not expressly grant the Fund leave to deem coverage of HMC not implicated until exhaustion of the physician’s coverage.</p>
