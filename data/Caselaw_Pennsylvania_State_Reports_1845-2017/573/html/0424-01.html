Rather, the lead Justices narrowly construed the appellant’s argument as presenting solely the issue of whether a judicially-imposed public policy exception should be implemented. <em>See <a href="/pa/570/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="810 A.2d 99" data-case-ids="270252,9307221" data-case-paths="/pa/570/0464-01,/a2d/810/0099-01">id.</a> </em>at 474-75 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7, <a href="/pa/570/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="810 A.2d 99" data-case-ids="270252,9307221" data-case-paths="/pa/570/0464-01,/a2d/810/0099-01">810 A.2d at </a>104-05 &amp; n. 7.

That <em>Reinforced Earth </em>itself contains the seeds for such confusion is manifested in Petitioners’ submissions, since Petitioners read the opinion as establishing, <em>inter alia, </em>that “an illegal alien who is injured in the course of his employment is entitled to receive benefits for total disability,” and, on such <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>basis, would concede the underlying question. <em>See Application of DDP Contracting Company, Inc. and Its Workers’ Compensation Insurance Carrier Penn National Insurance, </em>577 EAL 2002 at 2 (filed Jan. 29, 2003).</p>

Further, although I also view as significant the third question presented by Petitioners, which concerns the administration of partial disability benefits in relation an undocumented workers (assuming that such persons are “employes”), I believe that it is important for the Court to first resolve the central question regarding the statute’s scope. Accordingly, I would also deny review concerning Petitioners’ third question in the context of the present petitions.</p>
