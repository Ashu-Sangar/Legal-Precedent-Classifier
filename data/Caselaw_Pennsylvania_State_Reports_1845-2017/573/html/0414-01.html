Belak counters that the Commonwealth waived its argument here by failing to articulate specifically that it was seeking to sentence Belak under section 9714(a)(2). The record, however, belies Belak’s argument, as it shows that at Belak’s sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth expressly stated that it was seeking to sentence Belak under “Subsection A-(2) of Section 9714.’’ R.R. at 410. Although the Commonwealth did send a letter to Belak's trial counsel prior to sentencing in which it notified counsel that it would seek to sentence Belak under section 9714(a)(1), in that same letter, the Commonwealth also stated that it intended to seek a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, which is only consistent with sentencing under section 9714(a)(2). R. at 15; <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9714(a)(2) (providing for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole upon conviction of a third or subsequent crime of violence if the court determines that a lesser sentence is insufficient to protect the public safety).</p>

Rather, he asserts that even if this Court finds that he was sentenced under section 9714(a)(2), his sentencing violated his constitutional rights to due process and trial by jury under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em><a href="/us/530/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="530 U.S. 466" data-case-ids="9413911" data-case-paths="/us/530/0466-01">530 U.S. 466</a>, <a href="/us/530/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="530 U.S. 466" data-case-ids="9413911" data-case-paths="/us/530/0466-01">120 S.Ct. 2348</a>, <a href="/us/530/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="530 U.S. 466" data-case-ids="9413911" data-case-paths="/us/530/0466-01">147 L.Ed.2d 435</a> (2000). In <em>Apprendi, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant’s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury require that any fact, other than the fact of a prior conviction, that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em><a href="/us/530/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="530 U.S. 466" data-case-ids="9413911" data-case-paths="/us/530/0466-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/530/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="530 U.S. 466" data-case-ids="9413911" data-case-paths="/us/530/0466-01">at 490</a>, <a href="/us/530/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="530 U.S. 466" data-case-ids="9413911" data-case-paths="/us/530/0466-01">120 S.Ct. 2348</a>. Belak essentially argues that under <em>Apprendi, </em>it was necessary for the trial court here to submit the question of whether the victims of Belak's burglaries were present during the commission of the offenses for proof beyond a reasonable doubt because this fact made Belak’s burglaries crimes of violence, thus increasing his maximum sentence here for his first-degree felony burglary conviction by thirty years. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9714(g) (defining a crime of violence in relevant part as “burglary of a structure adapted for overnight accommodation in which at the time of the offense any person is present”). <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>

A stipulation is a declaration that a fact agreed upon is proven, and it must be enforced according to its terms. <em>See Commonwealth v.
