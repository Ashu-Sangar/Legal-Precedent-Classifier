    <p id="b799-7" data-blocks='[["BL_799.8",799,[206,1021,1156,253]]]'>The State College Area School District (District) employed Grieb as a part-time health and physical education teacher. In 1997, the Board of School Directors adopted a Weapons Policy<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> for the District, which prohibits the possession of weapons in any District building or on school property.</p>
    <p id="b799-8" data-blocks='[["BL_799.9",799,[206,1297,1153,414]],["BL_800.1",800,[246,320,1159,96]]]'>Grieb explained that on the evening of September 14, 1999, she was in the process of moving to a new residence after losing her home in an eminent domain proceeding. She loaded her car with her personal belongings, which included books, lamps, clothing, CDs, and three unloaded shotguns. One shotgun was placed on the back seat of her car and the other two shotguns on the floor of her vehicle. Grieb said that she left these items in the car overnight because it was raining <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>when she arrived at her new residence and she intended to unload the items before leaving for work the next morning.</p>
    <p id="b800-4" data-blocks='[["BL_800.5",800,[247,439,1161,576]]]'>At approximately 6:00 a.m., the District unexpectedly called Grieb requesting that she fill-in for another teacher immediately even though she was not scheduled to work until 11:30 a.m. Grieb agreed to substitute teach and proceeded to school, forgetting that the three unloaded shotguns were in her car. Upon arriving on school property, Grieb parked her car in an area of the parking lot that was for staff members only and she locked the door after exiting the vehicle. At approximately 2:45 p.m., a custodian who parked beside Grieb’s car noticed the weapons in the car and alerted the school administration. The District subsequently suspended Grieb without pay.</p>
    <p id="b800-5" data-blocks='[["BL_800.6",800,[244,1037,1170,1329]]]'>Grieb sought unemployment benefits. The Referee found that Grieb violated the District’s Weapons Policy by transporting three shotguns onto school property, and that she had no justification for her actions. In denying Grieb’s request for unemployment benefits, the Referee concluded that she had engaged in willful misconduct, rendering her ineligible for compensation pursuant to Section 402(e). The Board affirmed the Referee’s decision and the Commonwealth Court affirmed the decision of the Board. The Commonwealth Court held that Grieb violated the District’s Weapons Policy by parking a car that contained three unloaded shotguns on school property. Furthermore, it determined that the explanation of Grieb that she forgot the unloaded shotguns were in the vehicle at the time she parked her car on school property did not establish good cause to violate the policy. The Commonwealth Court recognized that an unintentional, inadvertent violation of an employer’s work rule does not constitute willful misconduct. However, it determined that an exception to that general rule exists where the conduct of an employee “could jeopardize an employer’s effective operations or place the public at risk.” <em>Grieb v.

The relevant exception provided in § 402 is the willful misconduct standard itself. The Courts are not authorized to dilute this standard premised upon perceived special needs of various occupations or employers. Any such request, being in essence a question of policy, is more properly directed to the General Assembly.</blockquote>

      <em>Navickas, </em><a href="/pa/567/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="787 A.2d 284" data-case-ids="404511,404551,404583,9454528,9454534,9454550" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0296-01,/pa/567/0298-01,/pa/567/0297-01,/a2d/787/0284-01,/a2d/787/0284-02,/a2d/787/0284-03">787 A.2d at 291</a> (internal citations omitted). The General Assembly has determined through its enactment of Section 402(e) that if an employer discharges an employee because of willful misconduct, the employee is not entitled to unemployment compensation. Because the Commonwealth Court’s adoption of the public safety exception to this rule contravenes what the General Assembly provided for in Section 402(e), its application by the Commonwealth Court was improper. We are bound by the express words of the statute and cannot alter them to suit our own public policy predilections.</p>

Accordingly, we reverse the determination of the Commonwealth Court affirming the denial of unemployment compensation benefits to Grieb.</p>
