George Amrom, M.D. (Dr. Amrom) performed the surgical procedure and Yevgeny Lerner, M.D. (Dr. Lerner) provided anesthesia services.' During the procedure, Dr. Lerner was responsible for maintaining Robin’s respiratory status. Dr. Lerner administered excessive dosages of intravenous sedation, causing Robin to stop breathing. Although the physicians were able to resuscitate Robin, she suffered severe brain damage from the lack of oxygen, which ultimately caused her death on November 1,1998.</p>

Specifically, Lloyd points to the fact that AHERF did ultimately pay the surcharge and that the CAT Fund retained the late payment. Lloyd cites to <em>Brakeman v. Potomac Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">472 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">371 A.2d 193</a> (1977), in which this Court held that failure to provide timely notice of a claim will not result in forfeiture of coverage for that claim unless the insurance company can show that it suffered prejudice as a result of the untimely notice. However, <em>Brakeman </em>is inapposite to the case <em>sub judice.</em>

In the present case, however, the CAT Fund is not an insurance company and it had not collected the surcharge at the time Dr. Lerner notified it of the possible claim of Lloyd. AHERF only paid the surcharge after the CAT Fund informed it that it would not cover the claim because of the failure to remit the payment. To require the CAT Fund to cover a health care provider who fails to pay a required surcharge on time would have the effect of making the sur<a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>charge payment an option. It would be absurd to allow health care providers to forego their surcharge payments until a possible claim arises. The only way the CAT Fund is able to operate is by collecting annual surcharge payments from all health care providers. Lloyd has failed to provide this Court with controlling authority requiring the CAT Fund to demonstrate prejudice prior to denying coverage for failure to make a timely surcharge payment. Even if we were to find the existence of such a requirement, the CAT Fund would clearly suffer prejudice if it were required to cover health care providers who remit their surcharge payments only after a possible claim arises. <em>See generally Dellenbaugh.</em>

Having determined that the regulation at 31 Pa.Code § 242.17(b) was valid and that the CAT Fund acted "within the confines of this regulation, the issue of whether a claim of bad faith could be maintained against the CAT Fund is moot because the CAT Fund cannot be deemed to have acted in bad faith for acting pursuant to a valid regulation.
