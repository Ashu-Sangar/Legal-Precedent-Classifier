For example, as we alluded to in <em>Moms I, </em>under certain circumstances application of section 9545 may not be constitutional as applied to the parties before the court. <em>See, e.g., Moms I, </em><a href="/a2d/771/0721-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="771 A.2d 721" data-case-ids="11101728,124707" data-case-paths="/a2d/771/0721-01,/pa/565/0001-01">771 A.2d at </a>734 n. 14, 735 n. 16 (discussing that circumstances, such as failing to have adequate time to review the petition or failure to have a petition “pending” before our court, may arise where the application of section 9545(c) to a particular claimant may render that section unconstitutional as applied in those circumstances). Additionally, as discussed infra, some claims may not fall within the parameters of the PCRA, such as a claim of habeas corpus or coram nobis. However, Appellant does not challenge the constitutionality of the PCRA as applied in his particular case nor does he raise a claim that is outside the parameters of the PCRA. Thus, all of the issues in this case are within the rubric of the PCRA and we will limit our consideration to whether this court should grant a stay of execution outside the framework of section 9545(c) where a second or subsequent petition for post-conviction relief is filed pursuant to the PCRA and an appeal on that petition is pending before this court.</p>

Subsection 9545(c)(1) provides that “[n]o court shall have the authority to issue a stay of execution in any case except as allowed under this subchapter.” The introduction of this subsection with “[n]o court” makes clear that this provision is intended to apply to all courts of this Commonwealth.</p>

We have already concluded that the PCRA court is bound by the requirements of <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>this subsection and can only enter a stay when such requirements are met. <em>See Monis I, </em><a href="/a2d/771/0721-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="771 A.2d 721" data-case-ids="11101728,124707" data-case-paths="/a2d/771/0721-01,/pa/565/0001-01">771 A.2d at 739-40</a>. We see no reason to depart from this conclusion merely because the application for the stay of execution is in front of this court. Section 9545(c) conditions the exercise of the power to stay an execution on a showing that <em>“a </em>petition for postconvietion relief which meets all the requirements of this subchapter has been filed and is pending and the petitioner makes a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits.” As discussed previously, the legislature crafted the PCRA, including this provision, in order to accord criminal matters finality. <em><a href="/a2d/771/0721-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="771 A.2d 721" data-case-ids="11101728,124707" data-case-paths="/a2d/771/0721-01,/pa/565/0001-01">Id.</a> </em>The interest in finality is not altered simply because the petition is pending before this court rather than the court below. Indeed, this court has repeatedly cautioned against encouraging further delays in capital matters by allowing claimants to file serial collateral petitions. <em>Commonwealth v.

Unlike questions of retroactivity, questions of timeliness are jurisdictional threshold questions that are clearly delineated by the terms of the PCRA—the PCRA defines what constitutes a timely-filed petition. It is the claimant’s burden to establish that a court has jurisdiction over the claims raised in the petition. Thus, any jurisdictional questions should be well fleshed out in advance and we believe that issues related to timeliness should be relatively easy to dispose of by the time they reach this court. In the event that this court is confronted with a complex question as to the timeliness of a PCRA petition, we can analyze the stay provision in context at that time.</p>

Absent such a finding, an appeal may be taken from the denial of the motion.” <a href="/pa/510/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="510 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1797026" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0336-01">508 A.2d at 291</a>. Appellant suggests that we adopt a similar “non-frivolous” standard in the context of collateral petitions in order to ensure that a claimant is not executed without receiving review of his claims of error.

Since the Majority does not suggest that our stay order was authorized under Section <em>9545(c)—i.e., </em>appellant did not “make a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits” of his appeal <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>from the dismissal of his time-barred, second petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541 <em>et </em>seq.—it can only have resulted from our “inherent powers.” Thus, the Commonwealth correctly notes: “It would be an appeal to fantasy to suggest that this Court did not have the power to grant a stay that was not authorized by § 9545(c), because it has already exercised that power in this case.” Brief for Appellee, 6. That assessment is beyond cavil.</p>
    <p id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[199,751,1157,1269]]]'>In my view, this Court has the inherent power to grant a stay in any case in order to properly perform our constitutional duty. But, the contours of the power cannot be divorced from the case in which it is requested to be exercised. In this case, the General Assembly has specifically spoken to the availability of a stay in one narrow context: litigation of a serial PCRA petition. As the Majority notes, we held in <em>Commonwealth v. Morris, </em><a href="/pa/565/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="565 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="124707" data-case-paths="/pa/565/0001-01">565 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/a2d/771/0721-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="771 A.2d 721" data-case-ids="11101728,124707" data-case-paths="/a2d/771/0721-01,/pa/565/0001-01">771 A.2d 721</a> (2001) <em>(Morris I), </em>that Section 9545(c) is “substantive in nature, not procedural, and thus, was a valid exercise” of legislative authority, and that the statute was constitutional. Op. at 167, 822 A.2d at 690. Since there is valid legislation controlling the matter, resort to this Court’s inherent power is both unnecessary and inappropriate. The diluted standards offered up by appellant in place of those embodied in the legislative enactment wrongly assume that this Court may simply ignore valid legislation. In any event, the standard provided in the PCRA and explicated in <em>Morris I </em>is more than adequate to ensure the orderly consideration of serial PCRA appeals, and to identify those rare cases where a particular death warrant must be enjoined to permit review of the denial of a serial PCRA petition. This standard is also, in my judgment, more than adequate to vindicate this Court’s inherent stay power in this context.</p>

This modest and sensible restriction—if it can be said to be a restriction of this Court’s inherent power at all rather than legislation effectuating that power—merely creates a theoretical possibility that a lawful sentence of death will be carried out in Pennsylvania. <em>See Sayres v.

    <p id="b386-5" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[240,1181,1163,1060]]]'>The important preliminary question in the aftermath of our stay order is whether, in a system of separated powers such as that which undergirds our governing scheme, we should have entered the stay order on June 21, 2001. The Majority clearly recognizes this question, <em>see </em>op. at 174, 822 A.2d at 694 (“we must now consider whether the stay of execution was warranted”), but never answers it directly. Instead, the Majority decides the merits of the underlying appeal <em>(ie., </em>whether the PCRA court was correct in concluding that the serial PCRA petition was time-barred), and only then states “we cannot continue the stay in this matter” and vacates it. Op. at 182, 822 A.2d at 699. I would confront the predicate question directly and acknowledge that our previous order was erroneously entered, since Section 9545(c) controls and appellant never made the showing required by it to obtain the stay. This Court should not give the impression that years of reflection, and a full-blown opinion addressing the merits of the time-barred- appeal, are required before this Court will rule upon a request for a stay of execution pending an appeal from the denial of a serial PCRA petition.</p>

Op. at 165, 822 A.2d at 691. I do agree with the Majority that, in order to secure a stay of execution in connection with an appeal from the dismissal of a serial PCRA petition, the petitioner must make “a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits.” I note that the Majority’s plain language approach is consistent with that set forth in my concurring opinion -in <em>Monis I: ie., </em>the Majority applies the actual PCRA stay language, rather than invoking the test employed by federal courts construing federal habeas corpus appeal standards. <em>See Moms I, </em>771 A.2d at 746-750 (Castille, J., concurring) (discussing distinction in purpose and meaning of standards). The Majority’s decision in this regard is wise.

Op. at 171, 822 A.2d at 692. <em>Tyler </em>involved the federal habeas statute’s restriction upon the filing of successive federal habeas petitions—a restriction that requires the petitioner to secure approval of the federal court of appeals before he may pursue a successive petition and which requires the federal appellate court to determine, within thirty days of the application, whether one of the two narrow exceptions to the ban on successive federal petitions has been met. <a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="28 U.S.C. § 2244">28 U.S.C. § 2244</a>(b). <em>Tyler’s </em>federal statutory interpretation does not involve any principle of federal law that binds this Court, nor does <em>Tyler </em>even speak to the distinct statutory interpretation issue before us. Certainly, appellant may forward to the General Assembly his rather simplistic equation that “(allegedly) complex issues should lead to a stay of execution as a matter of right” and seek to have the PCRA stay legislation amended accordingly. But nothing in Tyler’s discussion of the federal habeas statute remotely supports the notion that this Court is obliged as a matter of federal law, or even as a matter of inherent power, to ignore the stay statute in favor of the proffered equation. Indeed, since <em>Tyler </em>upheld the federal construct requiring a serial federal habeas petitioner to make his showing in the stringent thirty-day statutory limit or be denied authority to pursue a successive petition, even as academic authority, the decision undercuts appellant’s position.</p>

State Ethics Comm’n, </em><a href="/pa/569/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="569 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="312804" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0579-01">569 Pa. 579</a>, <a href="/pa/569/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="807 A.2d 812" data-case-ids="312804,312806" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0579-01,/pa/569/0578-01">807 A.2d 812</a> (2002) (Saylor, J.). In short, and in my judgment, implementation of the General Assembly’s present design for post-conviction review resides at the boundary between legislative and judicial power. Where the Legislature has proceeded in such circumstances, I have taken the position that a degree of comity is appropriate and deference due to such aspects of its design as may be deemed reasonable, although these may nonetheless have a procedural dynamic. <em>See id. </em>at 601, <a href="/pa/569/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="807 A.2d 812" data-case-ids="312804,312806" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0579-01,/pa/569/0578-01">807 A.2d at 826</a>. I believe that the legislative prescription requiring a strong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits as a prerequisite to a stay of execution predicated on a second or subsequent post-conviction petition is a reasonable one. The Court must, of course, be diligent in ensuring the necessary review concerning whether such likelihood is present, in the face of an impending execution.</p>
