After verifying this information by checking appellant’s criminal record, two uniformed officers interviewed the neighbor at his apartment, across the hall from appellant’s residence. The neighbor stated he had seen appellant with a gun earlier that day.</p>

The officers informed appellant about the complaint against him and invited him to discuss it outside. Appellant told the officers they could speak to him where they were. The officers told appellant there was a complaint he had been carrying a firearm earlier in the day, and asked if there was a firearm in the residence. Appellant, “[i]n a loud, vulgar manner,” stated it was none of the officers’ business whether he had a gun or not. N.T., 3/17/00, at 10. The officers then asked if they could search the residence. Appellant responded “not without a warrant,” and told the officers to leave. One officer described Appellant’s conduct as “violent and belligerent.” Id.</p>

The version of § 6105 in effect when <em>Todd </em>was decided read: “No person who has been convicted in this Commonwealth or elsewhere of a crime of violence shall own a firearm, or have one in his possession or under his control.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 6105. Because this version of § 6105 did not define “firearm,” this Court turned to § 6102’s definition, which contained specific barrel length requirements.</p>
    <p id="b307-5" data-blocks='[["BL_307.6",307,[231,1146,1155,692]]]'>In 1995, however, the General Assembly amended the Act. Section 6102’s definition of “firearm” was amended to include the word “length” following the word “barrel,” and § 6105 was completely rewritten to include its current definition of “firearm.” Appellant argues the addition of the word “length” to § 6102 evinces the legislature’s intent that barrel length remain an essential element of all firearms offenses, and asks this Court to interpret § 6105(i)’s definition as merely adding to § 6102’s definition. However, § 6105(i) explicitly states its broader definition of “firearm” is to be “... used in this section only,” which pertains to convicted criminals. Clearly the definition in § 6105 is there for a reason, which is to settle what a former convict may not possess.</p>
    <p id="b307-6" data-blocks='[["BL_307.7",307,[232,1899,1153,477]]]'>The current version of § 6105 also expanded the class of convictions from “crime[s] of violence” to include certain potentially violent crimes. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 6105(b). The clear purpose of § 6105 is to protect the public from convicted criminals who possess firearms, regardless of whether the previous crimes were actually violent or the barrel of the firearm was a certain length.

Section 6102 specifically states its definition of “firearm” is “[s]ubject to additional definitions contained in subsequent provisions of this subchapter----” 18 Pa.C.S. § 6102. Merely adding § 6105’s projectile/explosion requirement to § 6102, as appellant suggests, would be redundant, since any weapons with barrel lengths specified in that section are already capable of expelling a projectile by an explosive action.

While there is no hard and fast list of factors evincing voluntariness, some considerations include: “1) the defendant’s custodial status; 2) the use of duress or <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>coercive tactics by law enforcement personnel; 3) the defendant’s knowledge of his right to refuse to consent; 4) the defendant’s education and intelligence; 5) the defendant’s belief that no incriminating evidence will be found; and 6) the extent and level of the defendant’s cooperation with the law enforcement personnel.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Therefore, telling appellant he would have to step outside until a warrant could be obtained was reasonable, to ensure the safety of the officers and the others in the home, and in the building.

In addition, I would also distinguish the detention of Appellant in this case from those instances where the consent to search follows custody occurring in connection with a traffic stop, <em>see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Freeman, </em><a href="/pa/563/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="563 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="1366996" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0082-01">563 Pa. 82</a>, <a href="/a2d/757/0903-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="757 A.2d 903" data-case-ids="11243702" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0903-01">757 A.2d 903</a> (2000), or in the context of narcotics interdiction at an airport, <em>see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Mack, </em><a href="/pa/568/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="568 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="163542" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0329-01">568 Pa. 329</a>, <a href="/pa/568/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="796 A.2d 967" data-case-ids="163542,163576,163736,9445070,9445094,9445170" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0329-01,/pa/568/0328-01,/pa/568/0328-02,/a2d/796/0967-01,/a2d/796/0967-02,/a2d/796/0967-03">796 A.2d 967</a> (2002) (plurality opinion). Here, the detention would not have occurred but for Appellant’s belligerent behavior. Nevertheless, on this record, I cannot conclude <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>that the consent resulted from an essentially free and unconstrained choice, as opposed to duress or coercion, express or implied, <em>see Strickler, </em><a href="/pa/563/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="563 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1367019" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0047-01">563 Pa. at 79</a>, 757 A.2d at 901; rather, Appellant’s response to the threat to obtain a warrant, which he uttered while pinned against a couch 'with his arms handcuffed behind his back, more closely resembles acquiescence or submission.</p>
