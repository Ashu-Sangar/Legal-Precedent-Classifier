      <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>The record below establishes that on October 11, 1998 at approximately 2:30 in the morning, James Crawford was standing in front of a bar at the corner of Lawrence and Indiana Streets in Philadelphia. Jeanine Davis, the girlfriend of Crawford’s cousin, approached Crawford with the intent of procuring drugs from him. Crawford and Davis walked into a nearby abandoned house at the corner of Leithgow and Indiana Streets for the purpose of using drugs. When the two entered the house, Nick Cruz was inside. Meanwhile, Appellant and his half-uncle, Michael Centeno, drove up in a car and parked in the middle of Leithgow Street. Appellant and Centeno exited the car and walked toward the corner of Lawrence and Indiana Streets, where Crawford’s Mend Robert Kennedy was standing. As Appellant approached Kennedy, he asked Kennedy if anybody had any drugs. In response, Kennedy yelled for Crawford. Crawford told Davis and Cruz that he would be right back, and he left the house.</p>
    <p id="b810-4" data-blocks='[["BL_810.5",810,[231,1314,1161,427]]]'>A few minutes later, Davis, who was standing inside the house, saw Appellant and Crawford together directly in front of the house.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> As Appellant began to walk away from Crawford, Davis heard Crawford yell, “Yo, man, give me my s-t.” N.T., 12/27/1999, at 70. In response, she heard Appellant command Crawford to “[b]ack up.” <em><a href="/pa/539/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="652 A.2d 308" data-case-ids="474243,7867065" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0299-01,/a2d/652/0308-01">Id.</a> </em>Davis then saw Appellant turn around and shoot Crawford in the chest from about three feet away.</p>
    <p id="b810-5" data-blocks='[["BL_810.6",810,[228,1785,1163,372]]]'>Once Crawford fell to the ground, Davis watched Appellant turn around in a circle and look around, which gave her a clear view of Appellant’s face. She recognized Appellant from having previously seen him in the neighborhood. Davis then observed Appellant walk across the street and climb into the passenger seat of the car parked on Leithgow Street. The car sped away.</p>

      <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>Davis subsequently gave a statement to police in which she described the shooter as a six-foot-tall Hispanic male with a thin build, about twenty to twenty-five years old, which is consistent with Appellant’s physical description. Using these characteristics, police generated a line-up containing 106 different photographs. Out of this line-up, Davis selected two different photographs of Appellant and stated that he was the shooter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b811-5" data-blocks='[["BL_811.5",811,[233,772,1157,1054]]]'>On November 17, 1998, Appellant was arrested and interviewed by police. Appellant gave a statement to police, admitting that he had been present at the shooting but accusing Centeno of robbing and shooting Crawford. According to Appellant’s statement, as he was on his way to buy drugs at Lawrence and Indiana Streets, he ran into Centeno. When Centeno found out where Appellant was going, he decided to join him, telling Appellant that he was looking to “stick somebody up” and promising to split the proceeds of the robbery with Appellant. N.T., 12/28/1999, at 48 (testimony of Philadelphia Police Detective Richard Reinhold, in which he read Appellant’s statement into evidence). Appellant claimed that on the way, Centeno showed him the gun he planned to use to commit the robbery, but Appellant contended that he did not know that Centeno was going to shoot anyone. Appellant also claimed that upon arriving at Lawrence and Indiana Streets, he bought a bag of heroin and four rocks of crack cocaine from Crawford and then walked away. Soon thereafter, according to Appellant, he heard a shot and saw Centeno running down Leithgow Street with a gun in his hand.</p>

The Commonwealth also introduced <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>Appellant’s police statement into evidence to show that Appellant had admitted to being present during the shooting. Furthermore, Dr. Gregory McDonald, a forensic pathologist, testified that Crawford died of a gunshot that was fired into his chest from point-blank range. Officer James Joyce, an expert in firearms identification, testified that the fatal bullet had been fired from a nine-millimeter or a thirty-eight-caliber handgun, which was consistent with the nine-millimeter cartridge case found by police at the scene of the shooting.</p>
    <p id="b812-5" data-blocks='[["BL_812.5",812,[221,837,1164,528]]]'>Given this record, we agree with the trial court that the evidence was clearly sufficient to sustain Appellant’s conviction for first-degree murder. As detailed above, there was more than sufficient evidence presented at trial from which the jury could have concluded that Appellant deliberately fired a shot into Crawford’s chest, a vital part of the body, and that the gunshot caused Crawford’s death. <em>See Bond, </em><a href="/pa/539/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="652 A.2d 308" data-case-ids="474243,7867065" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0299-01,/a2d/652/0308-01">652 A.2d at 310-11</a> (evidence was sufficient to establish first-degree murder where defendant deliberately fired a fatal shot into the victim’s chest from close range).</p>
    <p id="b812-6" data-blocks='[["BL_812.6",812,[218,1391,1164,797]]]'>Appellant argues, however, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his first-degree-murder conviction because the Commonwealth contradicted itself by having Davis identify Appellant as the shooter while also offering into evidence Appellant’s statement, in which Appellant identified Centeno as the shooter. However, contrary to Appellant’s assertion, the Commonwealth did not contradict itself. Rather, the record reveals that the Commonwealth introduced Appellant’s statement into evidence for the limited purpose of showing that Appellant had admitted to being present at the scene of the shooting and therefore had the opportunity to commit the crime. Thus, Davis’s identification of Appellant as the shooter did not in any way contradict the Commonwealth’s use of Appellant’s statement, and Appellant’s insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim necessarily fails.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

      <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>In his second and third claims, Appellant essentially argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court’s jury instruction on accomplice liability and for failing to file a motion <em>in limine </em>in order to redact references to drugs in Appellant’s statement to the police. This Court recently held in <em>Commonwealth v. Grant </em>that ineffectiveness claims must generally be brought on collateral appeal, as opposed to direct appeal. <em>Commonwealth v.
