Yerkes (“Mother”) were married in November 1978 and separated in August 1992. During their marriage, the parties had two children: Amy, born in January 1988, and Richard, born in August 1988. Immediately following the parties’ separation, Mother sought child support from Father. The parties eventually reached an agreement for support in November 1992, whereby Father was to pay one hundred dollars per week for the support of Amy and Richard. Later the same month, the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County ordered compliance with the agreement and further directed that it be accomplished by payroll deductions from Father’s regular paychecks.</p>

He was ultimately convicted of aggravated indecent assault and has been incarcerated for that crime since August 1994. Father is currently imprisoned at the State Correctional Institute at Huntingdon, Pennsylvania (“SCI-Huntingdon”), and will be released by August 2004.</p>

The parties were directed to meet at a support conference to take place in August 1997, although Father did not appear because of his incarceration. Following the conference, the conference officer recommended that the petition be dismissed on account of Father’s conviction for assaulting Amy, who was a beneficiary of the support order. The trial court agreed and dismissed Father’s petition later in August 1997.</p>

He also contends that the trial court erred in essentially adopting a <em>per se </em>rule barring modification or termination where the victim of the parent’s criminal acts is also the beneficiary of the support order.

Thus, the scenario-one child suffers during the obligor’s incarceration, but there is a possibility of compensation at some point in the future.

      <blockquote id="b505-8" data-blocks='[["BL_505.7",505,[292,1508,1087,542]]]'>A prison sentence is often referred to as payment for a debt to society. However, a prisoner’s debt is hardly being paid if the prisoner is simultaneously incurring another debt to society by failing to pay child support obligations. Therefore, if the parent is unable to pay child support during incarceration, this "second” debt can and should be repaid upon release. This is not an additional punishment or fine, but is a simple reimbursement to the state for what the parent was obligated to pay in the first place. Likewise, public policy considerations require that other family members or private individuals who paid the child support owed by the obligor during the obligor’s incarceration, should be reimbursed for their expenditures. Private individuals should not be forced to assume the responsibility and obligations of the incarcerated parent any more than the state should.</blockquote>

In addition, the argument that the "no justification rule" unfairly burdens incarcerated parents upon their release from prison is undermined by the fact that, in Pennsylvania, the General Assembly has enacted a statute under which incarcerated obligors are prevented from being placed in an impossible position upon release on account of significant arrearages. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 4348(g) (limiting attachment of child support obligations and arrears to percentage set forth in federal Consumer Credit Protection Act). Moreover, we note that significant arrearages will not ordinarily result in a contempt adjudication, as any failure to pay support upon the parent’s release will likely be justifiable given his or her inability to comply with the support order at that time. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 4345 (requiring willful failure to comply with support order for contempt adjudication); Pa.RX.P. No.1910.25-1(b) (requiring finding of willfulness and a present ability to comply prior to contempt adjudication for failure to pay child support).
