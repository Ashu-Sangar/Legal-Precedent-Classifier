The result was that the only court to pass upon the actual merits of the election dispute concluded that the candidate did not belong on the primary ballot.

Hence, I would not ordinarily write to explain a dissent to a per curiam order such as this one where the issue has been rendered moot. But in this case there were avoidable errors in the conduct of the litigation itself, errors which served to artificially compress the already-truncated time available for review of an election challenge. In addition to preventing an ultimate merits resolution prior to the election, that avoidable compression of time obliged this Court to entertain a series of emergency filings in a matter that never should have reached the point of “emergency.” The contemporaneous litigation of various facets of the dispute in various courts also led to a confusion of circumstances such that the parties and the courts below may have misinterpreted the meaning and effect <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>of various orders from this Court.

So transformed, the Commonwealth Court granted the application and ordered the City Commissioners “to cease and desist from the removal of Fitzpatrick’s name from the May 20, 2003, primary ballot until her appeals have been resolved or until further order of this court.” Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Court neither passed upon the merits of Fitzpatrick’s appeal, nor did it determine whether the trial court properly issued a stay in the first instance under the <em>Process Gas </em>standard, despite the fact that petitioners had made both a merits argument and a <em>Process Gas </em>argument to the court.</p>

The standard for granting a stay of an order pending appeal is well-settled, and yet, neither of the courts below which acted to stay the removal order pending Fitzpatrick’s appeal ever suggested that she had met the <em>Process Gas </em>standard. Application of that standard should not have been difficult. The apparent basis for Fitzpatrick’s appeal is not a claim that Judge O’Grady erred in passing upon the additional 105 objections which were before him at the May 7th hearing, but rather that she should be permitted to relitigate 32 other challenges, which were sustained in the March 25th proceeding, but which she did not challenge in her initial appeal to Commonwealth Court. If Fitzpatrick believed that Judge O’Grady erred at the initial hearing in striking names of these particular voters, however, it was incumbent upon her to raise that challenge in her initial appeal to the Commonwealth Court. Her failure to do so results in waiver and, accordingly, she is distinctly unlikely to prevail upon the merits of her belated appeal from the May 7 th ruling. Accordingly, I would have granted petitioners’ Application, vacated the improvident stay entered by Judge O’Grady as well as the Commonwealth Court’s cease and desist order, and would have enforced Judge O’Grady’s substantive order removing Fitzpatrick from the ballot.

I realize that this Court has neither the time nor the resources to correct all errors below. I also realize that, notwithstanding the letter of the law — <em>ie., </em>the actual <em>Process Gas </em>standard ignored by two courts below—the timing and posture in which the stay issue presented itself to this Court made inaction seem like a less disruptive alternative, particularly since there was the possible nullification of error if the candidate lost.</p>

That the case was not decided in such an orderly and timely fashion—single hearing below, single direct appeal to the Commonwealth Court, and single allocatur petition here (if necessary)—resulted from entirely avoidable errors in judgment below, which I have already highlighted. I write to stress to the courts below the necessity for deciding such matters in a single, thorough and timely hearing and appeal. And, I write to stress to both courts below the necessity of ascertaining and applying the governing law when faced with a request for a stay, rather than essentially converting the prevailing party into the losing party and thereby creating an incentive for the losing party not to seek review of an adverse <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>ruling on the merits, in an election matter which involves a bedrock principle of our government, as soon as possible.</p>
