Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Astudillo), 570 Pa.464, 810 A.2d 99 (2002). Petitioners\u2019 Application for Relief is DENIED.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting statement.",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nThe first issue in these consolidated petitions for allowance of appeal is framed as follows:\nDid the Commonwealth Court err in ruling that an undocumented resident alien is entitled to receive benefits under the Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Act ... ?\nAs I read the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court in Reinforced Earth Co. v. WCAB (Astudillo), 570 Pa. 464, 810 A.2d 99 (2002), three Justices declined to address this central question of statutory interpretation, encompassing the issue of whether the General Assembly intended the key term \u201cemployee\u201d as used in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s core, operative provision, see 77 P.S. \u00a7 431, to include undocumented, resident aliens. Rather, the lead Justices narrowly construed the appellant\u2019s argument as presenting solely the issue of whether a judicially-imposed public policy exception should be implemented. See id. at 474-75 & n. 7, 810 A.2d at 104-05 & n. 7. Indeed, only two Justices squarely addressed the salient question of statutory interpretation, see Reinforced Earth, 570 Pa. at 485, 810 A.2d at 112 (Newman, J., dissenting, joined by Eakin, J.), for which they were criticized by the lead opinion. See Reinforced Earth, 570 Pa. at 475 n. 7, 810 A.2d at 105 n. 7 (Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court).\nIn light of the above, the Court\u2019s present remand for reconsideration in light of Reinforced Earth is confusing. That Reinforced Earth itself contains the seeds for such confusion is manifested in Petitioners\u2019 submissions, since Petitioners read the opinion as establishing, inter alia, that \u201can illegal alien who is injured in the course of his employment is entitled to receive benefits for total disability,\u201d and, on such basis, would concede the underlying question. See Application of DDP Contracting Company, Inc. and Its Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance Carrier Penn National Insurance, 577 EAL 2002 at 2 (filed Jan. 29, 2003).\nCertainly, the Court should definitively answer the statutory construction question that was avoided in Reinforced Earth. However, I do not regard this as an appropriate case to afford the necessary review, as Petitioners have now conceded this issue. Further, although I also view as significant the third question presented by Petitioners, which concerns the administration of partial disability benefits in relation an undocumented workers (assuming that such persons are \u201cemployes\u201d), I believe that it is important for the Court to first resolve the central question regarding the statute\u2019s scope. Accordingly, I would also deny review concerning Petitioners\u2019 third question in the context of the present petitions.\n. Mr. Justice Nigro's concurring opinion, which I joined, took issue with the manner in which the lead opinion limited the review. See Reinforced Earth, 570 Pa. at 481, 810 A.2d at 109.",
