I believe that the five-day notice requirement for meetings under the Non Profit Corporation Law, 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5703(b), is the minimum notice and that the corporation\u2019s bylaws cannot compress the time limitation. This matter itself demonstrates why the time limit must be a minimum, since various members of the charitable organization reside in the United States, South Africa and the Netherlands.",
