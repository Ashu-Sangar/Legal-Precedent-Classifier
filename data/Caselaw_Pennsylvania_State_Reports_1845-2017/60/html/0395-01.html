If no execution were ever to issue on the judgment, there might be less to complain of by the plaintiffs in error, or it might possibly be regarded as harmless. But the object of the sci. fa. on the lien, was to call on the defendants to show cause why the plaintiffs should not have execution of the premises bound by the lien; and if he should obtain judgment, the levari facias which would follow would contain a marídate to the sheriff to levy on and make the amount of the judgment recited in his writ with interest and costs, out of the premises as the same are described in the record: Act of June 16th 1836, § 21.</p>

The lien filed is against the fee; while the judgment is against the leasehold interest. If the leasehold interest only were sold, although the title would probably be void for want of a lien to support it, it might not concern the defendants directly, yet it would materially damage their interests, both in fixing a blot on their title, and most probably in creating litigation between the holder of the lease and a purchaser at the sale. A coal-mine might be destroyed almost, by suspension of operations during litigation, by becoming filled with water. These considerations show an interest in the defendants, not only to protect their title, but their interest as lessors, from a sale on the judgment rendered in this case, although it is not against them in point of fact.</p>

The Act of 17th February 1858, applicable only to Schuylkill and Luzerne counties, authorizes the filing of liens by mechanics and material-men against the estate or interest of the lessees, and the sale of their interests on judgments obtained thereon. As, therefore, the verdict has established that it was to a lessee, and for a leasehold estate, that the work and materials were furnished, it is manifest that only the interest could be bound; and no such lien having been filed upon it, there is no. lien to support this judgment against the defendants, for their estate was not debtor or bound — nor against Ell Hart &amp; Co., lessee, for the lien was not filed against his interest. We must therefore reverse the judgment. It seems that the plaintiff did file a claim against the lessee and contractor, Ell Hart, as Ell Hart &amp; Company, for the work and materials claimed for in this proceeding; if so, possibly he may be secured by proceedings on it; but about that we give no opinion, as it has not, in the view we have taken of the case, come properly within the range of our investigation.</p>
