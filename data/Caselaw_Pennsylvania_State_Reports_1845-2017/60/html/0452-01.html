R. Worrell, receiver, against Charles H. Wilson, commenced January 4th 1868. The declaration contained five counts, only one of which was insisted on. It was in trover for a quantity of goods belonging to the plaintiffs, which the defendant had distrained and sold for rent; the plaintiffs alleged that the distress was illegal.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b453-7" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[211,789,1156,473]]]'>The facts in the case were these. On the 1st of August 1866, the defendant leased to the plaintiffs as partners, a factory in Philadelphia for three years at the rent of $1000 per annum, payable quarterly. It was stipulated in the lease that the plaintiffs might give it up on six months’ notice of their intention so to do. On the 7th of November 1867, the plaintiffs owing $1150 for rent, proposed to surrender the lease, the defendant objecting and claiming the benefit of the six months’ notice; it was arranged that instead of requiring the notice $500 should be added to the rent; $1650 was the amount agreed on by the parties to be then due for rent, and the building was surrendered to the defendant.</p>

Wilson, James Seddon and Charles H. Wilson, for a dissolution of the partnership, an account, receiver and injunction. On the 23d'of November, an injunction was issued to the defendant restraining Mm from recording the assignment and from acting in any way under it. On the 27th of November, the plaintiff issued a warrant of distress for the rent stated to be $1659.50, and on the same day his bailiff levied on the goods of the plaintiffs on the premises. On the same day a notice of the distress was served on Theodore Wilson and Seddon, on the premises. Brisben received no notice. The goods were appraised on the 2d of December, at $3768. On the same day, by agreement of counsel, a decree was made, that the injunction should be made perpetual; that the firm should be dissolved; that E. R. Worrell should be appointed receiver. The sale under the distress was made December 9th, and on the 28th of the same month, upon the petition of the receiver, the court allowed him to employ counsel, and ordered Mm to institute suit against the defendant for the unlawful detention and conversion of the plaintiffs’ goods. In addition to the foregoing facts, the plaintiffs gave <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>evidence for the purpose of showing fraud between the defendant and Theodore Wilson and Seddon.</p>

The tenants came to the conclusion to surrender before the term ended; and it seems to have been agreed that six months’ rent, amounting to $500, should be considered as due and included with the rent past due. If you believe the testimony, all agreed to this, and for this reason I cannot direct you that the sale was illegal by reason of the $500 being included in the distress.

A notice to one of- the partners would have been sufficient. The notice, in point of time, was sufficient.

The Act of Assembly of March 21st 1772, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20370" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="1 Smith &amp; H. 370">1 Smith 370</a>, provides that the tenant shall have five days next after a distress and notice thereof wherein to replevy the goods: “ then and in such ease after such distress and notice as aforesaid, and expiration of the said five days,” an appraisement shall be made, and “after such appraisement” six days’ notice shall be given of sale. McKinney <em>v. </em>Reader determined that the rule adopted and applied in all other cases in the computation of time should also be the rule under this statute, notwithstanding the decision of Wallace <em>v. </em>King, 1 H. Blacks. 13, under the corresponding British statute; a case which, however, has since been expressly overruled as to. this point in Robinson <em>v. </em>Waddington, 13 Ad. &amp; Ell. 753. That rule is, that the time shall be computed excluding the day on which the act was done from which the count is to be made. It does not appear in the report of McKinney <em>v. </em>Reader on what day the appraisement in that case was made: all that does appear is in the statement of facts in the opinion of the court that as the fifth day from Tuesday, the day of the distress, fell on Sunday— <em>dies non juridieus </em>— the tenant had all the day following to replevy. The question, then, really was whether the landlord was a trespasser in leaving the goods on the premises during the five days.’ “Seeing, then,” says Kennedy, J., “this time was allowed him for this purpose, can it be considered as prejudicial to him that a reasonable portion of the leased premises was taken by his landlord and appropriated to the safe keeping of the goods distrained during that period ?” When it is once settled that the day of the distress is to be excluded in the computation of the time, the Act of Assembly itself determines the rest. The appraisement cannot be made on the fifth or last day. The words of the act are not open to any question or doubt. It is not to <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>be made until “after the expiration of the said five days.” It would be unwise to speculate about the reason of this, and to say . that provided the tenant had on the whole the time allowed by' the statute before the sale, as he undoubtedly may replevy after the five days as well as during their running, Jacob <em>v. </em>King, 5 Taunt. 451, it matters not to him except as to the costs when the appraisement is made. It could do him no harm, whether in anticipation of the regular time or afterwards. It is to be observed, however, that by the frame of the act, the six days’ notice of sale may be given at any time after the appraisement, so that to hold that it may be made on the fifth day, shortens the time of the required notice one whole day.
