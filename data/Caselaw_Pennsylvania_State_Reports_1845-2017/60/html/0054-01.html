Put the case that it should be provided that professional gentlemen, clergymen, lawyers and physicians, should only be required to prove their qualifications by their own oath or affirmation, or by their word of honor, as British peers, and all other persons by the testimony of one or more witnesses on oath or affirmation, would any one, lawyer or layman, hesitate to pronounce elections so conducted to be unequal, and the provision therefore unconstitutional ?

I have faithfully endeavored to discover, but without success. It was a wise foresight in the framers of the fundamental law to declare that elections should be equal. What more likely to occur in the heat of political strife, which so often blinds the eyes of men to what is just and right in the pursuit of victory, than that a majority in power should attempt to maintain it by throwing embarrassments in the way of certain classes, whose sentiments they might know or fear to be adverse to them, to make the process of voting more troublesome, uncertain, dilatory or expensive to them than to others, or to accomplish the same unjustifiable results as to some particular section of country, to whose inhabitants they may have rendered themselves obnoxious ? Even although the fact may be that no duly qualified elector is necessarily excluded from the exercise of the elective franchise, can the legislature make an invidious distinction between persons residing in one county and those residing in another any more than they can between different 'individual^ ? Indeed, the argument, if sound, must logically lead to the last inference. If the legislature can say that the rule for the people of Philadelphia shall be one, and that for the people of Pittsburg another, they can equally well say that the rule for John Doe shall be one, and for Richard Roe another. The Constitution has, therefore, as it appears to me, wisely ordained that election laws shall operate equally upon all citizens and upon all parts of the Commonwealth. It has said to the legislators:— <em>‘ </em>Whatever rules you establish in this matter, shall affect the rights of all your constituents alike. Although on other subjects you may adopt the policy of local legislation, on this most important one of elections, your laws shall be equal/</p>

The 1st section of the 3d article of the Constitution, in declaring that, ‘ in elections by the citizens, every white freeman of the age of twenty-one years, having within two years paid a state or county tax, which shall have been assessed at least ten days before the election, shall enjoy the rights of an elector,’ provides in effect that every such citizen shall have a period of time up to ten days before the election to procure himself to be assessed. If the legislature cannot directly enlarge or abridge this time, neither can they indirectly accomplish the same thing by appointing a different day for the closing of assessments. By the 28th section of the Act of April 17th 1869, it is expressly enacted, that ‘no extra assessments shall be made in said city after the 20th day of September in any year.’ This day, so determined positively as the last day upon which assessments can he made, must be seventeen, and may be twenty-three days before the second Tuesday of October. Thus the space of time allowed by the Constitution for assessment, has been manifestly abridged from seven to thirteen days. If it is competent to the legislature to do this, they might with equal show of right, enact that all assessments shall close six months before the election, and thus practically return to the Constitution of 1790, in disregard of the amendment of 1839.

It will be seen at once, that all those who from sickness or temporary absence from home, want of knowledge, or other circumstances, have not been able to make personal application to be assessed on or before the 20th of September, are precluded from the exercise of the elective franchise, unless it should happen that they have been assessed at some previous period. It cannot help a person to attend before the division canvassers on the tenth day before the election, for they have no power to assess a tax; nor can they, by the express words of the act,' place his name on the list unless he shall produce a receipt for the payment of a state or county tax, assessed agreeably to the Constitution.</p>

Keepers of hotels, taverns, sailors’ boarding-houses or restaurants. ‘ In making out the said lists, the assessors shall not place thereon the name of any person boarding at any hotel, tavern, sailors’ boarding-house or restaurant, or the name of any person who is not a qualified elector, having a fixed residence in the division.’ After this positive prohibition, we would naturally expect to find somewhere as positive a direction to place the names of these persons on the extra assessment list, or the list of the division canvassers, upon their personal application, and making their qualification to appear. The Constitution certainly does not exclude them. It does not require a fixed residence, whatever may be the meaning of that term. Admit, however, that they have the right to be placed on these subsequent lists, under the general words of the act, what is the evidence which they, as well as all others whose names are designedly or accidentally omitted from the division transcripts, are required to produce ?

The class upon whom this invidious burden is laid is large and respectable, comprehending journeymen mechanics, clerks in banks, insurance offices, and other corporations, as W'ell as in stores and manufactories, and unmarried workmen in all kinds of employment, who are usually hoarders in some shape or other.

No such requirement is made in any other part of the state, not in Pittsburg, nor in any other large city. There the testimony of one qualified elector is sufficient, whether he be a resident in the division or elsewhere, and that at the polls on the day of election, when of course the witness will not be required to vouch his belief in the existence of a qualification <em>in futuro. </em>But even if one of this unfortunate class of persons — being a private resident, or boarder at a private boarding-house — finds his name on the division transcript list, he is not safe. The division canvassers, at their session, on the tenth day before the election, or at any adjourned session to be held on the eighth day, may, in his absence, and without notice to him, strike his name from the list by drawing a line in red ink through the same, upon the testimony of two reputable citizens, qualified voters of the division, whose names appear on the said transcript, under the head of private householders, to be given under oath or affirmation, that such person is not a resident of the division, or is otherwise disqualified by law from voting at the said election (section 35). If he has procured himself to be placed on the extra assessment list by the production of the extraordinary evidence required for that, he is still at the mercy of the district canvassers, who, in his absence, and without notice, yes, and without evidence, may strike his name from the list. ‘ The said canvassers shall also examine and revise the extra assessment books of their respective divisions, and shall strike therefrom the names of all persons who are not residing in the division on the tenth day before the election.’ (Section 35.) Is it necessary to do more than simply recite these provisions ? Need I add that, in my judgment they are unreasonable, contrary to the first dictates of natural justice, and unconstitutional, because they unnecessarily embarrass and prevent the citizen from that free and full oppor<a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>tunity of qualifying himself for the exercise of the elective franchise, which the Constitution guarantees to him ?</p>

In the 4th section, which relates to the other parts of the state, it is expressly declared that on the day of election any person whose name is not on the assessors’ list may prove his qualification, and be admitted to vote. The evidence which he is required to produce is particularly described. There is no such provision in the sections which relate to Philadelphia. The evidence, which shall be necessary before the assessors and the division canvassers, is carefully specified, as we have seen; but there is not a word as to what shall be the evidence at the polls to the election officers, except the list and some things required in addition to it — production of tax receipts with proof of identity, and of certificates of naturalization without proof of identity. It may perhaps be argued that, inasmuch as he is not expressly excluded, a qualified voter whose name is not on the list will still have a right to vote, on giving the evidence prescribed by the General Election Law of July 2d 1839, § 66, Pamph. L. 534, which in this respect is not inconsistent with the provisions of this act, and therefore is not repealed. But this would present a very gross incongruity; that two witnesses, and of a very special character, shall be required to place a name on the list in advance, while at the polls the same thing can be done by the testimony of one competent witness, who is a qualified elector, and who need not be a resident of the division. I conclude, therefore, that when it is declared in the 36th section, that the list when finally completed by the division canvassers, ‘ shall constitute the registry of citizens qualified to vote in the said divisions respectively at the next general election’ (section 30), it is an affirmative necessarily pregnant with a negative. If this be the true construction of the act, then my settled conviction is that on that ground alone it is unconstitutional. Election-day is the proper time to prove the qualifications of an elector, if required by an inspector, or challenged by a citizen; for, from the very nature of the facts which make up the qualifications, they cannot be proved before. Residence in the state one year, and in the election district ten days, both periods of time to be immediately preceding the election, are past facts only complete <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>and susceptible of proof then. No previous proof can anticipate and take the place of it. It is enough to say, that the Constitution does not require the elector to have the constant intention of continued residence in the state during the year, or in the district during the ten days. At the commencement of and during all that term, he may intend to remove, and yet in fact continue to reside in the same place. If he removes from one district to another during the ten days, he can neither vote in the old nor the new district. He loses his vote. A legislative attempt to remedy this by the joint resolution of April 26th 1844, Pamph. L. 605, was very properly decided to be unconstitutional in Ewing’s Case, Q. S., Philadelphia, July 22d 1862, MS. Although a person may have truly sworn ten days before, that it was then his intention to continue his residence in the district until the day of election, he may change his mind and remove the next day. His witnesses may depose, with great sincerity, that they verily believo that on election-day he will be a qualified voter, yet the “result may show that they were mistaken in their belief. On what principle can an elector, who proves on that day that he possesses every qualification prescribed by the Constitution, be deprived of his elective franchise because he has not proved before what, in the very nature of things, he could not prove before ? Let us take, however, the case of one who, with every disposition to conform to the regulations which the legislature has made, has applied and been refused both by the assessors and the division canvassers, because, by the express provisions of the act, his name could not be placed on the list. A citizen of foreign birth has been naturalized the day before the election. He could not have been naturalized before, because his time had not expired. He offers his vote to the election officers at the polls. He is a citizen — a white freeman of the age of twenty-one years — has resided in the state for one year, and in the election district ten days preceding the election, and has paid within two years a state or county tax, assessed at least ten days before the election. The tax may have been a personal one assessed upon him at the previous triennial assessment, or it may be upon property owned by him. To reject such a vote is to deprive him of an undoubted <em>right; </em>it is to violate the Constitution, which says positively, imperatively, he shall enjoy the rights of an elector. I need not add that if, in consequence of the prohibition contained in this act, he was not assessed ten days before the election, this system, which denies him that privilege, deprives him just as effectually by that means of his elective franchise as by rejecting his vote, if he had been fully qualified.</p>

It will certainly be a very difficult one to decide, if it should ever arise. I do believe, however, after the fullest reflection, that an act of the legislature which makes a registry previously made up, conclusive evidence of the qualifications of all those whose names are on it, whether as to residence or anything else, is as contrary to the Constitution as an act which undertakes to exclude those whose names are not on it.</p>

It is admitted that the Constitution cannot execute itself, and that the power to regulate elections is a legislative one, which has always been exercised by the General Assembly since the foundation of the government. The Constitution appoints the time of the general election, prescribes the qualifications of voters, and enjoins the ballot; and for all the rest the law must provide. The precincts and places, the boards of election, the lists of the electors, whether called a list of taxables or a register of voters; and the evidence of persons and qualifications must all be prescribed by law. This undoubted legislative power is left by the Constitution to a discretion unfettered by rule or proviso, save the single injunction “ that elections shall be free and equal.” But to whom are the elections free ? They are free only to the <em>qualified </em>electors of the Commonwealth. Clearly they are <em>not </em>free to the unqualified. There must be a means of distinguishing the qualified from the unqualified, and this can be done only by a tribunal to decide, and by evidence upon which a decision can be made. The Constitution does not provide these, and therefore the legislature must establish the tribunal, and the means of ascertaining who are and who are not the qualified electors; and must designate the evidence which shall identify and prove to this tribunal the persons and the qualifications of the electors. How shall elections be made equal? Clearly by laws which shall arrange all the qualified electors into suitable districts, and make their votes equally potent in the election; so that some shall not have more votes than others, and that all shall have an equal share in filling the offices of the Commonwealth. But how shall this freedom and equality be secured? The Constitution has given no rule and furnished no guide. It has not said that the regulations to effect this shall be uniform. It has simply enjoined the duty and left the means of accomplishment to the legislature. The discretion, therefore, belongs to the General Assembly, is a sound one, and cannot be reviewed by any other department of the government, except in a case of plain, palpable and clear abuse of the power which actually infringes the rights of the electors. It is not possible, nor does the Constitution require, that this freedom and equality of election shall be a perfect one. <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>No human law, affected as it must be by obstacles and a difference of circumstances, can devise a system of perfect equality— it can only approximate it, and mere errors in the execution of the power cannot make the execution unconstitutional. Individuals may experience difficulties, and some may even lose their suffrages by the imperfection of the system; but this is no ground to pronounce a law unconstitutional, unless it is a clear and palr pable abuse of the power in its exercise. Then that election is free and equal where all of the qualified electors of the precinct are carefully distinguished from the unqualified, and are protected in the right to deposit their ballots in safety, and unprejudiced by fraud. That election is not free and equal where the true electors are not separated from the false ; where the ballot is not deposited in safety, or where it is supplanted by fraud. It is, therefore, the duty of the legislature to secure freedom and equality by such regulations as will exclude the unqualified, and allow the qualified only to vote. A free and equal election is the end, regulations to attain it are the means. If the end be attained, it is evident no question of constitutional law can arise on the uniformity or diversity of the regulations by which the end is reached. Of necessity, laws passed to promote a given object, must be controlled or modified by the circumstances surrounding the object, and must be framed to meet the exigencies standing in the way of the end to be reached. If uniformity of regulation be unsuited to different localities, the end must be attained by diversity. If in one part of the state a system secures to electors a free and equal election, but fails to secure it in another part because of the difference of circumstances, what principle of constitutional law makes it unlawful to enact other provisions to counteract the circumstances, and secure the true purpose of the Constitution ? Good sense, good order and sound morality require this diversity of regulation when it secures the end ; and it is a great fallacy to substitute uniformity of regulation for a free and equal election.</p>

If not, why is a city charter granted with all its large powers^ of local government, its special provisions for police and for conduct ? Where population greatly abounds vice and virtue have their greatest extremes. A simple rural population needs no night police, and no lock-up. Rogues and strumpets do not nightly traverse the deserted highways of the farmer. Low inns, restaurants, sailors’ boarding-houses, and houses of ill fame do not abound in rural precincts, ready to pour out on election day their pestilent hordes of imported bullies and vagabonds, and to cast them multiplied upon the polls as voters. In large cities such things exist, and its proper population therefore needs greater protection, and local legislation must come to their relief. The freedom and equality of the ballot-box must be protected from the local causes which mar and destroy a free and equal election. What crime have the freemen of Philadelphia committed, that their voice at the ballot-box may be stifled by the fraud or force which springs out of their local circumstances, and yet the legislature be powerless to relieve them ? In the language of another, that would be “ to place the vicious vagrant, the wandering Arabs, the Tartar hordes of our large cities, on a level with the virtuous and good man — on a level with the industrious, the poor and the rich.” Is that a wise and just interpretation of the Constitution which opens the polls of a large city to such imported hirelings and vagabonds without a home, by adhering to a uniformity of regulation unsuited to the city on the one hand, or to the country on the other ? Is the Constitution of Pennsylvania so deformed and sterile that her laws cannot protect the ballot-box of a city from falsehood and fraud because they admit of but one unbroken system for the state ? Such an interpretation of the Constitution is wanting in merit, and can only operate as an incentive to fraud. How then can the freedom and equality of election be secured in a great city if from the force of local circumstances the places of the real electors are usurped, if the ballot-box can be stuffed with impunity, or if suffrage can be exercised only at the risk of violence or life ?</p>

The number of these objected to is few, after having disposed of the difference between city and state regulations. Much stress has been laid on the right of the people to elect the officers of the elections; and much said upon popular rights which might well be addressed to the legislature in making or reforming the law. But, unfortunately for the argument, the people have by their Constitution disposed of all such appeals when addressed to us. What clause of the Constitution forbids the officers of the election, the canvassers, or even the assessors, to be appointed by a board constituted by law, whether it he a board of aldermen or a board of commissioners ? Let the Constitution itself answer, Art. 6 and 8: “ All officers whose election or appointment is not provided for in this Constitution shall be elected or appointed as shall be directed by law.” Here there is a law made under the direct sanction of the people themselves, expressly given in the Constitution. But it is said the law is unconstitutional because the hoard of appointment in this case (the aldermen) have a majority in it of persons belonging to a particular political party, and the argument omitted to say a <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>majority which is the result of popular elections. This ground of unconstitutionality of law because a board created by it is composed of individuals of different political opinions, with a majority in a certain way the result of popular elections, seems, to belong to an age fruitful in discovery. Iiow is it possible that any board composed of men can be organized without a majority in political opinion in one way or another ? To the party in the minority such a board must always be unconstitutional if such arguments were to prevail.</p>
    <p id="b80-6" data-blocks='[["BL_80.4",80,[286,793,1166,1588]]]'>But clearly it is not unconstitutional and not unfair to designate a board of gentlemen chosen by the people to administer the laws among them. If these men be unfit agents it is not the fault of the legislature, but of a people who will elect such men to administer justice to themselves. The law binds the board of aldermen to appoint the officers of the election, so that the political party having a majority in the election division shall have a majority of the board. It requires the canvassers to be appointed so that each party will be represented in the several boards of canvassers, adding a supervising power in the courts to correct errors. What fair mind can pronounce this an <em>abuse </em>of legislative power, so gross, so palpable and so plain as to become an unconstitutional act? Said Chief Justice Marshall: “All power may be abused, and if the fear of its abuse is to constitute an argument against its existence, it might be urged against the existence of that which is universally acknowledged, and which is indispensable to general safety:” Brown <em>v. </em>Maryland, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wheat.%20441" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="12 Wheat. 441">12 Wheat. 441</a>. The argument that the aldermen being judicial officers cannot be compelled to act, is of no weight, and was so regarded by the whole court in Page <em>et al. v. </em>Allen <em>et al., </em>decided last year. The position would overturn our own acts as judges in the appointment of prison, penitentiary and building inspectors, commissioners to take testimony and other officers. The practice is sanctioned by a century of use. The lower courts fill all vacancies in county and township offices, such as commissioners, auditors, surveyors, district attorneys, constables, supervisors and overseers of the poor. The associate judges constituted a part of the military boards under the bounty and provision laws, and the boards for the revision of taxes; and the judges of the judicial districts appointed the revenue commissioners. Besides the aldermen have not refused, and it is not likely they will refuse, and what authority have these plaintiffs to gainsay their right to act, or to put in a refusal on their behalf? The truth is the whole weight of this objection consists in the fact that the majority of the board, representing the popular majority, hold opposite opinions to the plaintiffs, and when a new deal of the popular cards turns up a different majority, I suppose gentlemen of the opposite party will use the same argument.</p>

The purpose of this regulation is obvious — it is to cut off the unqualified persons who are imported into the districts to displace the votes of the true electors; by taking a period for the extra assessment sufficiently distant from' the day of election, to render it inconvenient and difficult for these hirelings to obtain a false qualification. But what clause of the Constitution requires the assessment of taxes to be extended to any period ? It is a new discovery that the system of taxation must be subordinated to that of election. Neither the Constitution of 1790 nor that of 1838 prescribes any time for the exercise of the powers of taxation, though both use the <em>payment </em>of tax within two years as the means of distinguishing the true elector and as evidence of his residence and membership in the community. It is a great error in constitutional law to mistake a restriction for an injunction. When the Constitution provides that the elector shall have paid <em>within two years </em>a state or county tax, which shall have been assessed <em>at least </em>ten days before the election, its purpose was to restrain the assessment so that voters might not be fraudulently made at the very polls; but it did not require the tax power to be altered so that assessments should be compulsory down to the tenth day before the election. There is no express injunction, and it is not even a fair implication. The rights of the true electors were well protected when they were allowed two years preceding for the <em>payment </em>of a tax to secure their qualification, a period including certainly two, and it might be three annual assessments. To this the law adds an <em>extra </em>assessment at any time before the 20th of September. The time of the assessment of taxes is part of a different system, that of taxation; and the Constitution has nowhere said it is to be subordinated to the system of election. This time-belongs to the sound discretion of the legislature, and should be regulated with a regard to what they believe the best interests of the citizens. If the Assembly believe that the best means to prevent frauds in the city elections is to increase the period for the last assessment, it may be done, the only constitutional provision being the <em>restriction </em>that the time shall not be <em>less </em>than ten days before the election.</p>

The system of <em>annual </em>taxation has marked the whole history-of the government.

The first list of electors is to be made before the 1st of June, and being made by the same officers is evidently intended to be made in connection with the original assessment. If an elector has been already taxed, his tax will be transferred to the list of electors, if not, the tax will then be assessed in order to perfect his qualification as a voter. <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>When, the law is so easily harmonized it is a forced construction which exacts a second tax from one whose name is on the original list.

The law forbids the assessors to take down the names of such persons, to prevent the frauds known to result from taking down lists of persons given in as boarders, when no such persons are residing at the hotel or boarding-house. But it nowhere forbids these omitted persons from being placed on the registry at the proper time, and on proper evidence. On the contrary, a mode is provided to enable every lawful elector to be registered, by application to the assessors or to the canvassers. Clearly the feature complained of is a useful provision to protect the rights of the true electors of Philadelphia, and to reach the unqualified persons found at such convenient places just upon the eve of an election, when their votes are needed by unscrupulous men. Its purpose is to exclude this fraudulent. element, by compelling all persons not known householders and fixed inhabitants to come personally before the proper board and make proof of their right. True, the omission demands of single men, clerks, journeymen and transient boarders, a greater vigilance to secure their suffrage.

I cannot understand the reasoning which would deny to the legislature this essential power to define the evidence which is necessary to distinguish the false from the true. The logic which disputes the power to prohibit masqueraders in elections, on the ground that it affeets their freedom or equality, must also deny the power to repress the social disorders of a city, because the same Bill of <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>Rights declares that all men are free and equal and independent and have the right of pursuing their happiness.

The error is in assuming that the true electors are excluded, because they may omit to avail themselves of the means of proving their identity and their qualifications. It might as well be argued that the old law was unconstitutional because it required a naturalized citizen to produce his certificate of the fact, and expressly forbade his vote if he did not.

The argument is, that the law is unconstitutional, because the canvassers might abuse their powers. They are not permitted to strike off any qualified voter, and if they do, he has his remedy at law to compel them to restore his name. The canvassers are a legal tribunal established to decide on evidence of qualification, are sworn officers, and are required to proceed in a due and proper mode, and decide on sufficient evidence. ' But a law can be pronounced unconstitutional only when the law itself subverts the true electors’ rights, and not because the tribunal acting under it may make mistakes, or even abuse its functions.

What clause forbids the making up of a record ten days before, that shows that the person offering his vote to the board was <em>an actual </em>resident of the precinct ten days before; and was ¿hen set down as entitled to claim his privilege on the day of election ? Why is such a record not good evidence that his residence actually began in the district, or preexisted there ten days before the election ?

It is better evidence than the testimony of some irresponsible and base perjurer, brought to prove a false residence at some low boarding-place. The record has the merit of truthfulness, and it relieves the true and honest elector of those unfounded and malicious objections to his vote made by partisans of either side. Here is the legal proof that his residence in the district began in the due constitutional time. What better proof can there well be of a residence complete on the day of election, than the personal appearance of the elector on that day claiming his vote, with his ballot in one hand and the register in the other ?

A remedy for a disease must be regarded as empirical, which would only eradicate it by producing a worse. If frauds were imminent by simulated voters, let penalties be provided for the rogues, and set honest and vigilant men to watch them, but let not the rights of honest voters be sacrificed to these apprehensions. If such were the principle of legislative action on the question of a preventive remedy, assuredly the fewer votes there should be allowed to be polled, the more the danger of fraud in voting would be diminished, and it might be entirely prevented if no voting whatever were allowed.

But the reasoning based on the assumption, like the law, in this case, is applicable only to Philadelphia. The assumption must be that there are no rogues in the other cities of the state, or in the country districts; if this be not so, the act is simply a discrimination to cut down the voting population of Philadelphia.

It cannot escape the attention of any reader of the Constitution, that each class of electors— for the difference in qualifications justifies the propriety of classification — stands on the same footing, wherever its members are to be found, whether in the city, or in the country; and so they have always stood, with the exception of the period of three years, covered by the discarded and unjust Registry Act of 1836. That equality is destroyed by this act, and that persons will be free and unembarrassed to exercise the right of suffrage out of the city, while others with the same qualifications exactly, shall not exercise it on the same terms in the city of Philadelphia, and may not be able to enjoy it at all, owing to the embarrassing provisions in regard to the proof required, is, beyond dispute, the effect of it.</p>

The most skilful casuist will search in vain for a reason which would be satisfactory, why the people should intend that the legislative body, created' by themselves, to act in obedience to the Constitution, should have the power to diversify the enjoyment of their guaranteed, uniform rights, especially the right of suffrage, the corner-stone of the government, or render the enjoyment of it contingent, uncertain or hurthensome, to any of the classes upon whom it was conferred. The grant being identical to all qualified to exercise it, and without restrictions imposed on any, not imposed on all the classes enumerated, it seems to me it would be a palpable perversion of the rule to hold that the Constitution sanctions legislation establishing a different, or changing the rule established by itself. The clause quoted establishes a uniform rule throughout the Commonwealth, and <em>commands </em>that every citizen possessing the qualifications mentioned— no more, no <em>less </em>— “ shall enjoy the rights of electors.” This is the rule of the Constitution.

That this is the effect and result of the maintenance of this registry act, as between different portions of the Commonwealth, as well as citizens, my brother Sharswood has shown most conclusively in his opinion in the case at Nisi Prius, to which nothing could be added to strengthen the argument. Indeed, so conclusive was its reasoning regarded, that it wrung assent to its doctrines from unwilling quarters, if party predilections may be considered. A majority of my brethren, however, have discarded the uniformity and universality of what we claim as the rule of the Constitution, and have accorded an omnipotence to the legislative power equal to changing it, and establishing another and different rule, one which subverts both the uniformity and equality of the Constitution. The evils of such a conclusion I fear will not end with the partial legislation contained in the act. It will be a precedent for other legislation of the same character, and in time the electors of one county may be subject to terms of registration infinitely more embarrassing and onerous than those of another, by which virtual disfranchisement may ensue to many electors, otherwise entitled to enjoy the right.</p>

Many reasons might be given why it was not judicially tested in this court, and among them is the fact that chancery jurisdiction was only, in the same year, conferred on this court, and was new in practice, as it was unsettled in the extent of equity jurisdiction. But it is a feeble inference of its constitutionality that it was not so, tested, considering its brief existence. If there be any force in such an inference, it results from the assumption that what has not been adjudicated upon at all, is to have the same effect as if it had been; an inadmissible conclusion certainly.</p>

No citizen can be assessed later than seventeen days before election day. On the subject of naturalized citizens, the 85th section speaks: <em>“ </em>Every person of foreign birth, claiming a right to be assessed * * * shall, in addition to the proof of residence (by two qualified, <em>i. e., </em>assessed householders), prove that he has been naturalized conformably to the laws of the United States, and as evidence thereof, he shall produce a certificate of naturalization .under the seal of the court in which said naturalization took place, duly attested by the signature of the prothonotary or clerk, in his own proper handwriting; and shall prove by the oath of a qualified elector of the division, that he is the person named in the said certificate, and the person to whom it was issued * * * when and where he was born, and when and where he obtained the said certificate, and from whom, &amp;c.” And no foreigner, having declared his intentions, although entitled to naturalization before election day, can be registered in the city, and consequently cannot vote, although actually naturalized, before that day. There is no provision for the assessment and registration of such, nor any that I can see, for the registration of the sons of naturalized citizens. These two classes, it seems to me, are excluded in the city, although the most conclusive proof might be given of their constitutional qualifications on election day. Citizens of full age, and tax-payers, they may be on that day, yet, as classes, they are utterly excluded from enjoying the right of electors. Notwithstanding all this, we are assured, nay, it is decided, that the act which produces such a result is binding and valid. I do not think so, for my part.</p>

Nor will it be possible in all cases, for the applicant to state the irrelevant facts of when and where he was born, and from whom he received his certificate of naturalization ? There being no requirement of such a thing in the law when he received it, he may never have thought it necessary to make the inquiry. Nor is it necessary; for the seal of the court imports all facts of due execution, and itself is conclusive. Yet this <em>ex post facto </em>requirement, if not proved as required, may defeat the elector. Impossible, in a majority of instances, as a compliance with these requirements will be, still the letter of the statute demands that it be done; and it can only be done by disregarding the terms of the statute. A break in the chain of requirement will defeat the elector.

It involves a prohibition of interference with it.” This was said in what is known as the deserter cases, wherein it was contended that there was no clause in the Constitution prohibiting the legislature from forfeiting an elector’s rights for the cause of desertion mentioned in the act.

Nor is the foreign born citizen obliged to pass through the ordeal of proof noticed, as required in the city, or in any other part of the state; and I see not how sons of naturalized citizens are to be registered in the city; outside of it, the law presents no difficulties.

One class, viz., private householders, and residents with them, hotel keepers, restaurant and sailor boarding-house keepers, may be assessed at the option of the assessors without auxiliary proofs. All other citizens are to be registered only on the -production of the special proofs I have already noticed, to wit — by two members of the privileged class. Outside of that class, even the judges who interpret the act,Af boarders, would not be competent to place a voter on the registry; two boardinghouse keepers of the division could. <em>“ </em>This,” says the opinion of the majority, “ is to exclude the fraudulent element, by compelling all persons, not known householders and fixed inhabitants, to come personally before the proper board and make proof of their rights.”</p>

The rights of an elector rest not on any moral, but on a legal <em>status. </em>With the qualifications of the Constitution in his favor, he is not to be excluded on any assumed or even real ground of moral <em>status. </em>The governing power in this country is the people, and it -is made up of all classes. The compact between the people, namely, the Constitution, settled who should be voters, and this was a prohibition against interference with the arrangement. It is idle to say that that is not interfered with, if proofs be demanded of the right, so limited in character, on the assumption of want of morality in a certain class of citizens, as to render the proof itself precarious. That is the effect of restricting the testimony to establish residence to the privileged class noticed, viz., housekeepers, hotel-keepers, restaurant and boarding-house keepers.</p>

This is always said where the pressure is severe for an argument, but is mostly untrue. There are many things that the Constitution does not prohibit, but which all will agree conflict with it. Is it necessary to find a prohibition, for instance, against an attack upon the principles of liberty itself? This is no stronger an instance than an attack which distinguishes unfavorably one class of electors as compared with another. That that is what the Registry Act does, I have shown, and it is not denied in the opinion which has been pronounced sustaining it. In is, however, as wearisome to follow in detail this incongruous legislation, as it is painful to contemplate its unequal, and therefore unjust operations.

To enjoy the privileges of an elector, the claimant must submit to the imposition of a tax. Small though it be, it is in principle the same as if ten times as large. It is not said that the householding voter must pay it before voting, but it is positively required to be paid by all who may be placed on the extra assessment lists in the city. I presume this number will not fall short of one-tenth of tire voters, and may greatly exceed it. It is the privilege of the elector which is thus taxed; it is a step in the process of registration — which is a preliminary to voting — it is therefore a tax on the right. This is so beyond controversy; for no others than those who claim to be registered are assessed with this tax. The Bill of Rights ordains that elections shall be free and equal. Free on the condition of paying tribute for the enjoyment of the right, says the act. Is a right free which must be paid for ? The tax which the Constitution prescribes was to indicate who should be entitled to be electors; that was sufficient for that purpose— but that is not the purpose of this tax. Its object is to raise money for the city treasury. It is small now, but the principle sustained is capable of indefinite extension. Fifty cents is the limit this year, five or ten dollars will not be distinguishable in principle next. It is this year applicable to Philadelphia, next it may become a tax on Lancaster or Pittsburg, and Philadelphia be exempt.

The Constitution fixes the outside limit ten days before the election. The tax must be assessed at least ten days before the election, says the Constitution. It shall not be, says the act.

L. 49, is unconstitutional, remains unchanged. Nor does anything which has been brought forward seem to me to require notice ; especially after the dissenting opinion by the Chief Justice, except, perhaps, one ground which has been very largely and principally insisted on. I refer to the alleged decision of the Reform Convention of 1837. Indeed, it is now declared that their vote on the subject “should put an end to all argument on the constitutionality of a registry law.” I cannot so regard it. It was, in truth, no decision at all. A vote sustaining a call for the previous question, speaks nothing as to the merits of any amendment <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>which may be cut off by it. One of the objects of such a call, frequently, is to avoid a vote on the amendment pending. It is impossible even to conjecture for what reason the majority voted in this instance. They may have been influenced by various reasons. I mean nothing derogatory or disrespectful to the Reform Convention, when I say that the probability is that most of them just followed their file-leader. <em>Non constat </em>but that many of them thought that the existing declaration of the Bill of Rights was sufficient. The rejection of Mr. Sterigere’s proposed amendment, by a direct vote upon it, would have proved nothing as to the opinion of the convention upon the true construction of the clause, “ elections shall be free and equal.” In requiring, as the proposed amendment did, an absolute uniformity in elections, it certainly went farther than in my opinion does the clause as it stands, and much farther than is desirable. How, then, can it be concluded that those who voted for that call of the previous question thought that the Registry Act of June 16th 1836, Pamph. L. 705, was constitutional — much less that an-act would be constitutional if it did — what the Act of 1836 did not — make a different kind of evidence as to the qualification of voters necessary in one part of the state from another ?</p>

I cannot agree that any authority whatever belongs to the opinions of that or any other convention on the meaning of an instrument which they have met to amend. It is enough to say that their opinion on this subject was not incorporated with the amendments which were submitted to and ratified by the people. The people did not adopt all the votes and debates of the Reform Convention, but such only as were embodied and exjoressed in the amendments submitted. In construing the Constitution as the act of the people, we must look at it as it came from their hands. Such certainly was the view taken by the majority of this court in Shollenberger <em>v. </em>Brinton, 2 P. F. Smith 9. In that case, on the question of the constitutionality of the Act of Congress making treasury notes a legal tender, it was strongly urged that the Federal Convention of 1787 had by a direct vote struck out the clause in the Articles of Confederation empowering Congress “to emit bills of credit.” Yet that vote is not referred to in the opinion of the majority. In truth all that can be said of such votes in deliberative bodies, whether constitutional or legislative, is, that they are what logicians term, <em>argumenta ad verecundiam. </em>Their weight depends upon'the character of the men who give the votes. While I feel great respect for the members of the Reform Convention of 1837, I am not prepared to hold that their opinions upon the construction of the Constitution of 1790 are conclusive; more especially <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>in view of the fact that the vote of the Federal Convention of 1787 has not been so considered. I see nothing, therefore, in this argument to shake the opinion which I expressed at Nisi Prius, and which I still entertain, that an election at which one class of electors in one part of the state are required to prove their qualifications by two witnesses, and in another part by only one, is not an equal election.</p>
