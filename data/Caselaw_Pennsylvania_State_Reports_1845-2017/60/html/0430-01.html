Chamberlain, after considering awhile, agreed to do it. They went to Lancaster city that day to an attorney’s office, where the assignment was prepared, executed and delivered, Chamberlain paying Bear the $800 in the office; they then went to a hotel together, where Bear paid Chamberlain what he owed him. With what was left, Bear paid some little debts, and had himself and children to keep. The auditor reports no other facts on this point. On the day but one after his wife’s death, Bear went to Esquire Rambo and asked him if it would be lawful for him to assign his interest in his wife’s estate. Rambo would give no opinion, but advised him to ask a lawyer. He told Rambo that he wanted to secure the money for his own use, and told him that he owed creditors, and he was sure they would attach it, and he would try to secure it. He afterwards saw Rambo, and said that he (Bear) and Chamberlain had dealings, and he believed he would assign to him, &amp;c.</p>

He also made a statement of the nature of his indebtedness, but could not give particulars or specify amount, or state the aggregate amount paid, nearer than that it was between $200 and $300. At Lancaster, Chamberlain brought no books and did not give him the items. Bear had no account of the debt. Some part was more than six years’ standing. Chamberlain had never asked him for the money; had said he would not push him or put him to any trouble. Chamberlain gave him no receipt for the money. Bear did not ask for one. He gave as the reason why Chamberlain paid him the whole $800, and they went to another place to pay Chamberlain, that that was the understanding. He “ wanted it done without any fuss or excitement about Penningtonville about it.”</p>

He made the offer to sell to him for $800, which was at least $500 more than the debt due, stating at the time his motive for so doing, to wit: that he expected attachments would be issued by other creditors.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b433-8" data-blocks='[["BL_433.6",433,[221,972,1146,428]]]'>“ The auditor thinks not. So far as appears, there was a boná. fide sale by Bear to Chamberlain of a vested interest in the estate of his wife. At the time of its transfer, Martin Bear was the legal owner thereof, and had a legal right to the sale of it for a fair price to whom he pleased. He sold it for $800, which is, as it turns out, more than its real value, the whole estate being, after payment of the expenses of the administrator, $2162.18, which is reduced by this report, by debts and expenses of audit, to $1954.12, giving to Jonas Chamberlain $651.37J, being a loss to him by the purchase of $148.63.</p>

But it is not. It was a race between creditors, and Jonas made the purchase before the attaching creditors had moved; he made it not to hinder, delay and defraud the other creditors, but to secure his own debt, taking the risk of a good or bad bargain. Where there is evidence to sustain a justifiable motive, we cannot, without evidence, suspect and act upon one that is illegal. Although he knew of Martin’s belief that other creditors would move, does that knowledge tie his hands and deprive him of his right to secure himself by the purchase ? The auditor thinks not. Again, the statute 13 Elizabeth does not render void a conveyance made by a man, simply because he is indebted: 3 Penna. R. 160. If it did, then no man could safely buy of an insolvent or one much <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>indebted. To make tbe assignment in tbe present case void, tbe evidence should satisfy the mind that the intent or purpose of the parties was to ‘ delay, hinder and defraud creditors, &amp;c., of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, &amp;c.’ There is no evidence that Jonas Chamberlain knew anything of the purposes of the other creditors, except what he learned from Martin, and that only amounted to an expectation on Martin’s part, that some of his creditors would issue attachments. Does the expression of such a belief by Martin involve Jonas in something of the nature of a criminal conspiracy, to wrong the other creditors, in violation of the Statute of Frauds ? He said nothing, he did nothing by way of encouraging such a purpose, and why he should be visited with loss for the exercise of a proper vigilance in securing his debt, the auditor cannot conceive, and he is therefore of opinion, that his motive of action being legal, the assignment is not void, and that having paid a bond, fide price for the interest conveyed, the fact that there was some $500 in the hands of Martin after the liquidation of the' debt does not invalidate the transaction, there being no evidence that the assignee had any interest in the money he had paid by any arrangement with the assignee. In these views the auditor believes he is fully sustained by the law, as expressed by the Supreme Court in Covanhovan <em>v. </em>Hart, 9 Harris 500.</p>

We have therefore no question of pleading or of averment to meet. All that is required is that the claims shall be one for necessaries for the support and maintenance of her family — that they were contracted for by her or in her name by some one authorized by her to do so, and that her husband was insolvent: 11 Casey 384; <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20251" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Wright 251">1 Wright 251</a>. The auditor has found these facts. It is true he says for necessaries, omitting to say for the support and maintenance of her family; but on referring to the testimony brought up by the appellants, it clearly shows that the amount was for articles used in the maintenance of the family. Nor is it less clear to our minds upon a just, construction of Martin Bear’s testimony that the debt was contracted for these necessaries, in her name and by her authority.

There is no doubt that the assignment of Martin Bear to Jonas Chamberlain of his interest in the residue of his wife’s estate was made upon a valuable consideration and for a full price. But it is supposed that the communication of Bear’s expectation that if he kept it, his interest would be attached by other creditors, and that something would have to be done to save it from attachment, is such a fraud on part of both that the assignment is vitiated by it. The auditor finds as a fact that there was no fraudulent purpose on part of Chamberlain, and that <em>his </em>purpose was to be secured in <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>a debt which Bear owed him. We are not able to say that the testimony proves that this was a clear mistake on part of the auditor and of the court who confirmed his report. Chamberlain had a motive entirely adequate; to wit, the preservation of his own debt against Bear, who was insolvent. Fraud is not to be presumed without satisfactory proof of its existence; which can scarcely be affirmed, where a proper motive exists, which might have been as readily the operating motive as one that was fraudulent. As to Chamberlain’s taking time to deliberate, it affords little or no proof of fraud. The-nature of the interest, to wit, an unsettled balance of an estate in the course of administration, the law of its distribution, and the right passing under the assignment, were matters calculated to make any one hesitate, and to lead him to inquire how far he would be safe in advancing money upon it. Had Chamberlain’s debt equalled the interest assigned, his motive to obtain it by putting aside other creditors would not have affected his title, according to Covanhovan <em>v. </em>Hart, 9 Harris 500. So here his purchase being found to be ancillary to the main object of saving his debt, and not being fraudulent in actual intent, will not be tortured into a fraud in the absence of satisfactory evidence disclosing a positive intent to collude with Bear to hinder and delay his creditors.</p>
