Lowry, and served on the Monongahela Water Company, an alleged debtor of Lowry, as garnishee. There was an interpleader issue ordered by the court between the plaintiffs and defendants in error, and another party, to try who was entitled to the money due by the company to Lowry. Fowler &amp; Co. claimed it by virtue of the service of an execution-attachment on the 10th of May 1866; Foster &amp; Co., by virtue of a mechanics’ lien against the company filed June 6th 1866, for materials furnished Lowry, the contractor of the company, for building a pumping-engine; and David Lowry claimed it under an alleged assignment by Joseph L. Lówry of all interest in his contract with the company, dated the 19th of December 1865. The jury found against the validity of the assignment on the facts, and also against Foster &amp; Co., on the charge of the court that the mechanics’ lien filed by them was not operative against the company, and in favor of Fowler &amp; Co., and that the sum of $2327.72 remained due the defendant, Joseph L. Lowry, by the company, applicable to their writ. The case here, however, is exclusively between the plaintiffs and defendants in error, and <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>turns upon the question whether a mechanic’s lien is valid in law against property essential to the operations of the company. We are assuming nothing in stating the proposition thus, for undoubtedly the pumping-engine and engine-house of the company, would be absolutely necessary to raise water to the company’s reservoirs, in order to supply the districts intended to be supplied with water. It was to these the lien, if any, attached — to property vital to the objects of the corporation, and which, if it might be deprived of by execution on such a lien, would stop or suspend the operation of the works altogether, to the great deterioration, and perhaps destruction of the stock, to the injury of the inhabitants relying on the works for water; and to the company, by rendering the balance of the works worthless. The question is, therefore, a grave one, whether the mechanic’s lien, in a case precisely of this nature, is a remedy to secure a material-man; because if it be clearly so, we need not vex ourselves with contemplating embarrassing consequences; the law injures no one, even if such consequences follow its provisions.</p>
    <p id="b30-6" data-blocks='[["BL_30.4",30,[285,1183,1149,984]]]'>In the able argument of the learned counsel of the plaintiffs in error, it was claimed that, we should consider the question of lien without reference to its possible enforcement. This would be too abstract and unpractical; for the lien abstractly is nothing — its consequences or results, everything. The fruits of a lien are what the plaintiffs in error are contending for. We cannot, therefore, look at the question of lien, without reference to the legal consequences of it; and if they would necessarily contravene settled principles, it is evident that such an effect should not be given, and was not intended by the law; and if it be incapable of the practical results assigned by law to it, it is inoperative, is no lien. We must, therefore, regard the consequences of holding the claim filed to be a lien, one of which, and the principal one, is, that by virtue of it, the property bound by it would be subject to a sale on a <em>levari facias, </em>and then would follow the depreciation of the stock, the inconvenience to the public, and injury to the remaining property of the company, already referred to. We do not agree with the learned counsel, therefore, that in considering the question of lien we ought to ignore the possibility of its enforcement. The entry of the claim is parcel of a legal remedy, the whole of which remedy it is necessary to consider in order to determine whether it is a proper remedy, in any given case.</p>

Of the former, are corporations for the building of bridges, turnpike roads, railroads, canals, and the like. The public is directly interested in the results to be produced by such corporations, in the facilities afforded to travel and the movements of trade and commerce. It is well settled that this use is not to be disturbed by the seizure of any part of their property essential to their active operations, by creditors. They must recover their debts by sequestering their earnings, allowing them to progress with their undertaking, to accommodate the public. This direct benefit to, and accommodation of the public, very clearly distinguish this class of corporations from the second class, viz.: private corporations, or those in which the public is but indirectly interested, such as mining and manufacturing, or coal and iron companies, &amp;e., or libraries, literary societies, schools, and the like. Whether they progress or cease, the public is not directly affected, and hence liens are enforceable against them without, as a general' thing, any regard to the effect upon their operations. How this is to be done in given cases is in no way germane to the subject of this opinion, and need not be further noticed.</p>

The company was also authorized to borrow money in order to accomplish the work, and to mortgage or pledge the property and effects of the corporation for its repayment. A provision is also contained in the charter for the eventual transfer of the works to the municipal corporations above mentioned. It is thus not only a public cor<a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>poration in its powers and purposes, but is subject to become municipal property.</p>

It is, in this aspect, as important to the public as are convenient roads and highways, which, when constructed by companies, are always regarded as the works of public corporations. That this is the light in which such an undertaking as this is to be regarded, we have the authority of this court. In The Borough of Harrisburg <em>v. </em>Crangle, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20461" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 461">3 W. &amp; S. 461</a>, the right of eminent domain conferred on the borough authorities, along with the power granted to erect waterworks by the Act of 26th March 1839, was fully and unhesitatingly affirmed by this court, and to it we refer. The fact that the power was conferred on the borough authorities to engage in an enterprise confessedly not within the scope of their municipal powers, placed them in the category of private adventurers, and thus the decision stands as authority, that the purpose was a public one, and authorized the grant of eminent domain to it; and if so in that case, it is in this.</p>
