    <p id="b25-11" data-blocks='[["BL_25.14",25,[204,2101,1159,332]]]'>That he did not so mean to treat William’s, interest, is not reconcilable with the condition of things at the time. The opening or coal-bank was on the plaintiff’s share, and it is just as likely that what he intended in regard to the one, so far as the coal was concerned, he intended as to the others. But Alexander never admitted that his surface land was separated from the- Coal in it, for he sold to William some six or nine acres without restriction.</p>

That this is so, there is no question, and we need only cite Johnstown Iron Co. <em>v. </em>The Cambria Iron Co., 8 Casey 241; Clement <em>v. </em>Youngman, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20341" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="4 Wright 341">4 Wright 341</a>; Gloninger <em>v. </em>The Franklin Coal Co., 5 P.

We do not consider it necessary in this opinion to give or refer to the many instances in the -books, where like conclusions have followed devises and grants similar to the devise just quoted. This has been done in the cases of The Johnstown Iron Co. <em>v. </em>The Cambria Iron Co., and in Clement <em>et al. v. </em>Masser <em>et al., supra. </em>They fully sustain the conclusion we have arrived at, that nothing but a privilege was conferred by the devise in question; and it follows that ejectment will not lie for its interruption.</p>
    <p id="b26-8" data-blocks='[["BL_26.6",26,[286,1536,1158,515]]]'>It is plain that the testator meant that each of his sons might take coal from the opened mine for his own use, or otherwise, without the expense of making any new opening on his own land. Perhaps, too, he may not have known that there was coal to be found almost everywhere over the tract, as it turned out, and thus was desirous that each son should have the convenience of free fuel to be procured at that place, rather than to. procure it elsewhere by purchase. Neither the words nor intent deducible from the consideration of the whole, or any part of the will, lead to any other than this as the proper conclusion, as to what was meant by this clause of the will, and this conclusively determines the case against the plaintiff.</p>
