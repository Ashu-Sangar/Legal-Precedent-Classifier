H. Moore, the defendant, who was the collector. Afterwards, to August Term 1865, a number of writs of fieri facias were issued against Longenecker; the earliest came into the sheriff’s hands May 2d. Under these writs the sheriff sold the above-mentioned personal property to Beaver, Marsh &amp; Co., the plaintiffs. When the plaintiffs were about to remove the property, Moore, having the duplicate in his hands and the property being yet on Longenecker’s premises, seized and levied upon the property and sold it on the 9th of September 1865, the plaintiffs having given written notice to him and others at the sale that the property belonged to them. The property was sold for $670.78, to George Slifer, who sold it to the plaintiffs for the same price. By the case it was agreed: “ If the court be of opinion that the said sheriff’s sale passed the legal title and ownership of the said personal property to the plaintiffs in this case, clear of all liens for taxes, and that the said collector of taxes had no lien on the said property by virtue of the assessment of said taxes, and that he became a trespasser by seizing, levying upon and selling the same for the payment of the said taxes, after the same had been sold by the sheriff as aforesaid to the plaintiffs, notwithstanding they, the said plaintiffs, suffered it to remain for <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>a month on the premises, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs for $670.78, with interest from the said 9th day of September 1865; but if not, then judgment to be entered for the defendant.”</p>
