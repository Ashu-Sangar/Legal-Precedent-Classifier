That subsequently the defendant called and endorsed the note. This was before it was endorsed by the plaintiff. A few weeks before maturity the plaintiff left it for collection at a bank in Pittsburg; and there, by the direction of the cashier, wrote his name both above and below the name of the defendant. When the note fell due the defendant waived protest. These were all the material facts, and after the evidence was given the learned judge below entered a nonsuit, which was afterwards confirmed by the court in banc.
