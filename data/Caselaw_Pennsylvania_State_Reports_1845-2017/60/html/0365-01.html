Reiff, one of the sons, presented his petition in the court below, praying the court to make an order on the executors to pay him one-seventh of the fund absolutely. The answer of one of the executors submits that the legacy of the petitioner is by the terms of the will subject to a contingency, and therefore declines to make such payment until security shall be given pursuant to the provision of the Act of Assembly “ relating to executors and administrators,” passed February 24th 1834, § 49 (Pamph. L. 83). The court below made the order as prayed for.</p>

There a testator gave the residue of his personal estate to trustees in trust to place the same out at interest during the life of his wife, and pay her a certain annuity, and upon her death to pay and divide the said trust moneys unto and equally ■between his two daughters. In case-of the death of his daughters or either of them leaving a child or children living in trust for the children, and the testator declared that the children of each should be entitled to the same share his, her or their mother would have taken, if living. The Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Plumer, held that the testator intended only to substitute the children for the mother in the event of the decease of the latter during the widow’s life, and that the daughters who survived the widow became absolutely entitled. To the same effect are Da Costa <em>v. </em>Keir, 3 Russell 360, and Home <em>v. </em>Pillans, 2 My. &amp; K. 15. These cases may be considered as establishing this general rule of construction that where there is a bequest of personalty in terms absolute in remainder after a life interest — with an alternative bequest in case <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>of the death of the legatee to children of the legatee or in default of children then over, such contingency will be construed as limited to the period of the life interest, and unless it occur during that period — the bequest becomes absolute. “ The avowed aim of every construction,” says Mr. Roper, “being to give effect to the intention of the testator as expressed in or collected from the will, it seems that when a bequest is not immediate but in remainder with an executory limitation in case of the death of the legatee, these expressions will be applied to the period when the remainder takes effect in possession, viz.: the death of the person taking the preceding interest1 Roper on Leg. 409, 1st Am. ed.; 2 Jar-man on Wills 693. It follows that the order made by the court below was right.</p>
