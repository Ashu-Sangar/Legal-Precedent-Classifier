She commenced keeping a boarding-school in this city in the year 1852. Occupying at first but a part of a house on Walnut street, she was so successful in her business as to be able to rent, at the end of a few years, an entire house in Locust street, and finally to take the adjoining house, into which she cut communicating doors, making one large mansion, where she had during the last year of her life thirty boarders and fifty day scholars. The furniture required for this establishment exceeded in value $6000. She occupied for her own purposes exclusively but two rooms, and the controversy in this case is as to the extent of the word ‘household,’ the residuary legatee claiming to circumscribe it to the portion of the premises the testatrix occupied for her <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>own use, and the exceptant contending that all the furniture, save the articles used in the school, passed to her.</p>

That which supplies it is its furniture. The home is not confined to the particular bed-room in which the master of the house sleeps; for it may include his rooms for guests and apartments he never enters. So too it may properly embrace a school-room, for he may teach in his parlor, where many physicians and dentists practise their professions. It is difficult, therefore, to understand how the particular use of a portion of a^dwelling makes it any the less part of the household. Suppose this testatrix had taught a class in her own private parlor, could the residuary legatee claim that the chairs and tables therein were any the less household furniture ? Or if the deceased had occupied with her boarders one large dormitory — as is frequently the case in large establishments — would the bed in which she slept have passed as ‘household furniture,’ but all the other beds have gone to the residuary legatee ?</p>

And it must also he admitted that if the bequest had been ‘all my household and school furniture,’ it would have passed not only all the books, desks, &amp;c., called ‘school furniture,’ but also all the beds and other articles of household furniture used by the scholars.</p>

Franklin <em>v. </em>Countess of Burlington, 2 Vern. Rep. 511 (1705), was a bequest by the Earl of Burlington of ‘furniture and pictures’ of his three houses. It was held that by these words ‘the plate’ passed. The general question as to whether ‘ plate’ will pass by a bequest of household furniture is also discussed by Mr. Raithby in his note to that report, but there is nothing therein approaching the question in this case. The later case in the same volume, Lillcott <em>v. </em>Compton, p. 638, is to the same point, but merits a passing commendation for the brevity with which the reporter gives the whole case in a single line.</p>

There, by articles of marriage settlement, it was stipulated that the wife should have ‘ the household goods, or utensils, or household stuff,’ &amp;c., of the husband at the time of his decease. The husband, beside his house in London, furnished an hospital at Gosport for invalids. Lord Chancellor King decreed that the wife was entitled to the personal property at the hospital, but he was reversed in the House of Lords (3 Bro. P. C. 199), the objection to the ruling being that ‘ household goods’ could not mean beds and sheets ‘ used at a place where the testator himself <em>never lived, </em>but the furniture was provided and the undertaking carried on by agents and servants.’ In other words, the hospital was not his household.</p>

It turned upon the construction of a devise of ‘ goods wearing apparel’ — Lord Chancellor Hardwicke supplying the conjunction <em>and, </em>so as to make it read ‘goods <em>and </em>wearing apparel.’ A rule of construction, which, if applied to this will, might possibly, as already hinted, relieve it of all difficulty by making it read ‘ all my house <em>and </em>household furniture,’ meaning thereby not only the furniture of the household in the sense of family, but all the <em>furniture in the house.</em>

Other cases may perhaps be found upon this point, but if they were multiplied indefinitely, I apprehend that we would have to come back to the common sense of the case at last. Goods, miles away from a testator’s dwelling, are not his household furniture. Goods at his home, under the same roof where he eats, sleeps and lives, are his household effects, unless he keeps them for traffic or merchandise. Then they are in no proper sense for the use of his household. But round his hearthstone he may have a family, large or small, of relatives, friends, guests, scholars, servants, or in the olden time retainers or even soldiers; they are all, in the ordinary acceptation of the word, a part of the household, and all the furniture is household furniture.</p>

That she had at the commencement of her professional labors but little of this world’s goods is nothing to the point. That her merit and industry brought— as they always bring — success, and enabled her to increase her stock of furniture, takes from it nothing of its character as belonging to her household. Indeed, if such an argument has any place in the cause, we might turn it to the advantage of the specific legatee whose assistance through long years of toil had doubtless contributed its share to the success of this establishment, and thereby earned the gratitude of the employer and principal. But we have only to deal with this will as we find it. We cannot doubt that if this testatrix had made a bill of sale ‘ of all her household furniture,’ the purchaser would have acquired a title to something beyond the contents of one bed-room and parlor. Nor can we believe that an insurance company which had underwritten <em>‘ </em>the household furniture’ in that establishment, would ever have been permitted to escape from paying for a loss upon the plea that their policy only covered the chairs and carpets of two apartments. But it must be admitted that this is all <em>house fumibwre, </em>and as that word appears in the will we cannot strike it out.

That the circumstances of the property and the testator with reference to it may be resorted to to assist the construction, is a principle perfectly well settled: 1 Jarman 363. What, then, is the meaning of the words “household furniture?” In that excellent old work, “ A Treatise of Equity” (of which Henry Ballow is the reputed author, and which is the text of Fonblanque, so that with the elaborate notes which have been added by later editors, it has at length become, as has been well remarked, “ a rivulet of text meandering through a wilderness of notes”), it is said that “household stuff is <em>mstrumentum patrisfamilias domestieum et quotidianum:” </em>Book IV., ch. 1, § 11, p. 103. It proceeds to enumerate “ tables, stools, chairs, carpets, hangings, beds, bedding, basins with ewers, candlesticks, all sorts of vessels serving for meat and drink, being of earth, wood, glass, brass or pewter, pots, pans, spits, and such like.” It comprises, as has been said in several cases, everything that contributes to the convenience of the householder or ornament of the house: Kelly <em>v. </em>Powley, Amb. 610; Cole <em>v. </em>Fitzgerald, 1 Sim. &amp; Stu. 189; Carnagy <em>v. </em>Woodcock, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Munf.%20239" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Munf. 239">2 Munf. 239</a>. It is contended, however, that the circumstances in this case show that the testatrix used these words in a more restricted sense. These circumstances are, that the testatrix kept a boarding-school; that the greater part of the furniture in question was for the use of the boarders; that they form a very large proportion of her whole fortune, and that a part only of the house in which she lived was furnished for her own use and comfort. Hence it is argued that the bequest should be confined to the articles so used by her. I agree that the furniture of the schoolroom is not household furniture; desks, stools, slates, inkstands, maps, globes, &amp;c., cannot be brought within that category. The fact that the testatrix occupied one of the rooms of the house in which she resided for the purpose of a school would make no difference. But as to the remaining articles it is not easy to see how those employed for the comfort and convenience of boarders can be distinguished from such as are for the use of the members of the family, or of guests entertained withouj; pay. It cannot be pretended that these would not be included; otherwise the words would be narrowed down by construction to articles used personally by the testatrix herself; and for this there is neither reason nor authority. It certainly cannot be affected by the size of the establishment. A poor widow ekes out her livelihood in a small house by taking two or three boarders; would not the furniture of her parlor and kitchen, as well as of her guest-chambers, pass by a bequest of her household stuff? If so, can it make any <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>difference that there are fifty or one hundred boarders ? Where is the line to be drawn ? No doubt if a cabinetmaker or upholsterer, or other tradesmen were to make a will in those words, articles in his store or shop answering to the description would not pass, though he might have his residence in the same building. They would be in the way of his trade. So, if the keeper of a hotel lived in a different house the words would admit of a different construction. This is the extent to which the authorities relied on by the appellant go. We concur, therefore, in the conclusion at which the court below arrived.</p>
