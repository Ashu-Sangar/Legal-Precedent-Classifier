At the hearing Delaney, as a witness for the plaintiff, stated the lease had been altered as to its commencement and termination to the 1st of April, or to some date to suit the tenancy of Cooker. This statement took the defendant and his counsel by surprise. Mr. Vail, the counsel with defendant, stated that he had expected to prove by Delaney that the lease commenced on the 1st of January to suit Cooker’s lease; the witness did not seem to be perfectly certain but came to the conclusion that the facts were as he had stated them. Mr. Vail asked for an adjournment, alleging that at another hearing he could establish by one or more witnesses that the tenancy had been from January to January. The aldermen declined to allow an adjournment on account of the additional expense. The defendant then offered to pay the additional expenses; the aldermen still declining, the defendant offered to pay the expenses if the aldermen would grant an adjournment for half an hour. One of the objections to a continuance was that the defendant had no't taken out a subpoena for his witnesses.</p>

The principle on which the courts proceed on certiorari, in cases of this nature, is very well stated by Judge King, in Knight <em>v. </em>Parry, 1 Ashmead 221: “ If from the <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>whole facts a fair presumption arises that the justice boná fide refused to grant the continuance prayed for, because he believed the party was guilty of laches, or because he believed it merely colorable, and for the purpose of vexatious delay, the court will not and ought not to be astute to impute bad motives to him.” The aldermen in this case might with great reason consider that the defendant had been guilty of laches. He had taken out no subpoena, though he knew that the witness would testify as he desired, and he was within his reach. He alleges that he was taken by surprise by the testimony of the plaintiff’s witness ; but what right had he to be surprised ? The question when the lease terminated was material. It was the very gist of the contest. The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that it was on the 1st of April. The defendant could expect nothing else but that he would attempt to prove it. He was bound, therefore, to take measures to have his witness present to disprove it. If he came there in the vain confidence that the plaintiff would not be able to make out his case, he must bear the consequences of his mistake. He had no right to require that the course of justice should stop thirty minutes, or five minutes, to enable him to retrieve his error. We never hear parol evidence as to the merits of the case, but only of what occurred before the aldermen, as was settled in Buckmyer <em>v. </em>Dubs, <a href="/binn/5/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Binn. 29" data-case-ids="1793657" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0029-01">5 Binn. 29</a>.</p>
