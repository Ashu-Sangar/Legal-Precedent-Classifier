Still it has continuance till it is so defeated : Co. Litt. 331 a, note 286. Littleton’s opinion was adopted and followed in the case of Tooke <em>v. </em>Glasscock, 1 Saund. 250.

It is considered in that case that though the tenant in tail may part with the enjoyment of the land during his life by a deed of bargain and sale, or the sheriff may sell it on an execution, still he continues to be seised of the inheritance. It is clear, however, beyond any reasonable doubt, that if George K. Waters was tenant in tail, an indefeasible estate for his life passed by the deed of the sheriff .to his vendee; and as George K. Waters at the time of the trial below was still in full life, such an estate has vested in his vendee, or those claiming under him.</p>
