There was at <em>the </em>same time an insurance for $6000 in The Royal Insurance Company of Liverpool on the machinery, &amp;c., of the factory. Buckley on that day confessed a judgment to the plaintiffs for about $14,000, for which he was indebted to them. In March 1860, Farnum &amp; Co. had placed their mortgage in the hands of their attorney for collection, but were willing to give Buckley time upon the payment of $1000. At the request of Buckley, the plaintiffs advanced the $1000, Farnum &amp; Co. assigning to them one-third of their mortgage. On the 28th of March 1860 Buckley executed to the plaintiffs a bond for $1000, payable in a year, and he and his wife gave a mortgage on her own real estate to secure the payment of the bond. On the 31st of March Buckley assigned to the plaintiffs “ as collateral security” generally his interest in the policy of insurance. On the 2d of April the plaintiffs gave a certificate that Mrs. Buckley’s mortgage was collateral security for one-third of the Farnum’s mortgage assigned to them, and on the same day agreed in writing that Farnum &amp; Co. were to keep their mortgage, collect the $2000 and then hand it to the plaintiffs. The factory covered by Farnum’s mortgage was burned in March 1861, and the loss adjusted with the insurance company at $4200, which the plaintiffs received and appropriated to their $14,000 judgment. On the 6th of October 1861, Buckley’s factory property was sold by the sheriff under a lien prior to the Farnum mortgage; the plaintiffs received nothing from that sale. In April 1862, shortly after Mrs. Buckley’s mortgage was due, it was placed in the hands of P. Frazer Smith for collection. Mr. Smith wrote to Mrs. Buckley for payment. She replied, “ I will try <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>to get the money in a few days.” Mr. Smith wrote to her again, and Mr. Buckley afterwards called .on him with [his attorney. Buckley said he had called in consequence of the letter to his wife, and that he wanted time. Mr. Smith told Buckley and his attorney that the plaintiffs did not wish to press the collection if they could get the money without. Buckley said they must try to do it, but he did not know where to raise the money.</p>

The assignment, judged by its face alone, we would hold to be collateral security for all Mr. Buckley’s indebtedness to Garrett &amp; Martin, for its terms are general. But whether the circumstances surrounding the transaction and other evidence in the cause show it to have been intended <em>‘ </em>as collateral security for <em>Ms bond </em>given three days before, <em>and to secure Ms wife, </em>who had become his creditor,’ is a question for the jury. It is true, the eminent judge who delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court, when this case was before it, used the language embraced in this point. He did not, however, intend it to be regarded as a legal proposition, but simply as his judgment of what the facts tended to prove, for immediately following we find this language<em>: </em>And if it had been thus <em>submitted to the jury </em>their verdict must have been for the defendant.’ We did not before submit it, because we then regarded the question as controlled by the assignment itself, which as we have seen is in writing, and did not see any other evidence in the cause bearing upon it. We shall now submit the question to the jury as the Supreme Court has decided we should have done before, but, of course, without any suggestion of opinion how it should be decided. The jury must be guided in this respect by its own judgment uninfluenced by the court.</p>

And as this rules the case it is unnecessary to consider the errors assigned more particularly.’ Our own views heretofore expressed of- the question presented by this point have undergone no change. But in the different aspect in which the question now comes before the court, it seems to us that all difficulty in relation to it is removed. Eor if the jury finds that the assignment was <em>not </em>made with a view to secure the debt for which Mrs. Bucldey is liable and for <em>her </em>protection, but as security to Garrett &amp; Martin generally, with a view alone to their protection, they must be permitted to apply the money' received for such part of their debt as <em>needed protection, </em>or manifest injustice will be done. We would defeat the very object of the transfer by requiring them to do otherwise.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The debt covered by [Mr.’ Buckley’s mortgage was <em>amply secured. </em>About this no question was made, and none can be made.

To require the money, therefore, to be applied to this debt, would simply be to take away from the assignees all benefit of the assignment to this extent.</p>

As it is found, so must the case be decided.”</p>

It would require evidence of an express agreement or understanding to authorize the assignee to apply the amount of the insurance received in the event of a loss to any other debt or liability.
