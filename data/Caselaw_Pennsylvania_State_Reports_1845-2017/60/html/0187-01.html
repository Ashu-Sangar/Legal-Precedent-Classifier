Because the law requires if a man makes an assignment for the payment of his debts, and whether he is to gain that <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>object directly or indirectly — if he constitutes a trust for the payment of his debts, that whole trust shall be put on record in order to prevent the possibility of fraud. If it is not, then the creditors are entitled to come in at any period and impeach the transaction, and require the money to be paid instead of it going in pursuance of the trust. And from the time of the execution of the attachment all subsequent payments in pursuance of the trust will be in fraud of the creditor and against the law; at all events they are payments for which he cannot obtain credits as between himself and attaching creditors.] But the law is not so harsh as to call him or a creditor to account for payments made before the attachment. As to all disbursements made in execution of his trust before the attachment he is entitled to credits; but as to payments made after the attachment he is not entitled to credits.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b191-6" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[205,1023,1157,646]]]'>“ So the question comes down to you as one of account or fact, whether moneys were received by Taylor, the garnishee here, from the estate of Douredoure in his hands, subsequent to the time at which this attachment was levied, for which he is not entitled to credits, because, as to all such moneys received from that estate and forming part of this trust, he cannot credit himself for payments made afterwards. The period of time is fixed, namely, June 28th 1858. [What you will have to decide is, whether moneys were received by Taylor after that date, for which he is not entitled to credit for payments made before that date. If that be so, then, to the extent of the moneys so received, he is answerable to the attaching creditor.] I wish that question went to you in the case freed from all ambiguities. The principle of the law is a clear one; the facility of applying it is not so great for want of clearness in regard to the evidence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b191-7" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[206,1667,1157,685]]]'>“ In the first place, suppose this account laid before you is one in which Taylor charges himself for all the moneys received under this trust — and, as I understand it, he does so, making no distinction between them, being ignorant of the law, and not knowing it to be at all material. In point of fact, however, he had in his hands not only the lands belonging to Mr. Douredoure, but also lands belonging to Mrs. Douredoure. So far as Mrs. Douredoure’s lands were concerned, the creditors of her husband had nothing whatever to do with them. They had no right to be paid in derogation of the trust which she created. That property being her own, she could create just such a trust as she chose. [Subsequent to the time of the attachment coming in, the rents and profits derived from Mrs. Douredoure’s estate are such as Mr. Taylor is not chargeable for here. You need not consider those amounts in striking an account between subsequent payments and receipts.]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b191-8" data-blocks='[["BL_191.6",191,[251,2353,1112,45]],["BL_192.1",192,[294,410,1153,421]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>There is another point for consideration with regard to the <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>property destroyed. It is said, in this connection, that certain amounts of money were received from insurance companies. Now, if that money received from insurance companies was money resulting from the estate of Mrs. Douredoure, if they were her houses that were burned down, it would follow the property. I have already stated that for any rents of her own coming into the hands of Mr. Taylor he would not be bound here, except so far as he was executing his office as trustee. If it was Mr. Douredoure’s property that was burned down, other questions might arise.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b192-6" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[295,839,1155,815]]]'>“ If it was Mr. Douredoure’s property that was destroyed, then of course the proceeds arising from the insurance on that property ought to go in payment of his debts. Some portion of these moneys, it seems, went to pay off mortgages; and one question is, whether Taylor is entitled to a credit for the amount so expended in payment of these-mortgages. If these mortgages were, as is frequently the case, accompanied by an assignment of the policy of insurance, then the mortgagees would have a specific right to the application of any fund which might result from a destruction of the building to the payment of their debts. If Taylor received the money instead of the mortgagee, it would still be the mortgagee’s, and Taylor would be bound to pay it over. If there was no such assignment of the policy of insurance with the mortgage, then in that case you are to consider that although there was a mortgage on the land, yet so far as this money was concerned it was precisely like the payment of any other debt; and if Taylor was not entitled to pay the debts generally from the time the attachment came into his hands, neither then was he entitled to pay the mortgage.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b192-7" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[298,1654,1155,513]]]'>“ It appears that a certain portion of this insurance-money was applied to rebuild the houses — to repair the loss which the fire occasioned. If these houses were Mrs. Douredoure’s houses, the principle before mentioned applies as well here; [but if they were Mr. Douredoure’s, I do not conceive that a trustee for the benefit of creditors whose title to lands arises from a deed of trust, in case of a destruction by fire, can proceed to execute the trust by rebuilding after an attachment has been served upon him. He cannot proceed to apply that money to building up those houses, because it is in effect the money of the assignor in his hands, and therefore ought to go to the assignor’s creditors, and not to rebuild the assignor’s property.] * * *</p>

I <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>think that, so far as Mrs. Douredoure was concerned, it ought to be regarded as conclusive.

The recording of the papers made the mortgage valid against subsequent creditors.

Taylor being a mortgagee in possession, receiving rents, was bound to keep down encumbrances, and the service of the attachment would not relieve him. They can claim no more than their debtor, and he could not compel Taylor to collect rents and pay him, and let encumbrances and taxes go.

Mrs. Douredoure was surety for her husband, and had a right to be subrogated to the mortgage: 2 Story’s Eq.

He afterwards embarked in business and failed. He assigned all his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He then made an arrangement with William Taylor, to which the consent of the assignees and all his creditors was given, by which not only all the assigned but also the settled estates of his wife were to be conveyed to Mr. Taylor, who executed a declaration of trust, dated December 24th 1855, that he held the same upon condition that they were to be sold and the proceeds to be applied to repayment to him of the sum of $20,634, or thereabouts, already advanced and expended by him in purchase of debts and liabilities of said Bernard Douredoure, and of all other sums to be advanced by him for account of said Bernard Douredoure, and upon repayment to him of all sums so due, <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>together with lawful interest, that he would convey all of the property remaining unsold, that is to say, those formerly belonging to Mrs. Douredoure, to her or to her order, and those formerly belonging to Mr. Douredoure, to him or his order. The plaintiffs below subsequently, in T858, obtained a judgment in the District Court against Bernard Douredoure, upon which an attachment of execution was issued and served on William Taylor, June 28th 1858, who pleaded <em>nulla </em>bona, upon the trial of which issue the jury, under the instructions of the court, found a verdict for the plaintiffs. The learned judge charged that the several conveyances to Taylor, and the declaration of trust by him, were fraudulent and void as to the attaching creditors. The ground of this instruction seems to have been that they amounted to an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and not having been recorded within thirty days, were void under the 5th section of the Act of March 24th 1818, Pamph. L. 287. We think that in this there was error. Together they constituted merely a mortgage to Taylor, with a power of sale for the purpose of securing advances already made or thereafter to be made for the use and benefit of Douredoure. For what purposes the advances were to be made, or whether they were to be applied to their objects by the mortgagor or mortgagee, does not appear to be material. It was a security for debts thereafter to be contracted by the advance of money: Griffin <em>v. </em>Rogers, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20882" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Wright 882">2 Wright 882</a>. There was no trust for any creditor: the grantee could not be called on to account except by the grantor. Such a mortgage without any power of sale in the mortgagee has often been decided to be valid in Pennsylvania. “It is now settled,” says Mr. Justice Huston, in Stewart <em>v. </em>Stocker, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20140" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Watts 140">1 Watts 140</a>, “ that a mortgage or judgment may be given to secure a creditor, not only for a debt due, but for responsibilities, which are contingent, nay, for future advances:” Lisle <em>v. </em>Ducomb, <a href="/binn/5/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="5 Binn. 585" data-case-ids="1793678" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0585-01">5 Binn. 585</a>; Garber <em>v. </em>Henry, <a href="/watts/6/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="6 Watts 57" data-case-ids="1846033" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0057-01">6 Watts 57</a>; Parmentier v. Gillespie, 9 Barr 86; Moroney’s Appeal, 12 Harris 372. The power of sale does not vary the case: it creates no trust for creditors: it no more converts a mortgage to secure future advances to be applied in payment of the debts of the mortgagor into an assignment in trust for the benefit of creditors than would such a power in an ordinary mortgage given to secure a loan. The equity of redemption is subject to levy and sale on execution against the mortgagor, and the proceeds of sale, after payment of the advances, to an attachment in the hands of the mortgagee as garnishee. Neither do we regard the provision for commissions or compensation to the mortgagee as impressing the instrument with the character of an assignment within the Act of 1818. Whether such a provision ought to be pronounced usurious and therefore void, or whether a court of chancery, which watches with jealousy all unusual agree-<a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>merits between the mortgagor and mortgagee, clogging or embarrassing the equity of redemption, would consider it as oppressive and inequitable, and therefore not to be enforced, it is unnecessary here to determine. It does not render the mortgage void. We are dealing only with the question whether the instruments are within the 5th section of the Act of March 24th 1818. We are of opinion that they are not. This disposes of the first two specifications of error.</p>
    <p id="b196-6" data-blocks='[["BL_196.4",196,[267,758,1158,1105]]]'>Assuming the assignment to be void, the learned judge proceeded to apply to the case the principle settled in Re Wilson, 4 Barr 431, that for payments made under the trust before an adverse claim the assignee by a void assignment is protected, but only for such; and on that assumption his ruling was undoubtedly correct. But if the "conveyances to Taylor were not void, but constituted a valid mortgage to secure past and future advances, then his instructions to the jury as complained of in the 3d and 4th specifications were erroneous. If there was no personal assumption by Taylor of Douredore’s debts — if he was not bound by contract to discharge them, then according to Terhoven <em>v. </em>Kerns, 2 Barr 96, and Bank of Montgomery County’s Appeal, 12 Casey 170, advances made by him after a junior lien would be subject to it. But as mortgagee in possession he would be entitled to a ■credit for all sums paid on prior encumbrances, for taxes, premiums of insurance, repairs and other similar charges. If, on the other hand, Taylor was under obligation by contract to make advances, if he had bound himself personally to pay Douredoure’s debts, he would be entitled to the security of his mortgage for the advances made by him for this purpose though subsequent to the junior lien: Parmentier <em>v. </em>Gillespie, 9 Barr 86; Moroney’s Appeal, 12 Harris 72. The instruction to the jury therefore that Taylor was not entitled to credit for any payments made by him subsequent to the attachment, which were not contracted prior to that time, was erroneous, and the 3d specification of error must be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b196-7" data-blocks='[["BL_196.5",196,[276,1873,1148,118]]]'>The 4th specification refers to a part of the charge not made the subject of exception below, and cannot therefore be noticed here.</p>

Undoubtedly if Taylor was such a trustee this instruction was correct; but as our conclusion is that he was not, but merely a mortgagee, it is equally clear that if before the date of the attachment he had, with the consent of the mortgagor, made contracts for the rebuilding of the property destroyed by <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>fire, he had a right to apply the moneys received on the policies to such purpose.</p>
    <p id="b197-6" data-blocks='[["BL_197.4",197,[227,515,1156,1115]]]'>The 6th specification of error is grounded on the 5th exception to the charge that the decree of the Supreme Court was not conclusive as between Taylor and the attaching creditors as regarded the land of Mr. Douredoure. It appears that in 1862 a bill in equity was filed in the Supreme Court by Mr. and Mrs. Douredoure against Mr. Taylor, setting forth the several conveyances to and the declaration of trust by him, and that on December 1st 1860 an account had been stated by Mr. Taylor, showing a large balance in his favor, and that it was then agreed by him to accept in discharge certain portions of the real estate of Mr. Douredoure remaining unsold freed from the trust, and that he would convey to Mrs. Douredoure the remaining portions thereof, being part of the estate originally settled upon her. The bill prayed for the specific execution of this contract. It alleged also that Taylor, as part of the original arrangement, agreed and undertook to assume and pay the debts of the said Bernard Douredoure. Taylor filed an answer admitting the allegations of the bill, but setting up several attachment executions against Douredoure which had been served upon him, and among others that now before us by Cornelius &amp; Baker. Thereupon a supplemental bill was .filed, making all the attaching creditors parties, and among others, Cornelius &amp; Baker appeared and answered, setting up that the original conveyances to Taylor were fraudulent and void as against them; that their attachments were valid and subsisting, and bound all sums of money in the hands of Taylor received under the alleged trust.</p>
    <p id="b197-7" data-blocks='[["BL_197.5",197,[228,1629,1152,815]],["BL_198.1",198,[294,434,1150,1874]]]'>The cause was set down and heard on bill, answer and proofs, and a decree was made dismissing the bill as to the attaching creditors, but ordering that the contract should be specifically carried into execution; that the plaintiffs should execute and deliver to Taylor a release of certain property of Douredoure from the operation of the trust so that it should become absolutely his, .and that Taylor should convey to Mrs. Douredoure what remained unsold of her original separate estate. The learned judge below appears to have thought that so far as Mrs. Douredoure was concerned, this decree ought to be regarded as conclusive upon all parties; but that as between Mr. Douredoure, Mr. Taylor and Cornelius &amp; Baker, that when the bill was dismissed as to,[the attaching creditors, the court in effect said they would not adjudicate on that question; consequently it remained open for the decision of the jury. In this instruction we think that there was error. ■ The creditors were made parties in order that they might be heard if anything they had to say in opposition to the case made by the bill. If that case was true in fact they had no just claim upon Mr. Taylor as garnishee; if not true, as they were afforded the opportunity of <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>showing, the decree would have declared and established their rights and the bill been dismissed as to Mr. Taylor. Uxxless the release of Mr. and Mrs. Douredoure would give Mr. Taylor a good title, freed from the trust and freed from Douredoure’s debts, there could have been no decree for specific performance against him. If the conveyances and declaration of trust were valid, and were intended not merely to secure advances, which he was at liberty to make or not to make at his pleasure, but on his agreement to assume personally and discharge all the debts and liabilities of Mr. Douredoure existing at the time of the agreement, then Mr. Taylor was clearly entitled to retain all the property in his hands, including that of Mrs. Douredoure, until he was fully indemnified and repaid. Mrs. Douredoure had voluntarily pledged her own separate estate for this pui’pose, and if either the conveyances were void as an uxxrecorded assignment, or it was a mere mortgage to secure advances to be made by Taylor at his pleasure — the court surely would not have decx’eed a conveyance to Mx’s. Douredoure if the attachment was a subsisting lien and a personal claim against Taylor for any part of the fund which he had received and applied to his own advances. The decree was based ofl the merits of the whole case. The bill was dismissed as to the attaching creditors because no relief was asked against them — none was required. They were brought in to show cause against the decree, and if they could say nothing which xvould avail, to be bound by it. The decree that Mr. and Mrs. Douredoure should release Taylor,, and that Taylor should convey to Mrs. Douredoure, notwithstanding the attachment, was an adjudication against them from which they could have appealed. “ Where all the parties are brought before the court that can be brought before it,” says Lord Chancellor Redesdale, “ and the court acts on the property according to the rights that appear, without fraud, its decision must of necessity be final and conclusive:” Gifford <em>v. </em>Hart, 1 Sch. &amp; Lef. 408. And, again: “In Hungerford’s Case the creditors complained that the property had not been applied as it ought: it was objected that they should not come in under the decree and impeach the decree: it was answered that they might; for that if the decree contained in itself a wrong disposition of the property, they coming in as creditors had a right to appeal, because the decree bound their rights. In Osborn <em>v. </em>Usher, 2 Bro. P. C. 314, the same sort of principle was admitted if the right of a remainder-man or a person entitled to the estate in any way is bound by the decree, he must have a right to appeal from it, as well as the person against whom it is made:” Id. 489.</p>

It is enough that it is adverse to his interest: Johnston v. Churchill, <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a><a href="/citations/?q=6%20Litt.%20177" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="6 Litt. 177">6 Litt. 177</a>; Ogsburg <em>v. </em>La Farge, 2 Comst. 118; Wiswall <em>v. </em>Sampson, 14 How.

Whatever question was properly involved in the former suit, and might have been there raised and determined, is conclusively settled by the decree : Stockton <em>v. </em>Ford, 18 How. (S. C.) 418. To hold that the decree in this case is conclusive as to Mrs. Douredoure, so that the creditors have lost all claim on the estate conveyed to her, and yet is not conclusive as to Mr. Taylor, is to make the same decree dismissing the bill as to the attaching creditor — in the same breath — conclusive and inconclusive. If the assignment was void, or if it was a mere mortgage to secure future advances, the attaching creditors had a lien on the proceeds both of the estate of Mr. and Mrs. Douredoure, for both had been assigned, and the decree must be conclusive as to both or neither. The very questions now raised in this case were necessarily adjudicated in that — and all these parties were in court, and had a right and opportunity to be heard; and the decree is consequently conclusive upon them.</p>
