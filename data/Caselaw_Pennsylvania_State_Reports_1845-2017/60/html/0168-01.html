They had been conveyed to Samuel M. Poster, subject to a ground-rent. The land was sold by the sheriff on a judgment for arrearages of ground-rent, and conveyed by him to the plaintiff on the 7th day of February 1863. The amount of the purchase-money was $750, of which $610 were brought into court, distributed and paid out by order of the court. On the 29th of October 1864 the city of Philadelphia entered a lien against the whole lot as owned by Hands for taxes, amounting to $25.10, assessed against him in 1859, and it was sold by the sheriff on the 3d April 1865 to Mrs. Smith. After two years from the sale she obtained possession of the premises, and the plaintiff brought this ejectment to recover them.</p>

Primé facie this sum was sufficient to pay the taxes and costs, and it lay on the defendant to rebut this presumption. If the city failed to demand its claim from the sheriff, or to take the steps to obtain it, the lien will not follow the property in the hands of the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale. City taxes under the Act of 1824, and its supplements, are a prior but a divestible lien, unlike the fixed lien of a mortgage, which cannot be divested by a sale on a junior encumbrance, its lien is liable to be divested by any judicial sale, subject only to the restriction contained in the 6th section of the Act of 11th March 1846, which preserves the lien of so much of the tax as the proceeds of sale are insufficient to pay. This is the result of the decisions Northern Liberties <em>v. </em>Swain, 1 Harris 113, 202; City <em>v. </em>Cooke, 6 Casey 56, qualifying Gormley’s Appeal, 3 Id. 49; Duffy <em>v. </em>City, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20192" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Wright 192">6 Wright 192</a>.</p>
