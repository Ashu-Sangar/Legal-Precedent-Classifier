The writ was issued March 11th 1865. Both parties claimed under Jacob Miller, the elder, who was the father of the plaintiff and the grandfather of the defendant. The elder Miller died in 1839 intestate, leaving a widow, Ann Miller and seven children, of whom the plaintiff was one and William Miller, the father of the defendant, another. Two of the children conveyed their inte<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>rests to the plaintiff. On the trial, before Gilmore, P.

It also appeared by the evidence of the plaintiff that the whole tract had been granted by patent from the Commonwealth to persons named Hughes and Ryan; that the elder Miller, in 1824, which was long after the grant, entered upon it and claimed it; he built a house, cleared land and lived there till his death.

And in this case, if the jury believe the testimony, that old Jacob Miller remained in possession until his death in 1839, and his widow till 1845, and owned the same, there was at his death (he dying intestate) a descent cast upon his heirs; and if the jury believe the testimony of Joseph Bisset, John Kimble, Elias Mackey and others, that William claimed only a share, there was no such exclusive possession as to bar the plaintiff’s right to recover.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b18-7" data-blocks='[["BL_18.5",18,[337,978,1154,1323]]]'>Answer: “We are clearly of opinion that the Statute of Limitations could not commence to run till after the death of Jacob Miller. Of course there could be no ouster until after his death. If the defendant is entitled to retain his possession under the plea of the Statute of Limitations, it must be on the ground that there was an ouster of the co-heirs of Jacob Miller twenty-one years before the bringing of this suit. To establish an ouster between co-heirs there must be some plain, decisive and unequivocal act or conduct of the parties claiming, amounting to an adverse and wrongful possession in himself and disseisin of his co-heir. The disseisor must have the intention to hold the premises adverse to his co-heirs, but it is not necessary that he should make a formal declaration of this intention to his co-heirs, but while this is not required he must manifest by his conduct and acts that he holds possession hostile to his co-heirs. The making a sale or a will giving his estate to his children, as was done in this case, the will being witnessed by George Miller, would be a decisive, open, unequivocal act. But this intention to hold adverse may be abandoned, if he afterwards openly declared that he had relinquished his intention to hold the land, for himself, and declared that he only expected to get his share; this would show that he was not holding adversely, and would be admission that his possession was not inconsistent with the rights of co-heirs, and there would be no ouster. He might renew his hostile possession, but as he died in 1843, there is not much evidence on this subject. In referring thus to this evidence we do not withdraw from you the character of this evidence; much of it is impeached, and it is wholly denied that the witnesses proving these declarations are worthy, of belief. The witnesses on the part of the defendant are likewise impeached. You must judge of their credibility, and you are the sole judges of this.”</p>

He intended and expected to originate a title by settlement and improvement, and did not consider himself a disseisor. But his possession could be imputed as a disseisin if the land was already granted, although that was not his design. If he took possession, claimed it as his <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>own, and if he claimed to lines which he caused to be marked or claimed to lines already marked on the ground or other certain ■and ascertained boundaries, his possession would extend by construction to these lines or boundaries although the land was not all improved within the legal survey, but if'he designated no boundaries his disseisin would only extend to his actual possession or what was improved. It appears from the showing of the plaintiff that long before the entry of Jacob Miller the Commonwealth had appropriated the land and confirmed her grant .by patent to Hughes and Ryan, so that neither Jacob Miller nor any one else could acquire title to the land by settlement and improvement. We have no evidence of which we have any recollection that Jacob Miller knew that this land had been appropriated already by the - Commonwealth, nor is there much evidence that William Miller was better informed. We therefore charge you that if the facts set forth in the defendant’s points have been proved to your satisfaction, the plaintiff will not be entitled to recover. We hold that .Jacob Miller and those claiming under him are estoppedfrom asserting any title against William Miller and those claiming under him. It matters not that in this purchase from the Commonwealth he acquired nothing. If he acquired and paid for such title at the instance of Jacob Miller, and if he fulfilled the consideration of purchase to Jacob Miller and bought a title at his instance, he and all claiming under him are estopped to gainsay the title although it is not good and may not prevail against others. If you find the facts as set forth in these points you will be relieved from all further investigation of the evidence. If the plaintiff had not shown title to this property in Hughes and Ryan, the fact of William Miller taking out a warrant and procuring a survey for this land would have relieved this contract from the operation of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries. This is a reason why this title which William Miller procured from the Commonwealtfi ought not to be gainsaid by the plaintiff.”</p>

In Culler <em>v. </em>Motzer, 13 S. &amp; R. 356, it was held that a sale by one tenant in common of the whole tract is an ouster.

The uncontradicted evidence in this case showed that the co-tenant and plaintiff was a subscribing witness to the will, and according to the testimony of Elizabeth Miller the will was read in his presence. There could not have been a more open and unequivocal claim of an adverse title to the whole tract, and if the jury believed the evidence they were bound to find an ouster.

The substance of them was, that if the jury believed that the facts alleged and set forth in them were sustained and made out by the evidence the Statute of Frauds formed no objection to the defendant’s title. These facts were: that Jacob Miller, the father of the plaintiff and grandfather of the defendant, had settled on a tract of patented land; that, becoming old and infirm, he agreed with his son William Miller that if he would support him and his wife as long as they lived he should have the land; that to obtain a title William should apply for and take out a warrant in his own name, and procure thereon a survey and patent; that William accordingly procured a warrant, caused a survey to be made and paid the greater part of the purchase-money to the Commonwealth; that he built a dwelling-house, stable, barn and other improvements, and that he fully performed his agreement in supporting his father and mother during their lives. Now if Jacob Miller had been a settler on unappropriated land, and William had been an entire stranger, and had obtained a title from the state, and gone on and made improvements with the assent and encouragement of Jacob, can it be doubted that he would have been estopped ? When a man encourages another to settle on land and to go on and expend money and labor, he shall not afterwards take the land from the improver though he has an older and better title even though he was ignorant of his rights. To that effect are the cases of McCormick <em>v. </em>McMurtrie, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20195" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="4 Watts 195">4 Watts 195</a>, McKelvey <em>v. </em>Truby, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 323" data-case-ids="1856560" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0323-01">4 W. &amp; S. 323</a>. This is a stronger case, for there was evidence here of an express agreement; it was not mere assent and encouragement. Jacob Miller had no settlement right; he had no title, but bare possession; good indeed against all the world but the grantees of the Commonwealth. This possession was all that he agreed to give his son, it was all he had to give — that he might procure a <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>title from the state; both parties evidently supposing that such a title would-be available. On the faith of this agreement William went on and fulfilled his contract — took out the warrant and expended money and labor in improvements. If these facts were so, the jury were bound to find that Jacob Miller, the father, would be estopped from controverting William’s title or setting up an outstanding title in the prior patentees; and of course his heirs claiming in privity from him are subject to the same equitable disability.</p>
