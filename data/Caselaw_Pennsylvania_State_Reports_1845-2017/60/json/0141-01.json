        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nRead, J.\n\u2014 This case has been discussed at great length in the court below, on the original report of the auditor, and in the very learned opinion of Judge Brewster overruling the auditor. This makes it unnecessary to enter into a detailed examination of the numerous authorities cited by the counsel on both sides. John Rex, by his will, devised two tracts of land to his son, Joseph Rex, his heirs and assigns for ever, which was followed by this clause: \u201c Item. All the rest and residue of my personal property, of every description, not hereinbefore willed and bequeathed, I give and bequeath unto my sons, William and Joseph Rex, share and share alike, and to their heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d The estates thus given to Joseph Rex were absolute and unqualified, and both species of property are placed on the same footing. Then comes the clause which occasions the present dispute: \u201cItem. In case my said son Joseph, who is now in a declining state of health, shall happen to dye intestate and without issue, then, and in that case, I give, bequeath and devise the estate, real and personal, willed, bequeathed and devised unto him, to my son, the said William Rex, and to his heirs and assigns for ever, subject to the payment of one hundred and fifty pounds to each of my other sons, the said Jacob and John Rex, or to their respective heirs and assigns.\u201d\nThe testator died in 1802. William Rex died in March 1845. Joseph Rex remained in possession of the land devised to him until his death in 1859. Both brothers died intestate, unmarried and without issue.\nIt is unnecessary to consider whether the language used indicated a definite failure of issue, either in the lifetime of the testator or of William, because the words \u201c shall happen to die intestate\u201d negative entirely the idea that the clause gives only an estate tail to Joseph, with remainder to William. There is first an unqualified gift or devise in fee simple, and then a condition entirely repugnant to this estate upon which this is to go over to William. The result of the authorities is succinctly stated by Jarman on Wills, vol. 2, p. 15, thus: \u201cA power of alienation is necessarily and inseparably incidental to an estate in fee. If, therefore, lands be devised to A. and his heirs upon condition that he shall not alien or charge them with any annuity, the condition is void. And in like manner, a condition or conditional limitation annexed to a devise in foe, purporting to give the property over- in case the devisee shall die intestate, or shall not part with the property in his lifetime, is repugnant and void; since, in the first case, it would not only defeat the rule of law, which says that upon the death intestate of an owner in fee simple, his property shall go to his heirs at law, but also deprive him of the power of alienation by act inter vivos, and in the second case it would take away the testamentary power from an owner in fee.\u201d\nAnd the same author, in the same volume, page 19, says, \u201cIt is clear, therefore, that if a legacy were given to a person, his executors, administrators and assigns, an injunction not to dispose of it, though followed by a limitation over in case of non-compliance, the restriction would be void, and a gift over, in case of the legatee dying without making any disposition, would he also rejected as a qualification repugnant to the preceding absolute gift.\u201d The same doctrine is stated by Justice Williams, in the second volume of his treatise on \u201c The Law of Executors and Administrators,\u201d p. 176. The principles thus stated are supported by all the English and American cases cited in the argument, to which may be added Annin\u2019s Executors v. Vandoren\u2019s Administrator, 1 McCarter Ch. R. (N. J.) p. 135, decided by Chancellor Green.\nAgreeing therefore with the court below, the decree is affirmed at the costs of the appellant.\nDecree affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Karker\u2019s Appeal. Rex\u2019s Estate.\n1. General rules for the construction of wills should be adapted to the particular circumstances of the case.\n2. The words \u201c shall happen to die without issue\u201d generally mean an indefinite failure of issue and cut down a fee simple to a fee tail, but this rule lias no application to instruments conferring a power to devise in fee.\n3. A gift with uncontrolled power of devise carries the fee. What shall happen if the first taker die intestate is for the law to decide.\n4. A testator cannot say that although his devisee has the fee and power to devise, yet if he die intestate the law shall not take its course.\n5. If after devising to a son, his heirs and assigns, the testator add \u201c in case he shall happen to die intestate and without issue,\u201d then over, the word \u201c intestate\u201d recognising a power of devise, destroys the ordinary effect of the words \u201c die without issue,\u201d and leaves the fee unharmed thereby and intact.\n6. The limitation over after the fee is void.\n7. A devise to A. and \u201cin case\u201d of his death to B., is an absolute gift to A. unless he die in the testator\u2019s lifetime. Death generally, is not meant, but death in the lifetime of the testator.\n8. If the testator blend his realty and personalty, words which would create an estate tail as to realty are to be construed as carrying a fee, for there can be no estate tail in chattels.\n9. Where a testator devised to his son Joseph real estate \u201c to hold to him, \u201chis heirs and assigns,\u201d and bequeathed certain personal property to him, \u201c his heirs and assigns for ever,\u201d with a limitation over as follows, viz. \u201c In case my said son Joseph, who is now in a declining state of health, shall happen to die intestate and without issue, then and in that case, I give, &c., the estate, real and personal, willed, &c., unto him, to my son, the said William, and to his heirs and assigns for ever; subject to the payment of 150Z. to each of my other sons, the said Jacob and John, or their respective heirs and assigns,\u201dit was held,\n(\u0430) . That Joseph took a fee simple and not a fee tail.\n(\u0431) . That the limitation over to William was intended to provide for the death of Joseph within the lifetime of the testator, or in the lifetime of William, that it was therefore founded upon a definite failure of issue, and operated as an executory devise and not as a vested remainder, that Joseph having survived both these events, eo instanli the executory devise to William was defeated, and Joseph took a fee simple.\n(e). That the power of disposition in the first taker was inconsistent with the limitation over, and the latter is to be rejected as repugnant and void. Per Brewster, J.: approved by the Supreme Court.\n10. The words \u201c shall happen to die intestate\u201d negative the idea of an estate tail to Joseph with remainder to William.\nJanuary 6th 1869.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Read, Agnew and Sharswood, JJ. Williams, J., at Nisi Prius.\nAppeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court for the city and county of Philadelphia: No. 293, to January Term 1868.\nThese estates came before the court below upon exceptions to the report of Thomas Cochran, Esq., auditor, which presented the question as to the proper construction to be placed upon the following clauses in the will of John Rex, Sr.:\u2014\n\u201c I give and devise unto my son Joseph Rex all that my messuage * * to him, his heirs and assigns, for ever, &c.\n\u201c Item: In case my son Joseph, who is now in a declining state of health, shall happen to dye intestate and without issue, then and in such case I give, bequeath and devise the estate, real and personal, willed, bequeathed, and devised unto 'him, to my son the said William Rex, and to his heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d\nJoseph (the first taker) survived his father and his brother William. Both Joseph and William died intestate, unmarried and without issue, William having died first. His sister Sarah Karker granted all her share in his estate to her grandson. When J.oseph died the grantee under this deed claimed that Joseph\u2019s estate was only an estate tail, that William had a vested remainder in Joseph\u2019s share, and that Sarah Karker\u2019s deed had not only passed her share in William\u2019s estate, but a part of Joseph's share.\nIn opposition to this it was claimed that Joseph took an absolute fee, .and that WillianT(having died before Joseph) never had an interest in Joseph\u2019s share.\nThe question therefore was, whether the words above quoted gave Joseph a fee simple or a fee tail. The auditor decided in favor of the fee tail.\nExceptions were filed to his report, and the exceptions were sustained by the Orphans\u2019 Court in the following opinion:\u2014\n\u201c Brewster,, J. \u2014 These estates came before us upon exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, all of which have been withdrawn save those which present the question of the proper construction to be placed upon certain devises in the last will of John Rex.\n\u201c This instrument bears date November 5th 1801. The testator died on or about February 1st 1802, leaving surviving his widow and six children. After making various provisions in his will for his family, which it is unnecessary to recite, he gives in the 14th item thereof unto his son Joseph Rex two tracts of land particularly described, \u2018 to hold to him, his heirs and assigns for ever, subject only to the delivery of one-half of the fire-wood, and alsa one equal half part of the expense of keeping a cow for his said wife during her natural life, and except the water which may be spared willed unto his said son William.\u2019\n\u201c The next item bequeaths all the residue of the personalty to his sons William and Joseph Rex, their heirs and assigns for ever. Had the will stopped at this point, the family would have been spared much litigation, and the court considerable difficulty. The devisee, Joseph Rex, was, however, at that time in \u2018 a declining state of health;\u2019 and, anxious to provide for the very probable contingency of his death before the decease of the testator, or at all events before the decease of the brother William, the testator added the clause which has given rise to conflicting claims before the auditor, and to learned and exhaustive arguments before the court.\n\u201c The paragraph alluded to is in these words: \u2018 Item: In ease my said son Joseph, who is NOW in a declining state of health, shall happen to dye intestate, and without issue, then, and in that case, I give, bequeath and devise the estate, real and personal, willed, bequeathed and devised unto him, to my son the said William Rex, and to his heirs and assigns for ever, subject to the payment of 1501. to each of my other sons, the said Jacob and John Rex, or to their respective heirs and assigns.\u2019 The will then concluded with a clause appointing William and Jacob Rex executors, and revoking all former wills.\n\u201c The uncertainty of man\u2019s expectations was well illustrated, by the results in this ease. The son, whose early death was thus anticipated and provided for by the father, survived not only the testator, but his brother William. The father, as already stated, died in 1802, William Rex died in the year 1845, and Joseph Rex survived until the year 1859. As both of these sons died intestate, unmarried and without issue, it might have been that the heirs of one being the heirs of the other devisee, there would still have been no room for disputation. It seems, however, that shortly after the death of William Rex, his sister Sarah Rhoner, theretofore Sarah Karker (named in the will of her father Sarah Carager), by deed dated April 23d 1845, in consideration of natural love, of past support, and of $1, conveyed to her grandson, Jacob Karker, and his heirs, \u2018 all her interest in and to the estate of her late brother, William Rex, deceased.\u2019\n\u201c If this grantee can therefore successfully maintain his position that this deed passed not only the estate of William in his own right, but also in what is here called the remainder of Joseph\u2019s estate, or if, in other words, William died seised of a vested remainder in Joseph\u2019s estate, which passed to his sister Sarah amongst his other heirs, then this deed sweeps to the grandson all Sarah\u2019s distributive share, to the utter exclusion of her other descendants.\n\u201c To accomplish this result it is of course necessary for Mr. Karker to demonstrate that upon the death of the testator, John Rex\u2014\n\u201c 1st. Some interest in Joseph\u2019s share instantly vested in William.\n\u201c 2d. That this interest in Joseph\u2019s share was an estate not liable to be defeated by Joseph\u2019s survivorship.\n\u201c If he can succeed in establishing these propositions, then it follows that instantly upon the death of John Rex, tho foot of William was planted upon his brother Joseph\u2019s share, and that, although he died before Joseph, his heirs stood in his shoes; that Sarah Karker, as one of those heirs, was thereupon in like manner seised of an estate in Joseph\u2019s share which by her deed passed to her grandson, to the present exclusion of his own father, and all who would but for that deed inherit Joseph\u2019s share as the descendants of his sister Sarah.\n\u201c This statement of the relative positions of these different claimants brings us to the words of the will which is to decide between them.\n\u201cAnd here it should be remarked that none of the numerous cases with which the books abound can be declared to be an unerring guide to the true construction of this will. Like all other such instruments, it must, subject to the general rules upon this subject, be its own interpreter.\n\u201c Mr. Redfield has well expressed this thought in his valuable treatise on Wills, p. 423. He says: \u2018 Precedents ought never to be allowed an arbitrary and unbending control of any case not precisely analogous \u2014 we might say not strictly identical. * * * We ought never to forget that mere analogies never rise above the character of assistants. We should not, therefore, allow ourselves to become slaves to them.\u2019\n\u201c The same writer has also wisely told us that \u2018 There is in the majority of cases an opportunity to adapt general rules of construction to the particular circumstances of each case as it arises. And when it is not found practicable to bring the cause to that result which the particular facts and circumstances seem to indicate as the most conformable to reason and justice, it is always to be feared that the comprehension and wisdom of the court fell short of the emergeney in which they were placed.\u2019\n\u201c To the same effect is the syllabus of Passmore v. Huggins, 25 Law J. Rep. N. S. Ch. 251, 21 Beav. 103. \u2018 In.the construction of wills the court will consider the intention of the testator, the state of the parties provided for, and to remove inconsistencies,\u2019 will change a word. Our Supreme Court have enunciated the same principle in Rewalt v. Ulrich, 11 Harris 388.\n\u201c In construing this will, let us look to the intention of the testator as illustrated by the state of the parties provided for, in order, as Mr. Redfield says, \u2018 to bring the cause to that result which the particular facts and circumstances seem to indicate as the most conformable to reason and justice.\u2019\n\u201c The will is here our only directory. It tells us that the testator remembered well, and, as far as we can judge, impartially, his wife and all his children. He does not appoint Joseph one of his executors, refers to him as then \u2018 in a declining state of health,\u2019 and declares that \u2018 in case Joseph shall happen to die intestate and without issue, then and in that case the testator bequeaths and devises all the real AND PERSONAL estate devised unto him, to William Rex\u2019 in fee, subject to the payment of 150?. each, \u2018to Jacob and John Rex.\u2019\n\u201c It is clear, therefore, that the father thought his son Joseph might soon die. He does not say, that in the event of that death, all the estate bequeathed to Joseph shall pass to or belong to William; but seeming to regard it as probable that Joseph might die before the testator, and desirous of being spared in such a contingency the trouble of drawing a new will, he uses the peculiar form of expression \u2018 they, and in that ease I give\u2019 the estate to William which I have heretofore devised to Joseph, and I direct William, whose share is thus increased, to pay 150i. to each of his brothers Jacob and John, in order, as we read the will, to readjust the division of the property.\n\u201c Does this mean that Joseph was to have but an estate tail, which without fine, recovery or bar, would be but a poor life estate to him ? To give the will this construction we must strike out the words \u2018 heirs and assigns for ever\u2019 which have always been descriptive of a fee simple, and the word \u2018 intestate\u2019 which clearly recognised the already bestowed power of devising, and which is at utter war with the existence of an estate tail.\n\u201c Now, although it is very true that by numerous decisions in Pennsylvania the words \u2018 shall happen to die without issue\u2019 have been construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue, and hence to cut down a fee simple to a fee tail, yet in no case that I have been able to find has this decision been applied to instruments expressly or impliedly conferring the power to devise. And this for the very simple reason that no court could call a man tenant in tail who had the power to devise a fee simple.\n\u201cA brief examination of the Pennsylvania authorities on this point will illustrate this position.\n\u201cIn Clark v. Baker, 3 S. & R. 470 (1817), Theodoras Lord devised his plantation to his daughter and granddaughter, \u2018to hold to them and the survivor and their lawful issue for ever.\u2019 Then followed a cross-remainder to the survivor in default of lawful issue of the deceased, and if \u2018 both should die without leaving lawful issue, then remainder to Daniel Williams.\u2019 This was held to give the daughter and granddaughter estates tail. It will be observed that there was no power of devise.\n\u201c It is true there was a power of sale, but C. J. Tilghman did not regard this as inconsistent with the estate tail, for he quotes from the will to show that this authority really gave no right to dispose of the corpus of the estate, as \u2018 the principal had to be locked up for the benefit of the daughter and granddaughter and their issue indefinitely.\u2019\n\u201c In G-ause v. Wiley, 4 S. & R. 509 (1818), there was a devise to the testator\u2019s daughters, and if either of them should \u2018 die without issue, then the inheritances to descend to the next elder.\u2019 This was in connection with the w'hole will construed to be an estate tail, but in no clause of the instrument was there an express or impljed power of devising.\n\u201c The same remark is applicable to Eichelberger v. Barnetz, 17 S. & R. 293 (1828), where the limitation was in these words, \u2018if my grandson Abraham should die without issue, the part, as willed to him, is to fall to my heirs hack, to be divided amongst my children.\u2019\n\u201c In Caskey v. Brewer, in the same volume, p. 441, the clause cutting down the fee simple reads, \u2018 if either of my said daughters should die without issue, then the share of said daughter shall vest in the other daughters,\u2019 &c.; but here again was no grant or recognition of a power to devise the estate.\n\u201c The other cases I have examined are Heffner v. Knepper, 6 Watts 18 (1837); Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 Id. 447 (1840); Langley v. Heald, 7 W. & S. 96 (1844); Vaughan v. Dickes, 8 Harris 609 (1853); Pierce v. Hakes, 11 Id. 231 (1854); Braden v. Cannon, 1 Grant 60 (1854); Ivins v. Scott, 2 Casey 215 (1856); Price v. Taylor, 4 Id. 96 (1857); Rancel v. Cresswell, 6 Id. 158 (1858); Criley v. Chamberlain, Id. 161 (1858); Doyle v. Mullady, 9 Id. 264 (1859); Kay v. Scates, 1 Wright 31 (1860); Wynn v. Story, 2 Id. 166 (1861); Barnet v. Deturk, 7 Id. 92 (1862); and Hagerty v. Albright, 2 P. F. Smith 274 (1866).,\n\u201c Without encumbering this opinion with extracts from the wills construed in each of those cases, it is sufficient to say that in no one of them is there an express or implied power of general devise in the first taker.\n\u201c In Doyle v. Mullady, 9 Casey 264, and Wynn v. Story, 2 Wright 166, there was an attempted restriction on the power of disposition.\n\u201c In Barnet v. Deturk, 7 Wright 92, there was a proviso to the limitation over that if the son \u2018 should sell the aforesaid property he may grant and assign it as he likes.\u2019 A sale was made by the devisee though for a nominal consideration, and his grantee immediately reconveyed.\n\u201c In a very able opinion by Woodward, P. J., this exercise of the power was held to divest the estate limited to the plaintiffs, and the Supreme Court, in a learned review of the law by Read, J., affirmed the judgment, declining, however, \u2018to examine into the exact nature of the estate that would have been vested\u2019 in the first taker if he had not made the conveyance referred to.\n\u201cKay v. Scates, 1 Wright 31, may be regarded as overruled by Barnet\u2019s Appeal, 10 Id. 392, and Shailkland\u2019s Appeal, 11 Id. 113, so far as it affirmed Kuhn v. Newman. With reference, however, to the point now before us for decision, Kay v. Scates is untouched by any later authority, and it has been therefore examined in connection with its kindred cases, which rule that the expression \u2018leaving no issue\u2019 indicates an indefinite failure of issue, and therefore reduces the fee simple to a fee tail.\n\u201c In Kay v. Scates there was a power of appointment, limited, however, \u2018 to the issue\u2019 of the first takers, and that case is therefore no exception to the remark, already made, that no one of the testaments referred to in the decisions which favor Jacob Karker\u2019s construction of this will contained a word which expressly or impliedly gave to the first taker the right of devising the estate.\n\u201c Let us then see whether the will of John Rex gave the power of- devising to Joseph Rex, and if it did, let us next inquire whether this distinction between it and the other cases referred to is or is not of importance in determining the true construction of the clause now in dispute.\n\u201c The will says: \u2018 In case my said son Joseph, who is now in a declining state of health, shall happen to dye intestate and without issue, then and in that case\u2019 the real and personal estate is devised to William Rex, &c.\n\u201c It is therefore too clear to need argument that William could take nothing of Joseph\u2019s share unless Joseph died intestate and without issue. If Joseph left a will, the estate would of course pass to his devisees, and this must be regarded as a clear recognition of his right to devise the estate given to him in the preceding sentences. What then is the estate over which a man has the absolute power of general, uncontrolled, unlimited devise ? Who can, with any regard to technical propriety, call such an estate a fee tail ?\n\u201c Upon this point the case of Church v. Disbrow, 2 P. F. Smith 219, must be regarded'as conclusive,'not only because it is the last decision, but because the industry of the learned judge who delivered the opinion, and of the able counsel who argued the cause, have supplied us with perhaps every citation touching the question.\n\u201cWoodward, C. J., says: \u2018A devise of an estate generally or indefinitely, with a power of disposition over it, carries a fee.\u2019 It will be observed that there the devisee was only to hold the estate \u2018during her lifetime,\u2019 but she was also \u2018to dispose of the same as should seem best to her,\u2019 with a strong expression of the testator\u2019s wish that the devisee should leave the property for the benefit of a certain charity. She died without having made any deed or will; but our District Court and the Supreme Court ruled that she had taken a fee simple, and that the land descended 'to her heir at law.\n\u201cHere, then, in John Rex\u2019s will we find a fee simple in Joseph, with an express recognition of an uncontrolled power of devise. What shall happen in case of Joseph\u2019s intestacy, he 'being absolute owner, is for the law to declare. The testator could not say that although Joseph had the fee and the power to will, yet, if he died intestate, the law should not take its course. This has been attempted, but the effort has been frustrated by the courts.\nThe case of Gulliver v. Vaux was an ejectment which raised the question of the proper construction of the will of Thomas Turney. It was decided in 1746, but, so far as I can ascertain, was not reported for upwards of a century after the judgment had been entered. In the argument of Holmes v. Godson, 8 De Gex, McN. & G. Rep. 156 (1856), Mr. Lee, as amicus curice, referred the court to this case, and the reporters deemed it of sufficient importance to extract it from Mr. Justice Burnett\u2019s MSS., and to publish it at p. 167, following the report of Holmes v. Godson. The language in Turney\u2019s will is almost identical with the words we have been considering. He says, \u00a3 in case it shall so happen that all my three children shall depart this life without leaving issue, &c., and without appointing the disposal of the same, then and in such case, I give,\u2019 &c.\n\u201c The arguments there were directed to the same points as those discussed at our bar.\n\u201c On the one side it was contended that the first takers had but an estate tail, and that the words referring to the appointing power might mean \u2018 not having disposed thereof by fine or recovery.\u2019 It was also urged, that at all events it was good as an executory devise. The defendant\u2019s counsel contended that it could not be a remainder, because it came after a fee, and that as an executory devise it was too remote.\n\u201c Willes, L. C. J., was of opinion that the bequest was not good as a remainder, but that it would hold as an executory devise. In which opinion Abney, J., concurred, but Burnett, J., differed from his brethren upon ground not taken in the argument, to wit, that this was \u2018a condition or contingency repugnant to the estate devised, and must be void;\u2019 which he illustrated and supported by a number of authorities.\n\u201c The advantages of a minority were well asserted in this case, for the note-book adds, \u2018 Afterwards, upon conference between us, Willes, L. C. J., and Abney, J., changed their opinions, and Willes, L. C. J, delivered the resolution of the court agreeable to my opinion.\u2019\n\u201c Holmes v. Godson, 8 De Gex, McN. & G. 153, arose upon the will of Rev. Thomas Yates Ridley. He devised certain real and personal estate to his son, to vest upon attaining twenty-one years of age, with a limitation over, \u00a3 in case my dear son shall not live to attain the age of twenty-one years, or having attained the age of twenty-one years, shall not have made a will.\u2019\n. \u00a3\u00a3 Lord Justice Knight Bruce, after referring to the cases cited, \u00a3 not less than twelve,\u2019 decided that the words \u00a3 or having attained the age of twenty-one years, shall not have made a will,\u2019 were of no force, and the son having attained his majority, it was held that the estate had vested in him, and did not divest by his subsequent death intestate. This opinion was concurred in by Lord Justice Turner, and the gift over was declared repugnant and void.\u2019 The will of Henry Naglee was twice before our Supreme Court in Williams v. Leech, 4 Casey 89, and Naglee\u2019s Appeal, 9 Id. 89. There after a devise in fee, came a clause restraining the power of alienation, reducing the fee to a life estate, and declaring that after the death of the first taker the property should he equally divided among the children. Yet it was decided that none of these clauses touched the fee.\n\u201c\u2022To the same effect are Reifsnyder v. Hunter, 7 Harris 41, and Walker v. Vincent, Id. 369. Mary Biddle\u2019s Estate, 4 Casey 60, although decided upon a point which will he noticed hereafter, distinctly recognised the principle of the law which disregards limitations over inconsistent with the fee of the first taker. It will also he observed that the power in Joseph of making a will is fatal to the executory devise, if such it is to be called, in favor of William: Vide Jackson v. Robbins, 16 Johns. Rep. 585. The two are pronounced by all the authorities as \u2018 perfectly incompatible and repugnant to each other, and the latter is to he rejected as void.\u2019\n\u201c It may be answered to all this that the word \u2018 intestate,\u2019 in recognising a power to devise, confers no greater estate than had been previously given by the words \u2018 heirs and assigns for ever;\u2019 that they clearly give an estate in fee simple; and that as every tenant in fee can devise, the word \u2018 intestate,\u2019 upon which so much stress has been laid, is after all but mere surplusage.\n\u201cBut the moment the objector advances this argument, he moves into check. For it should not be lost sight of in this discussion that Mr. Karker can only recover by cutting down the fee simple in Joseph to a fee tail. When, therefore, he answers that the word \u2018 intestate\u2019 is surplusage as applied to a fee simple, he instantly destroys his whole case. If, therefore, the issue'here is between a fee simple and a fee tail, the word \u2018 intestate\u2019 gives its fiat to the discussion.\n\u201cIt would seem, therefore, that the same word distinguishes this from the other limitations over in our books, and that the subsequent attempt of the testator to make a new law of intestacy has not been favored by the courts.\n\u201c There is another expression in this devise which should not be lost sight of. The testator says, \u2018 In case\u2019 his son \u2018 who is now in a declining state of health shall happen to dye\u2019\n\u201cWas he thinking, as he published these words, of a death which might overtake Joseph fifty-eight years thereafter? He must have known that properties in the neighborhood of large cities increase greatly in value with the efflux of time. He could not foresee the rise which has taken place in the values of half a century past, but he may fairly be presumed to have had the usual understanding possessed by men of the most ordinary intelligence upon such a subject. In the light of that reflection can it be supposed as within the range of possibility that this testator intended 300i. as the sum which should at any period of time, however remote, equalize the devise over to William of a double share of the estate ?\n\u201c Let us turn from conjecture to the definition which the law has applied to the words before us.\n\u00a3\u00a3 Where personal estate is given to a person indefinitely or absolutely, \u2018 and in case of his death\u2019 to another, this disposition, though apparently constituting a gift of a life interest with a quasi remainder, * * is, in the absence of all indications of a contrary intent, construed to amount to an hypothetical limitation of the absolute interest, to take effect in the event of the person named as first taher surviving the testator, with 'an alternative limitation over, to take effect in case of the death of the first taker in the lifetime of the testator, &c. : Smith on Executory Devises [338-9].\n\u00a3\u00a3 And again, \u00a3 even where the gift over is not simply on the event of death,\u2019 but without issue, &c., the death will be construed not to mean a death generally, at some time or other, but in the testator\u2019s lifetime, &c.: Id. [347].\n\u201c The grounds of this rule, and the decisions which support it, are given at length by the learned author in the pages cited. Amongst other illustrations he puts the case : \u00a3 Thus a bequest to A. and in case of his death to B., is a gift absolute to A., unless he die in the testator\u2019s lifetime.\u2019 He adds [351] that this construction is equally applicable to real estate, and he criticises at some length an opposite decision. See also Id. [344], [349], [352].\n\u00a3\u00a3 In Clayton v. Lowe, 5 Barn. & Ald. 636, after a devise in fee to three grandchildren, the testator added that \u00a3 if either of them should happen to die without child or children lawfully begotten, then such part or share of the one so dying should be equally divided among the survivors.\u2019 It was held that upon the death of the testator the grandchildren took an indefeasible estate in fee simple.\n\u00a3\u00a3 In Caldwell v. Skilton, 1 Harris 152, after a devise to children in fee, the testator added, \u00a3 in case of the death of either of my said children, his or her share to descend to the children of said child, or if said child should die without issue born alive, then the said share to be divided among my surviving children.\u2019 These words are almost identical with those in the will of John Rex, but they recognised no powrnr of devising.\n\u00a3i,The point' argued was, whether one of the devisees had an indefeasible estate in fee simple. Judge Burnside, in an opinion of three lines, decided against the limitation over. It was ar\u2019gued before the court in banc as here, that the expression \u00a3 in case of the death,\u2019 meant \u00a3 death generally or whenever it might happen ;\u2019 but Bell, J., in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, says : \u00a3 l am satisfied, * * upon the authority of all the cases, that by this phrase the testator did not mean death generally, but in the contingent sense of death occurring within a particular time,\u2019 &c. Lie then reviews the English cases and quotes at length from Powell on Devises, ch. 37. The sum of all the authorities there cited, when applied to the case now before us, requires us to rule that John Rex \u2018 referred to the death of his devisee in the lifetime of the testator.\u2019 The case of Caldwell v. Shilton was followed by the decision in Mary Biddle\u2019s Estate, 4 Casey 60, in rvhich, after a devise in fee embracing both realty and personalty, the testatrix added limitations over \u2018in the event of her daughter\u2019s death without children.\u2019 This court ruled that the devisee took but an estate for life, but the Supreme Court reversed, and decreed the estate to the devisee in her absolute right. Lowrie, J., says: \u2018 The subsequent dispositions were intended to take effect if Anne should die before her mother.\u2019\n\u201c The next year Vice-Chancellor Wood decided the same way in Schenck v. Agnew, 4 Kay & Johnson\u2019s Ch. Rep. 405. In that case, after a bequest in fee, the testator added, \u2018 and in the event of her death then to her youngest surviving son.\u2019 The old argument was repeated that this meant \u2018 death generally,\u2019 but the Vice-Chancellor said: \u2018 He had looked into the authorities, and had come to the conclusion that * * the plaintiff was entitled * * absolutely; the gift to her youngest son being a substantial gift intended to take effect in the lifetime of the testator.\u2019 He added that there was but one case, Lord Douglass v. Chalmer, which appeared at all to stand in the way, but of that case he signify cantly said that it appeared never to be cited except for the purpose of being distinguished.\u2019 Hagerty v. Albright, 2 P. F. Smith 274, so far as the decision touches this question, is in recognition of the principle thus authoritatively established.\n\u201c But again we find this testator blending his personal and real estate. It is \u2018 the real and personal estate willed, bequeathed and devised unto\u2019 Joseph, which is to go over to William.\n\u201c That there can be no estates tail in chattels is too well settled to require argument, illustration or citation. The rule upon this subject, the reasons therefor, and the authorities which go to the extfemest length, may all be found in Smith on Executory Devises [307] et seq.\n\u201cIn holding that Joseph took an absolute fee simple, and that the limitation over was substitutional, intended only to apply to the contingency of Joseph\u2019s death in the lifetime of his father, we are but administering those favorite principles of the law which require us in doubtful cases to regard the first taker as the principal subject of the testator\u2019s bounty, which-favor the free alienation of estates, and which wisely hold the broadest equality to be the purest equity.\n\u201c If the views herein suggested have any foundation in law or logic, it would follow that the word intestate is the destruction of both the opposing theories upon which Mr. Karker\u2019s claim is founded, that even if it were otherwise, the limitation is void, and that at all events it never was intended to apply to a case wherein the first taker, as here, survived the testator. And if it should be answered that this is all mere technicality and refinement, may it not be fairly replied that Mr. Karker\u2019s claim is itself founded upon the subtlest of all reasoning, for he would introduce here a jargon of limitations over, indefinite failures of issue and fees tail, of which this good testator had probably never heard or even dreamed, and the slightest intimation of which would have driven him to a cold intestacy. It is meet, therefore, that this claimant should be defeated with his own weapons, for it is written Nee lex est cequior ulla, quam neeis artifices arte perire sua.\u2019\n\u201c Other points might be suggested, and other cases might be cited in support of the foregoing views. But they would only encumber an opinion already too long extended. We have been induced to go over the case, and to consider it at this length only in deference to the ability with which these exceptions were argued upon both sides, and in order to meet and answer every possible view which could be suggested against the construction herein intimated as proper to be applied to this will. It is due to the learned auditor to say, that many of the cases herein referred to were not cited before him.\n\u201c Considering all that we have heard and examined, we believe that the learned auditor erred in his conclusions, and therefore the\n\u201cExceptions to the report are sustained.\u201d\nFrom this decree Jacob Karker appealed to the Supreme Court.\nP. W. Sellers and Gceo. W. Thorne, for appellant,\nargued:\u2014\n1. That although Joseph knew that if he died without a will his share would go to William, he yet lived thirty-five years without making a will.\n2. That the devise of the fee to Joseph was cut down to an estate tail by the limitation over; that there was no case against this view in Pennsylvania: Wynn v. Story, 2 Wright 166.\n3. That the words \u201c die intestate\u201d gave by implication a power to appoint. But if the power were never executed it went for nought: Second Reformed Church v. Disbrow, 2 P. F. Smith 219.\n4. That the intent of the testator was to govern unless inconsistent with some acknowledged rule of law. We are bound to presume the testator used these words in the sense in which they had been construed by the courts.\n5. To \u2018 die without issue\u201d means without issue at the time of his death, and is definite: Beachcroft v. Broome, 4 T. R. 441; Fearne on Rem. 366, 551. Hence this is an executory devise, and the report is correct, though we may differ as to the reasons given.\n6. There is no blending of the realty and personalty.\nThe intent governs if not contrary to law: Findlay v. Riddle, 3 Binn. 149: Zimmerman v. Anders, 6 Wend. 219; Johnson v. Morton, 10 Barr 247. Devisor before 1833 could not pass lands not vested in him: Girard v. City, 2 Wall. 301; Gable v. Daub, 4 Wright 217. Under a power of appointment by will the appointee takes under the will: Goodill v. Brigham, 1 Bos. & P. 192; Maundrell v. Maundrell, 10 Ves. 246; Roach v. Wadham, 6 East 289; Ray v. Pung, 5 Mad. 310; s. c. 5 B. & Ald. 561; Cleere\u2019s Case, 6 Rep. 176 b; Tickner v. Tickner (cited in Parsons v. Freeman, 3 Atk. 742); Logan v. Bell, 1 Man. Gr. & S. 884. The testator had a right to give to the tenant in tail power over the fee: Clark v. Baker, 3 S. & R. 470. The following cases construe a case like that in hand: Gause v. Wiley, 4 S. & R. 509; Hoffner v. Knepper, 6 Watts 18; Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 Id. 447; Vaughan v. Dickes, 8 Harris 509; Doyle v. Mullady, 9 Casey 264; Matlack v. Roberts, 4 P. F. Smith 148. William took a fee simple as an executory devise: Barnett v. De Turk, 7 Wright 92; Langley v. Heald, 7 W. & S. 96; Jessup v. Smuck, 4 Harris 327; Gurnall v. Wood, Willes 211; Ivins v. Scott, 2 Casey 215; Curran v. McMeen, 5 P. F. Smith 487; Nicholson v. Bettle, 7 Id. 384.\nFro. O. ffannis, for appellee, contended : \u2014 \u25a0\n1st. That the limitation over was on definite failure of issue: Fulton v. Fulton, 2 Grant 28; Johnson v. Morton, 10 Barr 248; Biddle\u2019s Estate, 4 Casey 59.\n2d. The real and personal estate were blended.\n3d. That the time during which the death of Joseph was to vest the estate in William was expressly or impliedly limited to the lifetime of the testator, or, at all events, the lifetime of William: Caldwell v. Skilton, 1 Harris 155; Eichelberger v. Barnetz, 17 S. & R. 293; Eby v. Eby, 5 Barr 461; Langley v. Heald, 7 W. & S. 96; Johnston v. Currin, 10 Barr 500; Hagerty v. Albright, 2 P. F. Smith 276; Duval\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 112; Jessup v. Smuck, 4 Harris 327.\n4th. That the words \u201c die intestate\u201d implied a power to dispose by will inapplicable to an estate tail. A man may have a life estate with power of appointment but not of devise: Johnson v. Morton, 10 Barr 248.\n5th. That William could not take a remainder, for that cannot be limited after a fee: Church v. Disbrow, 2 P. F. Smith 219; Jackson v. Robbins, 16 Johns. 585. The words \u201c die intestate\u201d are also fatal to the limitation over, treating it as an executory devise.\n\u201cIncase\u201d denotes a contingency: Smith on Executory Interests 339. Words may be changed, &c., when the context requires it: Abbott v. Middleton, 21 Beav. 143; Redfield on Wills 453; Passmore v. Huggins, 21 Beav. 108; Rewalt v. Ulrich, 11 Harris 388; Matlack v. Roberts, 4 P. F. Smith 148. The limitation over of the \u00a1personalty and realty by the same words show that the same estate in each was intended: Morrison v. Semple, 6 Binn. 98; Steele v. Thompson, 14 S. & R. 101. The dying intended was in the lifetime of the testator: 2 Powell on Devises 763-765; Rapp v. Rapp, 6 Barr 49; 1 Roper on Legacies 400; 2 Id. 1551; Ross v. Drake, 1 Wright 376; Schenck v. Agnew, 4 Kay Johns. Ch. R. 405. An estate tail is not within the intestate laws: Goodright v. Morning Star, 1 Teates 313; Jenks v.
