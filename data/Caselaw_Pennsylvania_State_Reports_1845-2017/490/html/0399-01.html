The DER, without passing upon this PPC proposal, petitioned the Lawrence County Court for an adjudication of contempt, contending that the PPC failed to submit a plan that would assure compliance with the standards. Shortly thereafter, a “Complaint for Civil Penalties” was initiated before the Environmental Hearing Board (EHB) against the PPC, 35 P.S. § 4009.1, alleging violations of the DER pollution control regulations at the Lawrence County plant. 25 Pa.Code §§ 123.11 and 123.22.

We begin this analysis with the recognition that “technological forcing” would be severely restricted if the regulating body is to be limited to the options of compliance or closure. It is evident in cases of technological impossibility that immediate compliance could not be achieved and closure does not <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>provide the incentive for the developmental process necessary to meet the problem. Thus the concept of “technological forcing” by its terms recognizes that an unacceptable air quality level will be condoned for a period of time during which the developmental process is occurring. Industrial prosperity, from which tax revenues are derived, and the health of the citizenry, are both matters of high priority for any governmental unit. Where these two interests conflict some accommodation must be made. Congress has given priority in the area of air quality to the health of the citizenry, but it has also provided the flexibility to allow for the other important concern for industry. Thus the question properly framed is whether during the period where an unacceptable pollutant level is being permitted a regulatory body may constitutionally impose, as a condition, a fine to act as an incentive to the industry to develop processes to meet the pollution problem.</p>

Accepting this predicate, and recognizing that if experience proves in a given instance that this thesis is erroneous, the dynamics of business would terminate the enterprise, we cannot agree with the Commonwealth’s thesis that the assessment of civil penalties in this case was not reasonably related to the achievement of the public interest and thus an abuse of the state’s police power.</p>
