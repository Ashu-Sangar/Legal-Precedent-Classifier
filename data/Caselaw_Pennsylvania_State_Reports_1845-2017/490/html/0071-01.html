For example, in this March 27 memorandum Lucile undertook to pay any brokerage fees incurred in the transfer of trust securities for distribution. But the memorandum expressly stated that the question of whether trust property should be used to compensate the attorneys who had represented the Bank or Marilyn and Raymond Kiefer was unresolved. No mention was made of compensation for the Bank as trustee. This memorandum expressly anticipated, however, that the Bank would provide further worksheets, before final distribution, showing receipts and disbursements from the trusts since March 1977. Finally, the memorandum, expressly anticipating possible further questions concerning the Bank’s worksheets, required Lucile’s attorney to raise any such questions before the time of distribution.</p>

This officer testified to the general nature of the services performed for the trusts and to the methods used by the Bank to calculate the amount of claimed compensation. His testimony revealed that the Bank had charged fees on prior income distributions or had made periodic charges on income earned but not distributed from these trusts. Thus he explained that the income fee sought in the inter vivos trust was based on income accumulated since the time of a prior charge in January 1974, and that the absence of any income fee for the testamentary trust was because a fee had already been collected at the time of an income distribution in March 1978.

But the trust officer maintained both that these fees were reasonable and that failure to claim them in the earlier accountings or during the prior negotiations should not constitute a waiver. The only other portion of the record which supports appellee’s claim of improper motive are several remarks of the orphans’ court judge that the case was one of “bad blood.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

The court acknowledged that the fees claimed were reasonable. Moreover, the court indicated its belief that existence of animosity between a trustee and a beneficiary should not extinguish the trustee’s right to reasonable compensation. The court ruled, however, that the Bank’s failure to include the fees in the accounting it presented in 1977, in the Settlement Agreement of 1977 or in the memorandum of counsel of March 27,1978 resulted in a waiver of its claim. Exceptions to the decree were taken, but they were dismissed and the decree was made final on May 16, 1979.

Nevertheless, our research reveals no prior case in which the mere failure to express an intention to collect compensation in the future has been sufficient to support a finding of waiver. We believe no such finding is warranted here. Although our review of findings of fact made by the orphans’ court is limited to consideration of whether they are supported by competent and adequate evidence, <em>McCrea Estate, </em><a href="/pa/475/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="475 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1734079" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0383-01">475 Pa. 383</a>, 386-87, <a href="/pa/475/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="475 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1734079" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0383-01">380 A.2d 773</a>, 775 (1977), we are under no such limitation when we must review the legal conclusions an orphans’ court has derived from those facts. Here, clearly, the orphans’ court’s finding of waiver is a conclusion of law, subject to our full review. Given the established presumption that all fiduciaries are entitled to reasonable compensation for their services and given the on-going nature of the negotiations in this case, the evidence does not, in our view, support the conclusion that the Bank has waived its claims.</p>
    <p id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.6",115,[232,1814,1146,564]]]'>The record of the initial orphans’ court hearing in March 1977 makes clear that the accountings which the Bank then agreed to produce for appellee were intended simply to inform her of the current state of trust administration. They were not to be presented to the orphans’ court, and apparently never have been; they were not to be formal, much less final accountings of either trust. Indeed, the record gives no indication that at the time of the 1977 hearing immediate termination of either trust was contemplated. Thus the Bank’s omission of any claim for a termination fee on either trust is hardly remarkable.</p>

      <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>Nor is the omission from these accountings of any claim for income fees evidence that the Bank intended to waive those fees. To the contrary, the record establishes the Bank’s uncontested prior practice of claiming income fees on both trusts and suggests that these claims had been assessed only at the time of income distributions or, at intervals, on accumulated but undistributed income. There is no indication that any income was distributed or was meant to be distributed at the time of these 1977 accountings or that a charge on accumulated income was then due. Failure to include a claim for income fees at that time is hardly surprising, much less is it convincing evidence that the Bank intended to abandon its established practice.</p>
    <p id="b116-5" data-blocks='[["BL_116.5",116,[244,1020,1152,1111]]]'>So too the omission of any compensation claims in either the Settlement Agreement of November 1977 or the memorandum of March 1978 does not support a finding of waiver. Rather, both of these writings were clearly only working agreements in the continuing effort to obtain a negotiated settlement of appellee’s claims. Both of these writings contain provisions plainly indicating that neither party intended either agreement to be an integrated statement of all obligations. For example, as already indicated, every section of the Settlement Agreement expressly provides that the parties “will attempt to resolve” problems of distribution. And, indeed, the variety of issues covered in the March 1978 memorandum but not provided for in the Settlement Agreement demonstrates the incomplete and undetailed nature of the 1977 Agreement. Thus this Agreement makes no mention of which party will pay brokerage fees on securities to be distributed or which party will pay the Bank’s attorneys fees. Yet the 1978 memorandum shows that by that time appellee had agreed to pay the brokerage charges but that the parties had still not resolved the question of counsel fees.</p>

Clearly it came at a time when the parties were still negotiating the complete extent of their obligations.

In these circumstances we do not believe that mere prior silence of the Bank supports the conclusion that it had renounced its established right to reasonable compensation for its services.</p>

Although appellee’s petitions before the orphans’ court alleged that her relatives have controlled the trustee Bank to her detriment and that the Bank had withheld information from her, no evidence to support these claims was produced and the orphans’ court made no findings on these issues.</p>
      <p id="b114-7" data-blocks='[["BL_114.7",114,[276,1779,1116,582]]]'>Neither does appellee now urge that the claimed compensation should be denied because of the Bank’s alleged animosity toward her. And except for the remarks of the orphans’ court, see note 12, supra, nothing in this record demonstrates the existence of any such animosity. It should be noted, of course, that these remarks do not necessarily demonstrate that any animosity between the present litigants is the responsibility of only one party. Indeed these comments may well reflect only the court’s efforts to induce all parties to reach a settlement. Moreover, the orphans’ court did not rely on any finding of animosity. Even assuming a record from which we might properly attribute to this corporate fiduciary the sort of personal hostility alleged, we agree with the orphans’ court that it is far from clear that such ill-will alone, without some further showing, would rise to such a breach of trust as to justify the disallowance of otherwise reasonable compensation.</p>
