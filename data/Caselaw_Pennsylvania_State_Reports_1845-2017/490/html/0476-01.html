This tract was partially subdivided for sale, but the substantial portion of the property had been developed as a golf course.

The parties stipulated to consolidation of the appeals. The executor now disputes the court en banc’s determination that a conflict of interest existed. Alternatively, the executor argues that if such a conflict did exist, it was not detrimental to the estate. For that reason, the executor contends that the decree nisi of the auditing judge should be confirmed and the $60,000 redemption proceeds be distributed to the beneficiaries. Appellants argue that sufficient evidence appears of record to justify the imposition of a surcharge on the executor. According to appellants, the executor’s deductions of state and federal income taxes from the potential sales price of the Nordev property contravened established accounting principles of valuation. Appellants also contend that the executor improperly deducted the decedent’s cost basis when calculating <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>the value of decedent’s Nordev shares. We believe the amount available for distribution here may not be diminished by those deductions prior to distribution to the beneficiaries.

We are therefore of the view that the executor’s miscalculation, by improperly deducting taxes and the cost basis, fell below the standard owed as a fiduciary administering the estate.

In his opinion, the auditing judge properly points out that the “question of valuation of shares of stock in a closely owned corporation is a complex matter.” Here, however, the parties stipulate that the land accurately reflects the Nordev, Inc. share value. This stipulation removes from consideration any difficult questions of the marketability of securities of a closely held business and the related problems of valuation of minority blocks of stock where there are restrictions on transferability.</p>

In a letter addressed to this Court, Mrs. McDonald indicates that she requested an advance of a part of her share of the estate. The executor complied, but exacted a waiver of future claims against the estate in exchange for the early distribution. In her letter Mrs. McDonald now claims the waiver was fraudulently obtained. In the present posture of the case, we do not reach the claim Mrs. McDonald seeks to raise. This, of course, in no way affects her right to seek appropriate relief in the orphans’ court.</p>
