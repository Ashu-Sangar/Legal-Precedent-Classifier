Illustrative of the inability of our trial courts to attract a reasonable number of able candidates, it should be noted that, in 1973 (when salaries for trial judges stood at $40,-000.00), no fewer than 68 candidates vied for 10 Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas Vacancies — in 1977 (with salaries increased to $45,000.00), those seeking election to that bench had dwindled to a mere 13 candidates for 6 vacancies. <em>See also </em>the Chief Justice Michael J.

Assuming this was adequate then, the ravages of inflation have seriously diminished the purchasing power of this salary — thus, even at $45,000 (including the $5,000 raise in 1976), the purchasing power in 1979 was equivalent in “1972 dollars” to $24,099 (based on Consumer Price Index comparisons).</p>

Coupled with the significantly greater pension benefits (federal district court judges make no contributions to their pension fund while Commonwealth trial judges must make contributions which can be as high as 12% of their gross salaries), and the fact that no Social Security deductions are made from federal judges’ salaries, the disparity in compensation is rapidly growing, thus encouraging “recruiting” of federal district court judges from the ranks of our trial courts.</p>

In essence, this salary represents a percentage increase of 37.5% since the 1972 $40,000 annual salary — this percentage increase is substantially less than the percentage increases of the cost of living for the same period, according to the Consumer Price Index. In fact, this represents an increase of less than 5% per annum.
