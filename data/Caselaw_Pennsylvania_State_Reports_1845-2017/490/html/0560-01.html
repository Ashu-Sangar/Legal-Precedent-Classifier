A policewoman arrived, and the fight was broken up with the help of neighbors. Ms. Brown was forcibly removed to her home, screaming. Within minutes Ms. Brown ran from the house brandishing a knife and stabbed Veronica Jackson’s mother, Mrs. Rebecca Jackson, as she sat with friends on a stoop directly across the street from appellant’s home.

Quite to the contrary, the discovery of the cartridges was disclosed to appellant both before and during trial.</p>
    <p id="b597-8" data-blocks='[["BL_597.9",597,[217,1475,1149,905]]]'>Appellant further claims that he was prejudiced when the prosecutor briefly cross-examined his sister, Trudy Brown, regarding her use of drugs on the night of the shooting. A police officer testified that Ms. Brown appeared to have been drinking that night. Moreover, on cross-examination, Ms. Brown admitted that she had been drinking earlier in the evening. Several witnesses also testified that Ms. Brown’s behavior that night had been extremely irrational and violent. During her direct trial testimony, Ms. Brown attempted to corroborate her brother’s version of the shooting, describing in detail how the crowd “attacked” her home. The prosecutor sought to determine if Ms. Brown was inebriated or drugged when she made these observations. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that there was ample evidentiary support for the prosecutor’s questions. <em>See generally </em>McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>at 49, § 22 (Cleary ed. 1972).</p>

During his direct examination, Hayes testified that on the night of the shooting, an unidentified individual pointed a gun at him while he was attempting to mediate the dispute outside the Brown home. The prosecutor cross-examined Hayes with the statement he made immediately after the shooting that he had seen no one with a gun. This use of a prior inconsistent statement was well within the bounds of appropriate cross-examination. <em>Commonwealth v.
