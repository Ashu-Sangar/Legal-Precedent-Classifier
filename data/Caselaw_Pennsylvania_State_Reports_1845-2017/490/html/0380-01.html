Initially it is said counsel was ineffective for failing to “interview” Raymond “Chinee” Johnson and Derek Spells, both of whom had been tried and convicted prior to the Smith trial of participating with Smith in the murder of Jeffers. The record discloses that Smith’s trial counsel had personal knowledge of statements given by Spells. They were inconsistent as to his involvement in the crime. Moreover, the statements implicated Smith in the killing. Trial counsel was also aware of statements given by Johnson to police following his arrest. These statements were inconsistent with what Johnson later said at trial under oath. With this knowledge, counsel concluded it would damage rather than help Smith’s defense to call either Johnson or Spells as a trial witness. Under the circumstances, counsel’s failure to “interview” these co-felons did not constitute ineffectiveness. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

The victim suffered multiple stab wounds to the chest and extremities and a gunshot wound to the chest. Smith, Spells, and Johnson inflicted the stab wounds while Johnson alone inflicted the gunshot wound. The physician who autopsied the body of the victim stated the cause of death was either a stab or gunshot wound to the chest. Smith admitted stabbing the victim; however, he testified at trial that he was coerced at gunpoint by Johnson. Smith attempted to portray Johnson <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>as a professional killer and as some sort of devil worshipper who so intimidated Smith that he was coerced to stab the victim.</p>

The threat occurred more than a year after the killing while Johnson, Smith, and Spells were being transported to the York County Courthouse for arraignment.

To determine the merit of this contention, we must ascertain whether testimony of such a single threat is admissible to support the alleged violent character of Johnson in an effort to show that Johnson was capable of and did, in fact, coerce Smith to stab the victim.</p>

    <p id="b421-5" data-blocks='[["BL_421.5",421,[205,593,1147,798]]]'>Finally, Smith contends trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to certain rebuttal testimony elicited by the Commonwealth. During direct examination, Smith stated he stabbed the victim because he was coerced at gunpoint by Johnson. During cross-examination, Smith recounted some six statements made by him concerning the killing. In five of these statements, including a November 1974 tape-recorded statement given to state police investigators, Smith denied any participation in the murder; however, in the sixth statement, also tape-recorded by state police investigators on December 10, 1974, Smith admitted he stabbed the victim. Smith also testified during cross-examination that he told the state police investigators he was coerced, although this did not occur during any of the six statements referred to here.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Instantly, although Smith’s testimony concerning whether he told the state police investigators that he was coerced to stab the victim is contradictory, the trier of fact, in resolving the conflict in testimony, could reasonably have concluded that Smith affirmatively advised the investigators of Johnson’s alleged coercion. Accordingly, the Commonwealth’s rebuttal testimony, which in fact rebutted Smith’s statements, was properly admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>supra.</p>
