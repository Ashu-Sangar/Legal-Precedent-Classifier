    <p id="b127-7" data-blocks='[["BL_127.7",127,[222,1180,1148,1162]]]'>The threshold question in determining whether the statute in question is a valid exercise of the police power is to decide whether it benefits the public generally. The state clearly has a proper role to perform in protecting the public from inadvertent offensive displays of sexual behavior, in preventing people from being forced against their will to submit to sexual contact, in protecting minors from being sexually used by adults, and in eliminating cruelty to animals. To assure these protections, a broad range of criminal statutes constitute valid police power exercises, including proscriptions of indecent exposure, open lewdness, rape, <em>involuntary </em>deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, statutory rape, corruption of minors, and cruelty to animals. The statute in question serves none of the foregoing purposes and it is nugatory to suggest that it promotes a state interest in the institution of marriage. The Voluntary Deviate Sexual Intercourse Statute has only one possible purpose: to regulate the private conduct of consenting adults. Such a purpose, we believe, exceeds the valid bounds of the police power while infringing the right to equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and of this Commonwealth.</p>

Comment (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955). Many issues that are considered to be matters of morals are subject to debate, and no sufficient state interest justifies legislation of norms simply because a particular belief is followed by a number of people, or even a majority. Indeed, what is considered to be “moral” changes with the times and is dependent upon societal background. Spiritual leadership, not the government, has the responsibility for striving to improve the morality of individuals. Enactment of the Voluntary Deviate Sexual Intercourse Statute, despite the fact that it provides punishment for what many believe to be abhorrent crimes against nature and perceived sins against God, is not properly in the realm of the temporal police power.</p>

      <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>The Commonwealth submits that the classification is justified on the ground that the legislature intended to forbid, generally, voluntary “deviate” sexual intercourse, but created an exception for persons whose exclusion is claimed to further a state interest in promoting the privacy inherent in the marital relationship. We do not find such a justification for the classification to be reasonable or to have a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. Viewing the statute as exceeding the proper bounds of the police power, however, since none of the previously discussed valid legislative interests in regulating sexual conduct are promoted by the statute, the classification itself could not bear a substantial relation to a valid legislative objective. Furthermore, even if the subject of the statute’s regulation were properly within the police power, the marital status of voluntarily participating adults would bear no rational relationship to whether a sexual act should be legal or criminal.

In each case the evil, as perceived by the State, would be identical, and the underinclusion would be invidious.” Similarly, to suggest that deviate acts are heinous if performed by unmarried persons but acceptable when done by married persons lacks even a rational basis, for requiring less moral behavior of married persons than is expected of unmarried persons is without basis in logic. If the statute regulated sexual acts so affecting others that proscription by law would be justified, then they should be proscribed for all people, not just the unmarried.</p>

    <p id="b132-14" data-blocks='[["BL_132.19",132,[291,1916,1147,311]]]'>The majority tries to justify its novel and shocking ruling by suggesting that they are defending the individual from state intervention on questions of morality and personal conscience. Regrettably this theory ignores the facts of the case before the court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_1" id="ref_footnote_5_1">1</a> This is not a case of private, intimate conduct between consenting adults.</p>

      <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>Appellees, Mildred Kannitz, known on the stage as “Dawn Delight” and Shanne Wimbel are “exotic” dancers. Appellees, Patrick Gagliano and Michael Bonadio are employees of the Penthouse Theater in downtown Pittsburgh, in which Ms. Delight and Ms. Wimbel perform. In March of last year, plainclothes police officers went to the Penthouse Theater, paid an admission fee, entered the theater, and viewed the performances of Ms. Delight and Ms. Wimbel. During the course of these performances Ms. Delight and Ms. Wimbel engaged in sexual acts with members of the audience. The police officers arrested the two performers, the patrons who participated in the sexual acts, as well as the theater’s cashier, Bonadio, and the theater’s manager, Gagliano. Ms. Delight and Ms. Wimbel were each charged by information with one count each of voluntary deviate sexual intercourse pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3124. Messrs. Bonadio and Gagliano were charged with one count each of criminal conspiracy.</p>
    <p id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[206,1255,1148,630]]]'>The majority attempts to avoid the privacy issue<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_2" id="ref_footnote_5_2">2</a> by reasoning that there was not a valid exercise of the state’s police power in the prohibition of this type of conduct. The absurdity of such a position does not require demonstration. Here we have a public display of the most depraved type of sexual behavior for pay. Any member of the public who pays the fee can witness and participate in this conduct. That the majority would suggest that this is beyond the state’s power to regulate public health, safety, welfare, and morals is incredible. I assume that regulation of prostitution and hard core pornography are also now prohibited by todays ruling.</p>
    <p id="b133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_133.6",133,[206,1904,1146,205]],["BL_134.1",134,[294,303,1146,638]]]'>Finally, the majority’s conclusion that the statute violates equal protection presents a “red herring.” Concern over the marital exception contained within the voluntary deviate sexual intercourse statute, is misplaced, for the heart of this <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>exception is the intimacy and warmth of a <em>private </em>marital sexual relationship. Here the sexual acts were performed in <em>public </em>and in return for monetary compensation. It is therefore clear that the marital status of the participants in this conduct would not have affected their culpability. To suggest that the marital exception was intended to insulate a marital couple who performed deviate sexual acts for public display for pay would distort the obvious legislative objective in providing for this exception. The marital exception was designed to protect the intimacy and privacy of the marital unit. It did not give married couples the license to publicly engage in lewd and lascivious public acts.</p>

The assertion of a privacy right, however, is completely out of place in light of the present factual predicate. Arguments regarding <em>private </em>sexual conduct are totally irrelevant in the instant appeal, where the sexual activity involved was <em>public.</em>
