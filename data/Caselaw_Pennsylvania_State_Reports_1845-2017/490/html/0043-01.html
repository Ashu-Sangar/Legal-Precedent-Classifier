A hearing was held on the petition on March 10, 1978. On October 10, 1978, the court entered a decree nisi, and filed an opinion in support thereof, granting the petition. Exceptions were filed and argued. On May 31, 1979, the Orphans’ Court entered a final decree and filed an opinion dismissing appellant’s exceptions and terminating her parental rights.
