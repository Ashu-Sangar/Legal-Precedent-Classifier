Eyewitnesses observed the appellant, lying in wait for the blind man to descend a flight of stairs, step from a hiding place and deliver twelve forceful blows with a metal pipe to the face, skull, and neck of the man. During this beating, the blind man, who carried a knife for protection, inflicted a number of minor cuts upon appellant. The blind man, believing a robbery to be in progress in the first floor apartment where he resided, had descended the steps. Appellant initiated the attack, and, while continuing to strike the blind man, said “the MF ain’t dead yet, but he going to die now.”</p>

Since these cases were handed down, trial judges have lacked a standard approved by a majority of the full Court defining the circumstances under which a defendant’s request for an involuntary manslaughter charge should be granted. To clarify this situation, we now hold that in a murder prosecution, an involuntary manslaughter charge shall be given only when requested, and where the offense has been made an issue in the case and trial evidence reasonably would support such a verdict. The rule is firmly grounded in logic and policy, for to instruct a jury on possible verdicts that are unsupported by any evidence can serve only to pervert justice: Not only <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>may the jury be confused by what appear to be irrelevant instructions, and thereby possibly reach a mistaken verdict, but a conviction for the lesser offense may occur out of discriminatory favor for the defendant or out of animosity for the victim, or the jury might substitute its own visceral reaction for the classification established by the legislature.

Nor can the involuntary manslaughter charge be justified as giving a jury discretion to dispense mercy, since it is in the realm of arbitrariness to convict one of the misdemeanor of involuntary manslaughter when all evidence rationally indicates felonious homicide. Our review of the record indicates no basis upon which appellant could rationally have been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and, hence, he was not entitled to a charge thereon.</p>

Thus I remain convinced that “[t]he state of mind which suffices to establish the commission of involuntary manslaughter constitutes a lesser kind of culpability than the malice which is an essential element to murder.” <a href="/pa/474/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="474 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="1732125" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0449-01">Id.,</a> 474 Pa. at 464, 378 A.2d at 1207. So too, I adhere to the view that <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>Id., 474 Pa. at 465, 378 A.2d at 1207-1208. Accordingly, as in <em>Garcia, </em>I would hold that under the Crimes Code “in every murder prosecution a defendant is entitled, upon request, to a jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter.” Id., 474 Pa. at 469, 378 A.2d at 1210. Because the trial court failed to grant appellant’s timely request for an involuntary manslaughter instruction, this Court should reverse judgment of sentence on the murder conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>

C.S.] § 2504, also may be committed when a killing is committed intentionally or knowingly. Under the Crimes Code the categories of murder and voluntary manslaughter on the one hand, and involuntary manslaughter on the other, are not mutually exclusive categories. Because an intentional or knowing killing also establishes a negligent killing, all criminal homicides necessarily include involun-. tary manslaughter as a constituent offense.”</blockquote>
