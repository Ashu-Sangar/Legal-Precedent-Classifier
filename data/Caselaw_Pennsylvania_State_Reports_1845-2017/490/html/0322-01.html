    <p id="b356-7" data-blocks='[["BL_356.8",356,[280,770,1145,304]]]'>Appellant, William Lloyd Webster, Jr., a/k/a William Webster Bey, was convicted of murder of the third degree for the shooting death of Wendell Byrd. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to a prison term of not less than nine nor more than eighteen years. This direct appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b356-8" data-blocks='[["BL_356.9",356,[277,1092,1147,615]]]'>The facts are as follows. On November 2,1978, the victim drove past appellant and shouted that he wished to speak to him. Appellant’s companion at the time testified at trial that the victim did not sound angry; rather she characterized his manner as friendly. The victim parked his automobile and appellant escorted him out of the vehicle. The two men proceeded to a nearby alley (one eyewitness testified that appellant pulled the victim along by the arm) where an argument ensued. Testimony at trial indicated that the victim appeared to be pleading as appellant pointed a gun at the victim’s face. One shot was fired; the victim slumped to the ground and appellant fled the scene.</p>
    <p id="b356-9" data-blocks='[["BL_356.10",356,[273,1725,1148,612]]]'>Appellant, now represented by counsel other than his trial counsel, first claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to properly preserve the most meritorious issue in his case — that he acted in self-defense. Appellant took the stand in his own defense at trial, testifying that Wendell Byrd pointed a gun at him, and in the ensuing struggle the gun discharged. Trial counsel submitted points for charge, the second of which simply stated “self-defense.” The trial judge denied the request and appellant’s prior counsel never took exception to the charge or the denial of the point for charge. The issue was not raised in appellant’s post-verdict motions.</p>

      <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>There is no burden on the defendant to prove a claim of self-defense. However, before such a defense is properly in issue at trial, there must be some evidence to justify such a finding. Our review of the record in the instant matter convinces us that the requisite elements of self-defense have not been presented. Specifically, the evidence fails to establish that appellant was free from fault in provoking or continuing the difficulty which resulted in the shooting. One eyewitness testified that appellant escorted the victim out of his automobile. Another claimed that appellant pulled the victim down the street by tugging on his arm. This testimony does not suggest appellant was free from fault in provoking the altercation; rather, it tends to establish appellant as the aggressor.</p>
    <p id="b358-4" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[288,1083,1149,686]]]'>The Commonwealth’s witnesses testified that appellant pointed the gun at the victim. Only appellant claimed the victim pointed the gun at him. He testified that as he struggled to wrestle the pistol free, it discharged. At best appellant’s explanation suggests that the killing may have been accidental. However, it also destroys the second element of self-defense; that appellant reasonably believed that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm. When appellant was specifically asked upon cross-examination if he had been acting in self-defense, appellant conceded that he had not. At no time was there any testimony that appellant intentionally fired the gun in an attempt to defend himself.</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.6",358,[287,1788,1147,204]]]'>The jury was presented with the possible explanation of accidental death; the judge’s charge adequately explained that a finding of not guilty of any degree of homicide was required if the jury chose to believe appellant’s story.</p>

    <p id="b359-4" data-blocks='[["BL_359.6",359,[239,704,1148,535]]]'>Appellant’s second contention is that the evidence at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support a conviction of murder of the third degree. As we have repeatedly stated the test in determining if the evidence is sufficient to sustain a criminal conviction is, whether accepting as true all of the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences therefrom upon which the jury could properly have based its verdict, such evidence and inferences are sufficient in law to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.

Counsel for appellant seeks to discredit the witnesses’ testimony because one witness claimed to be thirty to forty yards away from appellant and the deceased, and the other estimated that the distance equaled fifteen to twenty feet. There is nothing in the record that compels the conclusion that the two witnesses were standing next to each other as they observed the shooting; the record also discloses that the witnesses’ designations of the distances were mere estimations.</p>

Another witness, appellant’s companion on the day in question, who also knew the deceased, identified appellant as the man who escorted the victim out of his automobile and walked with him in the direction of the alley.
