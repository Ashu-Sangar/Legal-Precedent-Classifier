In his first three contentions appellant asserts that the court below erred in not suppressing the physical evidence obtained from his home because: 1) there was no probable cause for the search since the affidavit “does not contain sufficient information to justify the conclusion that evidence or the fruits of a crime may be found at the place to be searched”, 2) the search was invalidated by the police’s unannounced entry into the house, and 3) the search was invalid because the warrant erroneously describes the place to be searched and its owners, and was issued to and executed by law enforcement officials acting outside of their jurisdiction. Next, appellant alleges that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. And, finally, appellant contends that the court erred in admitting into evidence currency found in appellant’s dresser which was identified as having been used to purchase drugs from another the day before appellant’s arrest.</p>

On January 5, 1977, the same agent purchased three pounds of marijuana from Anzalone and immediately arrested him. Police then arrested Anzalone’s supposed suppliers, the Andersons, and subsequently secured a search warrant for the Anderson's home based on the affidavit set out below.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The warrant <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>mentions drugs, drug paraphernalia, and marked money.

    <p id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[195,428,1149,683]]]'>When we look to the four corners of the affidavit in this case, we nowhere find a reference to any sales of drugs except a sale on January 5, 1977, at which time no money changed hands. The sale on January 4, at which marked money was used, is not mentioned. While the affidavit may establish probable cause to believe that Anderson was involved in drug trafficking, it establishes no probable cause to believe that Anderson was in the possession of any marked money. Absent a reference to marked money in the affidavit, there is no probable cause to believe that a crime involving marked money has occurred, and therefore, there is no probable cause to issue a search warrant authorizing the seizure of the marked money.</p>

If the police knew that Anzalone had received marked money from a police officer and that Anderson was Anzalone’s supplier of narcotics, and if they believed that Anderson might have possession of this marked money (as they apparently did, since they included marked money in the search warrant), they were required to mention the sale involving marked money in the affidavit if they intended to seize the marked money.</p>
    <p id="b473-7" data-blocks='[["BL_473.7",473,[197,1673,1149,472]]]'>Furthermore, I disagree with the view that if the money had not been mentioned at all in the search warrant, it could have been seized under the plain view doctrine. Once it is established that the warrant was illegal as to marked money, that is the same as saying that the seizure of the money was warrantless. And if the seizure was warrantless, <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire </em>requires that the marked money would not be seizable under the plain view doctrine because when police conduct warrantless searches:</p>

      <em>Coolidge </em>prohibits the warrantless seizure — and that is what this case involves — of objects “not contraband, nor stolen nor dangerous in themselves” which the police know they will find “in plain view.” The marked money in this case: (1) was known of by the police in advance of arriving at the Anderson house; (2) was known to be in the Anderson house (since it was mentioned in the search warrant); (3) was neither contraband, nor stolen nor dangerous in itself; (4) was improperly included on the face of the search warrant since no basis for inclusion was provided by the affidavit. <em>Coolidge, </em>therefore, prohibits seizure of this money.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

Anzalone told Agent Frankenburg that he could get 3 to 5 pounds of marijuana from his connection and also told the agent that his man was sitting on approx. 50 to 100 pounds of Columbian pot. Anzalone told the agent to return in about an hour. Anzalone then left his home in his vehicle and proceeded to 2046 Moravia Street. Anzalone knocked on the back door of this home but no one answered the door. Anzalone then returned home and within an hour of their meeting agent Frankenburg, returned to Anzalone’s home and was told by Anzalone that his connection was not at home. Anzalone was under surveillance by the affiant during his trip to and from Anderson’s home. At this time Anzalone told the agent that he would contact his man at 0900 hours on 01-05-77 and that the agent could return any time after 0930 hours on that date to pick up 3 to 5 pounds. At 0855 hours on 01-05-77 Anzalone was observed leaving his home and proceeding directly to Anderson’s home at 2046 Moravia Street. Anzalone was observed entering the rear door with nothing in his possession at 0902 hours. At 0909 hours Anzalone exited the back door and appeared to be carrying some type of gym bag. Anzalone then proceeded home in his vehicle and did not stop until he arrived at 1015 Westview Terrace Apt. A at approx. 0917 hours Anzalone carried the same package into his home through the rear door. Anzalone was under surveillance during this time period by Officer R. Smith. At approx. 1050 hours this date Agent Frankenburg entered Anzalone’s home through the front door and approx. 5 minutes later he exited the home with Anzalone and black male. Agent went to his own vehicle and then told all surveillance vehicles over the radio that he was going to Anderson’s house with the subject to make the 3 pound buy. All three men (Anzalone, black male and agent) then entered Anzalone’s vehicle and proceeded directly to 2046 Moravia Street the home of Ken Anderson. While proceeding to Anderson’s home Anzalone told the agent that if the agent had the money, Anzalone stated that he would be able to get the agent between 25 and 50 pounds of marijuana. Anzalone also stated that he could get a 50 pound bale of marijuana right now if the agent had the money. Anzalone also stated that he could the agent a pound of coke or half pound of smack right now or any time that the agent had the money. Anzalone also stated that the price of the 50 pound bale would be $325.00 per pound and then told the agent that he could break the bale up <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>himself.

At approx. 1115 hours on 01-05-77 Anzalone left his vehicle in the driveway of 2046 Moravia Street and then entered the Anderson home through the rear door.

The agent was then asked by Anzalone for the money and at this time the agent showed Anzalone the money and placed Anzalone and the black male under arrest. Anderson has been under investigation by the New Castle Police Department Narcotics Unit for the past 3 years and Lt. Abraham a former member of the Narcotic Bureau has told the affiant that during the time he served with the Narcotics Bureau he received information numerous times in the past from confidential and reliable informants that Anderson was a major drug dealer.
