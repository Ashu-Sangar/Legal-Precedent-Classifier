Primarily at issue on this appeal is whether landlords’ breach of the lease’s “non-competition” clause provides tenant a defense to the landlord’s actions for sums due and in ejectment. We are persuaded by our established caselaw, e. g., <em>McDanel v.

The parties’ most recent written lease agreement, executed in June of 1973, provides for a five-year term of occupancy beginning August 1, 1973 and ending July 31, 1978.

Tenant is to render an annual “certified statement” showing the total gross proceeds of all business done upon the premises during the preceding year. Tenant also agrees, “on every default of payment of rent,” or “on any and every breach of covenant or agreement,” to “empower any attorney of any court of record” to appear for tenant and confess judgment <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>against him.

Landlords based their request for both judgments on averments that tenant owed them monthly base payments, maintenance charges and utilities, and increased taxes. Landlords additionally claimed that tenant failed to provide landlords with a timely certified statement of gross proceeds and failed to pay the percentage of proceeds owing. Acting pursuant to the warrant of attorney contained in the lease agreement, counsel appeared for tenant and confessed judgment in landlords’ favor in the amount of $7,056.29. <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Counsel also confessed judgment of possession.

It is true that “[a]t old common law the promises made by a landlord in a lease were independent obligations, so that the failure of the landlord to perform them did not give the tenant any right to disregard his obligations under the lease.” Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant, supra, Introductory Note to Chapter 7. See generally I Friedman on Leases § 1.1 (1974). It is now clear, however, that this view of landlord-tenant relations, incorrectly resting more on notions of property law than on principles of contracts, has no place in modern jurisprudence. As long ago as 1934 this Court in <em>McDanel v. Mack Realty Co., </em>supra, recognized the error of the independence-of-obligations approach as applied to a commercial lease transaction. At issue in <em>McDanel </em>was the scope of the commercial tenant’s remedies where the commercial landlord defaulted on its covenant to heat the leased premises. In addition to the options of (1) performing “at his own expense” and deducting this cost from the rent due or (2) surrendering the premises “to relieve himself from any further payment of rent,” the tenant</p>

It is obvious that a landlord’s non-competition promise is critical to a commercial lease agreement like the one here. “The mere presence in a lease of a noncom-petition promise by the landlord justifies the conclusion that it is essential that the promise be observed if the tenant is to conduct his business on the leased property profitably.” Id. at § 7.2 Comment b, p. 254.
