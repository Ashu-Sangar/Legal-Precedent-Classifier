At that time, appellant was separated from her husband and was living “off and on” with M.W., the putative father of D.K.W. When <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>D.K.W. was three months old, a Youth Services caseworker was called to investigate a child abuse complaint which alleged that M.W. had beaten and slapped the child, causing bruises to her legs and bottom, and that he had held her nose while feeding her. The complaint further alleged that appellant had physically abused the child. Confronted with these allegations, both appellant and M.W. admitted that they were true. M.W. also admitted beating appellant on numerous occasions, and the caseworker testified that appellant was “covered from head to toe with bruises” on the day she visited appellant’s home to investigate the child abuse complaint.</p>

This arrangement proved unsatisfactory however. Just four days after taking the child, appellant’s sister contacted Youth Services and advised them that M.W. had made repeated threats on her life as well as the child’s, that she feared for both her and D.K.W.’s safety, and that she no longer could care for the child. At that time, appellant informed Youth Services that because of the ongoing problems with M.W., her nerves were bad and she was unable to care for D.K.W. Appellant also expressed the fear that M.W. would abuse the child and that she, too, might have a tendency to do so. Thus, on January 21, 1977, appellant joined with Youth Services in requesting foster care for D.K.W. The child initially was placed with a maternal aunt, and in July 1977, D.K.W. was placed in the home of the foster parents with whom she currently resides.</p>

He also has broken into her home on several occasions and has waited for her many times while she was out. Thus, despite her recognition of and asserted attempts to remedy the problem, she has not succeeded.

The guidelines included various types of counselling as <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>well as the requirement that appellant keep a record of her visits with D.K.W. Appellant never completed the required counselling and has been remiss in recording her visits. Moreover, although she has been afforded liberal visiting privileges, she has declined to take full advantage of them. On several occasions she missed visits altogether, and during some of the visits which took place at the foster home, appellant watched television rather than attend to the child. Further, on some occasions when she had D.K.W. for day visits, appellant returned the child tired and dirty.</p>

The child still requires regular therapy sessions several times a week at home and at the hospital. D.K.W.’s foster mother has received training and administers the home therapy. In contrast, although the special training was made available to appellant through several social agencies, she has failed to learn how to attend to D.K.W.’s special needs.</p>

    <p id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[261,1092,1151,1191]]]'>Appellant raises two additional allegations of error: First, she charges that the lower court erred in failing to make a specific finding that D.K.W. was “dependent’ within the meaning of the Juvenile Act, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, § 2, <em>as amended, </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6301 <em>et seq. </em>(Pamph.1979). If a child is adjudicated <em>“dependent,” </em>a court may take the child from the parent and grant temporary legal custody to an appropriate agency or individual. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6351. Appellant argues that the court required to make a specific finding of dependency before it could order continued placement of D.K.W. in foster care. However, once the court terminated appellant’s parental rights under the Adoption Act, the issue of custody under the Juvenile Act became moot and it was unnecessary to make a finding that D.K.W. was “dependent.” Secondly, appellant contends that the lower court erroneously applied the “best interest of the child” standard in terminating appellant’s parental rights. This claim is without merit since the opinion of the court below clearly reflects that its decision was grounded upon the criteria set forth in § 311(2) of the Adoption Act. <em>See Adoption of Baby Girl M., </em><a href="/pa/481/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="481 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1747304" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0171-01">481 Pa. 171</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="481 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1747304" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0171-01">392 A.2d 301</a> (1978).</p>

The instant case differs significantly from <em>In Re Adoption of Melissa P., </em><a href="/pa/475/0197-02" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="475 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1734072,1734115" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0197-02,/pa/475/0197-01">475 Pa. 197</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0197-02" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="380 A.2d 311" data-case-ids="1734072" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0197-02">380 A.2d 311</a> (1977) (plurality opinion), where the minor child was the victim of physical abuse by her stepfather. We recognized that it is “necessary to show that the causes of the . abuse . cannot or will not be remedied by the parent” in order to terminate under § 311(2). We further acknowledged that “regardless of a parent’s past transgressions, a court should not terminate parental rights if the parent stands ready and able to assume the responsibility of rearing his or her child [citation omitted].” In commenting upon the inapplicability of § 311(2) we noted that appellant (the natural mother) sought to cure the source of the abuse by encouraging her husband to enter counselling, and later “saw fit to <em>remove </em>the source of the abuse by living apart from her husband.” <a href="/pa/475/0197-02" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="475 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1734072,1734115" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0197-02,/pa/475/0197-01">475 Pa. at 200</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0197-02" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="380 A.2d 311" data-case-ids="1734072" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0197-02">380 A.2d at 312</a>. Moreover, unlike the instant case “[t]he record [was] barren of evidence to contradict her assertions that she [stood] ready and able to assume the responsibility of raising [the child.]” <em><a href="/pa/475/0197-02" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="380 A.2d 311" data-case-ids="1734072" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0197-02">Id.</a> </em>Here, despite appellant’s apparent desire to regain custody of D.K.W., she failed to convince the lower court that the source of the abuse had been eliminated and that she was capable of providing the child with essential parental care.</p>
